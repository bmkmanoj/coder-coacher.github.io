insurance claims management process
accelerator my name is Rosie pillar and
in this video I'll show you what it's
like to use the ICM process accelerator
to manage insurance claims before we
begin let's take a quick look at the
scenario that we'll be using in this
video a property casualty insurance
company sells insurance policies when a
customer has a loss for example their
house catches fire
they are robbed or their cars in an
accident the customer files a claim with
the insurance company the insurance
company then needs to process the claim
typically going through several phases
first notice of loss evaluation
appraisal and settlement at any point in
time caseworkers may have to review
documents make phone calls check the
agency's protocols send emails talk with
several people and even create brand-new
tasks that cannot be predicted ahead of
time in other words it's hard to predict
exactly what will be needed to
investigate and resolve the issues and
by nature the process is ad hoc Oracle
BPM adaptive case management supports
this kind of unstructured process giving
caseworkers the tools they need without
constraining them with a predefined
process flow and as you'll soon see the
ICM process accelerator which uses an
adaptive case management framework comes
pre-built
with insurance industry specific
functionality and at the same time is
customizable and extensible for our demo
we picked a property and casualty claim
scenario specifically a car accident
because it is a scenario that most
people understand before I show you the
demonstration let me introduce you to
the players in our scenario
Peter snow has an auto insurance policy
with a B
see insurance company he's in an
accident and contacts the call center to
file a claim see Doyle is a customer
service rep and he's the one who creates
the initial claim and also dispatches
towing services to the lost site W shake
is the case manager he is the overall
owner of the claim as spike is the field
adjuster she's the one who will be
examining the vehicle to assess the
damage and estimate repair costs with
that background we're ready to get
started let's see how the members of the
ABC insurance company use the ICM
process accelerator to manage peter
snow's claim as you watch the demo
notice how the interface does not
prescribe tasks and task order yet
provides the tools and flexibility
knowledge workers need to be maximally
efficient thus increasing customer
satisfaction let's assume Peter snow a
customer has an accident
he calls ABC insurance to report the
accident let's watch as seedoil
a customer service representative files
a new claim on his behalf see Doyle
locks in to business process workspace
he clicks links and then clicks manage
insurance claims to create a claim he
clicks create first notice of loss
on this screen he enters the relevant
information
then he clicks the lost details tab note
that the fields that are displayed
depend on the lost type that was
selected earlier customers can define
their own lost types and configure
fields in the lost details section
seedoil
then clicks the involved parties tab on
this tab he can add all the parties that
are involved in the claim
Peter snow has already been added as the
claimant notice that seedoil can add a
new involved party for example a witness
when he has finished he clicks submit a
new case is created for this claim when
seedoil clicks okay
he has taken directly to the case user
interface for the new claim case
the first thing the customer service rep
wants to do is verify that the claimant
has a valid policy to do that he clicks
the verify coverage case activity in the
activities panel in the verify coverage
case activity UI the customer service
rep can click view policy to view the
claimants insurance policy after viewing
the policy he clicks the coverage
verified checkbox then click Submit now
the customer service rep dispatches a
towing service requested by Peter snow
to the accident site after confirming
Peter snow has towing coverage on his
policy he clicks the dispatch service
case activity in the activities panel
this brings up a map showing the
location of the accident also it shows
the closest service providers in the
vicinity he selects ABC towing services
from the available service providers
section and clicks a sign before
submitting let's assume he wants to
change the default email message that
will be sent to the service provider he
clicks edit suggests that they contact
Peter on his mobile phone and clicks ok
then he clicks Submit to complete this
activity with the policy verified and
the tow truck on its way the customer
service rep will now hand off the claim
to a case manager that will handle the
claim he starts by clicking the assign
case manager case activity in the
activities panel he searches for and
selects a case manager
notice that the status of the case
changes to evaluation and the primary
owner has changed as well let's log in
as the assigned case manager to do a
more detailed review of the terms and
conditions of the policy and further
validate the claim he selects the claim
and clicks the claim number in the task
details this brings up the case managers
view of the case user interface he
clicks the validate claim case activity
in the activities panel he can click
view policy to view the insurance policy
of Peter snow let's assume he has done
that he clicks the claim validated
checkbox and then click Submit in a
scenario like claims management new
information can become available at any
point in time the case manager will next
update the claim based on new
information received and after
interviewing Peter snow he clicks update
FN o L in the activities panel in the
case activity UI he changes some lost
details information regarding the police
report that was filed
let's assume that case manager wants to
upload some documents that he has
received from the claimant Peter snow
and from other sources he clicks the
documents link of the case and uploads a
photograph of the accident
the uploaded document is now attached to
the case next the case manager assigns a
field adjuster to examine the damage to
Peter snows vehicle he clicks the assign
field adjuster case activity searches
for and selects a field adjuster
enters comments and click Submit notice
that the status of the claim changes to
appraisal and the selected field
adjuster becomes the primary owner of
the case next let's watch what happens
when the field adjuster logs into
business process workspace brings up the
case UI and reports on her examination
of the vehicle for damage
she clicks the examined damage case
activity in the activities panel and
fills in details of her examination
when she has finished she clicks submit
she then has to estimate the cost of
repairing the vehicle she clicks create
cost estimates she completes the form
then uploads a detailed appraisal report
she indicates that the appraisal is
complete and clicks submit the field
adjuster is now ready to submit the
appraisal back to the case manager she
clicks submit appraisal enter some
comments and click Submit notice that
the status of the claim changes to
settlement and the primary owner has
been changed back to the case manager
the case manager now creates a
settlement offer for the claim he logs
back in a new task evaluate appraised
claim has been created by the insurance
claims management system and assigned to
him he clicks on the task in the task
detail he clicks on the claim number the
case manager takes a quick look at the
appraisal summary then he clicks create
settlement offer he uploads a settlement
offer
selects the send to claimant checkbox to
generate a notification for the customer
and click Submit let's assume the case
manager wants to send an email to the
claimant he clicks email activity
composes an email to Peter snow
and sends it let's assume Peter snow has
received the settlement offer and has
accepted the terms the case manager now
records his acceptance the case manager
now initiates the payment that is part
of the settlement
as all payments are complete the case
manager can now close the claim
once this is done the status of the case
is changed to closed the insurance
claims management process accelerator
also includes pre-built dashboards so
you can monitor claim activity the ICM
operational dashboard gives you
real-time insight into the resolution of
claims this dashboard helps you answer
questions such as what claim processing
activities happen to date how many
claims are in the pipeline how fast are
claims moving what is the workload of
the case participants you can also
receive alerts for example when a claim
has been open for more than a certain
number of days without a decision for
example 30 days or when a claim has a
fraud likelihood value greater than a
specified number for example 90% the
performance dashboard shows claim
processing performance for a line of
business in a given period of time it
answers questions such as are the claim
resolution times improving how do new
claims compared to closed claims in a
time period what were the total claim
payments made in a given period what is
the percentage of fraudulent claims in a
given period my colleagues and I hope
