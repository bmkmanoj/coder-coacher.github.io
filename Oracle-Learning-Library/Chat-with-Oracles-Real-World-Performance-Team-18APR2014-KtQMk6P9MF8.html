the second webcast associated with
bullets and you'll probably live in
Europe you're probably obligation and
you're listening to a recording of this
and you're in Asia Pacific region you're
probably asleep at this point in time
and again listening to a recording so
most of people in line of probably in
North America and as I say it's not
going to really make too much difference
it's just it means that the interactive
part of this will be a we're only
getting a third of the audience today
but that's like so what I'd like to do
is introduce the fact that we've had
some more videos being launched have
been launched over the last few days and
and talk about some things that are
going on in real world performance and
you know just to open it up if that
people haven't met me before or haven't
sort of come across my team and you know
vice presidents the real world
performance team here at Oracle and you
know I have very very simple way of
looking at performance um you know and
explaining it and simply we make it it
usually means that we get the right
answers and we also get better
performance and at times it seems that
people over complicate the whole
situation and making different difficult
for each other so you know from what
I've found ever experienced that good
performance on today's systems is rarely
an accident well then fluke excellent
performance it's usually engineered and
thought about up front it's very rarely
retrofitted into the system it actually
does need to get portable get thought
about and designed and engineered in and
which gets me on to the next phase that
I can tend to see is that most companies
and people tend to get the systems they
deserve and I think a lot of us
understand what I mean when I say this
and this was taught to me by one of my
mentors early in my career when I was
getting extremely frustrated and when
people were making poor decisions at
every decision point and basically to
try and make their life easier
but as a result the system performance
was getting more and more graphic more
poor and you know it is a reality of the
situation is people get what they
deserve in the end and if they've got
port system performance and the usual
reaction is to either blame people and
it will think like that but if you
actually look historically you can see
there's been some major wise in the road
what wrong decisions and things went
wrong and the last thing is something
that is the mantra for my team we were
welcomed with this that we really hate
hearing this expression that I get far
too often that look the performance is
good you know and really in many cases
is performance set by business metrics
and we call it sometimes business
performance by MBA and rather than
actually figuring out what the
performance of the system is capable of
what the hardware and software is
capable so we always described for
excellence getting the best out of the
resources rather than just meeting the
business requirements because we know
and I think everybody on this cool know
that business requirements can change in
a drop of a hat so suddenly good enough
today is awful tomorrow and so we should
always be spiring for the best aspiring
for excellence and and it's usually when
a new hire joins my group and they come
and tell me out we think performance is
good enough it usually means that
they've got a frown on my face and
they're going back to work that evening
or we can get it to excellence because
you know just meeting the requirements
to me is not a design of good
performance getting the performance tour
that we're fully utilized and optimizing
the hardware and software is what good
performance is about to me and there is
a subtle difference and I'm still having
to take this every day in every
management meeting up there to visit so
that's like
anyway let's talk about real world
performance really you know everything
falls onto these three categories as far
as I can see is incorrect your use of
the tools and the products this comes
from you know something that we learn
intuitively and you know trying to put
users you know a hammer as a screwdriver
and in many cases but in Indian database
space it's very often database
incorrectly installed and working
patched which is the first thing correct
use of the product and then just try to
use functional in a manual designed to
be used the second big issue that we're
really seeing is the big little data
design challenge they've got little data
algorithms quite willing at the bottle
of state itself and we'll show you in
some of the videos why this can actually
be a pathological situation and then the
first one is the last thing is we see
here is a is a human nature issue and
everyone wants to be the hero everyone
wants to provide the quick fix the
solution how many times people suggest
two things with adamant and problem is
and this just waste time sound they
sound fantastic in a meeting when it
won't in a war room and stressed but
unless you understand the problem the
chances of you getting the right
solution so I even minimized so you know
those leader the fundamental mistakes
button being made daily in the space of
performance and and in fact what an
agent lead come to me tell me about
projects I usually drop and the history
of the project into one of those three
categories or some points on problem and
it happens literally every week every
day so what we're going to talk today
about is the new videos that were put on
line which is all about leaking and set
based programming and then we'll just
talk about what makes a great reward
send you more so let's talk about
leaking and leaking and has been done by
programmers or as long as programming
has been going on and people have
allocated resources and then floors and
their programs we've got
give them back I'm talking sure that
most of the people online being C
programmers once in their life limit
life and they've made a mallet call and
make big lots of red and then they
re-entered the same piece of code and
they allocate more memory and it's not
going to get back as a result the
program got bigger and bigger and
eventually right memory but if we forget
about memory for a little while what
about programs that take out database
resources and I've listed out things
like person sessions rocks eq slaves and
100 we had a program that with
allocating or losing and forgetting to
give them back especially when some of
these resources are finite and you can't
get them back and we're not an infinite
supply of them although in many cases
what we see is people are doing things
to basically eval you all the work will
shown in the previous video who spoke
about in previous sessions in terms of
getting curses and sessions to be fixed
and finite and under control and they're
basically soon as they're rolling
something out in production because they
have a bug in their application that
leaks resources and they have to set
these things like processes and open
cursors massive button just to make the
application run for a period of time
until such time it actually just blows
up and with that in mind and you know
this is what the videos is about and
it's really why a real world performance
engineer when he sees the application
same with processes set to thousands and
open as a simple and won't immediately
suggests reducing me valued because he
or she knows that they need to be a
little bit cautious because if the
application hasn't been checked leakage
it'll probably there changes will result
in the application grinding to a halt in
about 30 seconds will show that in the
videos and so you know whilst it's very
not good of us would explain the
computer science of why it's important
to have a finite connection pounds and
management works effectively we need to
understand why people have over
allocated and it's usually programming
boats problem is that these aren't
tested for in
you a process and we'll talk about that
in the video as well and you know
probably the majority of the times that
we've seen unstable environments with
over connections is a result of
programmer bugs and so it's a two-fold
thing the system architect needs to
architect great Google connections but
we also need to instruct our programmers
as to the bugs that they will create and
teach them how to test for them having
done that we're in a situation where we
may be able to implement the blueprint
designs for a scalable predictable and
connection strategy and online system so
that's kind of interesting and the next
most interesting thing is we're going to
talk about set based programming and the
videos here are really dealing with the
issues that we're seeing to be
associated with programs that have been
written some object oriented programs
will row by row processing some of my
colleagues call it slow by slow and they
end up signing eventually having to run
row by row or object object down a huge
list in batch and this batch process
never finishes within acceptable time
frames and as a result people are
complaining that the database either the
scale doesn't perform all the batch
windows are becoming a really problem
and again it comes down to the wrong
programming paradigm an object my object
will row bio row technique being used
when we fit should be addressing the
sets of data and having recoded
techniques to be a set based technique
we often see you know up to a
thousandfold speed up and when things
get a thousand times button will peyton
home from work hours to the second the
challenge this is is that set based
programming is not done very often it's
not understood by programmers it's
harder it's more intellectual harder but
there's plenty of tools within sequel to
enable you to do set-based techniques
however many cases the program's never
got that far in the manual we've got to
learn it because they're learning sequel
on the job
they're delivering functional code
they're not delivering fast functional
code and in many hard times these things
get worse and worse by religious issues
who determine all that application logic
must be executed on an application
server so they bring one row over the
network one of time and then suddenly
find themselves having to go down the
list of millions of objects and and
really it gets back to what we looked in
school boy max you have a each execution
takes a short period of time but you'll
multiply the number iterations you have
to run is a very big number you still
end up with a very big number and so we
use these numbers here just to give you
an idea of how long it would take to run
a batch job serial if each row process
took a millisecond which could be say a
call an invocation over the network
round-robin so you can see that it's a
millisecond we can do a thousand in a
second we can see very quickly by
scaling from the million a billion and
eventually trillion objects so we can be
leading to 14 years and this is quite
terrifying multiply because we're now
actually seeing companies generating in
the order of trillions of rows a day you
know web-based traffic and clicks and
billions of rows is not unheard of a
tool and so you know daily events and
processing down billions of rows and we
need the only way we're going to get
some of the batch jobs and data
correction and verification and
validation process one we will have to
use asset base plate and set this
programming using core database
parallelism allow you to exploit the
hardware such that you can actually get
the thing Finch and so a lot of people
this all mean complete rewrites of code
but what we've done in the videos is
race existing planned against interim
solutions and ultimate solutions and we
advise to have a look at the video and
look at the code and start seeing have I
got constructs like that in my
application
and then the last thing we really want
to talk about is what would make a
really good real world performance
engineer and this last couple of weeks
we had a couple of petco open with my
team and so we've been using sort of
social media techniques to see people
would like to become real world
performance engineers and we've done a
lot of internal thinking within my team
you know what really makes a world-class
real or performance engineer and
reviewing all of the resumes that have
been sent to us we recognize that
there's this perception of what people
think makes a really good performance
engineer and what we think makes a
really good real world performance and
roll very different and what we have
seen is a lot of resumes of people who
are what we would call platform tuna and
they like twiddling within it the aura
Graham they like playing with operating
system parameters and stuff like that
and but they really haven't learnt to
understand the problem and they're what
they're doing is they're just fixing
soup bones of things that were wrong in
the database they haven't taken a
top-down holistic whole system they're
just basically twiddling within their
own space and and this really is most
frustrating because the actual
performance gains from doing this is so
small and with the advent of the more
engineered systems or balanced systems
that the symphony I work today there
really isn't very much twiddling to be
done and if there are twiddling it we
run it mean tuning by quite a number of
active in the system my engineers will
be on whether you have to undo the added
value that so-called platform tuners
have done and in terms of damage to the
system or have restricted core database
functionality that has restricted
performance and so and through or purple
team we don't really hold and spend much
time on platform tuning we assumed
platform is tuned if you pretty much
have got most things that defaults and
we
a well-balanced piece of hardware and
it's well-engineered together if there's
massive imbalances in the hardware much
more seek new than i/o bandwidth that's
just a straight capacity planning
architectural challenge and you can't
tune your way around that but what we do
send to see is that a lot of people try
to and this is really a function of not
being able to recognize what problems
are and adjust and but there's this sort
of belief that and it's something that I
have to deal with management level daily
is that this is belief that we can just
fiddle away and make everything go away
and if there isn't enough hardware
matter how much tuning &amp;amp; fiddle you
can't make a difference and we also felt
with the fact that there's with this
restriction of people who don't want to
change code even if the code is awful
and there's also a belief that we can
actually choose bad code by fiddling
things underneath and this is just not
going to happen and I've been working
with a company who have been doing this
for quite a period of time they squared
to me the other day and they said Andrew
you know we have been fiddling around
with parameters for years and we've
never moved the performance needle the
day we started actually investing
intellectual capital and changing our
application form we saw the performance
gains you spoke about the game changed
and suddenly we will see performance
games on all platforms and all
environment and we've added to our
intellectual property within our
application stack and really this is the
key and we have to have a really good
real-world performance engineer will
basically will be technically that on
the application code almost down to the
assembler level at the bottom system and
this is where time and experience comes
in because they will have learned
relevant technical skills and in many
cases of the resumes I see I just see
this huge log of things that people
claim to be experts with and I think
that qualifies them but really it's not
the only thing to qualifies people as
world class before
Engineers being familiar with the
technology than being a driver is
important but this is also something
that can be learned on the job but
really what we're looking at in terms of
performance engineer is the ability to
measure and to extract the data and the
proof coin to figure out where the time
is being spent in a performance problem
because performance is all about measure
of something over in units of time so if
you can actually extract the data and
figure out where the plane is being
spent in many cases you have effectively
been able to define the problem we're
spending too much time in one operation
or one out rhythm of one form and it
should be segmented and you know at all
layers of the application we only look
at the bottom ten percent will get a
holistic view of it and and this skill
set is it really rare to find some
people who could actually look at the
whole thing ballistic and find out where
all the time is being spent and
recognize where things are either
algorithmically week or components are
not working as designed but it is above
as a defect whether the application code
is wrong is the skill that we like to
see developers an or performance
engineer this is the important bit and
being able to villista CLE figure out
where the inefficiencies are and what I
also notice is that basically good
performance engines use their peers they
use their network their skills and and
they're focused on making orders of
magnitude better and to be honest to use
my team on a performance project than
make things compass and effort is wasted
time we can sit around for 18 months and
that was a lot bigger that one off what
we're looking for is orders of magnitude
performance so if somebody wants to be a
world-class performance ends more their
goals should be at least 10 or 100 x
1000 x or at one of my engineers showed
me this week she actually got something
10,000 times faster and and that was
actually back to do just basic
real-world performance that in fact that
the users of the product weren't using
the day
this properly and she basically returned
everything that's equal value gathered
the correct default statistics on the
schema and it was 10,000 pounds fastball
and and this is a kid again and
something that we see all over and over
again selectively detuning products and
you know it just drops into these
categories all the time so it's
basically the ability to figure out
whether time gets spent and recognizing
what suboptimal and it's very rarely is
a case of using sips the symptoms and
trying to fix a system symptoms it's
using the symptoms to recognize where
perhaps were algorithmically with now
the challenge having figured out where
things are inefficient or wrong or not
working correctly is that you've done
step 1 we've identified the problem now
the next scale we look for performance
engineers and this is where really a
performance engineer becomes a change
agent instigating change to improve them
because it's not always easy and
performance engineer has to sort of this
certain amount of social engineering
very often developers don't like control
their quote doesn't work in many cases
they may be using a product that has a
bug and basically they have to make it
make sure that they can produce a test
case of the bug and such that the
developer can fix the products and so
basically they can you be able to use
the data they've gained on the early
Earth engine to actually produce the
evidence that there's a performance
issue and promote a solution to it that
involves changing over tonight within
real-world performs I don't care where
the code gets changed in the application
code or in the are DBMS in itself my
team log water bugs to improve the
efficiency in the database and but in
all cases whether we want to initiate
from application or what we want to
initiate changes in the database itself
the performance engineer has to produce
the data to win the argument to initiate
the change and it's not something you
can throw wall and just hope someone's
going to fix it you need
to get integrated propose the changes
get buy-in from the changes reduce the
evidence of changes maybe produce
prototypes and show the differences and
and basically get people on board and
you may find that actually that the same
mistake is being made by hundred
developers all over the same
organisation so having won the argument
once it's time to socialize that issue
over and over again such that other
developers with an organization don't
make mistake again and the final thing
that really shows a classic sign of
classical performance engineer is that
they see them throw into production and
see the benefits of more work so really
this is really the sign of the
successful performance engineer they've
got the changes they wanted to get into
production into production and they're
seeing the benefit forward and in many
cases a really good agent acclimate
within a matter of hours minutes days
sometimes it takes years to see this
rework because there's a lot of
corporate bureaucracy and resistance to
change and risk aversion and like that
but in many cases performance preventing
the business from function and so and a
performance engineer who is sadly with
the business and technical ocean and
socialize well can get these changes
push through to benefit the business and
this is really what we look for in a
performance anymore and somebody who
knows how to fiddle with a million and
it Dora parameters because they read
them on google only for all these
underscores was the solution and is not
what we're looking for we're looking
engineers we can initiate change and
make them orders of magnitude in
performance faster and get them into
production and and that should always be
everyone who claims their performance
engineer objectives so that's what we're
looking for and you know we are taking
resumes at the moment and quite enjoying
getting some of them and we have a few
places open and if this is the sort of
style of work you want to do
that it's it's hard work and performance
is always hard work but if we look at
any other engineering challenge where we
act make things go an order magnitude
faster like airplanes cars bridges ships
and things like that it's taken a lot of
hard work to actually get things to get
an order one foot platform and this is
why it's an interesting and that's why
I'm like name has been around for a long
time and many of my team have actually
been doing database performance forever
to involve it and because it's a
continual challenge that point that I as
much as I want to talk about today I
think we have about five or six minutes
and so I'm open to take some questions
either chat and thank you very much for
everybody
