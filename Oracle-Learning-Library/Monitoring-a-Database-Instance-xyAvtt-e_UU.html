monitor a database in an Oracle cloud
database as a service instance using the
database as a service monitor when a
database is created network access to
the virtual machine hosting the database
is limited to secure shell ssh
connections on port 22 this access
restriction ensures that the instance is
secure by default to access the database
as a service monitor you can either ask
your cloud service administrator to open
port 443 or you can use SSH client
software such as putty to create an SSH
tunnel to port 443 to connect securely
to the database here is a putty
connection defined with an SSH tunnel
using port forwarding from local port
443 to port 443 on the destination VM
that hosts a cloud database the
destination is specified using the IP
address of the VM concatenated with :
443 once you have opened port 443 or
created an SSH tunnel to port 443
navigate to the Oracle database cloud
service console click the menu icon on
the right beside the database instance
you want to monitor and select open
dbaas monitor console notice the other
consoles you can open for Oracle
application Express GlassFish
administration and Enterprise Manager
Express another way to access the dbaas
monitor console is to click on the
database name you want to monitor and
then click the menu icon at the top
right of the page a new page is open in
the browser with the URL HTTP your
instance IP address
dbaas underscore monitor you are
prompted for a username and password
enter dbaas underscore monitor as the
username and whatever password was
specified when your cloud database
instance was created the database
monitor console appears and displays
generic information about the status of
your database this monitor homepage
allows you to monitor and configure the
database as well here we see that the
database is up and running
it is using to point out two gigabytes
of storage there are 44 active and three
inactive sessions the database allows a
maximum of 472 open sessions and there
are 19 errors in the alert log file to
access the monitor page click the
monitor tab at the top of the page and
select our DBMS or select our DBMS in
the monitor section of the page the
database monitor page displays four
sections storage alert log sessions and
wait events each section links to a more
detailed view of the monitored area
click storage wait a few seconds for the
result to appear the storage page
displays a breakdown of the storage
currently allocated by the database
the inner ring shows the distribution of
the allocated space among the different
table spaces while the outer ring
represents the used space in each
tablespace the outer ring also shows the
free space in a tablespace to get the
details about the segments that use
space in one of the table spaces click
the tablespace name on the right of the
page the tablespace detail page provides
an interactive report on the segments
that exist within the tablespace most
segments are user objects and they
include tables large objects and indexes
returning to the data
monitor page click alert log an
interactive report displays the entries
in the databases alert log the alert log
is a chronological log of messages and
errors commonly used to learn whether
the background processes have
encountered errors among the entries you
will find critical errors administrative
operations process errors and other
database events returning to the
database monitor page click sessions to
view open user sessions an interactive
report displays information about all
currently open sessions in the database
the topmost table shows summarized data
about each open session click on any row
in this table to see more detailed data
about that session returning to the
database monitor page click wait events
to view the wait events in real time in
this example the wait events are
essentially those of CPU consumption
plus a little bit of system i/o and
various weights categorized as other
returning to the database monitored page
click the configure tab at the top of
the page and select our DBMS the
database configuration page displays two
sections configure database and features
the Features section reports the
enablement status of major Oracle
database features in this example the
Oracle real application clusters option
is not enabled
while application Express multimedia
spatial OLAP and X DB are enabled in the
configure database section click
parameter settings to view or modify
current parameter values the database
parameters page appears to modify the
value of a parameter select the
parameter
change its value and click the save
change button at the top you will have
an opportunity to review your change
before applying it changes that are
saved to memory will take effect
immediately across all sessions but will
be lost upon the next instance shutdown
changes that are saved to the SP file
will take effect upon the next instance
start up and are persistent and that's
it
you now know how to use the database
monitor for more information about
Oracle database as a service see the
documentation and the learning materials
in the Oracle Learning Library thank you
