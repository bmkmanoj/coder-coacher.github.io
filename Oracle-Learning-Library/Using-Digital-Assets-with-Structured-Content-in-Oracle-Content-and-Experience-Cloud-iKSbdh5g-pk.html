user of Oracle content and experience
cloud you and your team can easily
review collaborate and manage to jewel
assets such as corporate graphics stock
photography and more from the web or
your mobile device you can filter and
tag assets with keywords to find them
easily track asset status through an
approval process and use them with
structured content in a variety of ways
for example organizing them into
collections and discrete content items
if you're an enterprise user when you
log in new digital assets and structured
content options are available in the
side panel including a digital assets
view when you first click on the digital
assets view option a new system folder
titled digital assets is created under
documents on the content tab the digital
assets view is different than the
digital assets system folder you can add
assets directly to your digital asset
system folder or through the digital
asset view in the asset view all assets
in Oracle content and experience to
which you have access are displayed by
default this view includes all items in
the digital asset system folder and any
subfolders if there are other folders
with files you want managed as assets
click manage folders a list of all
folders and Oracle content and
experience cloud to which you have
access is displayed here you can select
additional folders with items you want
managed as assets while you can create
folders and subfolders in the digital
asset system folder to organize content
that organization is not displayed in
the digital assets view instead in the
assets view you can apply filters to
sort by type and status search for
keywords or select specific collections
collections are typically created when a
site administrator creates a website and
are a way to manage elements of the
website elements can include digital
assets such as images logos and videos
but also content items a Content item is
a discrete grouping of information that
can include fields for text dates and
graphics and other information content
types
provide structure for the content item
content types are defined by a Content
administrator and selected by you when
creating a content item
for example a new employee needs their
information available on the employee
website open the digital assets view and
select the appropriate collection upload
an image of the new employee notice you
can change the folder the asset is
stored in but it is still associated
with the collection you are viewing you
can add tags when uploading or add them
to the asset later tags help when
searching for the image create a new
content item from the content items view
when creating a new content item select
the content type and what collection the
Content item is associated with remember
a content type identifies the type of
information needed by a Content item so
after selecting a content type and
creating the content item you are
prompted to edit the item and add the
information needed once you are done
editing save the new item the new
content item now has all needed
information associated with it and can
be used in multiple ways selecting
preview on the content item page lets
you see an item as it may be displayed
on a website using different layouts
created by a site administrator thanks
