this panel discussion which is emerging
technologies in automation manufacturing
and robotics so we have a panel of
industry experts people have spent a lot
of years working on solving certain
domain problems working with
technologies and essentially
architecting solutions and without much
ado I would like to invite first Paul
Paul Peron from Peron robotics to
introduce himself and and we do the same
with other panelists okay that's a
leftover custom animation from some
silly slideshow but yeah anyway my name
is Paul Peron Peron robotics I'm the
founder and CEO of the company we
develop a general-purpose robotics and
automation software platform built on
Java 100% on Java it's been around since
about 2001 in going from research grade
into more commercial and more and more
complex applications over the years so
it's almost 12 years old and so what
spawned my interest in this in 2001 is
is looking at some charts like this
these are the classic hockey stick curve
charts that that futurists like to put
up there but there seems to be some
consistency and at least the vision that
robotics especially mobile robotics is
going to be an explosive market
opportunity and in the meantime
industrial automation and industrial
robots while sort of not as explosive in
the long term it still has a still
significant market opportunity none of
these charts so the opportunity for
defense-related
robotics but but that's also an area
where there's a lot of a lot of
opportunities so the this sort of
spawned the effort way back one of me
saying well what would be you know
what's missing what
are some of the what are some of the
gaps in these applications because I'd
come from the railway controls world and
some of the gaps are you have all these
different types of sensors and actuators
and PLC's and different Hardware systems
and and and to go from an application to
talking to these devices there's a lot
of software that needs to be sort of
created ranging from just communicating
with the devices to sensing and
measuring information control and
actuation methodologies and coordinating
the behaviors we've had vendors like
from the company SiC who make these
lasers that they put out there and their
customers are like great well what do I
do with this coffee maker it's a $5,000
you know laser system and they come to
us and they say okay we want
applications and you're the folks who
can do that so so how do you do that
them so what we've done to close this
gap over the years we developed and it's
a patent-pending platform called max
it's a jet like I said a general-purpose
robotics and automation software
platform that enables us to talk to
sensors easily integrate sensors and
actuator mechanism and implement control
algorithms and on top of that or part of
that microcosm of of making this useful
we've developed drivers that plug in the
max that let us talk to specific sensors
and in many cases we don't even have to
write new drivers we can just config you
know create configuration files that
tell our application how to parse the
data coming in from rs-232 or or you
know Ethernet ports and automatically
does that without any specific driver
code and then we have a host of
frameworks for more vertical areas we've
developed frameworks for vehicle
measurement like measuring vehicles on a
roadway that we can reapply to different
different Turnpike authorities we
develop them some physical security
frameworks and some unmanned ground
vehicle frameworks so I'll close out
with this rather complicated slide but
this is sort of max in a nutshell and
and what we do and so basically you've
got your partner platform your operating
environment we've got a job virtual
machine everything we do runs on top of
Java we've got different profiles that
run on standard different real time
flavors and of course micro micro
flavors but within max we've got these
we call these sensory building software
building blocks to to build sensor based
applications actuation blocks to help us
of course actually DC motors servo
motors stepper motors and then assemble
those into ways to create mobility
packages collections of motors that
implement mobility and different kinds
of planning modulus and what we call
container services because what we can
do everything is completely configurable
although we typically configure on
application and XML files we have
different sort of mediums through which
we can confirm the data the data that
configures our app can come from a
database or remote server but well the
idea is that all of our objects are
defined in terms of these configuration
files and so a lot of times an
application for us just involves taking
existing templates dropping them down
maybe writing a couple of lines of new
code or configuring some configuration
variables and we have an application
that works and so that dramatically
saves the time it takes to write
applications and it runs in a
lightweight can what we call a
lightweight runtime container you have
application components that have
callbacks and what have you but you can
also it's also a high-level API so that
you can use standard plain old Java
object type of invitations onto these
onto these reusable libraries and we
vetted this over many years and and and
across a wide variety of application
unmanned air vehicles ground vehicles
hobby bots industrial automation vehicle
measurement business physical security
and a lot of things like that and so
that's what we do in a nutshell and
thank you
so next I would like to invite Tim
Burnett from Rockwell Automation and if
I can just get his slides up
yes okay I won't need up I won't need a
pointer because I don't have any
pictures in this presentation this is
pretty dry but I promise if you come to
our talk this afternoon we'll have not
only all kinds of fancy graphics but a
demo that I hope will work but Ranveer
said you know tell us a little about
yourself so I'm an electrical engineer
trained as an electrical engineer I've
worked in a couple different fields
avionics and telecom and whatnot had my
own business consulted for a while for
about six years have been working with
Rockwell Automation as a software
architect and this is by far the most
challenging space that I've ever been
involved with and talk a little bit more
about what Rockwell doesn't and a little
bit but some of the things that I work
with the Advanced Technology Group there
and I'm involved in trying to take
advantage of some newer technologies and
bringing them into what is a very staid
technology space industrial automation
and that includes call computing we're
taking a look at using some big data
techniques some analytics to get more
out of the data that we collect and we
collect a lot of data in the factory
we've been working with embedded java
and a couple new products that are in
development at Rockwell and I'm also
quite interested in real time and
fault-tolerant systems a little bit
about Rockwell who here is like near the
industrial automation space anybody a
couple okay great so you you're probably
familiar maybe heard of Rockwell they're
pretty big in North America it's now a
public company about 20,000 employees
around five billion in sales we're based
in Milwaukee we have a big presence in
Cleveland also we're a PLC group is
focused we have labs in Shanghai and in
Prague to take advantage of some of the
research assets over there
we're in a lot of different verticals
our equipment is and we do also have a
pretty large services arm that's growing
that includes automotive food and
beverage pharma increasingly mining and
oil and gas the demo this afternoon is
from a fracking operation that we're
working with right now
in the United States and we make all
kinds of stuff write it we've lived this
catalog that's this thick and everything
from like push buttons and you know
fieldbus
a wiring stuff harnesses up through
motor drives components and relays PLC's
and software to run the whole kit and
kaboodle so we really want to do is come
out and wire your whole company with
Rockwell stuff it all works nicely with
with with its parts just say a little
bit about industrial automation for
those of you who are not familiar about
this you know there's really three kinds
or three spaces of industrial automation
there's discrete if you think about GM
or Ford with auto assembly
there's batch food making and I like to
think in terms of brewing beer and
there's continuous processes like making
glass or steel where you can't shut down
the process or you lose a tremendous
amount of money we have really
challenging environments with our stuff
I mean these PLC's are put out in a
factory that gets hosed down with acid
washes and stuff so you know you don't
put a you know adela PC out there right
it's that's not going to cut it but it's
it's hot cold it's dusty it's wet
there's shock there's eeehm Wireless
doesn't work in factories there's all
kinds of challenging things about this
environment safety concerns are a big
deal we're very active in a lot of the
safety standards bodies because you know
we have to make sure the machines don't
hurt people and increasingly security is
on our radar screen you may have heard
of Stuxnet which was industrial control
system had been infested with the virus
and we'll be seeing more of these I'm
sure it's a very competitive environment
you've certainly heard about
manufacturing being competitive and
global and I can't think of a more
competitive environment today downtime
is unacceptable in this environment so
you know people are trying to keep
prices down but they've got to have the
system be reliable and these systems are
incredibly long-lived I was in
Janesville Wisconsin at a GM factory
where they had our PLC fives that had
been there for like you know 20 years
untouched essentially so when these guys
get a line working they
going to keep it working it's like don't
mess it up okay
and that's not in common and that has
serious implications for software you
know Kent where's your Linux kernel
gonna be in 20 years I have no idea
right so these are things we have to
think about real quickly software an
industrial automation it's becoming
increasingly important visualization
communication historically this has been
believe it or not a Microsoft dominated
environment in terms of supervisory and
control on the standards there that's
changing there's a real desire now to
get that factory which has been kind of
walled off connected to the enterprise
and I think Oracle sees the
opportunities that are here and we do
too we have lots of different platforms
today starting at the bottom an arm and
x86 embedded we've got pcs that are
software runs down running a virtual
machines we're running in the cloud lots
of different operating systems
Java is really compelling for the 3 p's
in particular productivity because these
systems have been really hard with
native code to have a real productive
operation we also love the incredible
open-source palette that's available and
comes automatically with Java some of
the challenges obviously for embedded
kind of a little bigger footprint for SC
standard then we might want sometimes
but we still really want access to the
full set of api's we need fast response
we need to terminus tick execution I'll
talk this afternoon about some of the
challenges we have and some devices
we're building now we're you know we had
the system has to come up with in so
many seconds the screen has to switch
with so many seconds and you need fairly
deterministic not real-time a
deterministic behavior and that can
sometimes be a challenge
and we have a nice high level of
abstraction with Java but that can cut
both ways right sometimes I want to get
down to a marry location or an interrupt
and without real-time Java that can be a
bit of a challenge so that's it Thanks
so next in line our manufacturing
all-stars
I have built Sobel and Paul Warren doors
and I'll get their slides up and we'll
why don't you come up and introduce
yourself
hi will so Val I have too many slides
here but a little about myself I'm CEO
of and co-founder of a system insights
and actually come out of the financial
industry I spent almost 17 years
developing a risk management trading
systems trading system infrastructures
exchange systems and all those kind of
things and after taking a little hiatus
and teaching some software architecture
course over at UC Berkeley I got pulled
into manufacturing when I started
working with Paul on a standard called
empty connect and I have been the author
and architect of it we debuted in 2008
and Paul go into a little bit more about
that but after that I got kind of the
manufacturing bug and I realized that
there was a huge opportunity in this
industry to be able to provide new
technologies and new software we're in a
sense a lot of the technologies have
been kind of forgotten they hadn't done
the same transition to like cloud-based
technologies they hadn't a lot of the
business intelligence capabilities that
you're seeing coming up in other
industries like the webbing just like
web marketing sales and so forth we're
pretty much unknown they were still sort
of on a legacy legacy platforms so
Avalon and I decided to start a company
at that time to develop big data
analytics basically move the data
analyst into the cloud use some of the
new machine learning and highly scalable
technologies to be able to take collect
manufacturing data off the shop floor
and analyze it a lot of the technology
that's out there right now
answers the question of what is
happening on your shop floor which is
fine if you want to basically be
triaging everything immediately the
where we saw the industry going and the
needs of the industry where to be able
to answer the question why did something
happen and what is important so we got
to this sort of mantra you know being
able to monitor and then being able to
detect changes right before that
happened and then being able to predict
changes based on patterns and data being
I'll tell you this is about to happen
with a higher chance of probability to
be able to do that type of analytics you
need to have
very large amounts of data and you need
to have very scalable analytics plus a
whole bunch of other technologies I've
been working on
so our company is focused on figuring
out how to make companies more effective
when they're producing parts and if you
are familiar with manufacturing the
utilization of equipment is actually
fairly low when you're talking about
discrete part manufacturing making
things like medical devices and Eric
aerospace parts it's probably in a you
know 30 sometimes 40 percents and
there's a lot that can be done with that
and by being able to figure out why
things are down why you're not producing
parts basically we can help
manufacturers make more effective use of
this extremely expensive extremely
complicated equipment that they have on
their shop floor and that's that's what
we do so we have also we've been working
on open source technologies around the
MT Connect standard to be able to allow
other people to get access and be able
to sort of broaden the base of data
availability off the shop floor maybe
people who don't come out of this
industry discrete part especially
industry you don't know this but to get
data off of a machine tool your standard
CNC that's cutting metal is actually a
rather complex problem and the MT
connected standard addresses that by
giving you a standard set of structure
and data items to describe the
information you can get off it without
that basically doing what we do would be
extremely hard to impossible and that's
one reason that the industry hasn't
moved that far forward in this grade so
you know a lot of focus on standards
open source technologies or releasing
tools based on the Java platform out to
the industry and outs of research and
universities to be able to try to raise
up some of the capabilities of the
industry so that's what we're up to
Thanks
next I'd like to invite Paul Paul has is
our contact for empty connect and like
in stock
thank you good morning everyone a a
little bit of my background I started in
manufacturing in 1965 so you can do the
math how long I've been involved in it
worked for a number of companies and
recently when not recently 16 years ago
I joined AMT AMT what we are as we're
trade association were located in McLean
Virginia right outside of DC and our
purpose and goal is to help our
membership which is over 600 strong and
organizations become more effective in
their sales and understanding of their
product lines we have offices throughout
the world to help members in exporting
product and understanding what other
country needs are we also have advocacy
since we're close to the hill we do
represent our industry and bring to the
hill what they would like to do and see
and changes that they were like have
made we do research not in the sense
that we have any research is that we
help in focusing on types of research
that assist other organizations
universities in constructing research to
help our industry out we have events
IMTS
is anyone familiar with the
International manufacturing technology
show we just had that last month that
was an exhibit show of over 1.2 million
square feet of products that were being
showcased was over a hundred thousand
attendees so it was a rather successful
show this year my leaps and bounds
everybody said some of the projects that
I personally get involved in is one was
a smart machine initiative to help bring
intelligence to equipment on the floor
and then other one is empty connect
started that in 2007 and as willand
mentioned our first showing of it was in
2008 at
ts what is it it is a royalty-free
open standard that everybody can use the
purpose of it is to try to get past this
interoperability about how do things
talk to others the reason we took this
on is our members were actually asking
for something of this they were getting
tired of every time somebody had a new
application they had to develop a new
interface and to them that was a really
misuse of resources because most the
time they had to do it for free
therefore was a cost to them they wanted
some way to get past that so we brought
on the development of this standard
basically what it is is that every
device and every machine they all have
their same different languages they
speak differently and as will said if
you wanted to get the data out of this
stuff it was pretty complex and
expensive to do that what we're trying
to do is to take those different
languages and put them into one common
language be an empty connect and have a
dictionary of data items so that as an
application or anybody wanting to access
access that data they know what it is
how to interpret it how to deal with it
and we are building the we both the
eight standard on XML so that we could
give to our membership into anybody the
ability to extend beyond the standard so
they can differentiate themselves with
the product with their own namespace and
their own data items what we've done is
we've moved the definition and
description of what data is usually it's
at the application side you always have
to build an interface if you want to get
something from a piece of equipment
we've moved it to the equipment so that
anybody that would like to get the data
and is able to get the data we're using
HTTP so it's on any network you can pick
it up
and if you wish later on if anybody like
to see who can give you a little
demonstration of we're looking at
machines in India in Indiana throughout
the world
because you can put them on the internet
if you're allowed to but that's a little
bit what we're doing and if you have any
questions please bring them up
thank you thanks Paul
so the genesis of this panel discussion
was essentially the fantastic
conversations I often have with these
gentlemen and others in the field of
manufacturing automation robotics
and essentially domains where technology
today has tremendous power to change
things when I talked to Tim about his
process automation architectures it
fascinates me go back 15 years 10 years
and you see the landscape totally
different I see Paul Peron from Peron
robotics robotics in itself is such a
cool domain to work it's great to see
Java and emerging technologies showing
up and building something meaningful
manufacturing between Paul and Bill they
have written the empty Kinect spec so we
talked to them it it interests me to
understand what is emerging technology
why emerging technologies make sense for
these guys and secondly what we will do
is I have a list of about five or six
questions pretty generic I kind of asked
them and then we'll open it up to the
audience and if you guys have any
questions we'll let the panel at address
those
and feel free to stop me in case you
have a question and a burning need to
get some sciences I would entertain them
but anyway I'm sorry yeah right it's a
it's a standard so it only specifies the
HTTP protocol and the XML schema right
can be written on anything right now we
don't have a Java implementation that's
something that we are working right now
with Oracle on getting out there so I
wanted to start off and we'll go in this
ordered with dinner all rail and all
again so what are some of the technology
trends you guys are seeing in your
domain emerging technologies which are
relevant well okay so I'll just there's
lots of them but one that's I think
really a big deal for us is multi-core
you know we make some pretty good
business out of selling PLC's and all
the stuff that connects to a PLC and in
the past those machines were highly
constrained in terms of what you could
attempt to do both memory and processing
wise today we're looking at you know
soon to be launching for an eight-core
control system so now you can say not
only can I do basic control in i/o but I
could throw on one of those cores on a
model predictive processor right where
I'm actually trying to predict some
outcomes for the process and make
corrections
you could put job on one of those cores
and do some event processing localize
instead of collecting all the state up
at a higher tier so for us multi-core
presents a really big opportunity in
that space yeah well we've when we first
looked at these market projections for
what robotics and automation was was you
know back in 2001 and and and in the
mid-2000s you know was projecting
something that was a little further out
there and we as a small company you know
affect us as much because you know we
had the ability to to focus on research
and sort of builds build design for
tomorrow and implement for today in
other words you know ride this emerging
market wave so everything we've done has
been designed to really capture that
high revenue opportunity that's that's
on the horizon so the trends that I see
happening are luckily some of the
predictions are coming true so back when
we were working with the DARPA Grand
Challenge and had a DARPA Grand
Challenge vehicle and it was a high it
was considered a wacky research project
you know why why would you build a robot
that would travel the Mojave Desert self
navigating car and and now we're hearing
more and more about driverless and smart
car technology I'm actually the chairman
of the SAE Committee for on-road
autonomous vehicle standards California
is starting to legislate and allow
autonomous vehicles to drive on the road
so in just six years
we you know we've gone from you know
completely crazy Star Wars level robot
project to something that's viable going
to be happening on our roads in the near
future so the trend is is that this that
this is you know intelligent and robotic
automation is going to be explosive and
we saw the same thing with in
transportation using lasers was foreign
to to the to the traditional
transportation companies that were used
to treadles in the ground to to detect
where vehicles were and we worked with
the company and we put leis you know
lasers overhead and that you know
whenever you mentioned that the term
laser they think Austin Powers or or
some some you know crazy mad scientist
type solution but in fact these lasers
have real value these industrial lasers
are are measuring vehicles and doing
things that they never thought that they
could do so that that certain that that
period of being gun-shy and sort of
dabbling with the bleeding edge is now
coming back it's been a long business
cycle but the trend is
is that these companies are now starting
to see that this is the real deal that
you can actually do things with these
advanced intelligent technologies that
was only once the purview of science
fiction sure so just going back in time
when I first got into this around 2007
we went to IMTS Paul brought brought us
out there and they did a huge
presentation I mean see the pictures of
it so it was amazing what AMT put on as
far as a show for empty connect it's a
standard and we presented it to the
public a lot of the reaction we got was
well why do I care why do I really want
to get data off of our machine it's like
well you know they seem to be doing fine
I'm you know we make parts and we didn't
there was a lot of fear and also about
putting your machines on the network
because someone's gonna hack them it was
gonna cause all kind of disruptions and
there was security issues and just a lot
of a lack of understanding about what
could be done and what value could be
added to the process I've seen over the
last couple of shows this last show
especially when I started to talk to
people it's more now okay what can you
do for me to make my business more
efficient so the discussion has really
changed from the beginning but why
should I care to now really looking for
business value and how can we extract as
much business value same thing when we
started the company we were you know a
SAS based company and we were saying
we're gonna sell us a space to solution
into manufacturing and people looked at
us like we're crazy of course people are
never gonna let their data off of their
network never going to happen but again
there hasn't been that much resistance
we got interesting also just from some
of the companies through dealing with
just there just thought of this we first
approached some of the large machine
tool builders back in the beginning you
know he did these tours Paul and I and
we went to some of these companies and
we told them that we would like to just
get a read-only standard that's got able
to get data off of your machine and a
lot of these companies are saying
oh one of them especially said that well
if you did that they're gonna be able to
reverse-engineer how my machine works
and this is going to be yeah this is
gonna give us this is gonna allow our
competitors to compete you know
basically do what we're doing because
you're gonna be able to see our
positions and our loads and so forth and
now they're actually this company is one
of our biggest supporters so we've seen
a real turnaround in the acceptance and
the concept that we need to be able to
understand and monitor and really get a
handle on what happens in these
manufacturing systems and now we're
getting into things like the embedded
devices that are able to collect data
from different types of sensors and a
whole bunch of different sources so as I
see it I think the acceptance and the
understanding now in the marketplace
that these technologies are out there
that my business can do better can be
more efficient because I can now get
information I'm working off of an
information base instead of clipboards
and written notes I think that's a huge
change that's really going to impact
this industry incredibly well being in
this industry for a little while when we
started the project we knew the first
thing that and the hardest thing that we
were going to be faced with is culture
that we had to get past that and within
the past six years that's starting to
really come about as will it's at
mentioned in 2008 people would walk by
the booth or I should say what walk past
the booth because there was no interest
at the time and looking at the economy
and looking at what's going on now and
people starting to understand that
things can happen this last show we've
had I think most people I've ever seen
that wanted to monitors there are
organizations there are shops we are
working with the national tune
machining Association that's about 1,600
to 2,000 job shops in America implement
help implement empty connect problem
that we have is that we're getting past
the cultural issue now we got to get our
hands and get a hold of how much is this
all going to cost me these companies
don't have large pockets of money
therefore we have to get the cost of
implementations down that's been the
inhibitor for all of these companies
they even try to think about automating
the movement of data and the
understanding of the data on your shop
floor so that's one of the areas that we
need to really start to pay attention to
is get that price point down and that's
what we're working with national touring
machining Association on trying to do
that to show you how excited our our
members are is we're going to work on a
starter kit that B we're going to hook
three machines up and we're going to
give you an application just so you
could look at this stuff almost all of
the machine tool builders will do those
three machines for free that they want
to get the industry's getting
manufacturing up and going on the
advantages of monitoring and all the
installations are just about you correct
me if I'm wrong people have seen a
increase in utilization of the equipment
of at least 20 percent which is money to
them yes ma'am starter kit we're
shooting for then I'd say it reality
beginning of next year and actually
we're working on a little bit of an
application the freebie application it's
not going to tell you anything more than
the utilization of your machine for a
week and after that it blows up the data
because we can't compete against those
that are in the business of providing
applications but we want to do is get
people on board as the advantages if
they do implement this and open up the
world to them
very good so but I want to ask you guys
about an individual come
Lexx issue or a problem which you guys
are facing and you're solving with
technologies but before I do that I want
to give you guys a kind of a human face
to these problems which we are facing so
I was reading an interesting article
where they said in Singapore what
they're doing is they're overlaying
weather patterns on GPS coordinates of
taxis and they are figuring out that cab
drivers don't want to pick up passengers
when it's raining and by the way if you
have been to Singapore it's always
raining some part of Singapore and the
reason that they found out they don't
want to do that is because they have to
pay a bond in case they get into an
accident and that was hurting the cab
company which in the first place was
enforcing these bonds so they did this
analytics they had this mash-up of
different technologies and they figured
out the culprit was that bond so they
took that bond away and they saw a 40%
increase in revenues so this this is a
human face of this problem that we are
using big data big analytics to solve
these problems so coming back to that
question do you guys or have you guys
experienced a similar challenge and a
problem which you have solved using
these newer technologies which you
probably would not have been able to do
five years back or 10 years back I'd
like to pick your brain so why don't we
start this time with Paul okay I
understand correctly is what we can what
can we do today we couldn't do but in
the past exactly well there's a lot of
new technologies coming out and like a
additive processes it you know everybody
if you read the article now and seeing
on YouTube where you know you could make
parts with plastic by adding it up and
everything and some kids have made guns
out of this stuff so things are moving I
think where we're heading is that
innovation is going to come out as a
faster pace than ever before and that we
need and today things are happening
relative to innovation that couldn't
happen in the past because technologists
weren't available we have a company that
in the past had troubles with their in
their facilities they had pop machines
hundreds of thousands of employees I
think and they're monitoring their pop
machines to make sure that they don't
quake or if they're going to break they
fix them so that they don't get their
employees made out so we're all getting
into this new new understanding that
knowledge is becoming the power and then
the past we couldn't do that because we
couldn't really get the data and we
didn't have the devices it was too
expensive and nobody just wanted to go
there I think the lowering of the access
to the data will bring about greater
innovation things that we don't even
know well
that exists today I'll just say the
singularity is near yeah there's a
there's something that we struggle with
and our customers are talking to us
about we manufacture a series of what we
call historians and an industrial
automation factories these collect time
series data from sensors and from the
controllers and then later on they try
and make sense of what's happening in
their Factory what their process or
whatever problem is there's too much
data and I think there's two ways that
we can tackle that one is we can take
advantage of the scale available in the
cloud so we can move this historian we
have we have story anon a rack embedded
we have it on a PC we have an enterprise
server we're gonna put it in the cloud
so we can collect more data and we can
provide more analytics there but that's
not good enough because there's still
too much data so we have to go to the
other end and look at the bottom and say
hey when I'm collecting this data at a
sensor you know look at the costs of
things like putting Ethernet on a smart
sensor or an embedded processor today
they're dropping rapidly
so we can start looking at the very
bottom where we collect the data and try
and make some intelligent decisions
there and not collect all the data but
just the important data or the important
events that we need to be aware of in
those sensors so I think we need to
tackle it at both areas and we are doing
that for instance I saw a very
interesting product that Oracle had
which is an embedded complex event
processor they had it on big iron but
now they're taking it down to run an
embedded job in embedded spaces you
could take advantage of that kind of
technology closer to the point where you
collect the data to minimize how much
data you're collecting so I think that
those two that two-pronged approaches is
really going to be big for us and our
customers thanks Tim yeah I mean what
one of the things that has happened is
certainly in terms of the price of
sensor technology has come down which
has been great because that needs to
happen for example we have designed
software to talk to as they had
mentioned before these SiC that's the
name of the company SiC lasers and and
there they can be very expensive of you
know ten fifteen thousand dollar lasers
so we developed a software package that
is sort of sensor agnostic and that we
get we get data in the form of these
high-level points these point objects
collections of points so when SiC
created a lower cost laser we adapted to
that and then when we wanted to go an
OEM partner of ours wanted to go into
some retail oriented organizations that
were not going to be able to afford a
$1,000 or $2,000 sensor in their
application we were actually able to say
okay well hey there's this 150 dollar
connect like sensor now and the same
application software that we use for
security works with all three of those
lasers without any application software
changes based on the architecture so
what exactly we we want to see happening
is to sort of design this software to be
a hardware agnostic and be able to
leverage this
these these lower-cost sensors and in
some cases you know there's going to be
more they might be more expensive but
more robust sensors for industrial
applications at versus retail
applications so that's been happening
and that's been a tremendous boon and
the same thing goes the same applies for
mapping data for when we were working
with DARPA Grand Challenge only a few
you know in 2005 only a few teams could
afford the really really good data now
you know with some of the projects and a
GB project on work we're working on we
have access to data that's just about as
good and sudden some of its free and but
it's generally afford it's getting more
and more affordable so so it's just this
technology is is is is you know this
convergence is happening sensors are
gonna get cheaper and and and we're
gonna actually have more and more viable
robotics and automation applications and
so that's sort of the biggest change
I've seen is the cost reduction thank
you you've actually just listened to Tim
we've actually got on the other
direction we collect everything and one
of the reasons we've been doing that is
because we feel that you never know what
you're gonna need so a lot of our
analytics you know we're looking at
correlations between some something that
happened out on the shop floor and some
event that occurred well how far back do
you need to go what data is important so
you collecting all this you know sensor
data and machine tool data load speed
speeds process information and something
happens now let's look back in our data
set and see what's highly correlated
with that event occurring so how do you
do that well one of the things we found
is that you really need to collect
everything and you need a store
everything the good news is that with a
lot of the cloud technologies like where
AWS AWS based right now and we you know
it's reasoning all the you know latest
buzz words and things you know they have
been a lot kind of technology to be able
to store large blobs of data up in the
cloud and this has given us the ability
to find things like a customer if they
had an argument
between the operators and the
engineering were basically a machine had
failed and it crashed and they were
wondering you know the operator said the
part program was wrong or the machine is
skipping a part of the part program and
the engineering said that's not possible
that you know it just can't happen what
you're saying doesn't happen well it
turned out to be a combination of
problems a problem that alarm went off
on the machine and the operator reset
the alarm but the machine was in the bad
state it did execute the part program
correctly and finish it up and then we
noticed that there was you know some
loads and patterns we can actually see
the crash right in the data we could see
exactly what the event sequence was that
led up to this and we knew exactly why
this had happened so we could tell them
you know this is a sequence this is what
happens tell your operator not to do
this anymore if they hit the reset
button they have to actually restart all
over again and put the Machine back into
a home position because it doesn't know
where it is machine kind of got lost at
three stations and it got lost and it
thought it was in a different station
than it was so when it tried to move
again and said oh no and crashed into
something so you get these kind of
questions and having all the data having
all this information we can actually
solve problems again you next time we
see this kind of a pattern we can
actually say hey I think you're in a bad
situation you should really take a look
and make sure they go through the right
sequence of reset so that they don't
smack their machine again because these
machines are extremely expensive a
single problem like you know let's say
you smack a spindle you get slightly out
of alignment you're talking about maybe
a ten thousand dollar repair so there's
a lot of money involved in this and
you're talking about down times you're
talking about loss of production so what
you're talking to companies about these
kind of things I mean it's not just oh
yeah this is fun to do this is you know
this is true business decisions that are
being here to business value that you're
adding and you know dollars and cents
excellent so I have a lot of questions
probably five hours worth of questions
but unfortunately in the interest of
time
you have just 15 more minutes left so
what I'd like to do is I'd like to open
it up to the audience if you guys have
any questions for the panel feel free to
speak up now anybody yes can you
introduce yourself and I think all you
want to take that actually we we are
working with OPC we have a Memorandum of
Understanding and we're building a
companion specification on how you link
empty connect an OPC together so we
provide them to OPC is the dictionary of
the data items and what they mean okay
thank you yes
the RFP make it we're in my shop floor I
rally this promise pass through on my
shop floor and they got in their ERP
then they stand then I have a
comprehensive this where it was in 1990
I feel like I've got custom ability came
from all right I won't the couple that
passing through routing control
engineering finance manufacturing
planning and shop floors coming together
in that tie together of my ERP 10 my
child floor rallying control is on the
way up done in the past okay
big data I agree I need big data because
what I'm really wanting is to predict
I'm not only want to see it come through
I want to see problems come prove that
I'm going to be able to analyze very
different steps and see problems and get
my quality data in a little big data
forever okay I want to capture tip about
what you're saying everything I can
could get my predictions up in it what
it really won't say a video game on my
shop floor okay so it's pretty new rolls
I could hire they can't do an email but
they can do the unbelievable complexity
of a forward planning different but I'm
trying to tie these in I feel like I'm
doing the different pieces I don't need
to confidence yet in in the end kind of
standard CPI is the best I've got in my
world and every PDI projects and work in
progress
it's all they do think
I'm doing this I'm just gonna I want to
take a shot at that when I came to
Rockwell they said let's do research
project let's let's hook up the the s AP
supply chain module to a sample factory
a pharma factory aspirin product line
and that was hard and we had all the
resources available to us right and
you're right it's not getting better and
frankly it's not a technology problem at
all my take is you know SAP wants to
come down into the space the people who
are in this space don't want SAP there
they want to have their own proprietary
solutions and so they're they're not
cooperating they're not working together
and until that happens one way or
another it's going to continue to be
difficult just saying about this
actually aside for the fact that you
know it sounds like a you know like an
area where like an organization like
work or for example could could come in
and with some embedded you know you know
plugins and and and tools you know it's
a big problem you're looking at you know
sort of a system level solution that
needs to be provided by you know an
organization like an Oracle or something
with their toolset but you know tying to
all those those different pieces there
there is a gap maybe and what what's in
sort of Oracle world and wheezing what's
required perhaps to make that embedded
connectivity but there are people here
like Dave clack and and
and and some of the folks on the in the
embedded side that that are that are
helping bridge that gap I think but yeah
I mean that's that's sort of my rough
take on my loose understanding of your
problem yes I I know exactly you're
talking about every project I mean I
think before I'm to connect every
project is a one-off and everybody's
building the same damn software and
we've seen this over and over again even
with getting data off of controllers I
don't know how many implementations I've
run across where people have come up
with different ways of being able to
integrate with controllers and it's not
easy and you know actually PLC's in
process are probably easier than spaces
I'm sure how much you're forging so
you're probably doing mainly PLC not so
much CNC working correct yeah so I think
that standards can help because if we
can get people to adopt standards
especially the standards are one thing
that you don't want to get into as a
pay-to-play type of scenario where to be
able to use a standard it's going to
cost you money because then you have
barriers to adoption it's one of the
things that I'm to connect was very
cognizant of when we started this
project was to make it open and
royalty-free so that anybody could
implement it and I think when you start
getting into you know again it you know
it's a mark of maturity situation so if
people can contribute back so tha like
what you have device drivers and other
things along that line other industries
if you can get people to contribute
these solutions back then yet you may do
your one-off for your particular
scenario but if somebody else can
contribute if you can contribute that
back to the community then you can start
to get this sort of community effect
where if you need something then you can
download that from the community and
basically use it within your shop you
have to redevelop it from scratch but
all of the tiers of the same standard
protocols and standard vocabulary then
basically everybody can use the same set
of technology so there isn't that
ecosystem in manufacturing right now and
that's one of the things that were
really
you know from the Institute side to try
to build and there's a lot of resistance
in this industry because it's always
been you know I can come up with a
little proprietary solution and charge
you you know tons of money to be able to
use it and the solutions that they're
providing you are basically they're
giving you plumbing and the problem is
that if all you're selling is plumbing
enough business value then I think the
focus is really on the wrong thing we
really need to focus on getting the
applications and the analytics out there
and not so much focused on how to
getting plumbing going like you know if
everybody charged let's say you know ten
thousand dollars to be able to implement
you know SNMP on every router or machine
you know a computer that's out there so
you can just find out whether the thing
is operating or not people would say
that's ridiculous or if you put an
Ethernet port two thousand dollars to
put an Ethernet port on a device again
you know this is something we take for
granted in other industries where in
manufacturing we really need to get that
next step where these types of
technologies are freely available if
they're not just already embedded on
there already let Paul answer that then
we'll get yourself right I said this is
a big culture change that we're going
through to get everybody on board and
it's gonna take major influence to be
able to have it really come about we
won't solve it today it's gonna take
many years to get it done because
manufacturing is big there are so many
areas to address so many things to get
in but we got to get to started amt
we've got over 4 million dollars of our
own money into the standard because we
believe that we got to start somewhere
and we got to get this thing moving and
we're hoping other corporations and
companies come on board to help us out
we have over 105 organizations now
helping us with this standard and it's
going to take time it's going to take
your big forces to help get us to where
we really want to be in to solve your
problems so you don't have to always
hire a slew of programmers to come in
and then you're living with this for the
rest of your life because any change you
want to make is going to be difficult
and when that program release you're
done that we're trying to address it you
had a question sir
so why don't you start dim yeah so those
are really good points let me try and
answer the first one first question you
asked it was up I think one of the
things we're doing is our embedded Linux
we actually went and brought some
expertise in we're working with a
distribution called Monta Vista who
they're very active in releasing stuff
to the kernel in terms of embedded Linux
extensions and where that's headed and
we count on that partner to help us make
sure we're gonna have a good kernel ten
and fifteen and twenty years from now
secondly today where we are anyway with
Java in the real-time space is rather
limited we need to terminus t'k response
times but we don't need a real-time hard
real-time yet when we get on to one of
those cores in our PLC's in our control
environment now we're going to need
quite likely real-time response and
that's what I'm going to come over to
these guys and see if we can resurrect
some of the technology they have from
Java real-time and help us with that
because they have some great expertise
in there so we've worked with Java RTS
in the past we've we've and and you know
but but there is there is undoubtedly a
lack of real-time you know JVM solutions
out there but there are some vendors who
have Java real-time platforms and in
this space there there's a handful but
but they're out there and they have
different levels of support and then in
the same token the other the other level
is sort of at the microcontroller level
there are even fewer and farther between
options for running Java in like what's
considered a microcontroller level
environment but they're out there and
we've worked with every one of them to
try to see if it's it's usable some have
come and gone over the years but but our
strategy is is to to continue to work
with
with you know Oracle and and whomever
can provide these platforms for these
specific environments like we often we
have a need for qnx and VxWorks and and
you know it's multi core solutions on
those platforms so work with the handful
of folks who have the expertise in that
area to provide that and have had you
know a lot we have a lot of really good
experience with the RTS product and
that's actually deployed and running on
the Pennsylvania Turnpike hard a
real-time deterministic system we also
did it for an unmanned air vehicle RTS
and that and then some other robotic
projects so but but it is a it is a
concern and that you know how long will
you know is it going to evolve and we're
just going to continue to work with with
with Oracle and folks to see that it
that it that had happened and do
whatever we can do to support that
because we need it cool yeah sure
so I haven't dealt with much of the
artist level of device integration and
before you know
a lot of what we do is monitoring from
our application side we're actually
getting into some of the device
integration device inter-process
communication areas right now and but
from so the MT connect standpoint we are
ruffled at a higher level we're more at
the level of passing information back
and forth between devices like
integration between okay I'll stop
talking it's easy i I know nothing about
software so I can't answer your question
share that with you without any
questions we sent that email for them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
