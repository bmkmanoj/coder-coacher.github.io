practically perfect pl/sql so I've
talked in general about what constitutes
hard coding this idea that something's
not going to change so I can repeat it
in multiple places and pretty much hope
and pray that it doesn't change let's
take a look at a specific example so
let's take a look at line 5 on this code
and link to it line 10 and link to that
line 17 just on those three different
lines that I mentioned there are three
different hard coatings but I'm not
going to worry about all that right now
what I want to focus on is the
declaration in line 5l name is declared
to be VAR car to 100 so here's my
initial tip I suggest that you consider
any VAR car to declaration with a hard
coded value and you always have to have
a hard coded value to be a bug a bug in
your code unless it's the single point
of definition for that data type and
I'll come back and explain what that
means in just a moment but in general if
you see a VAR car to declaration in your
programs in the declaration sections of
your code bug how can I be you might be
saying or another way of saying it is oh
my gosh you're saying I have 10,000 more
bugs and I thought I had in my code bad
news so why all right well let's take a
look at how it's being used I'm fetching
the full name of an employee last comma
first into that local variable lname the
local variables being populated online
17 so I needed to declare a variable to
hold that expression last name comma
first name now what I'd like to be able
to do and I'm sure you're aware this
feature is percent type it in other
words say that L name should be called
table column percent type and then every
time my table structure changes my code
will be automatically we compiled and
will take up the new definition of that
column beautiful feature the problem is
I have a derived column last comma first
and I can't do like % type of this + %
type of that it it just doesn't work so
what do I do well I need to make sure
that the variable is big
to hold my last name and first name so
what I'm going to do is take a look at
the employees table hmm if I look at a
description of employees it shows me
that the last name is up to 25
characters in length the first name is
up to 20 characters in length let's add
one for the comet 20 25 comma 46 great
I'm going to double that I'm going to
make it a hundred 100 that way it will
never get to be too big it'll never
exceed that size will never get a value
error exception when the fetch is
performed right no I'm sure you're
saying no Steven that's not true at all
why is that not true because it's not
guaranteed that that employees table is
always going to look like that what if
the DBA comes along and says well we got
some new employees they got from really
long last names we better extend the
size of these columns last name is now
five hundred first name is now two
hundred we change the table or the DBA
changes the table my code doesn't
automatically recompile or it doesn't
automatically take up the new
declaration of the new sizes of those
columns because it's hard coded and then
the first time that a person's name is
fashion that's a really big name my code
blows up Wow so how do I get around that
well they're actually a couple of
possibilities one is I could add a
virtual column on to my table that has
this expression in it and it would
automatically be sized appropriately I
could create a view that has this
expression in it and it would automatic
the name of that column inside the view
would have that size dynamically created
and there may be good reasons for doing
that but in general you don't want to
create a new database object or a new
column in the table just to handle the
problem of declaring something in my
code that can't be expressed with the
percent type a more general and really
excellent solution is to take advantage
of subtypes subtypes what are subtypes
well let's subtype is a new application
specific type that you can define in
your code that is based on something
else so in general what you want to do
is use subtypes to declare application
specific types that can't be expressed
through percent type or percent row type
let's take a look
so I have a package called employees are
P that means employees rules package so
all the rules associated with the
employee table that the minimum salary
for a CEO has to be 10 million what is
and how do you construct the full name
of employee it's all contained here so i
have a function called full name that
takes the last name in the first name
and returns what is that it returns full
name you think it would return to our
car to write what is full name full name
is a subtype so full name on line 10 i
declared to be a subtype and it is
nothing more than and nothing less than
of our car to 10,000 or maybe it's of
our car to 1000 or maybe it's it doesn't
matter what it is the point is that it's
hidden behind the name full name T and
then I can go back to my code and I
could say I don't want to hard code this
declaration I want to swap coded and I
want a soft coated to be employee will
our pay full name t so now my
declaration of l-name is a redirect to
that package definition it's really the
same as a percent type in the sense that
I haven't said what it is I've said what
it's based on and now every time I need
to change this for example the DBA says
huh we've got really long names coming
in now we've got a first name that could
be 500 we've got a last name that could
be 20,000 what do you need to about that
developer no big deal I'm gonna go to my
package spec i'm going to change this to
let's say 32 767 biggest name possible
today in oracle 11 or 12 or whatever
working you're on I recompile the
package my procedure recompile as a
result and my new definition is in place
so what I've done is take a constrained
declaration of our car to declaration
ever evar car to declaration is a
constraint you have to provide a maximum
size and I've taken that out of this
specific instance of code and I replaced
it with a name and in general that's the
way you get rid of hard-coding you
replace the details of the
implementation with a name and the name
hides the details and tells you what it
is so my code ends up being more self
documenting I don't need to comment with
that thing is it's a it's a full name
it's pretty obvious in terms of the
expression that creates the full name
that's another hard coding and that
should just be put in
side the function and then you call the
function and I'll talk about that in a
different presentation but again I would
go back to the very simple rule that you
can follow every VAR car to declaration
should be considered a bug in your code
unless it's this kind of declaration
unless it's the single point of
definition through the subtitle if you
follow this rule you'll have way fewer
chances of breakage over time and this
is one of those classic examples where
you write the code today it works fine
goes into production works fine years go
by years go by you're gone maybe your
son or daughter's not maintaining your
code is this what you want to leave is
your son or daughter no you want to make
it sweat as these data structures change
as your data volume grows as things
modify your code automatically adapts as
much as possible or if you can't
automatically adapt because there's
nothing automatic about this you change
in one place the single poem definition
so thanks for joining me on this talk
thanks for getting rid of all your bark
are two declarations and putting them
into subtypes happy coding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
