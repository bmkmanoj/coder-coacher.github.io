the intent of this demo is to show you
when statement queuing kicks in when
several concurrent statements execute in
parallel
I have prepared three sessions in these
three sessions we will run three
concurrent parallel statements so that
we can see the behavior of statement
queuing if it comes into effect first of
all let's see what the parameters have
been set those parameters related to
parallelism the first one is the
parallel degree policy which needs to be
set to auto so as to have statement
queuing coming into effect the second is
parallel decreed limit which has been
set to do and which set the maximum
table for parallel statements another
parameter which is brandish the parallel
max service which set the number of the
maximum number of query servers that are
available for any parallel query and a
new parameter is the parallel service
target which is set to ten here and
which means that when ten query servers
are already in use are the parallel
statements will have to queue and wait
until the requested query service become
available so now let's see what what's
happening if I run these three
concurrent parallel statements in the
first session I will run a select star
from sales table with an order by and
with Ain top defaulted to two in the
second
I will run a select star from SH the SH
dot sales tables with the default
paralleled up to two and in the third
session I will explicitly request a
double for and on a statement which asks
for notable so let's start these three
statements concurrently the first one
starts the second one executes and the
third one is just hanging and we will
see why now let's go to enterprise mini
channel to see how our three executions
are proceeding the monitored sequel
executions we easily see that two of
them are executing and the third one is
in acute status so let's remember that
our panel service target has been set to
10 which means that only ten queries
service can be used concurrently at a
certain time so how many of these
parallel query service the two executing
queries are now using them so let's go
to the first one
so if we go to the parallel tab we can
see that this query is using only one
parallel set but with the top of two it
chooses to parallel servants now let's
go to the second execution and see how
many of these parallel servers it
chooses with the same degree of
parallelism of two so the second
execution we see here that it uses two
slaves sets and let's go to the parallel
tab yes to slay set and each of them
consuming two parallel query service
which means four of them for this
execution so two for the first execution
and four for the second execution means
six of them does the third query which
is in a dream state half has enough
query servers to execute the third
execution was executed with an explicit
parallel top set to four which means
with an order by that it had to get two
slave sets of four query servers which
means eight crew servants as the two
exit to other executions are consuming
six of the ten it cannot get the eighth
query service that it requests so it
will have to wait until one of the two
other executions completes to be able to
execute but if the first one completes
it only releases to query servers would
it
enough for this one to execute no
because that what this one requires
eight of the ten that can be reused so
it has to wait until this one which
consumes for query servers to be able to
start this is the end of the
demonstration thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
