spend some time showing you how to set
up a secure FTP and FTP protocols on
file shares within the ZFS and how to
access them first thing you need to do
is make sure those services are turned
on you go to configuration services and
then click on each corresponding service
itself you'll know if it's not if it's
on because of the green light you can
also says online in here you can turn on
and off really simply they're a service
change in a settings you want you know
out of the defaults so with FTP the
default port 21 you can see it has a
default login root directory that when
someone logs them they're going to go to
just the wide open export directory of
the ZFS appliance and then over on the
secure FTP side you basically can choose
a port number and you can add this RSA
and DSA keys if you want to do that as
well so once that could that's configure
the next step is to go to whatever share
that you want to have people access over
you know multiple shares obviously over
that protocol so by default
typically NFS is turned on in a
readwrite fashion in this case that's
not being shared SMB happens to be on
and we want to turn on FTP and SFTP so
in this case we're going to uninhibit
from the project because project has it
to none and we're gonna say FTP is going
to be read/write and SFTP will be
read/write as well go up to the top and
just hit apply and the log as it does
require a login account whenever you log
in with these protocols and either has
to be a local user or a directory based
user using either LDAP or Ness in our
case we're using LDAP so now that we
have the share setup we can then
basically go into our FTP client and set
up these connections so we'll set up FTP
first
and we put it in our LDAP user account
information and one last thing we will
pick what remote directory one ago
remember it's already going to export
and we're going to the FS 12 directory
and we'll save this we'll call this the
FTP account so that's setup now we can
click login and this should log us into
FTP and sure enough there it is I'm in
the FS 12 directory I can go in here and
pick that one's already there drag and
drop files over and then when we go over
to the ZFS what we should see is some
FTP traffic and sure enough there's a
little bit of traffic going on we can
come in here let's close this and clean
it up so we can go in here and see some
of the FTP traffic started a lot of the
same drill downs are for analytics are
here as well such as what type of work
you can look up by username you can look
it up by client so what machine is it
coming from
you can look at the individual file
names that are coming in what share so
on and so forth so there is my file name
and sure enough you can see that's the
file that I dragged over just a second
ago
performers discussion I can see it as
it's coming in okay and that completed
the files over there now the next thing
we'll do is set up a SFTP connection
it's not very different create a new
SFTP
I changed the port to 218 that's when we
were using same credentials you use that
private key pop you're using that now we
will set up that directory and we'll say
save and then log in over a secure FTP
and there it is it's logged in let's go
pick another video so I started copying
this video if we come over here and sure
enough you can see secure FTP traffic is
started so we're actually going in over
that protocol same sort of drill downs
here drill down by user type of
operation file name shares projects by
client whatever it is you're interested
in looking at you can grab that
information looks like it finished right
before I started recording the analytic
so that's complete but that is how you
set up FTP and secure FTP on a share
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
