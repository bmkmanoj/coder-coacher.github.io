re-execute the same sequel statement and
share the sequel statement by the use of
what we would call bind variables now if
we take things to use bind variables
you'll notice that we jump to see the
performance of the application another
order of magnitude to over 30,000
transactions a second now bearing in
mind we came from 300 transactions a
second this is a big game we have
increased the performance we haven't
changed the hardware we haven't changed
the licensing model the only thing we've
changed is how the application logic is
sending down the code okay so by use of
bind variables and being able to reuse
each other's cursors and execution plans
we have jumped another order of
magnitude other things to note when
doing these sort of things is that we've
actually changed the application to put
little markers which is what we would
call buy bind variables in the sequel
statement as a result we can reuse the
sequel statement or share the sequel
statement and in many cases we deal with
people saying well we - you think it's
that important to use bind variables or
it's slowing down my programmer
productivity well you may be slowing
down your program of productivity and
that's because you're having to go to
retrofit an application that wasn't
structured correctly from the beginning
and the programmer wasn't told to use
buy-in variables always never even
educated in the use of them and now we
were trying to defend the undefendable
and using silly arguments one of the
other issues is if you use a screen
scraping application and don't use bind
variables you leave yourself way open
for security implications
what happens if somebody typed into
those fields inside the screen scraping
application the right series of escape
sequences commas escapes such that they
could embed the sequel clause or one
equals one if they could do that
that means potentially this webform
could return all rows in the table that
you want him to look at
you've now let yourself open to what we
would call sequel injection attacks and
so one of the safest ways to write on
when you're doing a web facing or a
customer facing or an online application
to protect yourself from security
implications is to write it using bind
variables from the beginning again this
is something that the architects or the
development managers need to specify
before the programmers start writing
code this cannot be emphasized enough
because to retrofit it is always
difficult it's embarrassing and it's
best avoided altogether just do it right
from the beginning so let's go back and
start changing the application to start
using bind variables and I have a tab
here and we'll just basically apply that
and you will notice a dramatic change in
the performance profile of the
application you'll notice we as we
transition the cursor modeler there's a
dip in performance and that's normal so
nothing to worry about that but you can
now see now that we're using shared
sequel and by variables in every metric
that we have everything is improving you
can see we're now meeting our
performance target as we're now up over
30,000 sequel statements per second the
response time is now so rapid it's
barely forming a graph in fact you can
see it's two milliseconds and remember
we were at about 230 milliseconds when
we started when we were logging on and
off if you actually look at the database
profile we're running with no
contention next to no contention at all
down here it's all running on the cpu
and because we're actually not going
through the process of repassing the
sequel statements and creating curses
we've saved some code paths so we're
actually doing less code paths and still
the code paths the majority of it is in
user space but the big gain is to be
seen in the real world metric which is
the response time and the throughput
