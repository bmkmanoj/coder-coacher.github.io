demo on how to administer and deploy out
a new feature that we have an enterprise
one called the related information
application framework
now what this related information
framework allows you to do is to embed
external web content directly in line
with Enterprise one applications so
we're gonna walk through a very simple
use case today
where we're gonna go take one of the
enterprise 1 applications a simple one
called address book revisions and the
idea is for all the customers in this
system I would like to be able to
display a map to their location when I'm
looking at their customer information
now there's going to be some information
I need from this application prior to
setup most importantly I need to know
the form name of the application so I'm
gonna go ahead and click the about
button on the top right hand corner of
the application gives me information
about it and what I'm looking at is the
form name of the application so I can
see in this case it's W 0 1 0 1 2 a I'm
gonna go ahead and note that down and
use that for a later setup exercise so
now I need to go over to the application
that actually identifies which
applications have related information
associated with them so I go to
Enterprise 1 menus and our prize 1
lifecycle tools system administration
tools related information administration
and you can see there's an application
for related information administration
what I'm going to need to do is add a
new record into this application so that
it can tell that the route address book
needs to have related information some
of the information you're going to need
is which environment is this running
over the key for the related information
for web content is a generic URL set up
which users will actually be able to see
this map it will show in the form of a
tab within the related information and
then give it the form that you're gonna
be running against this was the WL 101 2
way that I noted earlier you wanted to
you could set it up for a specific
version and this time we're going to do
this case we're going to be very simple
and just show it for all versions of
that application the other thing we're
going to do is allow this user the
ability to create and add new tabs of
information within the related
information
now with that user can either just show
it to that user only so nobody else is
it's visible to nobody else they could
set it up to publish out to a predefined
distribution list or publication lists
made up of users and
roles within the system and if you'll
put a little more governance on it you
can actually require approval by an
administrator before other users and
roles can see that content once again in
this case we're just gonna be simple and
show how it can be published out to
myself once I've added this information
very simple information I just hit save
you can see I went back to the the list
and I now have a record for that address
book revisions applications and I could
just toggle back to address book
revisions you can see in this case I now
have a new tab that I can drag up to
manage my related information I'm gonna
go ahead and hit the green button to
create a tab I'm gonna say this is a map
I mapped to the customer location for
the text when it's toggled over and then
I'm gonna type in a URL this is
something you will have to get from the
web content you're going for as I
mentioned before the use case that we
said is that we only want this to show
up when a user is a customer type so we
do have a field here that says when to
define and display the generic URL and I
have a nice interactive capabilities to
select Anki capture come up and collect
on the fields so in this case you can
see it's turned to a green I'm gonna
stop my key capture and what that says
is only when search type is equal to C
well this map be displayed now the next
thing we want to do is contextually link
out the information from the application
to the map by passing parameters in and
you can do that from any form field in
the application I'm gonna go ahead and
collect over it click overwrite
parameters and what it did was go out
and parse out the URL that I had typed
in that URL had a number of different
parameters that can be passed into it
one of them was this value of Q which is
the Google representation of the address
that you're going to now I can
dynamically override that just by
opening up the value and hitting map to
and then it allows me to go up into the
application and pick the field that I
want to map it to so I'm going to the
mailing tab and I just very simply
select on the postal code and you can
see that everything turns in orange adds
a value to the queue and then also you
can see it rendered down in the URL very
simple I go ahead and hit the Save
button and you can see at this point in
time the map will be rent
with a direct location out to that
postal code so very nice simple solution
to be able to embed really any type of
external web content as long as you have
a URL and you have authority to set up
the application so that was a quick
run-through on how to set it up thanks
for your time and I hope you can use
this feature in your own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
