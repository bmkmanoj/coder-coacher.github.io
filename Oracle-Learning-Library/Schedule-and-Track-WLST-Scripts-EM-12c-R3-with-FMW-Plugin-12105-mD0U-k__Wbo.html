welcome to the Oracle Enterprise Manager
Cloud Control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I will show you how you
can schedule and track the execution of
W LST scripts from Oracle Enterprise
Manager 12c as you probably already know
wls T stands for weblogic scripting tool
and is a command-line scripting
environment used by administrators to
create manage and monitor weblogic
domains beginning with Oracle Enterprise
Manager cloud control 12c release 3 and
the fusion middleware plug-in released
12 105 a predefined job named the view
LST script is available from the cloud
control console to access this out of
box job type we can navigate to the
enterprise menu jobs submenu and then
library on the job library page we can
see a list of all jobs currently in the
library to which we have access looks
like we have access to several jobs
already jobs spanning w LST scripts
fusion middleware process control
operations as well as some OS commands
for the purposes of this demonstration
we will create a new w LST script job
that creates a JDBC data source in an
existing WebLogic domain target to
create this new job we can access the
create library job drop down menu select
w LST script and click go we will name
the job create data source and accept
the default target type selection of
WebLogic domain since our w LST script
makes a configuration change to the
domain if our w LST script did not
change the domains configuration but
rather only obtain performance data on a
managed server we could have selected
the weblogic server target type so now
we must select the WebLogic domain
target where we want to create the data
source
if necessary we could select multiple
domains in which to create a data source
but for our purposes we just need to
create the data source in a single
domain now we can navigate to the
parameters page here we can choose to
copy the entire wls t script in the text
field or we can choose to point to the
python file that already exists at the
destination for our purposes we already
have the python script on the
administration server host machine of
our domain so we will point the job to
that file on the remote machine w LST
jvm options or additional parameters
could also be specified for this job
however for our script no further
customization is needed in order for
enterprise manager to execute this
remote script a local management agent
must be installed and running on the
administration server host machine
operating system credentials for that
host must be provided in those
credentials must have execute permission
on the script in addition weblogic
administration credentials must also be
provided in order for the management
agent to connect to the administration
server we already have preferred
credentials configured for this
enterprise manager administrator so we
can continue on leveraging such
preferred credentials is beneficial as
we do not need a hard code the domain
credentials in our w LST scripts as with
any job we can choose to submit the task
immediately or at a later point in time
for our purposes we will schedule the
job to run immediately whenever the job
is submitted we can grant other
enterprise manager administrators access
to this job if we like by default
administrators have view access to the
job
as the owner of this job we can choose
to receive email notifications on the
status of the job this is quite useful
because if any problems occur with a job
we can immediately be aware of them
returning to the job library we can now
see this newly created w LST job and
whenever necessary we can select it and
submit it in order to create the JDBC
data source let's do that now since we
just created the job in the library no
further modifications are required to
the job so we will just submit the
operation now a confirmation message
appears providing direct access to the
successfully submitted job to track
progress of this job will drill down
into it looks like the job already ran
successfully and the JDBC data source
has been created in our domain so that
concludes this demonstration thanks for
watching how to use Oracle Enterprise
Manager cloud control 12c for scheduling
and tracking WL st script jobs
