dying DNS training session after
completing this lesson you should be
able to describe the basic OCI DNS
services available on Oracle cloud
infrastructure you should also be able
to configure DNS zone within intendancy
the die network which has managed DNS
email to make the delivery internet
guide is deployed on top of a global
network consisting of 20 existing
facilities and connectivity of a mix of
tier 1 internets of service providers
the network has been split in the two
diverse constellations to provide active
active failover between these
constellations in the event of
catastrophic failure within each
constellation DNS traffic is distributed
between multiple data centers providing
a global active active load balancing
using an ending cast routing technique
queries via any quest technique allow
the fastest of the entire network to
answer the query this network allows OCI
dns to offer its customers an
industry-leading level of service and
reliability the network continues to
grow and add more points of presence
this results in a spirit superior
end-user experience connecting to OCI by
configuring OCI dns enterprise and
business customers can connect their DNS
queries to various kinds of assets such
as OCI compute as well as third-party
other cloud assets and private assets
operators can manage their own DNS
records for both cloud and non cloud
resources osei dns is used when zones
need to be exposed to the internet for
resolution domains and zones can either
be both OCR environment as well as in
the enterprise dns needs to be handled
across multiple resources
Dyan can also act either as the primary
or secondary DNS and follows DNS
specifications carefully and by the
appropriate RFC whenever possible
the OCI DNS solutions offer a complete
set of functions for zone management
within the universe user interface it's
possible to create zones within the
tenancy zones or tenancy wide and as
long along with I am OCI DNS crosses all
the regions so if we create his own
it'll be in all your regions users can
also manage records from those from the
consoles so basically all record
management can be done through these TNS
zones and its own editor is also
impossible to import complete zones via
the host ID NS console it's also a but
we are also able to set up OCA DNS as a
secondary and facilitate zone transfers
from primary DNS server OCS DNS support
OCI DNS supports zone transfers via s
axfr full or high xfr incremental zone
transfers posea dns keeps track of all
the DNS queries against the service both
at the zone level in total and it keeps
metrics and that's how usage for the DNS
server is charged DNS service is charged
FCI DNS supports all the standards and
major record types as seen in here ocid
DNS via dying can also register domain
names record types are the basic a
quad-a and cname records
these are TTL defaults to one our NS
records are used to list all of the
authoritative name servers for your
domain or subdomain by default any new
primary zone in the host ID and that's
will automatically create NS records at
the apex of the zone for your own sign
name servers OCI DNS is capable of
adding Heather had NS records at the
apex of the zone if you're using
multiple DNS providers such as the
scenario of OCI DNS is the primary and
another provider is secondary they also
support MX records which are used to
find the mail server accepting an email
for the domain the mail exchanger record
should be a fully qualified domain name
MX records should not point to the C
name or IP addresses some emails that
systems have trouble handling these or
the spam detection
PTR records our pointer records are used
for reverse mapping and IP address to a
hostname which is a basically the
opposite of an a record and this forward
mapping of a host name to an IP address
PTR records pointer records are found in
reverse DNS zones such as in tattered
are above for ipv4 and ipv6 are before
v6 the start of authority record is
automatically created by host IDNs when
you create a zone it specifies the
authoritative information about the DNS
zone including the primary name server
the email of the domain admin and the
domain serial number and several timers
relating to refreshing his own a server
record allows administrators to use
several servers for a single domain this
is useful for load balancing and backup
scenarios this also gets used quite
heavily with Microsoft domain services
text records are used to hold
descriptive human readable text may also
include non human readable content for
specific uses it's commonly used text
records are commonly used to do sender
policy framework records or domain key
records that required you know non human
readable stuff in there there's also a
special type of record alias this is a
handy record which dying implements
which is you know they're increasing
people are creasing moving their
applications and cloud services and cos
and see DNS and then go throughout the
traffic to name resources so for example
like you know you know ec2 - 53 141 -
uswest at one or whatever they need to
route - names like that
so the DNS name of a cloud computing
since rather than its IP address so he
takes on increasing importance
unfortunately associating a name
resource with the root or apex of a DNS
zone can lead to integration challenges
with third party systems host guys alias
record type helps enable the Association
for the name resource from the root of
their zones without introducing
integration issues with other DNS
systems or any additional overhead the
rest of the normal types of records are
dying also supports our DHT IDE DNS key
you know SSH FP all these types of
records they're all able to be supported
denied
but there they still have to instrument
those records for use in our console
when Dyne merged its capabilities with o
CI o CI inherited all the dyeing
capabilities it's the same network
currently a subset of dyeing
capabilities are exposed to row CI DNS
in the console and through the API
there's a rapid progression towards
enabling all the advanced features of
dyeing in on OC IDNs this gives oracle
cloud infrastructure users direct access
to dyn's network
there's also integration with billing
and metering there's no separate bill
for using OCI dns service limits are
also enforced by OC I along with API
rate limiting OC high constable
integration is is complete in its
initial phase and general API SDK and
terraform capabilities is being built
out for o CI DNS as well the OCI dns
initial page is found under
networking under dns this is the initial
dns owns tab from here existing zones
can either be managed or new zones can
be created phones can be created from
scratch or from a zone file existing
zones can either be deleted or refer to
two prior States so his own Center
managed here have a history of
configuration that OCI DNS is
maintaining for you adding a zone as a
matter of selecting then ad selecting
the ad zone button and selecting a name
so that you're adding should be owned or
controlled by you or the name should be
unregistered a zone file can be used to
create a zone this must be in the RFC
1035 format which is basically exported
by bind so in creation takes a short
period of time and the domain is after
that to appear time the domain is
immediately available for editing this
is also where the decision is made to
initially create the zone as a primary
or secondary zone once the zone is
created records can be added or viewed
in the DNS own detailed page if a record
is selected it can be edited certain
records will automatically be locked
like NS and SOA records
these can be unlocked and relock from
here as well unlock records can be
edited straight away each record type
will have a different type of edit
dialog box once the edits are made they
will be unpublished in order to push
them everywhere throughout the entire
dyeing network you would select the
state publish and apply and convergence
happens generally in about one minute or
less the OCI DNS feature is bringing a
feature that allows for a private pool
of IP addresses to be mapped to a
specific customer this makes it possible
to not only get a completely random IP
when a new instance is created or an
instance is terminated and recreated
this capability also helps to keep
record editing a little less problematic
as records in OCI dns will at least be
pointing to a customer owned IP if the
instance is terminated another
capability of OCI dns is the vanity name
server where the forward and reverse
names for customer hosted DNS name
servers can be customized this makes it
look like the customers running their
own authoritative name server for their
zones Oracle OCI DNS is leveraging Dyne
systems and network as is Titan is
established industry-leading solution
that has been around for over 10 years
and has thousands of large customers
some of the larger customers have very
large recognition DNS load those high
DNS easily can easily provide name
services for other cloud providers in
third party or on-premise assets the
performance of this network is very good
propagation times for changes in the sub
1 minute category a unique feature of
OCI DNS it can function either as a
primary or secondary DNS unlike some of
the competitive solutions so it can be
it's actually comes in very handy
because a lot of the DNS scenarios are
mixed the DDoS protection is built right
into the or any of the records and zones
that are hosted by OCI DNS and OCAD
Anais is one of the most standards
compliant DNS platform out there which
adheres to the relevant RFC's as closely
and as inter opera
as possible ocid ness is designed to
play nice with everyone in this lesson
we went over the OCI dns service so on
the OCI is dynamic dns service features
and learned about how to configure
unmanaged notice the i dns zone from
here you can go into a tenancy and try
the service out for yourself simply go
into networking select TNS and created
his own and tests it out for you for
yourself thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
