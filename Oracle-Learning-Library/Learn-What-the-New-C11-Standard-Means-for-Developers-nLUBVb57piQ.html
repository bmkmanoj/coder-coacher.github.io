my name is Dargo and I work in the Salar
studio team two performance analysis
today I'm joined by Steve damage our C++
project lead and also the chair of the
u.s. C++ committee thank you joining
misty I'm happy to be here so we've got
a new c-class plus standard the 2011
standard the previous standard was 2003
that's right
so Pete um something about the process
of getting from that previous standard
to this new one so after the 2003
standard there were a lot of features
that people have been thinking about
would be interesting to put into the C++
language at some point you have to
decide what we have is good enough to
publish and it had been five years since
the previous standard the C++ 2003
standard was basically fixing bugs in
the original there were things that were
improperly specified specifications
conflicted some things just weren't
specified at all so that took care of
those problems the meantime everybody
had his own favorite list of features
that he'd like to see in the language so
we spent some time working on them some
of these features were quite elaborate
and in the end there was some time to
get them in even to the C++ 11 standard
some things just it requires a large
number of people to agree on a lot of
details part of the problem of
introducing a new feature in languages
how does it interact with existing
features and those are the major
problems that have to be solved it's
easy to come up with a bright idea that
they can't work with the rest of the
languages which are T right so basically
you've got to figure out how to
incorporate new IDE new features new
concepts into the language without
breaking the stuff that's already there
yes and in particular put it in a way
that it's can be taught and explained
and understood without a lot of
surprises Brussels if you can find
future feature a works b2b works use
them together and something strange
happens that's not good
so what's gone into the new standard is
it if there's substantial changes or
minor changes yes there's substantial
changes there also some small changes as
well the new standard just to look at
the document as a crowd
only twice as long as the two very
stinky the runtime library all of the
things that make the language easier and
more fun to use it's about three times
the size okay this big I was trying to
think of how to characterize what's new
the problem is with all so many new
features it's hard to pick out just a
few to talk about in a short talk for
comparison about Scott Myers who
lectures and teaches and writes books
about C++ has a five-day course
explaining what's me right I have a
two-hour talk that I give them what's
new that's only a fraction yes so we
probably won't get into many detail
today yes okay so but other only top
level highlights you can give there's a
couple of major new ideas in C++ 11 one
is references to our values and our
value is just a value as opposed to an
object right okay this was not
previously allowed but it's a powerful
new idea because it enables you to do
things like move objects without having
extra copies yeah so this was introduced
partly to give efficiency but it also
enables some new ways to program another
major feature is lambda expressions
which exist in some other modern
languages actually some old languages as
well lambda can be thought of as an
on-the-fly function before you don't
have to go through all the overhead and
boilerplate of making a function and
being able to call it the land they can
carry its own data along with it like a
function object and traditional C++ so
this enables new styles of programming
as well the number expressions can you
give me a simple example of where you
might use a lambda well let's consider
the standard sort function okay which
Kate's a comparison function as one of
his arguments right well unless you want
to use something that's already built in
for comparison you have to write a
special function
give it a name make sure it doesn't
conflict with any other names and then
call that fukk in the past that function
into the sort function using a lambda
expression you can just write the
function in place using special syntax
and you're only using it once in this
one context it doesn't even they in fact
with us
so does that give you any other
advantages and just kind of dumping a
function into it
yes it does a lambda cannon is when
declared inside a function can inherit
in a sense the local variables of that
function without the dang explicit
parameters so this gives what's called
in computer science a closure where this
function since is passed along to
another function can be called in the
context where the context of the calling
function is still available something
that possible otherwise does the new
standard change my existing code that's
a very good question almost entirely its
new features new things you could do
that you couldn't do before essentially
all of standard C++ code 3 is still
valid C++ 11 the one exception is
keyword Auto has been repurposed but can
I mix a three and eleven code otherwise
let's look at this from two standpoints
one source code the other object code
right so for the source code in C++ 11
is effectively appear superset your a
code assuming it was valid C++ of three
should still compile now in the real end
through this the same result yeah in the
real world people come to rely on
non-standard pieces of compilers or bugs
in the compiler that Obama instead of
the code to be accepted and with any C++
11 compiler you might find that some of
the seams have been tightened up a bit
and maybe your code compile it's not
because it's C++ 11 is because the
compiler has got everything right it's
certainly true for our composite okay
secondly object code if I have some old
binaries that I build with say the
previous compiler having compiled some
C++ 11 code and then they come together
that will depend on the compiler
our compiler the answer is known that
the recompile code the reason is that
the ABI that is to say the way binary
code is generated by the compiler that
ebia was not adequately C++ 11 and we
kept it would have to make some changes
do you have any features in the language
that you think programmers will leap
that's just what I've been waiting for
ah well let's go back to the first
question about how something gets into
the standard okay first of all somebody
has to feel passionately enough about
this feature to walk it through email
discussions and face-to-face meetings
over a period at sometimes several years
okay swayed everybody else on the
committee that this is a really good
idea okay that's how it gets into the
standard so this is this means that this
feature is considered it by at least
some group with people to be important
and it's useful so this is pretty much
true of everything that's new so for
anybody who reads through a list of new
features is going to find several it'll
say oh and so glad that's there I'm
going to start using it immediately but
somebody else would have a different set
of features if they like okay so there's
tons in that for if there's a lot of
tons of stuff in there something to
please everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
