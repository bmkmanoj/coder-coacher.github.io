to show you how to in a replication
scenario perform a failover and failback
during the disaster recovery I'm gonna
simulate this on my two systems so to
set up the systems I'm doing this all
using the SMB protocol so I have two
different systems ones IP is 1080 54 104
it's a 71 20 and this is a box I have
another one whose IP is 1080 54 182 and
it's the 7120 B box and I'm gonna
simulate it using this project called a
files and inside of it I have a single
file system called a rep one I have set
up a replication job here for this
project it's updating some scheduled
basis every half hour updates I so you
can see here at the last time it synched
was a little bit ago and then over on
the remote side we can see under
projects and replicas click replicas
you'll see here's the 7120 a a files
project which is sitting over here as a
replica so it's replicating and then
from the client side I have this a rep
one file system you can see it's mounted
over 1080 54 104 and I have a single
file in it called f1 so now what we'll
do is we'll simulate a disaster so in
this case the clients get disconnected
so I will disconnect him so he no longer
sees the storage and then we will go
back over to the production side and we
will disable replication because it's no
longer working because we're pretending
the power went out or maybe the whole
box melted something happened on the you
know some user are most likely and the
production side is no longer syncing but
we did have a sync the tempo a while
back so
that data next step is we'll go to our
dr site and here we'll go to the
replicas we'll go to this replicated a
files project and we'll go to the
replication tab for it and one of the
options you have is this right here so
I'll turn around
this will reverse replication so what
this will do and if I click it the first
thing is going to do is they give me a
what project do you want for this
project you're going to reverse and
we'll call the exact same file and
project name eight files and it's going
to tell us that it's gonna disable
replication and it's gonna move the
contents of this into a a new local
project on this dr box so it's going to
export everything out of this and then
it's also going to set up a replication
job as well so I'll show you that here
so now under I'm still on the dr side
1080 54 182 but now if i look under the
local projects
I can see a files a rep one is now here
and it's exported I consequently if I go
over to the replica side I click it
there as well you'll notice the a files
is no longer in there so now what I
could do is go to my client on the dr
side and i can map this same file system
and sure enough it's now mapped over the
new at the dr site i see there's a file
i can go take something we we work on
this for a while you know well our dr
site is getting unfledged
so let's do some work here add some
files add some data on the on the remote
side and now let's say the dr production
side is now back up and going and so we
no longer have a failure so now we're
ready to fail back over and one of the
first things we would do is come over
here to on the dr side to this project
and the first thing you'll notice is if
I go into replication for the project
itself they'll are there's already a job
in here to replicate the data back to a
and it only replicates back the changed
amount of data not all the existing data
so you can see there is some change data
and I want to sync it so we're going to
update that now and the thing you'll
notice is on the a side when it comes
back up it doesn't really know what's
happened as far as it knows a files is
still here you know it doesn't know so
you you could have a scenario you want
to make sure you don't have anybody
mounted when you bring the site back up
most likely in a real disaster you
wouldn't but you what you would want to
make sure that so now you come back over
here we will sync the data and so now
it's replicating a files it's gonna send
that 24 megabytes of data I've written
on the DL site and so let's watch that
for a minute here it's beginning a sixty
percent just take a minute here to
finish that and I can show you back on
the a side now you'll notice this things
have changed over here so first off the
AIF files share is now gone that's
because this project was emptied because
when I sent the replicas over we told
the 8 bucks hey we've taken over now and
you are no longer in charge of this fund
this project
I am and so now it's changed it into a
replica and so it's no longer being
exported out of this box and you can see
it's finished replicating the files so
now we have all the data is up to date
on our system so typically what you do
in the D are scenarios we did you know
hit sync one more time
now actually we would disconnect our
clients so we'd have all our D our
clients disconnect them we would then go
back to the D our box and I would hit
sync and update it one more time to make
sure we got all the data over there in
our case we know nothing's changed so we
won't and then I will disable
replication from the D our back to
production because it's all up to sync
so now I've disabled that and now I'll
go back over to the remote side and the
before I reverse replication again from
a back to B I need to get rid of this
empty project so the a files that
project is still there but there's
nothing in it and we're going to restore
from the replicas so I will delete this
empty project and safe to do there's
nothing there there's no file systems
there so I deleted the a files and go
back to the replicas and we'll open this
guy up I've got a replication and you
see he had all the data there like I
said in our case the only data actually
got replicated was the new that new file
I wrote the existing data it didn't it
was still here because we didn't
actually lose the array we just lost
power
so we're simulating and so we'll say
reverse replication and this means we're
gonna send it back to B so the same
exact thing we'll name the project eight
files you forget that right I'll say
okay it's just gonna tell us if it's
doing the same exact thing
and sure enough now a files is now
exported out of the 1084 104 the a box
so it's back up and going but now you
can see it's bigger because now it has
the new file that was written over on
the D our site now I can go back to all
my clients and have them reconnect and
sure enough there are both files ready
to mount and now we can create new files
and do the work we were doing before so
I can open these files up edit them and
production is back to normal the only
thing left to do at this point is now
we're back at production we want to do
one last thing and that's reset up our
replication back to B so we go back in
and create our schedule again to
whatever we want it to be hit apply and
now we've updated that one file you know
we should do to make it a little more
meaningful to copy something else
it will copy this folder back to the
e-rep paste so we pasted that in to the
share we'll go back and say let's sync
up a back to B so we began replicating a
files back to the B appliance back to
our D our sites
oh I already finished I missed it I said
yep sure enough the files are over there
now and that's a little bit bigger and I
we have 25 megabytes I sent another
megabyte of data but that is a nutshell
simulated disaster recovery for SMB
