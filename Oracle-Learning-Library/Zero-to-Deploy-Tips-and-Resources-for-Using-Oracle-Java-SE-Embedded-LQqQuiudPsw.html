Oracle in the java SE embedded theme
this is the standard safe harbor
statement so 0 to deploy I'm going to
assume that you are still fairly new to
java embedded and maybe also fairly new
to running java on embedded systems so
that's the red 0 of course in this
picture and i'm going to try to get you
to a point where you know you can you
will know all the steps to take to start
with an embedded card how to put linux
on it and then how to java on it and
then to run your embedded application
and by the way please feel free to you
know interrupt at any time and ask
questions you know it's above session
after all so so the program agenda so
it's organized according to what would
be the logical steps to get you up and
running from point 0 to the point where
you are you know fully deployed and
running java see embedded on an embedded
system there is a wide variety of
embedded systems of course and generally
speaking and but the good news is that
the preparation process for getting
started generally speaking is it's
mostly the same for for these different
systems there's some some little things
to you know take take into account where
where things are different a and then
i'm going to also try to include a demo
and then after that we can have a
discussion but at any time during the
session itself you can also you know
interrupt and ask questions please feel
free to do so
so let me start with the quick
introduction to Java as CM that it what
is the motivation for it the motivation
for this what you may have heard before
during this conference which is the
internet of things where you know
there's lots of devices everywhere lots
of systems they are all interacting
they're all in network connected so it's
it's a whole ecosystems and embedded
devices play an increasingly important
role in this ecosystem these are
typically devices at the edge as they
say because they are like at the
terminal ends in this hierarchy or
systems often times you know produce
producing massive amounts of data but
they can also serve as you know systems
the data on servers or maybe you know
persists information the key point here
is that these embedded devices are
extremely diverse you know if all kinds
of processors all kinds of operating
systems and luckily we have Java because
Java has the you know ability to run on
all these different devices if we have a
JVM for them and then applications can
just migrate and be totally portable
across different embedded systems so
Java as he embedded is really java SE
optimized for embedded use that is
really what it is so Java Sea embedded
is optimized from relatives but I'm
optimized for umbrella Tucson typically
high and high and embedded devices when
you think of Java embedded in the you
know in the let's say five six years ago
you would think about probably Java ME
but we've seen an opportunity to move
java also to higher end devices using
java SE and we just basically optimized
it in a way so that it would run
optimally on
on hi aunt embedded devices and some of
the typical things we've done to
accomplish that task is you know memory
optimizations we have removed some of
the optional components you know java SE
has various optional components
components that are not needed as per
the specification they give value to you
know some developers but for embedded
use cases typically these components are
not not always needed so those are the
types of components that we basically
got got rid of there are also runtime
optimizations where we you know optimize
the bytecode interpreter we like you
know it has to understand the new
instruction set because you know we
built implementations for arm for Power
PC until then we had never done that so
that's that's where the optimizations
come in and also you know the jet
compilers which also generate native
code those have been also you know
customized to to be able to run an
embedded system and then there is an
increasing focus on multi-core because
you know speed has hit a plateau and
where true boot is important at some
point you have to actually introduce
parallelism which can be done through
much for multi-core just to give you a
quick introduction on some of the
example devices we have some of the
typical use cases java embed it is
increasingly being deployed as i said in
the high end systems things like you
know power of a point of sales terminals
digital printers smart metering etc etc
so these are some of the examples so
let's now move on to the several steps
that need to be taken to actually get up
and running with java SE embedded on an
embedded system obviously you will need
first to obtain hardware
and fortunately there is a wide variety
of hardware affordable about it words
that can be can be obtained I provided a
link here to do a website that mentions
39 Linux friendly embedded warts and
products some of the examples of the
boards are the rest the Raspberry Pi
beagleboard pandaboard who's Barry board
there is a whole list of them you will
find them in this in this resource that
that I that I provided there's also
embedded products where you know it's
not the board but it's it's the board
plus the encasing so so to speak and
examples here are you know cotton candy
the Q boxplot computers for example
Marvel created the design for a plot
computer they themselves don't actually
manufacture these systems but they
license the design to those who want to
implement the design and you know come
up with this block block computers an
example this is a global scale where
there where Shiva blocks so I'm going to
be focusing mostly on the Raspberry Pi
board for this presentation a lot of
what I'm going to be mentioning is very
much applicable also to other boards and
it's just easier to just you know give
an example through through through one
board because you know this obviously
not sufficient time to cover several I
have an embedded board here a Raspberry
Pi board which is the size of a credit
card as you can see and I just started
it up and i have connected to it here an
SD card which has the operating system i
connect it to it as well here a USB
stick which carry some of the software
that will be showing and then also i
have here a USB dongle for
a wireless keyboard and mouse still on
Oh No okay I think we are on again all
right so this is an example of of the
Raspberry Pi board detail view I just
showed it to you but you know here are
the details so it's essentially you know
an armed recess of a v6 processor that
has seven that runs at seven on
megahertz the board has 256 megabytes in
RAM and the price is actually quite
attractive it's $35 plus shipping there
are two models there is a model in a
model b b is the latest one that is that
is currently shipping and that is also
the one that i just showed you and that
is being shown here as well so where can
you get them well there's various
vendors you could easily find those
vendors if you you know google for it i
can mention a few there is for example
premier anel element14 there is RS
Components and there are many more and
what i heard is you can get them also on
ebay although i'm not sure if that's
going to be much better in terms of
price so here is a top view of the
Raspberry Pi with some of the peripheral
connections there is an hdmi connection
for high-resolution digital quality TV
you can you know connect your monitor to
it and you know get a just pure full HD
TV quality display there are two USB
ports there is an SD card slot that I
just showed you at that's an i2c bus and
it runs at 3.5 wat at five falls through
a mini USB okay so of course first you
need to download the system so we have
corporate at the hardware now and now
we're going to the you know getting the
OS on it
this is why you would typically start
there is a special website the rest at
Raspberry Pi dog org and you go to the
download section and there are several
images that you can try the one that i
have installed on this board here is the
debian wheezy which is from august the
eighth you would need to copy this image
after you download it to to an SD card
it's a fairly simple process and I
provided here a link where you can get
detailed instructions for that and then
it comes to interacting with the boards
as I said it you can connect an hdmi
monitor and an USB keyboard and a USB
mouse and that is typically how many
people would do it I guess this is you
know what we call ahead full
configuration where you have a screen
you have a keyboard any of a mouse and
it is perfectly fine for a lot of people
actually one note I need should make is
that if you don't connect the keyboard
and a mouse the system won't get with
the you know get to a full full boot so
you need to be you know aware of that
you can actually also use it as a as a
headless system if you connect a
keyboard and a mouse to it or what I
usually do is you know I connect a
wireless keyboard and mouse meaning that
you only you know connect a wireless
adapter in it and at that point the
system already thinks there is a
keyboard and a mouse and you can just
you know it'll it'll finish the booting
and you have essentially a you know
headless system if that's the kind of
use case you're pursuing so the next
steps are not that hard either there are
some you know in the standard distro you
know if you download the image and you
put your copy to your SD card you'll
notice there are you know a couple of
card petitions which I have indicated
here on the on the slide there's a boot
partition Linux root file partition
letting
to a partition and you might want to
resize some of them you know to suit
your needs and if you do that a good
tool for that would be cheaper dad so
you could just run it with pseudo
cheaper debt and you know make all the
necessary changes resizing zuv all these
partitions there is optional networking
setup I believe by default the system
comes with the dhcp you could configure
it to have you know static IP if that is
what you prefer and but it would you
know amount to change in a couple of
files not networking files another
approach this is what i usually do if i
want a fairly constant IP address if you
could do you know you could do a DHCP
reservation where essentially you map a
dhcp address to to the mac address of
the device now how do you find out what
the MAC addresses the mac address is you
can you know run ifconfig or a tool like
that and it will show you the mac
address and then you program that MAC
address in your in your router and you
make there in your router a DHCP
reservation for for this system and then
from then on with dhcp it'll have a
constant IP address as if you have
static you know I p so that covers that
next step is downloading and installing
java embedded this is a not hard eater
here's the downloads page from our
product website if you go there you'll
find several implementations you'll find
x86 implementations you'll find powerpc
you'll find arm obviously you'll want to
arm the arm version and the one that is
supported forearm v6 specifically so
okay and now time for a demo that I have
set up the demo has been put
this memory stick here it is a
proof-of-concept blood glucose level
meter and it tries to realistically show
and collect blood glucose the data
essentially all the software is there
except for the real sensor you know
which would need to take a blood sample
every now and then that is the part that
I simulate there is a threat running and
there is a model behind it and it it
basically does that basically what I
program is when the subject has meals
which is where the glucose will go up
and then at what points you know this
subject which you know could be a a
patient needs to take insulin to you
know get get to get the blood level the
glucose level down again so that's is
the in a nutshell what this application
does and I'm going to try to show it and
I've shut up okay now let's see if i can
get my this is the part that might be a
bit harder
ok so this black window is where I'm
talking to the to the rest to the
Raspberry Pi and I'm going to connect to
it I think I've set up the connections
correctly there's here's my router for
flat for private network one cable
connected to my laptop one cable
connected to the Raspberry Pi and I'm
going to see if I can ssh into the
system looks like it arm and I'm going
to say this is
hmm not sure maybe i mistyped the
password
ok so I'll try again
something has gone wrong with this
supplication I guess
okay let me try something else
strange
oh well I guess some this was working
before
yeah but that we had changed it actually
so that is you know we change it to root
and something else but yeah that is a
good point let me see here 1 i'll try
one last thing here
what's that
yeah okay let me let me try something
here yeah
Oh
well in any case this was working just a
few hours ago I'm not sure first up okay
be sure oh ok I'm guess I'm in all right
i'm not sure why it it must have been
timing out in something i'm not sure
what because normally it would go in
right away alright so we're in ccd demo
okay so what I'm going to do now is I'm
going to actually run this glucose meter
and I'm going to do that as follows a
couple of startup script here I have
startup scripts for different devices so
i'll have to just pick the one for this
raspberry pi
oh sorry I have there's something I need
to do it there so they'll set up
required first that I kind of overlooked
this will set up the environment for for
alarm systems and now I'm going to
here and I'm going to run the meter
right now so um
ok
so what it does is it starts an rmi
server you can interact with this meter
through rmi and this is a simple simple
server for example you could use it to
pull data you know glucose level data
that have been captured by the meter and
that have been stored in a database for
this database we use a Berkeley database
and so this this this is just running
right now in fact I've run it a few
times before and I could for example
look at the current last let's say 10
records in the database so here are the
last 10 records with you know glucose
level indicated here and also the access
times to get this information from the
database and this database is on this on
this memory stick so everything is there
the java the java application that runs
the meter as well as you know the
database that is discovering so this way
you can actually extract information
from the system across the network to
run the meter you you know there's a
there's a help prompt here that gives
you all the commands that that you can
provide to this meter and let's see if
we can connect now to this meter across
the network and i'm going to go now here
is this visible oh I think it's off the
screen a little bit the airline raise it
a bit okay
all right the environment has been set
up for him and then let's see which one
we're going to run here don't we're
going to now run a simple GUI that will
connect through our mi with with this
meter and we're going to run for that
this one
let's go back to this guy here as you
can see it has now added a diagnostic
message saying GUI window connected so
basically whenever a connection is made
it does a bit of logging here which is
this which is what this message is and
this is a simple GUI that you can use to
you know extract the information to make
and make it you know show it visually so
let's see if we can get a couple of data
so this is currently the last twenty
four entries in this in this berkeley
database and another thing i can do is
actually to animate it a little bit but
to do that I need to get the meter
running so I'm going to supply here to
command R which is running and now the
meter is running and if you go back here
now if all goes well you'll see actually
the GUI being updated as a new data
point is added all the time which is
which is currently set to force 24
seconds which of course is not realistic
in a you know in a reels in a real
scenario but for the purpose of you know
a demo this is perfectly fine i guess i
change it just now 22 so it should be a
little faster now okay so that's that's
that so i showed that you know i can
remotely connect to this glucose meter
there's some other interesting things
that can do with it as well let's close
the GUI now and let's see where i am oh
it switches space all the time
I'm not sure where my window is um
okay it should be here
alright so here's the ears that the
meter the other thing I wanted to do is
to show that you can also extract
diagnostic information from from this
from this meter because Java exposes JVM
interfaces several of them one is for
example for management and monitoring
another one is for you know what we call
the tools interface JVM TI and this is
useful for for example attaching a
profiler and then you can collect
information which which which could be
useful and what I'm going to show is to
attach what I have enabled here in this
in the script is management the
monitoring and so I'm going to see if I
can connect to it too with the
management and monitoring and interface
and see if I can you know extract useful
information so to that and I'm going to
try to connect to it it's obviously a
remote connection that I have so I'll
click this one the machine name the
remote machine name is called PI 1 and
I've set it up to communicate with port
9999 so and we are going to connect here
and as you can see this is a you know a
simple GUI that shows all kinds of
activities in the end of vm it's it this
this tool is called jconsole it's
available in average ATK and it allows a
remote connection to any any other
system that that that runs java and in
this case java on an embedded device and
you can see all kinds of interesting
information like for example the heap
memory usage how that changes over time
let me make the meter run oh it's all
its effect already running ok
here you can see no more threats classes
that are loaded cpu usage of several
tabs here you can get a vm summary what
is your vm etc so yeah with that i hope
you have given you a brief overview of
you know what you can do with embedded
devices how to get java one on them it's
it's fairly simple actually and you know
you can apply a wide variety of
applications you can do troubleshooting
things like that so with that if there
are any further questions
going once going twice well thank you
very much for your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
