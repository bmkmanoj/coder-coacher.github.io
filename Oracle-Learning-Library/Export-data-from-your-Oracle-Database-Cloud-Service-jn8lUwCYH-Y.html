data from the Oracle database cloud
service so let's start out from the my
services page there's various tabs the
overview tab tells me information that I
need for this exercise and that is the
service SFTP details so I'm going to
need several items from this one is SFTP
host yeah there's the port number and
I'm gonna need the user name so here we
have this username and go ahead and copy
that I want to point out to you for
instance one of the reasons you might
want to use SFTP is to conduct data
export so you can click on the data
export tab I've already Requested some
down exports here but I'll walk through
there again so you click on the export
data
and go ahead and make your selections
here whether you just want the data
structures or the data as well
click create data export and that'll
process for a bit so give that some time
and then while you're waiting on that
you need to have a FileZilla or a win
SCP File Transfer Protocol client setup
to go ahead and download the export from
your database cloud service ok so I went
ahead and pulled up my FileZilla FTP
client here remember I tell you you knew
that information so here's house I will
go back to the overview tab also shows
up in the email when you sign up for the
service some of this information but
when you're already in to service you
can just pick it up here from overview
tab so SFTP host gonna copy and paste
that here and then username again we're
gonna use this trial a32 so I can just
go ahead and copy and paste that here
okay so remember I reset my password in
the previous demo so I'm going to use
that reset password here important
number should be 22 in DD 22 so I'll
just type that in then we'll connect to
the DB service
password is case-sensitive this shows
you the remote side I'm connected to you
so this is my database cloud service and
over here is my local machine so what I
can do is I can go ahead and click on
the download folder here take this DMP
file that was exported from the cloud
service double click on that to initiate
the transfer take just a moment here you
can see the progress of that transfer
which is occurring right now I just have
it set to download to my desktop ok so
that finished successful transfers 1 and
here it is right here so did indeed
transfer to the DMP file from the Oracle
cloud service to my local directory
specifically a desktop and that's it
once you have your SFTP account user
setup you can export data you can also
import data from your local to the
database cloud service so let's recap
first locate service SFTP user account
details you can perform a data export
from your service then use the FTP
client and your SFTP account to download
your data export locally and please
remember to share the SFTP username and
password with designated administrators</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
