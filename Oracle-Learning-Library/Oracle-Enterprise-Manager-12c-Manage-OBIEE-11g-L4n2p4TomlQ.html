of the new features for the Oracle
business intelligence Enterprise Edition
management pack for Oracle Enterprise
Manager 12c and we'll start here on the
home page for the BI instance and the
home page is designed to give a quick
overview of the health and the
performance of our BI instance and we
can see that we'll have a section for
the status of our system components to
all the members of our BI instance we
have a graphical representation of the
response and the load of the system we
can also see if we've had any incidents
or configuration changes for this
instance over the last seven days we
have some key system metrics to show us
how the system is performing they
grouped unresponsiveness
load and reliability and down here at
the bottom we have a list of the failed
scheduler jobs for the last 24 hours
up here under the availability tab we
get some more information on the status
of the members in the components over bi
instance you can also do some process
control there are two types of reports
we can look at we have dashboard report
and schedule a report the dashboard
reports will show us things like two
failed dashboards in the last 24 hours
and we can see dashboard usage in the
last seven days as well as top
dashboards by resource usage in the last
seven days we can also see who of our
users have consumed the most resources
in the last seven days the second type
of reports are scheduled reports and
here we can see the jobs that have
failed in last 24 hours as well as the
scheduled jobs are coming up for
execution the configuration for this bi
instance is stored in the repository and
we can look at the configuration that's
currently associated with this bi
instance we can also look at all the
individual components that are member of
our instance the configuration can also
be looked at historically if you want to
see the configuration for for a certain
date for example we can also take
snapshots of our configuration and use
that for comparisons at a later time the
configuration can also be compared
between members
of a cluster or between members of one
instance to another instance for example
if you want to compare our test
environment to our production
environment now let's take a look at
some of the performance metrics so let's
go to this bi server and the performance
summary page
this is a customizable page where you
can build your own view of the metrics
you're interested in so if you click on
the metric pallet out here we get a list
of all the metrics and related metrics
available for this component so by
simply checking a checkbox here we can
add metrics to our page we can also drag
and drop metrics from here onto one of
the other charts if you want to
correlate two different metrics this
page can also be saved as a name chart
if when it access this page at a later
point in the future another new feature
available in this release is the log
file monitoring this feature can be used
to look for patterns in log files and we
can see an example here that looks at
the pattern error in the NQ server log
and once our thresholds are reached this
will generate an alert that can be used
to send out email notifications or you
can use Enterprise Managers rich set of
event and helpdesk connectors to do a
system to system integration let's end
this demonstration by taking a quick
look at two of the new target types
namely the Essbase server and the
Essbase application we'll start by
taking a quick look at the Essbase
server so the Essbase server homepage
looks similar to that we've seen before
of the BI instance and we can see
there's a general section as well as a
performance summary section showing the
response time and we can see the running
applications and unexist applications
for this server and we have the number
of incidents and configuration changes
here for the last seven days down at the
bottom of the page we have a list of the
Essbase applications for this server and
we can use the links here to drill down
into the Essbase application the Essbase
application home page
shows a similar summaries as well as a
list of the cubes in this application
and that concludes this demo thanks for
watching
