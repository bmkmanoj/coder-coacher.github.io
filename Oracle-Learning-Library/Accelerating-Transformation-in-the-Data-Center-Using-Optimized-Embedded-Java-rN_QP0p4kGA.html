to the embedded session focused on data
centers and the use of secure optimized
embedded Java in the data center my name
is Bill mAb chairman CEO of server G
where we have developed exciting a
disruptive new class of a data center
service saves up to 80% and power of
cooling and space you know back in 1996
I conceived and developed the world's
first underwater website for dr. Ballard
famous oceanographer and discovers a
Titanic it was very Jules Verne Ian
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea type of
stuff it was a real adventure and
allowed kids of all ages be part of the
adventure the excitement exploration
with with dr. Bob and it was an early
use of actual Java and Sun servers I
think that the java jdk 1.0 which had
had its name changed from oak to java
for the trademark conflicts came out the
first part January February of 96 and so
this expedition was two weeks long it
was a it was a special event and
adventure and exploration actually in
the Florida Keys with dr. Bob Ballard
and so anyway I just want to share this
it's a good example from device to data
center because a lot of what we're doing
with the streaming video from the device
is actually placed underwater you're ten
miles offshore in the bottom of the
ocean you know we had streaming to the
data center for architectural and
continuity reasons to minimize the risk
because it was a multi-million dollar
promotion so we streamed back to the
server farm actually in Plano and an h
rift the video onto the pages and paste
these the server itself on the bottom of
the ocean the Sun server went down would
still be able to stream the video and
keep it going because this is the
highest visibility event promotional
event that eds did each year at the time
so I had a blank check and just tell
basically did you know failure is not an
option
so a lot of a lot of first on this on
this adventure and I share it because it
always sparks the imagination you know
the the the media you know picked up on
it internationally and actually shot
four hours of underwater video from the
team I dissembled around the world of
highly technical specialized engineers
to the top engineers in the world that
also had the requirement they had to be
expert divers offshore divers to handle
the elements you know because we're
talking ten foot waves for visibility we
had sharks fire portal a strong currents
that could carry you out to see you
around the edge of the reef you know
into the abyss so going forward again
there are a lot a lot of worlds first it
was a Award winner
international award winner the global
information infrastructure award which
the USA Today coined is kind of the
Academy Awards of the Internet at that
time so don't going forward I've
actually got a video that and there's a
shot of a much younger bill that with
dr. Ballard wife there at the award
ceremonies in New York City but one of
the earliest so happens when the
earliest uses of Java yeah so it's it's
kind of cool very exciting but I've got
a video I'll share with everybody and
it's just three minutes again I shall
all the underwater videos you've seen
this in in this piece here he
co-produced it with a friend of mine a
States Felder he was vice president
CNET's at the time here in San Francisco
and it got picked up by the USA Today
cable channels Sci Fi Channel and others
so with that we'll go ahead and start
and hopefully the the audio will come
through
you'll hear the audio you see that
central hi I'm gia st. John and I'm
Richard Hart welcome to CNET central
this week students from around the world
are getting a chance to operate a
submarine by remote control best of all
they're able to see their results over
the Internet we're watching the
broadcast over the net right now thanks
to something called the Jason project
every year for seven years this
nonprofit group has sat a remote control
submarine to some exotic ocean location
and broadcast live from beneath the
water to classrooms around the globe
this year for the first time these
dramatic video images are being
broadcast live over the Internet 18
miles south of the Florida Keys and 60
feet beneath the sea the Jason project
is bringing together science technology
and the Internet in a way that's never
been done before our goal for this
year's Jason project is to teach
children about the sea
named after the legendary ancient
explorers Jason and the Argonauts the
project is using the worldwide web to
send its discoveries to students and web
servers around the world
the huge project is the inspiration of
the man who located the wreck of the
Titanic when I found the Titanic that
came home and there was 16 thousand
letters sitting on my desk and all of
them said the same thing how can I go
with you on an expedition and we thought
well using the same remote underwater
Rover that explored the Titanic and a US
nuclear submarine and a permanent
underwater Marine Laboratory the project
is producing a daily television to show
that show is moved by satellite to 27
sites around the world their students
and teachers are gathering to view the
expedition live and actually operate the
remote vehicle with a joystick through a
computer to satellite link the
exploration updates are also being fed
to the World Wide Web where students and
web surfers can access them live this is
also the world's first underwater
but perhaps the Jason projects most
remarkable achievement is the world's
first underwater website last Saturday a
team of divers hook fiber optic and
coaxial cables from a floating barge to
the underwater laboratory 60 feet below
the surface they then mounted a video
camera that streaming images to a
microwave tower on the barge and out to
the world you can see the images live on
the World Wide Web you know a couple of
years ago I was lucky enough to go along
on one okay so there's the video we'll
move on but couldn't get the idea you
know it's exciting early use of of
Technology and Java really at its best
leverage in leveraging the power of the
potentials technology for education for
telepresence tremendous implications for
telling education telemedicine and so on
so it's a real really again a very it
was a great adventure and one of the
earliest uses of Java and actually the
first in a code blue Java in contrast to
green job which we'll be talking about
here shortly what is green Java how do
you get dream Java so and you know going
going forward you know 17 years later
Java still at sea the latest issue of
the Java magazine features James Gosling
and his new project with liquid robotics
and some of the interesting things are
doing there including a entirely new
model using Java data as a service such
tremendous implications I think that's
going to be it's so early they don't
even have the analysts don't even have
projections for it but but the the job
at data as a service is huge market
potential you know if you look at one of
the biggest
sources of data perfusion of data we're
seeing a lot of its location-based data
that's being collected in addition to
video so anyway you know that was that
was kind of exciting us one to share
with everybody everybody always enjoys
seeing that over the years almost 17
years 17 years later now so heading from
um you know to a slightly different
direction not just connecting to the
data center but now actually heading
inside the data center itself that going
forward you know just to put a quick
frame of reference around this session
the sessions purpose has arrived
directly from the you know job-embedded
at JavaOne purpose statement found
online tailored this session so it's
this business focused content discussing
how java embedded can deliver value and
efficiency with a lot of the focus of
this session on value and efficiency as
well as to be you know in a secure
optimized environment and what that
really means and how do you achieve that
that can enable a new data center you
know Java data center business
strategies you know and so the session
goals if you look at the three main
session goals are to show the compelling
value of exploding data center market
talk a little bit about the exciting
global data center markets the whole
world goes online and servers and data
centers take over the world and then
show some of the benefits of leveraging
Java embedded job in the data center and
then hopefully along the way show such
showcase some of services thought
leadership in the industry as well so
just just a quick spot poll here how
many in the audience currently are using
Java embedded Java you consider using
yourself using embedded Java in the data
center okay well whether you raised your
hand or not you know I think that I
trust you'll find this session
interesting as well as informative so
going forward to deaf you know let's
we'll start with a
definition of embedded systems you know
the definition of embedded systems has
evolved over the years and what it means
you know back and you know the seventies
when I first got into computers
you know embedded you thought real time
constrained systems for process control
or DoD weapon systems and back in the
70s the DoD was actually the one driving
innovation and technology but here's
here's a great definition of it that I
believe I've got this actually off of a
Wikipedia and I probably should credit
them here on that hop to that but an
embedded system is some combination of
computer hardware and software either
fixed in capability or a programmable
that's specifically designed for
particular function so you think about
that a second it's some combination of
computer hardware and software and
that's a pretty broad definition but
that's what's happened isn't as far as
you know the the point of computing
computing you know as its capabilities
have grown you know with current
technology the computing power and
capacity has pushed further and further
to that to that point of you know the
being embedded where the system is
actually embedded it's not just
collecting the data but now actually
processing to be able to process the
data going forward
this was off the the website for job
embedded Java Java one you know and it
states that embedded is a generic term
and so examples of that or wide and you
know in growing only limited by the
imagination really and it really comes
down to anything that you need feigned
you know that you can put into the
digital blender and computers continue
to embed themselves ever deeper and
pervasive you know dairy aspect and
facet of our lives again be don't
limited by the imagination as we move
closer to an ambient
sensor embedded smart planet powered by
computers so exciting times you look how
far how far things have come so quick so
fast so far and the Internet of anything
anytime anywhere you know 1975 when I
first got into computers they were no
devices networked to the Internet didn't
did not exist of course ARPANET in 69
with the Vinton Cerf and others and then
eventually Scott Metcalfe for the
ethernet you know they were doing things
but really none to speak of
until you know really after the internet
was commercialized because you know in
95 before that time it was illegal to do
business over the over the Internet that
was actually commercialized by part of
the legislation by bora which is why he
thinks he looks at it as he invented the
internet because if the legislation he
passed it helped commercialize the
internet so going forward now I mean
look at the projections is this just
incredible it's so exciting anything and
everything you want to throw in the
digital blender you know what happens
when you take your you know processor
and you put your glasses in there and
throw in four GS and GPS and you know
you can emergency response standby you
know it's just it's endless the
permutations and combinations but as we
move from depending who you talk to you
50 billion to trillion
devices here here you know the next next
several years so the Internet of Things
is a popular way to put it but in some
ways I think that can be limiting and I
prefer to think of it as the Internet of
imagination you know in so kind of to
that point you know looking at the next
slide here
there's a lot of obviously a lot of
directions that we could go and discuss
with Java embedded and smart or smarter
energy to smart grid don't you know well
smart anything and you know I think but
nuns more significant with more impact
globally than inside the actual data
center itself so that's why the New York
Times has said that data centers have
become the new nerve centers of
businesses
they're very Paul's the very heartbeat
of business in society and talk about
innovation rich you know it's just very
exciting and so you know the data
centers have become kind of the the
twenty-first century you know digital
air conditioning and plumbing or you
know I guess in San Francisco would be
heating and and in plumbing but it's
huge global heavy liftin infrastructure
that we're talking about here and very
very pervasive and so it's kind of like
how to put one time like the the gold
rush you know the only people made money
in the gold rush for the people who sell
Levi's and pickaxes and so this is you
know the servers in the data centers and
in the data centers are kind of like the
the Levi's and pickaxes of the 21st
century don't matter what you're doing
what business you're in this cuts across
every company in every industry and
every geo globally you know it has
tremendous impact you're gonna need a
you know hope you know servers and a
whole lot of them to be successful in
data centers in your business so
whatever matter if you want to use
drilling for digital all money in for
digital go developing digital real
estate you know it's it's huge and very
exciting space consuming a lot of power
so in this session also we just
introducing the concept of green Java
embedded in the data center and so as we
go through go through this session you
know we'll give it a definition you'll
be able to determine which one you have
and if you don't have green Java how to
get it with the latest job embedded
tools from from Oracle you know by the
way this is a Treehugger eco Duke a
pitcher here who's who's not only
interested in the three P's of people
profit and planets but also a fourth P
that would like to introduce in this
session to each of you for consideration
that's performance which impacts all the
three above and it's often overlooked
and what is what does that really mean
so a little more on that later but first
a little more on the latest exciting
you know Intel and insights in the world
of data centers I think you'll you'll
find interesting so you look at the
global data set industry by 2015
there'll be 2 billion more people online
and it's amazing 75 X more traffic in
the data centers and ten times more
servers than today and if you think
about the implications of that that
doesn't even include projections don't
even clued the onboarding of new
technologies again it's only limited by
the imagination the Internet of the
imagination it's the Internet of the
nouns it's not just things as people
places things you know and so it's it's
amazing how fast things are moving when
I look back you know to in 75 at a local
radio shack in 1975 and you know looking
at a trs-80 model one with 4k of memory
in it they can how in the world would we
use all that that memory gets a lot of
shift left shift or a height you know a
lot of registers to load up and then
over there is 110 baht acoustic cover
but it's so cool because you know they
can talk to each other wow that's
amazing
you know so now then you have the latest
technology innovations from Oracle with
the x3 you know the Exadata systems with
hundreds of terabytes of flesh you know
memory make sure you no wonder what the
next you know 37 years whatever will
hold for us going forward now I was
recently in New York City and I was
coming out of the bank of elevators and
I kind of had to take a double double
take at this plaque you know the New
Yorker Hotel was built in the 29 opened
in 30s were a Jack Benny I mean a Benny
Goodman rather and and Pete fountain all
the classic big bands went to want to
stay in play you know in New York City
at the time
it's very deco and so it's really a
historic landmark but this plaque here
talks about that it's you know it's an
electrical and engineering computing
time capsule we're really landmark
because it had the largest power station
in the u.s. at the time
and so that's kind of what's happening
day and if you you know realize that as
you know what alternating current did
for electricity is the same thing that
high-speed fiber communications is doing
for the internet but only in photons and
civil electrons but it's turned into a
utility and so can you imagine the
company you're working for a building
its own power station today I mean
that's that's that's the same thing you
know we're talking about here so that's
what's happening with with the movement
to the cloud because the you know their
data centers are very large complex
labor-intensive require specialized
skills to develop and you know what
we're not even we're not in the data
center business why do we need to build
our own huge data center or a cloud and
so you have this movement you know of
the whole world going online and and
moving to the cloud as they December's
become you know utilities and in fact
employee utility pricing you know
pay-as-you-go pay as you use type models
and concepts so that in effect is you
know with Oracle's you know recent
announcement and getting into cloud that
made a decision that they're going to
become a 21st century utility company
you know that's the the implications
there so going forward if you look at
the cloud you know the data center
utilities you know this year we're gonna
surpass sixty billion dollar market you
know they're currently the top three or
SAS CRM and human capital management the
next way that's coming and you can you
can print you know project you can see
the different ways they're gonna be
coming you know when everything becomes
available as a service you know is
supply chain management a PLM business
intelligence state as a service XYZ as a
service so here's kind of projections
and some of these clearly you know the
different services that are coming
online and they're their growth but
clearly software-as-a-service blows
everything else away
because it continues to grow huge huge
market so additionally and you know you
have the the deadest explosion you also
have the population explosion and that
part of what's happening that's
important dynamic and factor with data
centers because you go you know from all
antiquity beginning of times in 1901 in
Union Mississippi when my grandfather
was born it took all that time for they
build billion people on earth and now
just a little over just barely moved the
dial just barely 125 years later you
know now last Christmas
what was that the seventh billions baby
was born you know well in India well who
figured that one out maybe we should ask
for a recount you know but the next stop
10 to 12 billion and so huge huge
implications again the whole world's
going online and they don't just want
electricity and water now they want
their iPads and iPhones using more and
more electricity until the National
Research Laboratories and others have
said you know what do the math we can't
build electrical plants or capacity fast
enough to keep up with the growing
global demand so the only way that we're
going to be able to keep up is through
energy efficiency plays similar what we
do it serve at you here because if I
take this glass of water and I support
half the glass just right here in front
of us right now half what half the glass
that's how much electricity waste every
year so unless you find some way to
recapture that reclaim it you know we'll
never you know get to a sustainable
future for our children our children's
children when I say sustainable I'm not
talking about respectfully Al Gore in
the environment I'm talking about
preventing severe sustained rolling
blackouts that are coming because here's
the event scenario globally you got now
billions and billions and more people
now trillions of more internet devices
and shrill you know a trillion more
internet buses connected online and
trillions and more electronic devices
using more and more electricity driving
more and more demand for servers and
data centers globally using more and
more electricity
you know just iPads alone this year I
think the latest projection
for ipads is approaching a hundred
million iPads 100 million you know I
don't want you ever take type and just
stacked them flat you know Nina I wonder
how high that would go I mean we
probably could look out the win and have
to look up that's incredible
100 million well now is that means
they're going to need a whole lot more
servers in data centers you know which
is good for hopefully everybody in the
room here very exciting so what we have
here is here's what happens in every
minute on the internet and even this is
outdated now so you've got all these
things happening if you could see data
you know envision is just little zeros
and 1 bits like an alphabet soup or
something you know just a perfusion of
data it would just would be enormous
it's incredible that the members were
speaking here not just the data
acquisition of 37 terabytes per hour on
just one engine on a jet plane or
something like that even you know it's
just amazing and so within it within the
center here you know where it says 60
seconds you can place you know actually
place servers and data centers right in
the center there because servers are
really the engines the new engines of
the internet and really of the new
economy and so they're not only huge as
we as we mentioned strategic the new
nerve centers a business inside society
but they're also you know as vital to
the function of society now is power
stations so it's it's just a really
exciting space and place place to be in
so as a result you know efficiency is
becoming increasingly strategic and
moved to center stage and its kind of
create this perfect storm within data
centers because you know the increase in
energy costs which we'll talk to some
more on the next slide couple with
greater complexity and higher customer
expectations are creating this real
challenge
this huge watershed and Giga trend if
you will
globally because what's happening if you
do situational analysis you know the
internet uses more electricity in
America than the automotive industry and
nowhere to go but up
it just keeps increasing everyday again
the whole world go there's a whole roll
goes online and using more and more
servers and data centers globally so as
a result the top problem the top concern
the biggest top problem globally is is
energy efficiency in availability for
power-hungry servers which in turn also
brings us to the top opportunity
globally in data centers which is energy
efficiency and the number one reason
data centers look to expand and by by
expand the infrastructure and by five
new servers so what's happening now some
what's having automotive industry in the
70s for those that you may be able to
remember or reference back in the early
70s everybody's driving these big
vehicles these big cars around those big
bugs that's why this big big boats you
know but the 450 whatever big engines in
them and then they started you see what
they're putting on the windows now and
on the automobiles it's that mpg you
know who cares about that
well obviously Toyota did because they
built the top-selling car in all of
history and you know it didn't have it
wasn't a Ferrari like a high-performance
computer it wasn't you know even a
Corvette and it only had four cylinders
but it got the job done and it cost less
use less fuel took up less space it was
kind of a car for the masses so anyway
going forward if you look at the
implications here's the numbers on green
data centers that are they're
skyrocketing literally you know
currently projected 17 point 1 billion
in 2012
a growth 245 billion in 2016 that's
what's over the next 48 months by the
way and you know nowhere to go but up
from there because the projections from
you know these projections here don't
even account can't really account for
the on board of new technologies that
haven't been invented yet that's waiting
for us to invent you know as we move to
a smart planet ambient sensor embedded
smart planet driven by Java right is
tremendous tremendous implications
because we move to a smart planet then
you have smart podiums well we do with
this podium we stick in the big digital
blender and throw a microprocessor in it
you know what could we do with it it's
pretty exciting you think about it what
what what about you have smart walls so
let me show you that let me show you the
latest weather here smart walls smart
floor smart tables any surface can
return to a smart interactive surface
and so whether it's you know for
whatever advertising for interactive or
whatever function tremendous
implications so the growth rate between
now and 2016 is 28% and some of the
global drivers of that growth rate are
soaring energy costs surging computing
power demand environmental concerns
economic pressure the fact according to
Gartner that eight to eight out of ten
data centers are out of power and out of
space exploding devices coming online
exploding population all that's
tremendous direct correlation and impact
to this exciting exciting market
explosive market so you look at the
game-changing potential for savings
here's actually an infographic that we
put together and I know you can't read
it it's just kind of a talking point but
it says I think you had it yeah
they shall shoot myself in the eye here
there we go alright so if you look at
the hundreds of millions of square feet
of space saved you could have you know
this this many more football fields you
could create or this but power savings
this many more nuclear plants each year
or just the space savings alone you
could have you could you could build
another stadiums that you know caused
how many billions to build told somebody
that the other day and said well I can
use the one we got now 186 for you know
but you know you think about the
implications are huge you know in either
New York Metro or Tokyo Metro both 22
million approximately metro area beauty
of each person you know six hot air
volumes for the carbon savings each year
there's additional component here which
is increasingly important recently in
New York City for a data center event up
there and you know a growing concern is
the water footprint the water savings
you know that's that's that's huge
because basically if you look at for
example its server G we're essentially a
power company because you help recapture
and repurpose that energy those energy
savings and nothing is bigger than that
except maybe water but then you think
about although the water savings it's
huge
so by 2015 almost a result almost 30% of
all investments in 150 billion
dollar-a-year annual data center
infrastructure market is going to be an
energy efficiency technologies and so
like energy energy efficiency touches
every industry company application geo
worldwide so it's like light bulbs and
it touches literally you can't think of
a company that you've ever passed by I
worked for or heard of ever will that
doesn't use servers or data centers it's
one incredible incredible space so again
recapping you know the definition of
embedded system in broad terms it's a
combination of computer
we're in software either fixed
capability or programmable is
specifically designed for a particular
particular function so taking that that
definition examples of embedded Java
language you know very very pervasive
and so you know I'm sure you y'all
borrow hard the numbers I won't read
them to you you can you can see them
there it's you know large larger than
large and getting larger so and of
course data centers are now becoming an
increasingly important aspect of that
which is again the topic of the session
today
now here's actually a benefits of
job-embedded in the in the data center
which by the way are the same as the
benefits of job-embedded now I've got I
was going to I was trying to plug a Dave
clack this is actually contributed to
this as I was gonna plug his his blog
there I think because he actually
contributed to this but it's you know
it's just what I'm sure you know all the
other sessions have talked about
specifically which is not the real focus
specifically we go beyond that in this
session here but so I won't spend a lot
of time on it but you know the benefits
of job-embedded in a data center you
know decouples of software from the
hardware development you know there's
tremendous implications on your cycle
time and cost and so on low cost
development environment you can use your
PC I mean you know it's that's that's
really key quick quick time-to-market
you know highly productive language that
create high quality applications easily
you know how performance secure robust
you know cross-platform applications
easily in language and platform
independence obviously a big one for
language and platform variations in
continuing you decouple software from
hardware development low cost
uh you know what okay
so it's so important I wanted to list it
twice how's that I actually over wrote
deleted the wrong slide like it was too
much to put on one slide so I was
creating two slides sorry y'all
I'll correct that in the in the deck
before we make it available for
distribution so anyway there's that if
you know there's a lot of really great
benefits of Java
you know embedded Java and Java embedded
in general and the point main point of
this slide is it holds true in the data
center and so just realizing that and
changing your mindset has tremendous
implications on system design life cycle
support cost your your java strategy
within the data center and so going
forward looking at the definition of you
know java embedded a data center
appliance you know it's the server
appliances or servers that have a
hardware and software pre-configured by
the manufacturer think think of vcr you
know it's just a huge market potential
in in the data center and so again it's
a definition slide the kind of a level
set slide the server's designed so that
the end users don't need to understand
the details of the you know the system
appliance is just plugged in you know
it's kind of plug and go type of system
user select the components to be active
you know enter up in minutes so it's
easy easy to install and the that can be
controlled remotely and again back to
the previous definition of embedded
narrow focus you know of services
usually focused as a true information
you know appliance and so the java
embedded server benefits or simplicity
just to recap I kind of recap the
previous
simplicity you know it's easy to
implement plugin plugin go plug-and-play
security at highest levels scalability
and pricing design serviceability high
of highest levels performance improves
as you scale and availability at the
highest levels now if you look at green
job embedded server appliances now if we
look at green and what that what what
that means now is it's only simple and
reliable and affordable and secure and
complete as we discussed before but it's
also optimized engineered for
performance and efficiency and so as we
go along we'll be discussing that a
little bit more so some of the some of
the potential appliances that we're
looking at her is fees was there along
you look at the different flavors of is
fees all the different is fees
potentials it's very exciting it's you
know endless the different appliances
that are there they're yet to be be
developed and so we're currently talking
to a modeling group that the Gartner
just rated it was the top modeling a
company in the world in their space very
excited about developing embedded
appliances you know their Java and
actually have green job embedded
appliances we're talking to security
there's video CRM HCM cloud a business
intelligence big data storage web it's
you know you could just keep going on so
if you look at the you know back to
embedded smart planet fourth P that we
talked about earlier not just people
prophets and those people prophets and
planet but performance you know it's
really keeps it impacts all those and
it's optimized you know it impacts
everything else and so as a result we
need to you know since it impacts
everything else we should really
carefully examine our definition of
optimize performance and that's really
critical there's been is it does it is a
performance equal speed as a pharmacy
efficiency you know and actually what
suggesting here in the session today is
it includes both so it's the classic
mindset if everything has a hammer
everything looks like a nail and so
what's you know who's driving who's
software hardware or software driving
the system and so the answer should be
bailed for a true system engineer
optimized approaching benefits this we
have to think out of the you know the
server box
you know require new way of thinking and
engineering to achieve optimization but
it's the classic you know trade-offs
conundrum you know and usually the
mindsets choose one or the other you
know which one you want you want high
performance you want low cost what you
want but a new paradigm new mindset new
model is to really choose both within
quote engineering efficiency engineering
approach because one of the one of these
we'll see here in a little bit one of
the most often overlooked aspects of
efficiency is you know it's the actually
the energy cooling space costs and
savings topics so op X problem or
opportunity you know if you look at the
operating expenditures you know within a
data center that can be up to sixty
percent of the capital expenditures the
cost to purchase the systems you know in
the total cost of acquisition whether it
be hardware or software and you know
increasing power consumption you have
new servers which have greatly increased
processing power cannot you know cost I
think they can use up to many times more
power than the older ones which is huge
impact on power comes like a power and
you know power and cooling tanks
additionally you've got a look at the
total cost of ownership you know look at
the the whole system system as a whole
and you know it's important to identify
the hot heavy and power-hungry devices
and so the key is to partner with you
know facilities to understand which
devices are causing
of energy costs and what you're going to
do about that so I think you know
there's a growing pent-up demand for
energy deficiency Hardware within the
data center and so you have actually a
lot of so much of such a demand that you
actually have what's happening is data
centers are depreciating writing off the
difference just to get more energy
efficient technology in the data center
and that's why the digital Realty a
report that we saw earlier is the main
reasons that data centers the no.1
problem globally of data center
operators they confirm that a huge a
report is power and availability you
know energy cost and availability for
their power-hungry computers and so as a
result they they also found out that
that that's you know the main reason
that servers look to expand their
infrastructure or by data centers look
to expand their infrastructure by
additional servers just for energy
efficiency so you know again here's the
Eco Duke you know got got green green
Java embedded so green Java you know is
Java you know that system engineered
optimized with efficiency in mind that
really pays for itself as we'll see here
here in a minute there's six key drivers
to that and you know it actually impacts
a triple bottom line of people profits
and planets along with a fourth Appiah
performance which true definition of
performance you know is engineered for
optimal efficiency so if you look at
data center optimization there's a lot
of things that you could be looked at
you know engineering facilities property
energy finance network IT all have an
impact by far the biggest you know
source of power and cooling costs within
datacenter the biggest operating cost
within the data centers or the power of
cooling in space by far and so just
focus in on that on the IT you know
within the context of this session
within the IT space you know parameter
design parameter for data center
optimization
going forward you know is is a similar
you know it's the same thing that Oracle
talks about you know job-embedded
optimization is really hardware and
software engineering together an
engineering approach and so you know
that forces you to look at Java embedded
as a system you know including hardware
so true systems engineering is is not
just optimizing software with hardware
but it's actually asking the question
you know really looking at both and
asking are we optimizing the hardware
and software together and only then do
you have a true systems engineering
approach but that's just part of the
equation that's the performance part of
the equation close the Bennett with a
lot of benefits of doing that you know
of using systems in your approach with
Java embedded increased quality of
service enhance agility decrease
complexity lower IT costs you know but
not just invented optimization but green
Java not just job embedded optimization
with green Java embedded optimization
requires a systems engineering approach
look at the hardware in the software
which equals performance optimized
systems okay
but taking it a step further it requires
an analysis of data center cost drivers
to recurrent operating costs in order to
maximize efficiency optimized systems
okay so optimized can be a systems
engineering approach on performance
optimizing performance so systems
engineering approach we look at hardware
and software holistically and we
optimize performance okay so that's
performance optimized but a true
optimized performance has another
components what I'm proposing here is
that it's important to also look at
efficiency optimized and that's where
you engineer efficiency to where systems
can literally pay for themselves so to
do this you have to basically take a
look at the data center cost structure
analysis and kind of do a decomposition
and do that analysis here which I'll go
through here
fairly fairly quickly and you know
please stop me if you have questions
going through this but you know if you
look at the data center cost structure
analysis breaking it down you have
direct cost indirect costs and you know
systems engineering approach must also
look at the system cost structure and
efficiencies in order to engineer a
truly optimized and green java embedded
system so in doing that looking at if
you look at the you know a true java
embedded server system optimization then
you have to break it down even further
and look at the cost associated there so
within within server system optimization
you know you have have these parameters
you have the cost of acquisition for
your hardware the performance of the
hardware and then the efficiency of the
hardware the OP X a lot of times and
more commonly not you look at the
performance in the cost of the system
you knows what's what's what's very you
know commonly done and that's for the
hardware same thing with the software
you have cost performance and efficiency
efficiency and software be reusability
the elytis maintainability scalability
you know all all the Ã¬let ease their
compatibility but the one of the least
considered highest impact areas is the
efficiency the OP X of actual hardware
aspect of a java embedded system so
going forward look at the server
hardware optimization in the data center
again taking this SC system engineering
approach and balance of performance with
harder Hardware up X what you do when
you decompose the cost drivers what you
see is that is within the recurring
aspect of hardware efficiency op X yep
that's where you get your power : in
space cost so then really looking at you
know if we do a break down and
reconstruct the cost structure for
achieving green Java embedded ok in the
data center or anywhere else for that
matter we discover the six key variables
that have to be addressed and the true
systems engineering approach that are
required in a truly optimized system and
that is screen you know that is green
and literally can help pay for itself
which is part of the definition I'm
using green Java
and so here's that here's the six
variables here for a green job embedded
system unit the hardware total cost of
acquisition performance affects the
software total cost of acquisition
performance op X and unless you look at
all these can you truly have a truly
optimized system for performance and
efficiency and in such a way this system
will actually help pay for itself so
before we had the embedded server
benefits in the data center but there
was something missing and so we've added
added the bottom bullet here and that's
what gives us drink green Java
okay green Java embedded server benefits
in the data center and that's as you
know a system engineering approach that
also optimized you know it's it's
optimized in the sense that you know
it's just engineer performance plus
efficiency such as system dramatic and
lower topics and literally helps pay for
itself so to do it to do a wrap up some
important points you know green Java
embedded server closed system think
Energy Star VCR huge potential in the
data center marketplace in space green
optimized system is hardware and
software engineering for optimal total
cost of acquisition performance and
efficiency the capex performance in
effects and an efficiency engineering
it's a mindset as well as a business
value extraction process that involves
minimized in hardware and software
effects such that this system really
pays for itself and so just taking this
approach you basically you have the
software that you can bundle if you have
have the the green clean hardware and
you could say here's our system it's
already pre-configured plug-and-play and
we'll pay for the pay for the system
you'll pay for the system sure just plug
it in because it literally pays for
itself so you know as far as green job
embedded holistic system engineering
approach to incorporating green Java
embedded in the data center you create
differentiated solutions to really
improve operating margins as well as
revenues and so you look at the green
job embedded data center
oh gee what is your green Java embedded
data center strategy you know offers a
truly it's an endless you know very
powerful to be able to offer secure and
optimized systems for your global data
center Java you know your Java your
global Java data center strategy that
literally helped pay for itself and of
course the key that we're proud to be an
Oracle gold.gold partner
it's Araji and so using Oracle's device
the data center you know market and
product strategy offers significant
business you know advantages in the data
center today and also helps minimize
development inefficiency optimized cost
a testing cycles time to market all the
things we mentioned before you know for
secure truly secure optimized Java
embedded system in the data center so
we've got I guess just a few minutes
here ran over just a little bit here but
be glad to stay and as answer any
questions take a few minutes here a
server Qi again without proud to be a
Oracle gold partner and we had actually
I guess the exhibits into today but you
can find out more about us online so
we'll have have a few questions and take
a few minutes and I'll be up here at the
front for anybody wants to mate and
actually do we have also you know if I
wants to see our server do we have on
with us do we we have it we have it at
the booth still okay okay so before we
all have to run off sail off to Treasure
Island here so I put on my glasses so I
can see better yes just tell me when to
stop okay
it depends on the scenario and scenario
analysis but we have you know four new
data centers we actually should show in
best case instances less than a year
yeah it's pretty dramatic yes yes sure
it's clean tech server we're I haven't
registered internationally and we just
got Australia and Japan confirmed so I
mean it's but it's a clean tech server
yeah Thank You Hannah
any other questions okay well I
appreciate everybody coming today
very much and you know I'd like to give
a special thanks James for the
invitation to speak very much and Hannah
you as well and everybody on your team
we're very supportive so thank you for
that you guys have been the best and
also every one of you in the audience
for joining us today I'm glad everybody
beat the rush in today but thanks for
coming I appreciate everybody your time
very much thank you thanks everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
