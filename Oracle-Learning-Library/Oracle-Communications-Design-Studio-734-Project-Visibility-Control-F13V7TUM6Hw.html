design studio 734 project visibility
control training session this training
session is intended as an add-on to the
Oracle communications design studio
platform basics course that is available
through the Oracle Learning Library this
training session has three parts first
there is a brief introduction this is
followed by detailed coverage of custom
tags and then working sets we begin this
session by introducing the concept of
project visibility control the design
studio workspace is a comprehensive
integrated development environment
capable of holding a large number of
projects in order to improve the
usability of design studio a filtering
capability to customize what is seen has
been introduced in the studio projects
view you use working sets to control
project visibility instead of having to
see and navigate through all of the
projects in the workspace you can narrow
down what is shown to just the projects
you are interested in the filtering
mechanism called a working set controls
the visibility of projects but does not
add or remove projects from the
workspace the work set filtering
mechanism uses project types and tags as
the basis for project visibility
filtering now we look at custom tags you
use your own tags to control project
visibility in the studio projects view
for example if there is a particular set
of activation projects that would be of
interest to the activation management
team you could create a custom tag
called activation PDM and apply it to
the particular set of projects when you
apply the working set filter that uses
that custom tag only the projects with
that tag are shown to create a custom
tag you use the tag wizard
in the tag wizard you add the details to
your tag
note that tags can only be created
within model type projects be sure to
give the tag a meaningful name you can
add a description to the tag and you can
also provide runtime directives and
build directives to the tag after the
tags are created you apply them to the
projects in the workspace and then use
them in working sets to control project
visibility use the project tag tab to
add tags to the project
note that the tag description appears in
the selection dialog box and in the
project tag tab custom tags can be
renamed if a tag is being referenced all
entities that reference a renamed custom
tag are updated with the new name if you
delete a custom tag that has entity
references the entity reference
relationships are broken in a project
that has the deleted custom tag the
deleted tag is marked with an unresolved
error marker in the working set wizard
if a deleted tag is in the tag list an
error message appears at the top of the
wizard and the deleted tag is marked
with an unresolved error marker note
that a deleted tag cannot be selected in
the tag list now we will examine the
working set filtering mechanism you will
learn about how they work how they are
activated and deactivated and how they
are created and modified in the context
of design studio a working set is a
configuration that defines which
projects are visible in the studio
projects view or which route elements
are visible in the solution view this
functionality is based on the standard
Eclipse working set functionality which
is described in the Eclipse workbench
user guide in design studio there are
two types of work
set predefined and user-defined when you
install design studio the exclude based
project working set is active in the
studio projects view this working set
causes all base projects all projects
tagged with the base project tagged and
all non design studio projects to be
hidden in the studio projects view now
we'll look at an example of using the
predefined working set for this example
design studio was installed and in the
new workspace the common model-based
data design pattern was run this design
pattern imports the oracle coms
model-based project into design studio
this project is a base project and
because design studio installs with the
exclude based project defined working
set active in the studio projects view
you do not see the oracle coms
model-based project in the studio
projects view menu you see that the
exclude based projects working set is
active as indicated by the blue
highlighted icon in the menu from the
studio projects view menu deselect
working set was selected this
deactivated the exclude based projects
working set which caused the studio
projects view to be updated to show all
based projects all projects associated
with the base project tagged and all non
design studio projects in the workspace
because the workspace contained only one
project that met the criteria that
project which is called oracle comms
model base was made visible in the
studio projects view if you wanted to
reactivate the exclude based projects
predefined working set you would select
it from the studio projects view menu
now we'll turn our attention to
user-defined working sets note that if
you are going to use tag
when creating a working set make sure
they are defined before you start when
you create a new working set you need to
select the type of working set you are
creating for filtering design studio
projects select studio design as the
working set type when you configure the
working set give the working set a
meaningful name so that users will have
an idea of what the working set will do
keep in mind that working sets can
include or exclude projects from what
will be visible in the studio projects
view sometimes excluding a few projects
would be equivalent to including many
you can select the appropriate action to
make your working set as efficient as
possible you identify the projects to be
affected by setting the criteria for
determining project visibility the
criteria you can set include the project
types and tags you can modify an
existing user-defined working set by
using its editor if you want to modify
the active working set select the Edit
active working set entry in the studio
projects View menu if you have multiple
working sets that are active you would
select select working set from the menu
and then highlight the working set to be
modified and then click Edit after you
have made the changes in the editor when
you click finish the studio projects
view is updated all available working
sets including both pre defined and
user-defined are listed in the studio
projects View menu to activate a single
user-defined working set you would
select it from the menu how the active
working set behaves depends on how the
working set is configured assuming the
working set is configured with the
include option selected if the working
set has only project type selected and
no
Tagg selected for a project to be
visible in the studio projects view it
must match at least one of the selected
project types if the working set has
only tagged selected and no project type
selected for a project to be visible in
the studio projects view it must match
at least one of the selected tanks if
the working set has both project types
and tagged selected to be visible a
project must match at least one selected
project type and one selected tagged in
this example a single working set is
activated in that working set the
include option is selected also in the
working set the model and OSI model
project types are selected and the
modeler and conceptual model or tags are
selected in order for a project to be
visible in the studio in the studio
projects view a project must be of type
model or owesome model and must be
tagged with modeler or conceptual model
ER or both tags you have the option of
activating multiple user-defined working
sets concurrently in this case you would
select the check boxes for the working
sets to be activated or to select them
all you would click select all
this causes the selected working sets
option to be selected when you click OK
the studio projects view is filtered
using the working sets you selected
project visibility behavior between
active working sets depends on the
criteria selected in all of the active
working sets if you have only project
types selected in all of the active
working sets then to be visible assuming
the include option is selected a project
must match a selected project type in
any of the active working sets the same
principle applies for active working
sets that have only tags
when the act of working sets have a mix
of project types and tag selected in
order to be visible assuming the include
option is selected a project must match
both a project type and a tag regardless
of which working set in which the
selection resides for this example there
are two working sets the first is called
in PDM and in it the single tag called
in PDM is selected the second working
set is called activation PDM and in it
just the activation project types are
selected for simplicity in both working
sets the include option is selected in
two of the projects in the workspace the
in PDM tag has been applied the first
project is a model project type and the
second project is an activation project
type which projects are visible in the
studio projects view depends on which
working set or working sets are active
if just the activation PDM working set
is active which has just the three
activation project type selected all of
the activation type projects in the
workspace will be shown if just the in
PDM working set is active which has just
the in PDM tag selected all of the
projects in the workspace that have the
in PDM tag are shown when both the
activation PDM and the in PDM working
sets are applied concurrently the only
projects visible in the workspace are
activation type projects that have the
in PDM tag applied you can export one or
more working sets to an XML file so you
can use the same working sets in
different workspaces in the export
select dialog box design studio working
set is listed under oracle you select
one or more working sets to export and
provide
a destination XML file name if you want
to use working sets you previously
created in another workspace export them
from that workspace so you can import
them into your current workspace in the
import select dialog box design studio
working set is under Oracle
Communications design studio Wizards you
select one or more working set check
boxes to indicate which working sets to
import note that if a working set
already exists in the current workspace
you cannot reinforcing working set a
message is shown at the top of the
wizard page and the already existing
working set is not selectable after a
working set is imported its behavior is
the same as a working set created within
the workspace this concludes the
training session</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
