for Microsoft sequel server plugin for
Oracle Enterprise Manager 12c today in
this screen watch will be reviewing the
fully revamped 12 1 0 4 0 plugin
including its new features and
monitoring capabilities this plugin has
been upgraded to be compatible for
aureum 12 CR 4 as well as being
backwards compatible for the old 12 CR 3
as well it also includes updated support
for Microsoft sequel Server 2012 and
some added support for Microsoft sequel
server clustering other supported
versions include 2005 in 2008 r2
throughout this video we'll see just how
the Microsoft sequel server plugin is
such a great individual solution for
monitoring your Microsoft database
environment this is due to its
integration with Oracle Enterprise
Manager making it a great ideal solution
for your heterogeneous database
environment so before we get started
just want to quickly review what we'll
be covering in this video we'll be going
over the upcoming core features and some
of the new additional features found in
this release and then we'll dive deeper
into these components demoing the all
new performance page how to execute jobs
the UI the comprehensive monitoring of
over 200 metrics intelligent metric
thresholds we'll review those and how to
set those and look at some of the out of
box reports this plugin comes with 20
out of the out-of-the-box reports so
we'll take a look at one of the one or
two of those so getting started you can
see already logged into Oracle
Enterprise Manager cloud control will
see and navigate to the enterprise
summary page from here or any other page
that you may be logged into will
navigate to the all targets page by
selecting targets all targets once at
the all targets page I prefer to refine
my search and select the Microsoft
sequel server target type from the left
navigation pane this will filter the
list of targets to only targets relating
to this plugin
for the sake of the demo I've already
deployed and configured to target to
point at the Microsoft sequel server
2012 cluster
when viewing the homepage of the plugin
you'll notice the summary overview of
the sequel instance and host giving you
status uptime DB and server names and
version new in this release is the
ability to run jobs from the UI this can
be accomplished by clicking the stop
button or Start button next to the
server or agent status you can see the
dialog pops up confirming the job will
start no iam job in the background but
for now we'll just click no click in
this performance link will bring us to
the performance page but we'll get to
that in a minute here
next to the summary view is the database
table in this table each database
associated with this monitor in
Microsoft sequel server instance will be
listed as a row with status size and
space available if you click on the
column header like any typical table
will sort by that metric type so this
can be useful for finding which
databases are trouble somewhere which
ones are filling up with space fast if
the plug-in is monitoring a cluster the
status of each cluster node will be
listed here in this cluster view also
listed in this view is annotation of
which node is currently active moving to
the right
detailed metric graphs and charts are
provided for some of the more critical
collecting metrics the graphs and charts
provide easy to see call-out points when
hovering over them with the mouse at the
bottom of the home page you can find the
standard OEM instance and problems and
job Activity views here you can quickly
view any incidents that have occurred
from the metric thresholds and other
problems Boston over the incident will
give you the full description while
clicking on the incident will bring it
to the incident manager so for next step
in the demo will navigate to the
performance page by clicking that link
we looked at earlier in the summer view
here the performance page is broken into
two main sections the top five sessions
and the top five queries the top five
sessions can be organized by CPU time or
memory while the top five queries can be
organized by execution count CPU time or
block time after selecting the metric to
view each graph can then be filtered to
show different sections of time by day
week and month hovering over different
points in the graph will display
detailed information
metric point table below the graph
offers detailed information about the
top five sessions as well as the ability
to kill the session by selecting the row
and clicking that kill session button
above the graph clicking yes and this
dialog will start an oem job to kill the
selected session however for now during
this demo we'll click no moving down to
the top five queries graph again looking
over over the lines to display detailed
data points and then mouse and over the
table rows below the graph will show the
full execution count and query being ran
a home page and performance page display
the most critical information however to
view all of the metrics collected by the
plugin will navigate to the whole matrix
view here the metrics collected are
organized into metric groupings the most
recent data collected can viewed as well
as some historic values that are stored
by the plugin these metrics explore the
breadth of the plugins ability to
collect data from the Microsoft sequel
server environment setting some incident
thresholds and collecting historic data
and these metrics can prove to be a very
beneficial aid and alerting
administrators of potential issues next
let's view these incident thresholds for
the plugin to do this will navigate to
the metric and collection settings page
this metric and collection settings page
is already predefined without the box
thresholds for some of the configurable
values if desired you can fine-tune
these thresholds for each of the metrics
in this list as to a desired value
the last thing we'll look at today are
some of the information publisher
reports the Microsoft sequel server
plugin is shipped with over 20
out-of-the-box reports for easy and
quick reporting of key metrics
for example let's take a look at the
report from memory statistics
as the report loads you see that the
data is logically organized for quick
viewing and easy print ability the
Microsoft sequel server information
publisher reports also a great way for
analyzing trends and data and finding
stress points in your sequel server
environment before some major issue can
occur and that concludes the screen
watch for the Microsoft sequel server
plugin thank you for taking the time to
watch
