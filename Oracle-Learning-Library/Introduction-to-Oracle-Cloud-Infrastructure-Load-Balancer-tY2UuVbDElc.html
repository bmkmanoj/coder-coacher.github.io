infrastructure load balancer
enterprise workloads today are
increasingly diverse and distributed
consequently the requirements and
challenges are getting complex to
effectively navigate the complexity a
fault-tolerant front-end interface is
required that can ensure high
availability for enterprise applications
with the Oracle cloud infrastructure
load balancer you can meet these
challenges squarely
the Oracle cloud infrastructure load
balancer provides automated traffic
distribution from one entry point to
multiple servers within your virtual
cloud network or VCM a load balancer
improves resource utilization facilitate
scaling and helps ensure high
availability the service offers a load
balancer with your choice of a public or
private IP address and provision
bandwidth you can access the service
using the Oracle cloud infrastructure
console or REST API
interesting when should I use the public
load balancer and when should I use the
private load balancer
use the public load balancer when your
application requires a public internet
facing entry point
use the private internal load balancer
when your application requires a private
entry point using private RFC 191 8 IPs
this is ideal for traffic originating
within your vcn or from your on-premises
network that is connected via an IPSec
VPN or fast connect note that the
internal load balancer itself is highly
available within a specific ad whereas
the public load balancer is highly
available within the region both types
of load balancers are ideal to route
incoming traffic across multiple compute
instances reachable via your vcn
on what basis does the load balancer
distribute incoming application traffic
the load balancer automatically
distributes the traffic to a list of
healthy back-end servers based on a
health check policy and a load balancing
policy you define these policies for a
logical entity called a back-end set
a health check is a test to confirm the
availability of back-end servers a
health check can be a request or a
connection attempt
based on a time interval you specify the
load balancer applies the health check
policy to continuously monitor back-end
servers if a server fails the health
check the load balancer takes the server
temporarily out of rotation if the
server subsequently passes the health
check the load balancer returns it to
the rotation
please tell me more about how the load
balancer routes incoming traffic to
multiple compute instances
the load balancer is associated with
another logical entity called a listener
the listener determines which incoming
traffic the load balancer accepts and
the back-end set determines how the load
balancer directs traffic to the
collection of back-end servers the
back-end set comprises a list of
back-end servers the back-end servers
compute instances associated with a
back-end set can exist anywhere as long
as the Associated security lists and
route tables allow the intended traffic
flow a load balancing policy you can
define load balancing policies that tell
the load balancer how to distribute
incoming traffic to the back-end servers
currently the supported policies are
round-robin lease connections IP hash a
health check policy you can configure
multiple application specific health
check policies to ensure that the load
balancer directs traffic only two
healthy instances optional SSL handling
to use SSL with your load balancer you
must add one or more certificate bundles
to the load balancing service including
the public certificate the corresponding
private key and any associated
certificate authority certificates
optional session persistence
configuration you can enable server-side
cookie driven session persistence for
your HTTP load balancer
how do you set up a public load balancer
let's take a look at the reference
architecture diagram say you have a vcn
with multiple compute instances
distributed across multiple subnets in
separate availability domains and you
want to create a load balancer to
distribute application traffic among
these instances you can create or
designate to public subnets in separate
availability domains create a public
load balancer and provide these two
public subnets create a back-end set
with a health check policy add the OC
IDs or IP addresses of the compute
instances to the back-end set create a
listener with optional ssl handling with
these steps you will have a functional
public load balancer now if you want to
create a private load balancer the
process is exactly the same except you
need to provide only one subnet
can I provide pre provision load
balancing capacity or bandwidth
you can provide pre provision load
balancing capacity bandwidth by
selecting a load balancer shape a load
balancer shape is a template that
determines the load balancers total pre
provisioned maximum capacity bandwidth
for ingress + egress traffic
currently the available shapes include
100 megabits per second 400 megabits per
second and 8,000 megabits per second
note you cannot change the shape of your
load balancer after you create it to
alter the total pre provision bandwidth
you can use the console or API to create
a new load balancer and specify a new
shape
each load balancer has the following
configuration limits one IP address 16
back-end sets 512 back-end servers per
back and set 1,024 back-end servers
total 16 listeners
thanks for the overview as I can see
Oracle cloud infrastructure load
balancer offers five unique capabilities
choice of bandwidth I can provision the
load balancer as per my application
traffic density high availability I can
distribute traffic across multiple
availability domains access control I
can configure the load balancer to
adhere to specified network security
policies IP address I can use the
provisioned IP address and register it
with a DNS service to access my
application support for Network TCP or
SSL and application HTTP or HTTPS and
HTTP slash to traffic load balancing
very well said that's exactly why Oracle
cloud infrastructure load balancer is
the ideal front-end for your
applications please go to the Oracle
