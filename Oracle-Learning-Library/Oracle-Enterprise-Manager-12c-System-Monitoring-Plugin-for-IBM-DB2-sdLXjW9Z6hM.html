for the IBM db2 plugin for Oracle
Enterprise Manager 12c today we'll be
reviewing the updated 12 1040 plug-in
including its new features and
monitoring capabilities throughout this
video we'll see how the Oracle
Enterprise Manager IBM db2 plugin is
such a great individual solution for
monitoring your IBM db2 environment its
integration with Oracle Enterprise
Manager makes it an ideal solution for
any heterogeneous database environment
before we get started let's review what
we will be covering in this video we'll
be going over the plug-in support
capabilities core features some of which
are new to this release and others that
were introduced last release and finally
the plugins integration with OEM the IBM
db2 plugin is compatible with the
current OEM release of 12c release 5 it
includes support for IBM db2 9 dot 1959
dot 7 10 dot 1 and 10 dot 5 so getting
started you can see I have already
logged into an Oracle Enterprise Manager
12c cloud control web console and
navigated to the enterprise welcome page
from here you can go to the enterprise
summary page through the enterprise menu
located at the top of your screen in the
inventory and usage graph to the right
you are now able to view your IBM db2
databases
you can drill down to the details using
the inventory and usage details page
here you can see various details such as
target hostname version platform and
more from here you can also click a
target's name to go to that targets
homepage another way to select a target
is through the all targets page you can
navigate to the all targets page from
any page in cloud control by selecting
targets all targets once at the all
targets page we can find and view our
IBM db2 targets I prefer to refine my
search and select the IBM db2 database
target type from the left navigation
pane this will filter the list of
targets to only targets relating to this
plug-in clicking on the deployed target
will bring us to the plugins home page
the first thing we'll look at on the
plug-in homepage is the summary overview
the summary overview provides details of
the database name and status uptime db2
version and host also in this overview
administrators are given the ability to
run jobs to start up or shut down their
IBM db2 instance and quiesce or unquiet
abase these jobs can be run by clicking
the specific buttons next to the
database or instant status confirming
the job will start an OEM job in the
background at the bottom of this view
are links to the analysis and
performance pages clicking these links
will bring us to each of these pages
will visit them in a moment next to the
summary view is the applications table
in this table each application utilizing
this monitored IBM db2 database will be
listed as a row these rows contain
metrics on the cpu utilization rose read
and written and sequel statements it is
committing against the database if you
click on a column header the table will
sort by that metric
more detailed data about the db2
database is displayed in the second row
this data includes the cash ratio in a
line graph format table space
utilization in a bar graph and the
database health indicators in a table
hovering over the line graphs and the
bar graphs will display call-outs with
details on the specific data points at
the bottom of the home page you can find
the standard OEM incidents in problems
and job activity views here you can
quickly view any incidents that have
occurred from metric thresholds and
other problems mousing over the incident
will give the full description while
clicking it will bring you to the
incident manager next we'll navigate to
the analysis page by clicking the link
we looked at earlier in the summary
panel this analysis page is broken into
two main sections the top five sequels
statements and the top five lock weights
the top five sequels statements can be
organized by CPU time or execution count
while the top five lock weights can be
organized by blocking application
blocked application table or to show all
weights after selecting the metrics to
view each graph can then be filtered to
show different sections in time by day
week and month hovering over different
points in the graph will display
detailed information on that metric
point the table below the graph offers
detailed information about the top 5
sequel statements for the given graph
selectors mousing over the query in the
table will give a more complete view of
the query moving down to the top 5 lock
weights table again we can hover over
the table cells to display the complete
metric if it is not fully viewable also
included is a kill application job to
kill troublesome blocking db2
applications from within the UI using
the targets contextual menu will now
navigate to the all new target
performance page as you can see the
performance page is broken down into
three key performance indicator
categories cash and connection storage
and i/o and sequel execution each of
these categories contains historical
data on the defined metric you can
change the length of the historical
collection by utilizing the radio
buttons at the top of the page the three
pages we have just covered display some
of the most critical IBM db2 information
however to view all of the metrics
collected by the plug-in will navigate
to the all metrics view
here the metrics collected are organized
into metric groupings the most recent
data collected can be viewed as well as
some historic values that are stored by
the plug in these metrics explore the
breadth of the plugins ability to
collect data from the IBM db2
environment to explore a metric further
expand the metric group in the left
column and then select one of the
specific metrics you wish to view the
values collected for that metric are
then displayed in this table on the
right as you can see clicking on a row
in this table splits the page
horizontally into two sections
the top section shows the average low
high and last known value in the bottom
section then graphs the historical
values of the selected row over time the
time frame can be changed by selecting
the view data drop down menu above the
top table now that we have a good
understanding of all the metrics that
are collected by the plug-in let's
review the available incident thresholds
that we can utilize to alert us in the
case of a failure or problem setting
incident thresholds and collecting
historic data on these metrics can prove
to be a very beneficial aid in alerting
administrators of potential issues to do
this we'll navigate to the metric and
collection settings page if desired you
can fine tune these thresholds for each
of the metrics in this list to a
specific value this metric in collection
settings page is already predefined
without of the box thresholds for some
of the configurable metrics this release
comes with three new out of the box
monitoring templates containing
predefined metric thresholds to view the
monitoring templates will go to the
monitoring templates page
you can filter the search by selecting
IBM db2 database in the target type menu
and clicking the arrow to the right the
IBM db2 plugin includes basic IO and
lock monitoring templates the last thing
we'll look at are the business
intelligence publisher reports
the IBM db2 plugin is shipped with over
19 out-of-the-box reports for easy and
quick reporting of key metrics for an
example let's take a look at the report
for IBM db2 database tablespace
statistics as a report loads you'll see
that the data is logically organized for
quick viewing and easy printability the
IBM db2 bi publisher reports are also
great for analyzing trends in data and
finding stress points in your db2
environment before they occur and that
concludes the screen watch for the IBM
db2 plugin thank you for taking the time
to watch this brief demonstration
hopefully you have found this video to
provide good insight into the updated
IBM db2 plug-in and how it can add value
to your infrastructure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
