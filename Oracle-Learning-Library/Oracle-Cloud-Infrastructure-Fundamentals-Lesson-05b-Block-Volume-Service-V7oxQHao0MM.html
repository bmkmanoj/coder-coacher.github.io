today we are going to talk about Oracle
cloud infrastructure block volume
service in this lesson you will learn
about the Oracle cloud infrastructure
block or new features managing a block
volume and its reacher recent feature
announcements all right so to understand
the service let's begin by understanding
what block volume is volume is a type of
data storage then is more expansive than
file storage it uses the ice cozy
Ethernet protocol to deliver features
and performance similar to on-premise
storage area networks or sans and are
designed for the security and durability
of the data lifecycle using this service
you can create block volumes and attach
them to your compute instance the Oracle
cloud infrastructure block volumes
service delivers a simple scalable block
volume service that fulfils all your
workload performance speeds the service
lets you dynamically provision and
manage block volume storage volumes you
can create attach create backups and
move all users needed to meet your
storage and application requirements
once attached and connected to an
instance you can use the volume like a
regular hard drive the service also lets
you store data on block volumes manage
block volumes control your data and
achieve the storage configuration your
application requires volume service
utilizes industry-leading highest
performance nvme drives and is offered
over the network using a standard ice
cozy protocol so if we talk about some
of the typical scenarios for block
volume service services one of the like
the basic scenario is expanding an
instant storage so typically flock
Walliams are used to increase an instant
storage once you once any compute
instances are lodged you can attach
block volumes to the instance increasing
the instances storage capacity second is
persistent and durable storage so block
volumes can be detached from one
instance and reattached to another
instance with
any loss of data this data persistence
allows the user to migrate the data
between the instances safely and also
safely store it even when it is not
attached to an instance
additionally block volumes offer a high
level of data durability compared to
locally attached drives all volumes are
automatically replicated for you helping
to protect against data loss and the
replication happens across availability
domains across all available domains
another of the common scenarios is the
instance tailing we we announced a new
feature or a recent feature which is
boot volumes that service actually
allows you to scale the instance CPU
keeping the data secure in the process
and we will talk about that particularly
both the boot volumes and the instance
scaling later in the lesson one
important thing to remember for the
volume service is that it is associated
always with an instance therefore it is
always created within a particular
availability domain and that is why
block volumes service is an availability
2 main construct ok so continuing on
some additional features of the block
volume service block volume sizes start
from 50 gigs and go up to 16 terabytes
with 1gb increments and you can attach a
maximum of 32 block volumes to an
instance from a performance perspective
I ops and bandwidth scale linearly per
GB volume size up to the service
maximums so for instance a 16 terabyte
volume gives 25,000 jobs at three 20
megabytes per second megabytes per
second throughput the performance you
observe for a block volume is basically
limited by the network bandwidth of your
compute instance once again block
volumes are highly durable insecure
multiple copies of data are stored in
run entry across multiple so
service and there is a backup service
available for taking block volumes
backups as well
moreover your data is encrypted at rest
on a block volume backups that you
create are also encrypted for increased
security okay so let's talk about some
of the block volumes service components
an instance is a compute instance within
the Oracle cloud infrastructure and we
support both the virtual machine or a
bare-metal as discussed earlier block
volume uses the standard IC IC protocol
for communication between the host and
the clock walliams and then the block
volume has two types of volumes you can
say block volume itself which is a
detachable storage device that you
attach to an instance once the instance
is launched and the second is the boot
volume the boot volume is a recently
announced feature of block volume
service so whenever you launch a
bare-metal
or a virtual instance with an oracle
provided image or a custom image a new
boot volume is automatically launched in
the same compartment containing the
image used to boot that instance this
boot volume is associated with the
instance when which is launched and we
will talk about more about again about
the boot volume later at the end of the
deck so let's take a look at what are
the steps of managing a block volume
service you log into the console and
navigate to the storage services tab
there you can choose a bar column and
click on create profile when you while
you are creating the block volume you
have to provide the name of the block
volume the compartment you are creating
it in the availability domain and the
size of the block 1u compartment and
availability domain are important
because it is tightly coupled with an
instance that you are going to attach to
and compute instances are launched
within specific availability domain
therefore you also choose during create
during creation which availability
domain and compartment you want to
create this block argument once you have
created this blog volume you can
navigate to your computing system and
just attach the list among the list of
block volumes in that particular
availability remain and compartment to
the instance that you wanted to attach
to once the volume is attached you log
on to the instance and use the I scuzzy
ATM command-line tool to configure the I
scuzzy connection in your instance once
block volume is configured you can mount
it and use it like a regular hard drive
block volumes are also work well with
like Windows instances so if a Windows
instance is present a different set of
copy/paste cop I scuzzy commands will be
provided that you can just you know copy
it and paste it on your windows instance
to attach it to configure it by default
all of these commands that are that are
given to you persist the connection so
 they should be able to they
actually persist even after a reboot and
you no need to reattach it
once you have rebooted the instance
let's talk more on what are some of the
management options available for block
volumes like we discussed earlier you
can detach a block volume once it's no
longer needed without any loss of data
you can detach and reattach to a
different sensors make sure when you
reattach you do not need to format the
disk as it will delete the data on the
disk you can also delete the block
volumes the delete operation is final
and cannot be undone
block volumes allow you to take
snapshots and pointed time backups
anytime and an interesting thing about
volume backups is that they are
differential and automatically managed
so a number of volume snapshot backups
will change to form the most recent
backup saving you space time and cost
and the service manages these
incremental backups for the users when
it comes time to restore these backup
snapshots are automatically maintained
so that any restorations will match the
volume state at the time of the last
snapshot users don't have to keep track
of those incremental backups backups go
into the backup section of the stories
service which is pasted on object
storage and they can be restored to a
same or a different availability domain
and reattached to the original instance
or any new instance as well I don't want
to mention here that this that this
would not be the right mechanism to use
a backup for running databases the
database instances do not use block
volumes for the data they use local and
object storage for backups and you will
get more information on the databases in
the database module so block volume
service also allows to you to clone a
plot volume this enables you to make a
copy of an existing block volume without
needing to go through the backup and
restore process and it's a point in time
direct disk to disk deep copy of the
source volume so all the data that is in
the source volume when the clone is
created is copied to the clone volume
any subsequent changes to the data on
the source volume are not copied to the
clone since the clone is a copy of the
source volume you cannot change the size
it will be the same size as the source
volume you can also create a clone for a
volume within the same region
availability domain and tenant you can
create a clone for a volume between
compartments as long as you have the
required access
missions for the operation so we briefly
discussed about the blue boot volumes
earlier as well so when any instance is
launched be it a virtual machine or a
bare-metal on an oracle provided image
or a custom image a new boot volume for
the instance is created in the same
compartment the boot volume is
associated with that instance until you
terminate the instance when you
terminate the instance you have the
option of preserving the boot volume and
its data this picture gives you more
control on the boot volumes of your
compute instance and let's talk about
some of the additional things that you
can do with the boot volume feature
itself number one it gives you the
ability to preserve your boot test
content by keeping it when you terminate
a computer instance and then once you
have that boot volume you can use that
preserved boot volume for a new instance
creation as well just like block volumes
the data across all the data of the boot
volume is replicated across all
availability domains the boot volumes
are also highly durable as they are
replicated across availability domains
automatically and this is being managed
by the block volume service itself would
volumes can also help in instance
scaling so since you can preserve the
boot volume by terminating an instance
the preserved boot volume can be used
within a new instance of different shape
which can have different o CPUs in
memory in matte Ram that you want to
select in this way you can also do an
instance scaling the launch times are
quite faster than what it used to be
earlier again just like clock william's
all boot volumes are also encrypted at
rest and additionally you can also you
have to also have the ability to use
boot volumes in troubleshooting and
repairing scenarios if if there is a
problem with a boot volume itself you
can stop the instance a reattach the
boot volume attach it to another
instance
Kru some troubleshooting and a bearing
detach it again and put them in boot
volume back to the original instance so
these are the features this is a lot of
flexibility from that and which is
provided to the boot volumes of all the
instances whenever they are launched and
to use these boot volumes there is
nothing special that you need to do
moving forward all instances that are
launched will be done using boot volumes
having all the features that we have
just talked about all right so that
actually sums up our block story service
lesson as well a quick summary on what
we learned and thank you for joining us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
