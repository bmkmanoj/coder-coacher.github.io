coming out I know it's a bit late i'll
try to keep it entertaining and maybe a
little fast paced i just moved three
videos over that i just got at the last
minute straight from nigeria the guys
recorded some little greetings for you
so we'll mix that in as appropriate I
have not watched them so it's unedited
like life um I'm a mobile trainer I work
for a company called future ice and flew
over here from Helsinki to tell you a
bit about what's going on in Africa of
all places because there's some very
cool app innovations there and it's a
very different market and everybody
talks about going global and let's be
glocal and they come up with silly terms
but what's actually happening on the
ground in a place in this case nigeria
and it's pretty cool they're doing some
really neat things and they're having
fun so if this beeper works I live here
I'm originally from the States but I've
been there so long I've lost my accent
or gained another one this is my company
best place to work in Europe it's
official now the place where we were is
Lagos here in Nigeria and in case you've
forgotten your geography that's hot this
is what it looks like on the street this
is what is the easy story to report
about Nigeria crazy traffic remember
these yellow Vance they're not all
yellow it's called add-on fo but it's
going to show up in one of the apps
later on these things are nuts so they
have a driver who drives like a rally
driver and they have a hustler who hangs
out the window on the side or out the
open door and gets people on and on off
the bus it's very free market they
compete like physically
for customers as they go along I'm sorry
I'm starting to lose my voice I hope I
can make it through this session um but
the reason nigeria is interesting above
most of the other countries in Africa is
it's huge it is the biggest market in
Africa it's the seventh most populous
country in the world so after you get
over America and China and the usual
suspects Nigeria is the next one that
you see on the list so it's actually a
very important market and very dynamic
they love their phones a lot of them you
see them carrying around two phones um
but it's a little bit different and
we'll try to focus and as a game i'm
going to show you nine different
applications built by um some of my
students there in nigeria thanks Michael
and I'd like you to tell me what you
think is slightly different about the
app as it's built for nigeria vs what
you would expect to see here in the
States I'd like to give a special thanks
to our sponsors nokia who have sent me
to nigeria and given me that chance to
really make a difference for these
developers many years ago I was actually
born in Africa and it's very nice to go
back and be able to use my professional
skills to to help people and I think
you'll see that we probably have helped
people four of these companies have
gotten venture funding after this
program some of the companies who have
been through training like this are
millionaires in their local currency so
they are successes we are making a
difference in the work that we do to
help these young companies make cool
mobile apps so nokia is partner for this
in nigeria is the code
creation hub this is a social
entrepreneurship venture that brings a
lot of cool companies together these are
the two guys behind it punji quit his
job because he wanted to make a
difference and started this with some
partners damu badgered Nokia to pay for
it along with some other sponsors that
they have there and what you see here is
the rooftop of the building where they
have the co-creation hub it really is in
downtown Lagos there are our people all
around on the streets this is not some
isolated ivory tower thing we're going
into the middle of Lagos to help people
are make cool things this is a little
bit strange picture well the guy on the
right with the face on the left is a UX
designer who went with me so we're not
only teaching mobile developments but
we're teaching the entire process of how
to make a good start up company I've
been an entrepreneur for 10 years I
understand something about this and with
minkos help we teach them UX we teach
them the process of being agile and we
teach them the technology in a very
intensive way and then we follow up
after are the training on site with
remote skype help our own company arm
has a notion that people should be happy
and enjoy what they're doing that we try
to transfer that the types of phones
that we're dealing with you may not be
familiar with some of them have dual sim
this is important for people to save
money they can trade around they can
have a spare sim so they're always
looking for the best deal this phone
costs something on the order of seventy
eighty dollars it's not expensive but
it's a full touch device and it can run
apps
and it can run them wicked fast in some
cases faster than a high-end Android
device the main limitation of this phone
is it doesn't have a lot of RAM so
you're working in a small memory space
it's a real man's sport to make good
apps on this but I love it and in
Nigeria they have some real men this is
an asha 306 are the same phone but
instead of dual sim it's got Wi-Fi the
311 here we're getting to the high end a
hundred dollars maybe 110 dollars and
this has 5-point capacitive multi-touch
it has accelerometers arm it's a very
nice phone for not much money now why
are these guys developing for nokia
Series 40 you guys aren't developing for
nokia series 40 right they don't even
sell that phone here you want the latest
coolest Android I've got a nice windows
phone oops that's not running java well
it's a cousin of Java but yeah they
can't see me so they don't know what
phone that was the the point is look at
that 675 million phones in active use
Nokia doesn't talk about this I don't
know why but I don't work for nokia so
i'm going to say what I think that is
roughly double the number of phones in
active use of you name it android
okay yeah well the market in Iceland is
different because you guys know what a
drinking phone is right that's the cheap
series 40 you take with you so when you
fall down in the snow you know you don't
break your more expensive device there
there are differences we do develop
those apps and you get all of the the
big-name apps there the app store is not
as big in developed world because a lot
of us a lot of the designers are here
one of the problems the Nigerians have
is there aren't any design schools there
are no designers they have to hire in
some of them are hiring a designer out
of the UK or they're asking us for
quotes and I'm like you don't want to
pay our rates it's crazy like we are an
expensive consultancy that is hired by
operators and such so I refuse to take
their money we try to help them and then
get them in contact with a long term
support that will do the design the
Nokia Store has a large number of
downloads per day but look at the number
of items in the store I don't know why
they brag how many items are in android
store or iphone store because i want to
go to the opposite i want to go to the
undiscovered country and that's what i
think this is these guys are very
motivated I don't have to tell them this
they know it they see it on the street
we give them the numbers in there like
yeah yeah let's go but it is difficult
to make a nice UI on this phone relative
to our for example a code behind
metaphor that you have with xml and and
other things you don't have that here
you need to write it as procedural like
painting on a canvas or you can use the
relatively easy form based stuff we show
you that in some of the other sessions
but there's a lot of opportunity these
are the guys are really good I have to
say this is one of the best groups I'd
ever trained I was stunned some of them
like you walk up to the guy and he's
like tell him I'm from helsinki's like
oh yeah I've been there a few times and
they've been living in the UK they've
been training in other places many of
them go back and some of them are self
educated there but they all have a real
desire to do something for Nigeria and
for themselves their nationalistic and
proud and they want to make a difference
this is the co-creation hub that tunji
and his partners have put together it's
a very nice space the two top floors of
a small tower and one of their sponsors
gave them internet but they had to build
a tower to get a microwave transceiver
on the roof to get really high bandwidth
internet and that's how they suck the
guys in because it's a nice place to go
to air-conditioned lots of open space
trainings like this for free and from
this collection of good they can select
the great and those are the ones which
it's my privilege to work with these are
the applications that we have to talk
about I have some videos from some of
them let's look at the first one and
then we'll switch over and watch a
little video so you can meet the guy's
arm in in the videos i only have three
videos Don pho is the name for this mini
boss the local transport the guys were
really excited about this game because
this is version to version one was a
huge hit and you should have seen how
crazy the guys they were laughing and
having fun because this is a cool game
it's it's like a comedian who you know
is funny walks into the room because
everybody loves these things they've got
the music pumping and the guys yelling
and they're you know they're enjoying
life and this is part of it playing the
game because you have to pick up
passengers and weave through traffic and
do all the crazy stuff that a downfall
driver does together with Nokia they ran
some contests giving away cash arm
they've got a huge number of downloads
bios a great guy it's really a pleasure
to work with companies like this my cash
my cash is a cash management system but
actually first let's go back what's
different about Don fo if you like
you've got great designers here why
can't you make this game in San
Francisco that's really the thing I'd
like you to think about what's different
yeah yeah I didn't know what it down for
was actually wrote in one that it's
called the motto doing in Nairobi but
it's dangerous yeah it's while um but
let's look at my cash and then we'll
watch some videos so my cash and ask
yourself what what is different here
making designing a mobile app and
building it for the Nigerian market
versus what you do here this is a cash
management application so you're going
around you want to keep track of your
money you type it in right away and you
can get all of your accounts they're
going to link it for a payments and
other things but right now it's a cash
management application
really skilled guys again very motivated
putting together an application that
looks and runs well one of my beliefs as
a as a developer who does a lot of
front-end development is I'm obsessed
with performance so an app like this if
it's going to be in your pocket it
really needs to start instantly and this
is a good example you can click the
button and it fires up faster than on an
Android or an iPhone and you can get in
there do your stuff and get out so it's
very pain free to run an app like this
on these phones arm but what's different
why wouldn't you design this app this
way for San Francisco audience
any thoughts no more cash in America
that's a good answer this is a
cash-based society so they're not
getting their financial history from a
credit card receipt at the end of the
month arm a lot of people on the street
they may have a nice phone or a decent
like low-end phone but they don't
necessarily have a bank account so this
is actually quite important it's they're
living in a different frame of reference
a different environment and so it's it's
important to have the skilled local
developers have access to the best
techniques and technology so that they
can make good apps for that market let's
see if we can get some video here
so this is my cash
it's just a quick screencast you can see
one of the earlier pre-release versions
of the app as he's going through and
using it this phone is an emulator for
the nokias x-302 which is a touching
type device so this is two generations
old touch screen at the top multi tap
keyboard at the bottom these devices are
still sold on and not so different from
the newest devices there are a lot of
new AP is that you can get since then
but the look and feel of the UI tends to
be a bit different on this phone gives
you some idea
let's see
hello everyone my age recreate and
absolutely people six months ago the
corporation organized deposits are let's
check
the whole purpose of tech medication was
to see how we introduce technology to
solve some problems in Nigeria
that weekend some ethical was formed you
enter how to invest
there was an estimated 1.5 million
candidates that sucks four white
assistants
information idea has it that 61 cents of
the opposite building never exams for
the year when you better the United
States video it
empty sucks
these are the doctors lawyers bankers
engineers and even the teachers of the
year
the truth is I nomas video is no longer
used
something has to be done
so the contributing factors include non
personalized learning if you notice
there is an increased globally and the
number of self-paced online learning
because we learn not only different ways
but are different ways infrastructure's
and educates especially for a change
those classrooms are outdoors without
windows sometimes when without roofs and
it's amazing that in the 21st century in
certain schools exist without teachers
for key subjects such as plants english
physics government Jagran finally of
course all these factors open together
motivation is low on part of the student
as well as teacher a solution of people
is a social mobile quiz platform
designed to enhance learning through
self-assessment what f equal 62 is to
make students responsible for the
adrenaline and to reward students who
perform hi possible Africa scranton
targeted targeted ads student in casinos
accomplished at soil and such content is
not really tight national senior
secondary curriculum what is provided by
Nigerian publishers now some of the key
features on a people are of how good the
cost analysis Chile reason ss1 students
in legal scrummage he gets home from
school when Woodstock hydrocarbons in
chemistry he launches their people are
protected with this gets this round and
then challenges his friends will go
unchecked another key feature is
standardized contact this is especially
important for students in shuttle
computers because the content on a free
quote is gotten from a physical action
publishes it means that no matter the
school are no matter challenge that you
are given a level playing field to excel
people people also feature social
expression so friends can challenge
their friends on social media then i'd
share their scores people also features
in start scoring Franklin need aboard
this is important because students are
challenged positive when they see their
score is a lot of their kids
we also have geographical map in this
important so that we know the students
are excelling in certain areas and
students who need help in other unions
fickle available freely for download on
local spots across home as well as local
chapa low end phones there's also an
android version why android by asking
samsung galaxy salad possibilities to
entry-level smartphones i can purchase
part was for less than x equal to an IRA
and then we have the mobile web pressure
for other platforms not currently
supported
now the offical team has achieved some
level of success
the internet for jobs competition
organized by the Nigeria Internet as
well as we were also gonna first round
winners of the Android African Charlotte
currently the team is working towards
completing all kinds of all platforms
and decent product to the market on
behalf of symmetrical I say thank you
for watching I asked them to be brief
but they have a lot to say and if it
goes one of the cases we'll talk about
our next they they have a very
interesting product we have a bit
shorter one here mobile developer I
develop on j2me blackberry and also
Android I developed an application
called my cache which is an expense
tracking application and the main reason
is to help people manage the expenses
their love solutions available for
Android you know blackberry iphone but
for jtm it has actually been neglected
for a couple of years mainly because a
lot of developers are moved on to other
platforms so the goal was actually to
create a really rich experience tracking
experience on low-end devices low-end
devices are still very much predominant
here in Africa and that was the main
goal currently the expense tracking
application has gotten over 20,000
downloads and we were named the first
price for the nokia create for millions
in west africa and we've also developed
the expense tracking application to
house on advanced features like snapping
of expense receipts and there's also a
tip search functionality we've tried to
keep it to a minimum to you not to go or
blow to the application with too many
unnecessary things and also listened for
user feedback on the things that they
actually want especially in the expense
application thank you very much um I
asked them to keep it short and informal
I'll and those were just sort of last
minute you know if they could show up
and just sort of quickly introduce
themselves that's the style that we
wanted
the guy is totally brilliant we went
through some brainstorming sessions and
he just came up with bang bang bang
things that made my head spin really
really nice creative talent so let's see
what happened to our PowerPoint there I
can do this without falling so my cache
has a high retention rate and some of
these teams are one person some of them
are 46 people so they tend to be pretty
small focused startups at the stage that
we're going through and training them
and then we follow them through ticket
mobile is a what it sounds like mobile
ticketing solution arm again ask
yourself what's different this is not
the bart you've got a very different
public infrastructure for transportation
a much more complicated problem and it's
a good example of where mobile can
really make a difference in people's
lives and add some structure add some
modern infrastructure to how you go
about purchasing and spending the ticket
directly from your phone and planning
the trip so very nice services that are
coming to people on these devices the
users can buy a ticket they can plan
everything out they can see what the
latest changes are armed and they're
working to get more and more vendors
involved in the process here are some
screenshots they give you an idea again
a designer in Finland wouldn't choose
this color scheme our fins like they're
blue and why
nokia logo in Africa they like it bright
it's important that they have more
design skills there that's one of the
things we're hoping to help them with
going forward ah they're looking to get
more users and partners and sell a lot
more tickets so they're still in the
growth ramp-up phase nien go mobile r is
a mobile history quiz so in a country
where the education system is up and
down people love to know their history
they love to know their local history
arm and they love to talk about things
and get quizzed on them and that's what
this is tapping into it's a edge
attainment type of game Oh victor is a
really nice guy the app you can see here
has different sections and you can go
through and choose different elements
and find out more about your own country
at the same time that you're being
entertained so it's a different format
from a traditional book about history
it's much more interactive ah the
history quiz game looking to expand the
team and add the app to some of the
nearby countries so it's a concept that
can be replicated as they go forward
ethical you saw the video where she was
discussing this is also a mobile quiz
platform but this is aimed at school
children so when you go home you might
not have a computer at home but you may
well have a nokia phone and you will
have our assignments that you can do
quizzes and reviews and
you can get instant feedback on that
they have a pretty big team actually
they were the team was formed ethical
means bookworms in the local language so
this is a sort of a nickname so for
people who like to do book warming
things they can play around and do
scoring and again learn pretty big team
I believe that they actually came
together some of these teams have been
assembled around the CC hub so they
might have met each other they might
have been involved in a contest or
something that's going on there yeah
decade hackathon and they won and they
move forward from there so it really is
forming and creating new businesses are
they have a variety of clients they also
have mobile web and here are some
screenshots showing you the different
areas obviously getting a large amount
of content is a challenge take some time
but it's a nice idea and they're doing
pilots and going on with that nine
reality is not educational this is pure
entertainment they have partnerships
with various local TV shows and if you
love to talk about your latest reality
TV show this is a place where you can do
it because if you're not going to go
into a website and chat about that show
or go into Facebook you can do it here
more effectively um you can get updates
and meet other people who have a common
interest in that space so nigerian idol
big bro
jinsol dance all these are the types of
local content shows that they're going
after again think to yourself the design
is different the context of use is
different just like building an app for
a pc and building it for a phone is
different building it for phone in the
US and building it for a phone in
nigeria takes a different mindset and
here's a typical user a lot of the
mobile phone growth in nigeria and other
developing countries is with young
people a lot of young people they want
the cool stuff they don't necessarily
have the money for an iphone or an
android or they might have the money for
a low end android but then they have to
choose do they want to phone that lasts
3-4 days on a charge or a phone that
last half a day um they're practical
factors quality of build voice quality
but getting the good apps android has
more apps so getting the good apps is
what we're focused on ah again i really
enjoyed working with these guys i look
forward to seeing them i'll be going
back again in a few weeks i was going to
go back immediately after java one so i
was going to be on a plane for four days
straight but fortunately it's been
delayed a little bit tracklist
this is essentially amazon for nigeria
so mo too has the idea of giving a
website and associated web service that
you can access from your phone that
helps you buy things find things and
making it very easy for any local shop
to put their inventory on the net on the
mobile net because that's the primary
mechanism he has a nice website very
attractive well designed and adding more
and more shops all the time and putting
this same package on the phones is the
challenge making it easy and compelling
so that the store across the street from
you can have this type of interface on
the phone from the guy down the street
and then you know where to go you can
comparison shop you get more efficient
infrastructure very important
developments so these are very concrete
ways that I'm not sure how that should
be pronounced hua sarees very important
developments in terms of helping
people's lives when Nokia talks about
connecting people this is the concrete
result the Nokia growth Academy here
Massa Reese is about job search helping
people find jobs so you put your data in
you get a push SMS notification and the
app white wakes up when there's a job
that matches your criteria no matter
where you are one of the differences in
Africa is that's the best way to do push
ah it works even if you don't have
mobile data in that location
it is a nice concept and I hope that
they can help a lot of people get jobs
um I'd like to know what you guys think
did you learn anything about what it's
like to be in Nigeria building mobile
apps does it give you a flavor to
actually see some of the apps to meet
some of the people because that's kind
of rare in my experience you are you
hear about people buying phones in
Africa or China or India but you don't
really get to experience it and thank
you I'd like to take some questions and
the more questions you ask the more
likely you are to walk away with a nice
toy so please fire away no everybody
except Michael yes
nothing so it's up to individuals are
like Dungey excuse me like Dungey who
want to make a difference the issue with
Nigeria is a little bit special they
discovered oil and whereas they used to
be one of the bread baskets of Africa a
lot of farming a lot of industry as soon
as the oil was discovered all the
government guys sort of dropped their
shovels and went and just started
arguing over who gets the money and how
its divided so the infrastructure is
horrible the rolling blackouts in Lagos
are a daily occurrence there's not
enough electricity to light up the whole
town of I don't know seven million
people nobody knows exactly seven to
nine million something like this so
investing in mobile infrastructure is
pretty far down the list of needs they
need running water so you don't need to
have a water tower on top of every
building and a generator in front of
every building so that it can keep power
when the power goes out so all of the
mobile development has come from
entrepreneurs companies coming in
there's some companies that come in like
I believe one of the big operators
started in South Africa there are some
Indian companies and the Chinese coming
and it's it's a big market everybody
knows the potential but it's a little
bit confused at the moment because of
the politics
the local Wi-Fi or are you you have
local Wi-Fi in a place like CC hub you
don't have it in the local coffee shop
usually arm you might have it at home if
you have internet there but the
connection tends to be pretty low
bandwidth in and spotty so it's it's not
just the local connection but the whole
backhaul infrastructure is a bit
overloaded they did add a under C fiber
which circumnavigates Africa and touches
ground in a number of places and that's
made a huge difference in terms of
developing the Internet infrastructure
there but I don't actually know exactly
how good mobile data connectivity is as
you're building an application mobile
web for example is not a practical
example thing that you would want to
design around for this market not for
this particular market anyway I suppose
in India it's much more developed and
much more likely to function well but if
you leave the city I wouldn't expect to
have mobile data so you may want to use
SMS push to send the data around hit
small chunks when an SMS tends to work
quite well and you can do it directly
peer-to-peer with serious 40 yes
um some of them have have studied in the
UK and in other places some of them have
been self-taught so I think self-taught
is more likely they're local schools
that will teach you this in that but I'm
not sure to what level so just like
anywhere the really good guys learn it
because they love it and they teach
themselves i'm going to start handing
out the goodies to get you guys talking
let's see well if you go south it's
worse if you go north it's better in
that particular coast ghana is supposed
to be one of the stable very nice places
that I I hope to get invited to go to
arm Sierra Leone to the south where I
was born he's like it was when I was
born gun firing the streets type of
place there's not active gunfire at the
moment but it's pretty much destroyed so
if I can separate these out there you go
keep all you know some finish very nice
thank you a lot of things okay and I
think I have to take my wire off yeah
yeah any more questions or concerns
ideas
yes yes it's it's local to Lagos only
with the Nokia growth Academy we hope to
find similar partners elsewhere but um
TAMUK erv who started that inside of
nokia has been working in Africa for
