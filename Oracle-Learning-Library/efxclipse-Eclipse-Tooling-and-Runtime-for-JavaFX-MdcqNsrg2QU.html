co-founder of a small company located in
Austria Central Europe
I'm Eclipse committee at various Eclipse
projects starting from a four to
platform UI and going over to EMF and
I'm the main developer of the tool I'm
going to present at runtime I'm going to
present today I through the handlers at
Thompson Tom so some words about ethics
clips the project I'm working on
it's an open source project led by best
solution all sources we are developing
are provided on the EPL so you can use
them for free you can even modify them
but if you modify our sources we expect
that you give back what you modified but
you can use it for free we start the
project or I start the project in summer
2011 and it's now one year old a little
bit more than one year and I think of
showing it really interesting and cool
stuff that we accomplished in this time
we release quite often so I try to
release every six to eight weeks and
each release gets downloaded by around
2,500 times per release so it's the best
open source stuff I ever released so
that that many people are downloading it
every six weeks we have community
support at our home page and you get
commercial support for the stuff I'm
presenting from our company what you
should take away from this talk that's
all the most important things is Java FX
2 is really a great technology to create
really good-looking you eyes you can
really create really astonishing looking
fresh looking you eyes using this
technology but the oceans should get
with you is that if not only NetBeans
that provides tooling for Java FX
development it's also the clips that we
provide stuff for you so if you are
Eclipse user you're not forced to switch
over to NetBeans to write Java FX
applications
and one more thing you should take away
from this talk is that not everything
that comes from eclipse is bound to SWT
so many people think that everything
that comes from eclipse they have to use
SWT to make it work but that's not true
most technologies develop that eclipses
are don't use Authority at all
they don't care about SWT so the
eclipses are Arabic the project is split
in two parts the first part is about the
tooling so that we provide you tools for
developing JavaFX application but they
don't stop at the tooling level we also
provide you stuff for the runtimes so
when you have JavaFX applications we
provide you support for is GI and all
the stuff so we don't stop at the
tooling but also go into the runtime so
that when you run the application we
provide components you can use for free
so that the applications are better
structured more maintainable and all the
stuff is provided by this project so
when we talk about JavaFX applications
well what they are build off are in fact
they're using Java so use plain Java to
write Java effects applications you
don't have learn any new language like
it was in the old days with Java FX 1 so
what we can provide as a tooling
provider is we can provide you a class
buff container that finds the child
effects libraries on your system the
problem until now is still the Java FX
is not part of the boot strap class path
so you have to add it as an extra charge
to your class of the new boot up your
applications and that's true even for
IDs they have to find out where your
Java FX jar is located since I think
Java 7 use u6 update 6 they ship
Java FX as part of Java 7 but they ship
it but they don't put it on the boot
class buff so you have to edit your own
or have tooling that does it for you so
we're providing a classpath container
for eclipse so that Eclipse finds out
your Java FX char on the system and add
it
the class posted I can write easily Java
effects applications naturally we
provide Wizards like project Wizards
that help you together projects rotate
started to get everything set up for you
without having do it everything manually
the next thing that you use when you add
java fax applications you have to use
CSS I think so it's fairly impossible to
write a Java fax application without
using CSS the problem is that CSS does
normally Britain for IDs near for web
development so Java FX has all its own
properties it has its own meanings and
stuff so you need a specialized editor
for CSS to really make use of Java
effects stuff so it's really important
that you have a good CSS edge or
whenever you write Java effects
applications so that's why we started
writing a custom editor not reusing the
one you get for web development but we
bootstrapped a completely new one using
a texture framework called X text that
you can create your own DSL and the CSS
is nothing more than a DSL to explain
how things should look like it's a deal
solitude domain-specific language for
styling right so nothing more and the
last thing you are not forced to but
it's encouraged that we use F XML to
create your UIs
you get the scene builder tool to do it
visually but I'm not a guy that likes to
click around and drag things around I'm
more better at typing stuff I'm a
developer I'm not a designer or
something like that
so we developed a specialized XML editor
that really helps you to write F XML
files by hand and ethics in Mal itself
is nothing more than a sterilization of
an object graphs so you type it and then
you TC utilize the runtime and get up
here note your scene graph out of the
XML file and the last thing that gel
effects comes with is a specialized arm
tasks that you can package up your
applications to a native are
Windows MSI installer X a dmg file for
mac RPM packages so we provide you an
extra editor that helps you to configure
the tooling yet no you cannot always ask
questions
well while CSS itself has a sus as the
meaning of selectors so selectors I
think they are not supporting everything
that you get from css3 selectors that's
a subset of it but it has its own
properties so for example you have - FX
background color they have special
things that you can set a padding or an
age gap on an H box for example so those
properties are not part of this year's
al spec in fact they are part of the
HTML spec HTML says you can put a
padding on a note or on a on a span or
on add if it's not the CSS spec that
tells you that and that's what our
editors does it provides you specialized
typing but I will present the tooling
and probably see it right so I wanted to
talk about while chavo facts lets you
package up the application as an install
MSI installer dmg package so it has
extra on tasks and we have an editor to
help you to define information the arm
task needs for input to generate your
application that become installed so now
it's the first time I'm going to present
the basic tooling functions that just
described it helps you bootstrap an
application traded and edit an FX and
mal file connect to a controller
whenever you have to execute code in you
have to FX in alpha but Specter the
format then you want to run code you
must connect it to a Java class or a
scripting class the show I'll show you
how to edit a CSS stylesheet and how to
export the application
so we have a specialized project
research that allows you to create a
project that's sample and fix - I'm
using eclipse for but these supports are
upwards eclipse 3.7 and 3.8 so this is
Eclipse for up to 1 in this manner but
we support all flavors of Eclipse and we
are not going to raise the level so we
will stay at least another year on the
lowest level is 3.7 so that's what are
you going to support so I've now created
a project for me I create a package
sample and here I have another research
that allows me to create a Java FX main
class my sample so when you look at the
Java effects main class
it simply extends a base class from Java
FX it's called application and then you
have the main method and call launch and
then this is where your main application
starts so you create a border paint it's
the big enough for you in the back so do
you see the code or should I make it
bigger yeah
you can download it from our homepage
that's I had it on the first slide I
think so it's you get it from
from here
let's we provide you a complete download
of eclipse compact with JavaFX or you
can use an update site to install it in
your host eclipse so the easiest part is
downloading a complete Eclipse bundled
with the JavaFX tooling so that's the
easiest you can download it it started
in a minute so the wizard created a
class that extends the application class
R now create a border plane and that's
normal Eclipse Java tooling so nothing
special in here hello jae-hwan then we
need to create a scene
very positive order pain we've passed
the scene sorry okay set scene then they
give it a size set wife 205 200 and so
that's all we need to do to have a basic
job of X application then they can
simply launch the application it should
get up this example application so we
are similar hello world example for
JavaFX applications so that it said well
we now have our our example this only
using Java but the best thing would be
if we use and that if we export the
application with it then we have a
specialist editor it's not redrawing so
this editor is used to help you to
configure the on task I talked about and
every app export the application you
want to have an installable application
so this editor allows me to insert my
company's name the application version
I'm using it asks me for the main class
the application starts with and then I
have down here I can say I want to
package it for native packaging so then
when I export the application it creates
a built XML file on the left hand here
and now kicks off in case of Mac it
creates a a dmg package which is used in
Mac to install the application in this
case it also packaged in the complete
GDK so the users don't have to have Java
installed on the system everything comes
in with this dmg package so even
thinking future its would be even
possible to put it on the App Store like
this so that's what I think our crews
working at
so now the packaging is done and on the
left hand side we have an a deploy
folder we have bundles we have the DMD
package and that would be default Java
neck installation of applications so it
should open the GMD somewhere
it is not here just here it is the team
freefall so I'd simply move it to my
Applications folder and then I can
launch the application like I would
always say Oh
being a Kearney not supporting maven the
problem with maven is that while you
have to tell me even first where it has
to find the JavaFX jar as well and it
compiles things so we didn't looked at
maven at the moment so I can give you an
answer for that
ok so this was the easiest application
lifecycle the next thing I'd like to
show is our tooling support for effects
similarities so we create an FX in
little file we can leave it as a border
pane it's sample and an ethics and mal
file is simply this F XML description
it's a port of pain and then we now want
to do the same thing we did in Java we
need to have Center the nice thing is we
have integration to the Java world so
when you have a or Center we know in
Java we have to call a set of effort and
be simply in for that we can show the
Chava talk of the setter method so you
get all informations you get in a Java
tooling as well but editing the XML file
so the center and in here we can create
our button and then we can have a text
attribute hello jae-hwan the nice thing
about editing the effects in our file is
that is decorative so what we have in
here is I can show you a preview value
editing the file so we have
tap down there but shall shows live what
you're doing on the upper hand so when I
change something here or add some things
then immediately see what you're doing
so you get what this is got the cat
feeling while editing the effects in
alpha so as I said I think I'm I'm a lot
faster doing the editing by hand and
dragging things around but that's my
personal opinion so now we have the FX
in alpha now we need to film it and for
this we need our CSS so we create a CSS
file new order
sample CSS and if you now have our
button we want to connect our CSS file
and the preview to the CSS file so what
we insert here is a simple information
that says sample CSS another nice thing
is when I go down here and for example
we declared a button to for example
having @fx padding with 10 it really
gets applied to make it 20 that usage
really so glad you're adding the CSS
file veeery applying the CSS on the
black preview and see what you're doing
with CSS on the fly as you saw you get
out the completion support so those are
all the special attributes that you can
send on JavaFX nodes so we provide you
information about them and the last
feature in the last release we added was
many over is you see the declaration
what is behind the scenes so ethics
padding you can put one value as a size
or you can put four values the left top
bottom we show you the information about
it we even allow you to tour down if you
want to know what is the size then click
on the size a size tells you okay its
length or percentage and if you click on
a length or percentage then you see a
length or is made of a double value and
and afterwards you have pixel or
millimeters or centimeters or points in
the end so all those informations are
provided by the tooling for you we even
use this information that we have
collected in here to provide the outer
base the wizard that helps you to
specify it really knows what you want to
do so it really helps you about the
completion even values not only the
attributes right so in the next in this
release we simply do the other
completion stuff where an extra is we're
going to use this information to
validate your CSS on-the-fly the real
nice thing about this is assets and
everything in Java effects is that well
you can
create your own control with your own
property set so we have to have a story
that helps you out helps that allows you
to teach the tooling what properties you
provide to us so that's why we created a
small new language which allows us to
define what's going on under see behind
the scenes and then we look here here in
here we find the padding the padding is
defined here so that's our language that
tells ok we are in a region it's up here
all the specifications will be our
region a region expands in seeing and
telefax apparent and that why we know
what properties are available so we have
a structured format to store information
and you if you create your own control
you could create your own CSS text file
provided to us and we can add it to our
outer completion story so in future we
research the class path for those files
if they're there will help the tooling
to help you ok
that's the main story about the main
stuff then you use Java effects for Java
FX development so let it be left off
here we left off so next thing is some
advanced tooling that we provide it's
not only the basic stuff but the first
thing well I was not happy at the
beginning with F F F F XML an XML XML is
a very noisy former's so I created a
small language that are called ethics
graph that has a JavaScript object
notation like syntax so it feels much
more natural to create an object graph
using javascript object object notation
and this language compiles to F XML in
the end it doesn't compile the bytecode
but it creates effects similar at the
back end then we have some tooling for
SGI so that you have all your
applications or booster powers jf leak
applications and they provide you an SVG
converter that allows you to take an SVG
convert it to F XML the converter is
written in Java pure Java in the end
so you can use it even on your web
server to pre create effects in Mal
files of F of s SVG so I'd like to
present you in a short demo the tooling
ethics draft tooling so instead of
creating a fix email file I create an
ethics graph file this time I use a
great plain that's fine so as you see
here that sentence is well similar to
JavaScript object notation it also
provides you all out the completion
stuff so I can go here and say I want to
have a button and the button has a text
hello
jaywalk so that's the same thing you see
and on the left hand side I create the
ethics graph file and by that also the
sample ethics in alpha got created
whenever I hit safe i generate the XML
file out of the ethics graph information
the nice thing in years you have out the
completion for all and everything so I
say start with then is start with our
sample CSS so we apply the sample CSS
and then they can say controlled by and
then they can give it a Java class they
can set the controller on so now if you
control a Java class whenever I hit the
button I want to run a method on the
Java class so I'm here in Java vexy say
on action controller method and then it
looks at this controller class and finds
that oh there is a method hello world
it's annotated with a XML and it
presents its you that you can say okay
that's it I'm now connected my F XML
file to the Java control Amanda run the
class and hit the button then the cloud
Java controller method in here is
executed that's the method in here do
not even do that if you have a problem
in here we show you that there's a
warning and the provide you with quick
fixes okay it finds out there is no
Holabird method in there would you like
to create one in your controller hit
this one then my controller magically
gets a new method hello world one so all
the things that you expect from
tooling in chav are
and you're used to in your Java world
out here for F XML even that's not only
a thing that is part of a fixed graph
even in the XML but we can do the same
so you get the sink out the completion
syntax and values in letter use ethics
graph or or something different a nice
little feature of ethics graph is that
well normally when you do designing then
it helps you to see the grid lines for a
grid right so you don't see you it
really but it's around here there's a
liner on the problem is that it's good
at design time but at runtime you don't
want to see the grid lines so what we
have in Java in ethics graph is we can
prefix such an attribute with preview
then the previous shows the grid lines
but the resulting FX and alpha doesn't
hold those attributes so you can really
make up your UI because things change if
you have a drop-down box with a long
value in it it gets bigger so it might
destroy your design and see you can try
things out using the preview keyword
because in the resulting effects ml file
it's not there it's only there for the
preview in your IDE right so that's a
quite little nice feature that we have
okay now that's for a little bit more
advanced tooling let's go back to the
slides and now switch over to the basic
runtime stuff that we provide well I'm
coming from Eclipse Eclipse is based in
the West GI Java vex itself has problems
of OSGi but the first thing that we
provide is more for ordinary trouble
develops we have some layer panels that
you will feel familiar with as to rutile
a outs then they have a grid layout we
have a row layout which are not part of
Java effects we have some dialogs which
mimics the the idea of the SWT and
Chaifetz dialogs we have F XML and
choose integration and as I just said
well the most important thing for us of
Eclipse is that we use OSGi so whenever
used something in the clips of want to
use it in Eclipse you have to use it by
using always
so the problem here is that JavaFX
is not on the poot classpath it's not
even SPECT so moisture has no idea where
it has to find it so the idea that I had
or what the way I thought was there's
something called a clinics extensions
but it can add classloader hooks to find
well you are asked if a class is
searched and I will then locate on the
system the travel effects chart for you
so this helps integrating Java effects
into the OSGi world hopefully this will
go away in about one or two releases or
updates because then JavaFX is going to
be on the poot class buff even on Java 7
on Java 8 it's for sure I think it's
already now or it's going to pee but on
Java 7 it's still on the book class path
but we'll get there and then they can
get away without the extension that we
are providing let me show you how you
can create a chav effects OSGi
application naturally one swore we have
a wizard
so you can create it's called a plug-in
project sample OSGi - let me select you
want to create a Java effects
application they don't want to switch
and now we have something similar that
we had before but now we are in osg I
said oh we don't extend anymore the
basic application class from OSGi but
the extend the base class that's coming
from the ethics Clips runtime project in
the end you get some more information
you get the so called I application
context and eclipse that's what you get
when you start and always chalak ation
and eclipse so it holds all the
parameters you passed in as command-line
parameters and all this stuff but it's
quite similar we see the code is there
afterwards is completed completely the
same that it is for ordinary Java
applications but they can now have run
it as an OSGi application so really
running on OSGi it's not any more
plain old plain java application but
it's really puts
jep's those GI environment and then
brings up your complete application so
you get all the modern model arity stuff
from OSGi you're used to already
together with Java of X as a new cool UI
technology what you can do with this I
can show you in a small demo because
I've written a small IDE using Java FX
gdt core the compiler that comes with
Eclipse and the web integration of Java
FX I have already here a project I can
create here a new class I have now the
completion or something like that yeah
but in the end I have a small editor
with syntax highlighting on the right
public void main static void main static
void main string parks
out went long hello chaewon and then the
nice thing is that in the background
while I'm typing it's like in the clips
we out to build in the end on the
backhand the class file and can run the
classifier from anything within here
so the really cool thing is that this
writing this took me one and a half days
so I really have a small idea I know it
has now other completions all the stuff
but took me one and a half days using
OSGi technologies from eclipse which are
not bound to a stability like GED core
adding out the completion would be
probably one more day and then things
are gone things are working so that's
really I think a nice showcase what you
can do at the moment you get OSGi your
chav effects in OSGi working together
and that's really a cool thing I think
ok that's it for the OSGi stuff so
naturally what we have the basic stuff
but you have also trans stuff so
advanced stuff is for example if you
create a view for eclipse where you have
to present something like a chart they
make sense to use JavaFX we provide you
components that help you integrate
JavaFX into a view of Eclipse even we
have things to add to bootstraps stuff
then a very special thing in Java FX is
F XML and F XML and the loading of OSGi
they don't really work together I will
show in a minute divided that's so we
help you or provide support that you can
easily deal with F XML inside an OSGi
container and we provide you a very
special thing it's called F or Enders
the Eclipse for framework which this
Eclipse is build upon doesn't really
depend on testability is you can rip out
SWT and replace it with Java effects and
you have a modern RCP platform which
uses not as the tea or swing but pure
Java effects but you get a really cool
platform
and we have support for Changi unit
testing so you can put stripper chummy
unit test from it so that you can
Outlook test your applications on your
continuous integration servers so the
problem with Ericsson Island osg is that
noise jar you have almost this
visibility thing so if you don't depend
on something you can't see it the
problem is that we have our application
we have our controller in there probably
have our custom control and we have our
FX an alpha
on the other hand we have a bundle of
the ethic at the FX bundle which holds
the fix ml loader class and as I said F
XML is nothing than a serialization of
an object graph so in the XML loader
loads the XML file it tries to create
instances of classes the problem is that
the visibility rules you know SG I tell
you my app bundle can see the effects
bundle but the FX bundle can't see my
app bundle so it can't load classes from
there
so that's the real problem you're having
when you use FX ml + OSGi so you have to
take extra care that you set a cert
class loader the class loader of the
original panel so that thing's the
lookup of classes is really working as
expect them to work in a Louis gyro so
that's where we help you with some small
features so
where is my sample di so here once more
have well in this case you have a plain
application class there is no sub
classing going on because what's
happening behind the scenes is that
we're using a dependency injection
engine that looks up everything for you
and the cool thing about the dependency
injection engine it knows a lot about
the scope you're in so it can provide
you special things I can now simply go
in here and say add inject and so-called
perfect simulator for those who ever use
dependency injection that's the way it
is then we have a factory and check that
when the class gets created this Factory
has all information it knows in which
bundle it is in it knows the class
loader and it helps you by simply not
creating or loading the class using
factory then we can say we load the
class relative to ourselves to
application class or we load it relative
to the bundle which is the root class
path of your OSGi bundle in this case
it's relative to us I think and named
the cloud affection alpha Sam bo F XML
more than one thing yes I have to call
load afterwards
wrap it cast it and then drop it and
surround of try/catch
what's turn
No so this injection stuff helps you
really you don't have to set the class
loader you can load things relative to
your own class and its really well
normally you have to write ten lines of
code instead of this one to get things
working in OSGi and this simple
injection stuff helps you simply writing
this and loading the stuff you're used
to it using the helpers we provide to
you so it really gives you very small
code instead of writing ten lines of
boilerplate code when you're running in
OSGi with FX ml so I already talked
short about the clips for stuff so the
clips for framework that's the core of
it eclipse 4 is well attached the GRE
there's no SGI it has the eclipse 4
application platform which is content of
that the banners injection container a
service model a workbench model but the
really important thing that that has to
be T on on the outer side it's really
not part of the core framework so when
you use only the blue parts you don't
depend on the stability but you get a
really modern application framework to
write your application and what I did a
simply replaced has to be T through Java
FX so instead of rendering all the UI
like Eclipse does it was a SWT are
simply render the UI using Java FX I can
show you short how such an application
looks like
here it is so we can launch it sample
you for this is a small application so
it can double-click you can minimize and
maximize your stuff
well you get things for free naturally
you can for example pin a part to the
bottom so moving things around you can
detach them in new window so now that
you've got attached all the stuff you
get for free from the framework so all
the windowing the plugging and all the
stuff they're provided by eclipse for to
you the only thing we do we simply
provided a renderer that you can use
instead of SWT so that's really what the
nice thing is you can really watch
videos in here and scale them and well
that's all things that you get from
JavaFX it's nothing that I had to
program so that's for free but the cool
thing is yeah you can use a modern
framework with dependency injection a
service model and all the stuff for free
with your child effects applications
so although this thing is very young we
have already two commercial products
that are built upon it so one is from
Asus deliver they providing a simulation
software for Audi BMW Ford Magna
Volkswagen and others you have a
client-server application built on top
of ethics clips and efore on JavaFX
they using state-of-the-art technologies
like e4 and JavaFX and they make heavy
use of styling the application then
looks like this what they are providing
to their customers so I haven't seen it
to myself I only have two screenshots
from them but yeah I think it's quite a
cool application and the second thing
that is written on top of efore and chav
effects as a system to observe what's
going on in your factory so when the
product is going from machine to machine
you can really monitor what's going on
that's a very young company in Germany
that provides that so this is the
application this is the for application
JavaFX efore application so really
looking very very good instead of when
you have a stability it would take you
months and we've written the initial
prototype that shows those application
in two days simply because of using Java
FX e for and all the stuff it provides
to us a very nice thing what they're
using because you can monitor your your
your fat and it's a live monitoring from
the server where they get the Tata from
the machines and show where a product is
in the cycle of your fat and what
they're using they're using SVG they
sent SVG to the server they use our
converter to convert that to F XML and
then sent back the XML of the
application and then animate stuff in
the XML at the runtime so it's quite a
cool use of it ok and the last thing I'd
like to present is project after
working on I think two weeks ago I call
it FX FX for free effects for free so
you get effects for free so it's really
a small thing that well we have a GVM
you have OSGi and have the FX free
desktop above it and then you have
so-called apps in there you have a
browser app you have a media app you
have your calculator app and they're
separate from each other using OSGi
technologies you can create deep can
create departments inside your
application and be using this tech
technology to really separate your
applications and when you run such an
application it looks like this so you
can launch for example the browser go in
here say go and then you go to that page
so it's a simple one of the simplest
application in this framework what's
really nice is integrate integration if
you write an application let's say we
write an application for Java one so we
have very smile so an application is
here's the application so we want to
have an application that says hello to
Chavo one hello Java one we saved this
one and then all we need to do to
install the application is we drag it
down here now we have the application in
our running application we click it it
opens and says hello Java one so this is
all done using plain OSGi technologies
Ohr is a really dynamic system so it
allows you to install and uninstall
stuff at runtime and that's what we are
simply using here dragging over some
file it locates the file of a system and
installs it into the oyster environment
and then you can put up your
applications now now imagine you would
do this you use Linux then you lose user
stall at pet shop manager you bring up
the TVM they bring up OSGi and they
bring up the eff it's free desktop in
full screen models and you have a kiosk
system they can install small
applications so it's probably in the
future something that we are going to
proceed and try do to write such a
system we provided to our customers
because it could be an a very in an
environment which is very controlled
they don't have applications and
security constraints that you can really
write such do such a thing for your
company to have it on your tablets or
something like that in the entrance so
that's something you can do with the
technologies we already have now there
there you can use them and writing such
a thing is not more than a week of work
so ok that's it from well there some
credits I have to have all the I
conserve and the companies that provided
the resources to me and he wants more
you get the homepage our company's home
page and my twitter handle and yeah any
questions yeah yeah I don't think so no
well but dear going of albeit currently
working on a cross conversion so you can
convert your F XML the ethics graph and
and ethics draft back to FX M L so you
have the full cycle so you can always
decide on well you always generate the
XML so if you switched the the tool you
switch to scene builder or you switch to
NetBeans you still have two F XML file
with you I fixed graph is simply a small
little language that we invented for us
yeah it's special to F is Clips project
you know any other questions
yep
don't smoke reflection or be using
reflection of course
well we about what what the tooling does
in the backend is it loads the job the
effects in our classes or it's not a
reflection we using GTD core which was
TD has all information about our classes
in your class path and you can ask TD T
tell me which methods are there so it's
not hard coded in there so we're using
reflection on the GDD core level to find
out what classes are there what methods
do they have and if they match each
other so we're using reflection in this
way the fractions even used not only by
the ethics graph tooling but I didn't
show that but in the end when we have an
F X enough oh moriss moriss so the same
what I showed this to ethics draft
language is possibly with eczema F XML
itself so when I go here and hit control
space it shows me out there at the
controller meffert's right so it even
allows me to say that's a controller
method that's unknown when it provides
me the same quick fixes do you want to
add a controller method so be using in
the backend the memory model be using is
the same for Ethics graph and F XML
that's simply the representation in the
in the UI that is different I can show
you the code where we go through and
find out what classes are there it's not
Java reflection but Gigi decor
reflection okay any more questions
Thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
