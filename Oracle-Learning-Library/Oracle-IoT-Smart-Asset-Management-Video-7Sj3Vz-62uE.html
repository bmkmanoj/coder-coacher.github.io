demonstration of a smart asset
management system built with the Oracle
Internet of Things cloud service an
e-business suite enterprise asset
management module to do this
demonstration we'll be using two
principal components the component you
see on your left is a simulation of a
heating ventilation and air conditioning
unit this represents a physical HVAC
device that would be placed on the top
for example of a corporate building this
simulated HVAC unit has been
instrumented using the Oracle Internet
of Things cloud service client libraries
in order to deliver real-time telemetry
data into the IOT cloud service
specifically you see it is configured to
send five data values output temperature
fan vibration oil viscosity motor
amperage and target temperature on the
right hand side you see an enterprise
application which has been built on top
of the a public API for Oracle Internet
of Things cloud service and Oracle
e-business suite enterprise mass asset
management this enterprise application
gives us a unified view of real time
data coming in from our device's
location information provided by the
Internet of Things cloud service as well
as real time views into the work order
progress and history for each of the
HVAC units in our system let's begin the
demonstration we will
left-hand-side a unit from one of our
buildings for example I will select
building 300 on the right hand side I
will also select building 300 here you
can see the enterprise application
displaying the real-time telemetry data
in the right hand corner the four green
gauges indicate proper operation of the
device I can begin by simulating a short
circuit in the system the short circuit
will create an anomalous condition where
the amperage of the device fluctuates
analytics patterns that have been
designed into the Oracle Internet of
Things cloud service will constantly
review data coming through and look for
patterns that indicate potential
problems or actual problems with each of
the devices as I introduce the short
circuit you can see the real-time data
which is being sent through the cloud
service for IOT into our Enterprise
dashboard has created this red graph at
the bottom you'll notice a blue banner
has been created the blue banner
indicates that the IOT cloud service has
determined the varying voltage to be a
severe condition and in this case a work
order has been generated in EBS at this
point by clicking on the EBS link in the
bottom we can be taken directly to the
Business Suite Enterprise Asset
Management to look at the state of the
work order what we see here is a work
order has been created pre-populated
with information about the device its
location and has been dispatched to an
hv a an HVAC tech so as I turn off the
short circuit here what we have
demonstrated is in the past where
something like a short-circuit would
cause a situation that an HVAC unit
would go offline and not be repaired
until building occupants noticed there
was an issue by integrating real-time
data from our HVAC device using the
remote monitoring solution we have been
able to speed
the mean time to repair by dispatching a
tech before the problem has actually
been noticed by a building occupant so
let's take a look at how we made this
possible I'll begin by shutting down our
simulator and moving to our IOT console
here you see a dashboard view of the
Oracle Internet of Things cloud service
it gives us eye level view of all of the
devices in our deployment so here we see
we have a set of five devices messages
flowing through and we can look at
trends the first step in deploying a
solution like this is to take a set of
devices and configure them into the
system by requiring all devices to be
registered we ensure the security and
integrity of the system no device may
participate in an Oracle IOT cloud
service solution without be securely
activated if we look at a particular
device we can see that each device has a
security section which includes a device
ID and a shared secret the shared secret
was previously configured and is not
displayed here for security reasons
in addition manufacturer details and
location are stored for all devices at
the bottom we see a metadata section
this metadata is solution specific or
customer specific data that may be added
to any device in the IOT cloud service
here we are adding specifically an asset
key and a maintenance object ID in order
to help correlate data as it's being
sent through the analytics engine as
well as the correlate data with the
respective devices that have been stored
and configured into EBS now that our
devices are configured and online their
reporting data into the IOT cloud
service let's take a look at some of
that data here we can look at the
messages tab and we see data is flowing
in all data is delivered to the IOT
cloud service in the form of JSON
messages which we can see here a sample
data message for example contains the
output temperature
vibration oil viscosity motor amperage
and target temperature which we
previously discussed now that we've
if I data is flowing into the system
let's begin to look at the analytics for
an analytics perspective our analytics
pane has two major two major sections on
the top half we see the data that's
flowing in here in the form recognized
as you are n : com Oracle HVAC this is
our HVAC data stream which is being sent
into the stream Explorer module the
principal means of analytics in IOT
cloud service on the bottom of the page
what you see are the analytics rules
that have been executed and returning
data back into the IOT cloud service
finally we can look at these different
streams each you notice has an
exploration number next to it and we can
integrate those with something like our
enterprise application so here for
example I can look at our am demo
application and here you see we have
created an HTTP connector allowing us to
take data and ship it to the enterprise
application this application is defined
with a name and a description and
because it is a restful application its
endpoint is defined by a host name port
number and the URI associated with the
application here we're using a simple
HTTP basic authentication scheme what in
Meishan is being sent to this
application if we look at the streams
tab you can see specifically device data
is being sent as well as three analytic
streams these three analytic streams
combine to produce the alerts that are
then used to generate the blue banner
and the work orders so when all put
together we end up with an enterprise
application that while capable of
providing visibility into work orders
from a historical perspective is also
capable thanks to the IOT cloud service
of giving us real-time insight into the
operation of our devices and automating
creation of service requests based on
real-time data and thus overall
increasing customer satisfaction thank
you for taking the time to watch this
