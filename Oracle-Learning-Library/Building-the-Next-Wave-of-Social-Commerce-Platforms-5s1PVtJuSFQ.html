back up to our stage from sociable abs
if you hopefully we'll get a few more
people but feel free to move up to and
we look forward to hearing all about
what you're doing James and Babel have
some question and answer at the end sure
great great thank you all for coming
hope you have a nice lunch so
everybody's nice and relax and I'll
after that book you're not too sleepy my
name is James darlin i'm the vp of
engineering and CTO for a start-up in
San Francisco called sociable labs and
we are in the process of building out
social applications for commerce and the
way I'm going to structure this whole
presentation is to talk a little bit
about kind of what's involved in
building social apps and give you some
examples of you know of social commerce
applications themselves and then I think
the meat of the presentation really is
going to be talking about some of the
challenges that we've had in terms of
building social applications which i
think is applicable across the board
regardless of whatever type types of
social apps dr. building James Pierce
was here for the last presentation he
talked all about open graph and
Facebook's api's and he gave you that
perspective from facebook so I'm going
to give you a different perspective
which is that of a consumer of those
api's and the types of things that
you'll kind of run into along the way
all right so sociable labs is a small
startup based out of San Francisco we
have about 35 employees 20 of which are
engineers so we're a very tech-heavy
company we actually incubated at
Facebook back in 2009 so we were part of
the the FB fund which is Facebook's seed
funding process for small startups and
since then we've received about 10
million in funding over the past couple
of years we have about 20 customers the
primary ones are online online retailers
online you know ecommerce companies but
over the past couple of months we've
also seen a big interest in terms of
media so other media companies we're
trying trying to build a lot more social
engaging features for their for their
users all right so what is social
commerce actually found this slide on
Wikipedia can see it's a bit of a mess
and it means lots and lots of different
things you know I wonder how many people
here have heard of social commerce or or
even think they've used it at some point
a couple right how many people have
actually bought a products based on a
recommendation from a friend many more
right okay so that's kind of what social
commerce is right i mean that's one
aspect of it is doing doing things you
know such as recommendations and it kind
of intersex lots and lots of different
you know different areas things like
social community shopping user-generated
content and media but what it really
boils down to is making your shopping
experience better I've been able to give
you better recommendations on what to
purchase and what to read and that's on
the you know the end user side on the on
the enterprise side the goal is
obviously you know to drive sales and
and to use social as a technique for
driving more customers to your sites you
know to make more purchases i think the
space is really interesting i worked in
social for the past five years
everything from you know social travel
to social community and social CRM one
of the problems about social is its kind
of fluffy right it's very hard for
companies to really see if they're
making an actual roi on the investments
that are making in social Reuters big
effort right now to do you know
engagement on facebook and really do a
lot of marketing campaigns in facebook
and and other platforms but it's very
difficult to see if you're getting a
true or a lie and that and one of the
benefits of what social commerce is that
because it's tied into the actual
shopping process there's a direct
correlation between social apps and
somebody purchasing something so there's
real roi associated with it this is kind
of we you know we believe that
practically all online commerce
experiences will be social in the future
and that when you buy something there'll
be some element of your social network
that's going to influence that and
that's something that we feel pretty
strongly about and we're getting
definitely traction in the marketplace
that this is this is true all right so
what is next generation social commerce
this is kind of an overview of our
platform basically what happens is we
have a suite of JavaScript libraries
which get basically embedded into you
know ecommerce or media sites and it's a
pretty simple process of dropping
something into a website that JavaScript
library finds a dev on a page
displays an application of some shape or
form that's actually so you know
socially engaging and the application as
well as pulling in information about who
we user is it's pulling in product
information and all of that is kind of
done in a very ingestible way so the act
so the e-commerce company themselves
don't need to do a huge amount of you
know work up front as the consumers are
on those sites and engaging the
applications are capturing lots of
information about what somebody is doing
right so they're capturing information
and what somebody is looking at what
their browsing what they're shopping for
what they're purchasing what they're
liking what they're favoriting so on
right so all those actions are captured
by us and then we feed them into our
system and then we are we also share
those actions back to Facebook so a lot
of what's happening in these ecommerce
sites is being routed back to Facebook
and share it on Facebook through their
Open Graph API and then as users you
know friends of yours see those actions
on facebook they're enticed to go back
to e-commerce sites and make purchases
and see products that is a very strong
kind of a viral loop going on between
offline ecommerce sites and Facebook and
driving traffic to and from these two
different places we're also capturing a
lot of information about users what they
like and so on we do a lot of data
mining on Facebook's Open Graph API and
we have a lot of analytics that we built
around this platform too so just to give
you an example of what some of these
apps look like this application is
called targeted referral and it's
typically a way that when you're looking
at a product on an e-commerce site and
you may invite your friends to come
along and look at that product to or
even shop for it and you know you know
the reason being that your friends
typically will trust your opinion right
and often friends will purchase
something based on what somebody else
has said under the hood what this is
doing is actually identifying who are
the most appropriate friends to invite
based on their user information based on
what they've liked in the past are based
on past purchase history so there's
actually recommendation engine running
behind this this is another example of
recommendations this is a product page
that you would see on any e-commerce
site somebody's looking at this nice
handbag here
we're recommending products on the right
hand side we're recommending different
types of clothing and the reason we're
doing that you can see here at the
bottom it says why are we recommending
these and it's because you recently
mentioned these terms dresses Gucci
v-necks and so on so we're actually
looking at information that's been
posted about you on facebook to come up
with a lot more recommendations about
other types of products that you may
like in terms of how we're doing this
it's a hybrid approach of collaborative
filtering which means looking at a large
data set of users segmenting people
based on similar characteristics and
then doing product recommendations based
on users who fall into the same clusters
and then simple content-based filtering
as well so there's lots of different
techniques you can do you know you used
to do recommendations okay this is kind
of power platform looks we have a suite
of applications JavaScript applications
that got get embedded onto ecommerce
sites there's about 15 or 20 of them
most popular ones now or this concept
called seamless sharing which means all
of the actions that you take on these
offline ecommerce sites get seamlessly
shared back to Facebook gallery which is
a more Pinterest like view of a product
catalog and other things around driving
most popular products to the forefront
of your site based on social data we've
got integrated a/b testing built into
all the apps it's something I'll talk a
little bit more later on in more detail
but a be testing allows us to do split
tests for applications for users and be
able to essentially deploy a different
version of the same application to fifty
percent or twenty-five percent of your
population and you know if you're
actually capturing metrics in that you
can figure out what is the lift and what
is the benefit of each application it's
a very very powerful technique and I
think most startups that are moving
quickly and trying out new techniques
for applications are typically doing
some level of you know a be testing to
make your decisions based on data versus
anything else and then we have a whole
suite of end-to-end analytics which
allow our customers to look at the the
uplift and the conversion of these
applications technology stack is one
hundred percent java-based and we use
lots of open source it's a SAS
technology so it runs in the
we run on top of amazon's amazon AWS
services which is there a virtualized
environment for running servers we also
use a lot of the new amazon services
which they deploy it into these
environments things like Hadoop and
HBase which are currently available in a
cloud environment there's pluses and
minuses of those things which we'll talk
about in a bit more detail we've
deployed this we have about 10 million
connected Facebook users right now who
are using our applications we've
captured probably over a billion social
actions at this point and we capture
probably about a thousand actions per
second on this platform today and we've
integrated product catalogs in the order
of a couple of million we do about three
billion page views a month so it's
definitely a you know a very active
platform and we've been able to scale it
pretty well using Java and lots of other
technologies to so a little bit about
what's involved in building social apps
there's a whole I mean this this slide
could be huge there could be 50
different things on here I wanted to
break it down into the things that I
felt were most relevant when you're
building social apps and log in and
authentication knowing who the user is
being able to authenticate them and
actually authorize them is obviously
critical you can't build an app and you
can't engage a nap sorry you can't
engage a user unless you know who they
are accessing social api's such as on
Facebook and Twitter and lots of
JavaScript development integration with
things like open graph and then
obviously building the social features
that you want to make available on your
site's behind all of that there's
typically a lot of work that goes into
things like data collection and data
mining and also data analytics all right
so log in and authentication and the the
primary technique I think that most
people will use for building social apps
is to use Facebook Connect Facebook
Connect is a Mazari is Facebook's
authentication technique it's
essentially a plug-in that can be
dropped into your sites and by users
interacting with that you're able to get
back information about who that user is
it's pretty pervasive on social websites
I think Facebook have said that there's
over I think over a million websites
right now that have integrated facebook
login what we've seen on the e-commerce
side is that typically only about 5%
of the top 500 internet retailers have
facebook log and implemented so it's a
very big opportunity for companies that
want to get in there and build you know
innovative products for e-commerce and
for media what is the authorization
protocol that's used by Facebook and
Twitter and others it's essentially a
handshake model where you authorize the
user authorizes your application and
gives you specific permissions things
you can do get back an access token you
do a handshake with Facebook and get
back a second reacts s token and that
access token can be used to access the
facebook open graph API for a period of
time I think right now Facebook allow
you to actually access data on behalf of
the user for about 60 days with an
access token the idea being that if
these are subsequently d authorizes your
app you're expected to to remove that
data and and purge it okay so what do
some of these api's looked like I two of
two different examples here because I
think they're very different Facebook's
open graph is a very semantically rich
API it's highly structured they've got a
really good you know ontology about the
types of things that you can query for
for on Facebook beyond just
authorization it's very easy to get
information about you know about a user
about the users profile it's easy to get
information about things like things
that they like events they've been to in
the past or going to in the future or
even stuff they've mentioned in their
feed so you can pretty much get access
to anything that somebody has published
on facebook assuming they've given you
permissions to access that data it's a
very you know to graph oriented API so
it's very highly structured and very
easy to use i would say twitter also has
api's there it's a much simpler model
given that they have they don't have as
rich structure behind the the object in
their system or the API that they
provide and and unfortunately with
Twitter you typically only get a
sampling of the data so it's it's it's
much harder to get back you know a
comprehensive data set across everything
that's going on in Twitter did you have
this concept of something called a fire
which gives you access to I think almost
all the data that's been published but
only a few companies have access to that
and I think it's pretty expensive to use
as well so here's an example of using
Facebook's open graph so this is getting
back likes for a user protocol runs on
over HTTPS it's graft at facebook.com/
you pass in a Facebook user ID / likes
in this case means i'm asking for likes
it's a restful api it's very easy to use
gives you back a block of jason theta
and in that job in that chase Jason data
you can see it's pretty well structured
it's showing showing you that there's a
couple of movies there's a movie here
live light I've seen recently called
headhunters and I like Amazon this is
actually from my account so I'm
typically a big user of Amazon like to
buy lots of stuff there it's a good
website and so pretty much all the api's
look like this right it's a it's a REST
API once you have an access token it's
very easy for you to get information
about the user and do interesting things
with that data alright so I put this up
here it's very Facebook specific but i
think is important as you are
considering building social apps and
trying to push that into the facebook
and other platforms open graph
publishing is a way that you can take
offline actions and publish and publish
them to facebook as if their native
actions so I think when James was here
earlier he was speaking about the kind
of the graph actions that Facebook is
trying to build themselves and percolate
things like somebody listening to music
song or somebody reading a book there's
obviously some very highly structured
actions that are common across every
application right but there's companies
out there that are doing things that are
fairly unique and Facebook can't
anticipate all of the actions that that
are going to end up on Facebook in the
end so what they're allowing companies
to do is to essentially define and
publish your own actions so in our case
you know we're publishing actions around
somebody browsing a product or
publishing actions around somebody
purchasing something we're publishing
actions around somebody commenting on
something and we're able to publish
those actions back to facebook
and by those actions being in facebook
and being available as part of their
Open Graph they're open to things like
advertising so people can do a lot more
richer targeted advertising based on the
actions that are being published by like
ecommerce sites and media companies it's
very interesting stuff I think it's a
lot of debate around Facebook's
advertising platform and whether it will
be successful or not compared to
Google's one thing is for sure and
that's that Facebook will have a lot
more data that can be used in a very
targeted way to give you a very very
targeted advertising experience okay so
I talked about the api's some of the
challenges that I think social
developers will run into when they're
building out social apps using these
api's the first is really that these
api's are typically outside of your
control right these are api's that are
being built by other companies and your
kind of relying on you know relying on
them to be one hundred percent available
because if they're not there it's
difficult for your apps to work and
these api's have issues around things
like availability latency rate limiting
documentation I mean there's a whole
swath of problems that you're running
too there's network latency they will
try and you know many cases rate limit
or throttle the amount of times you can
call these things so there's problems
like that you'll run into is your
building social apps the solutions that
we've put in place one is to cache login
state so not to go back to Facebook
every time to check if somebody's logged
in we make some assumptions and the
application will degrade or improve
based on based on the login state if we
find out after the fact that it's
different we do a lot of caching of API
responses so we don't typically go to
Facebook all the time to get back data
we go back and get back Delta's and data
you can imagine if somebody likes things
as they like more things those are all
you know additions to that data set of
like so you don't need to go back and
career everything every time you can do
lots of caching the other thing we do is
we do a lot of API calls on the client
side so this is kind of a little bit
different typically most of these calls
would happen in server side we actually
push a lot of these api calls into the
browser an act gives you the ability you
know the benefit of kind of getting
around throttling because
and every browser for the most part is
going to have a different IP address and
that's typically how Facebook do things
like throttling so you can kind of
spread out your load across all of you
all of your user base versus being rate
limited on the server side and in terms
of batch processing we spread out our
API calls across different servers and
different availability zones in Amazon
which gets us around some of those
issues too and then the last item is we
to believe face because the second we
data store for all of the actions that
were capturing so even a Facebook
becomes unavailable and the API goes
down we have access to all that data in
our own systems and we can surface that
through our applications okay so this is
a slightly different application in the
social commerce space this is a
something called gallery which gives you
a view of the products that are on sale
in a very social social way right and
things are ordered typically by how
socially active they are you can see
here these products have got things like
the number of likes number of comments
how many times something has been
purchased and there's conversations
happening about these products in real
time as well so really blending Commerce
data with social data to give a new type
of experience for users the the point
I'm making with that is typically you
end up kind of architecting and planning
for much bigger scale then you've
probably done in the past I've come from
building enterprise apps trading systems
for banks and so on and I will say that
the the effort involved and the
scalability challenges involved in
building social apps is of a much higher
order of magnitude than it is on those
types of systems Facebook for example
today have almost over a billion users
so you can imagine how do you build apps
that are able to you know accommodate
that number of users that I'm be able to
scale appropriately and to be able to
render and themselves you know quick
enough to give a good experience and
then we we also have the kind of
additional problem of because our
JavaScript apps run on ecommerce sites
and they're typically deployed across
all the pages
we typically take on all of the traffic
and have to render in all of that
traffic and so the Admiral customers we
kind of exact you know basically make
that problem worse and worse and so we
end up taking on a lot more load than we
typically would have if we just build
some sort of a consumer web app and
we're collecting lots and lots of social
actions typically over a thousand a
second and so we need a way to really be
able to write that in a very efficient
way we have a you know elastic
infrastructure so we can spin up new
servers on demand as traffic increases
we have monitoring built in which allows
us to deploy new servers and get them
integrated into the running environment
within usually a couple of minutes and
then we leverage the browser for so you
know for social API calls to so calling
facebook open graph I'm calling Twitter
we push a lot of that on to the client
side and execute us in the browser so in
a sense you're kind of moving traffic
off of your servers on to these client
environments which gives you the ability
to take on more traffic without
necessarily having to deploy new
hardware like i said earlier analytics
is obviously a big part about social
apps you're dealing with many many users
and and a lot of data and typically
you're your customers the people who are
paying for these products want to get
insights and what they don't want is
just you know reams and reams of data
they want you to do analytics and data
mining for them so you can come up with
interesting metrics for example here
this shows how many times you know an
application was loaded on your ecommerce
sites how many times somebody clicked on
it how many times that we shared how
many times was posted how many orders it
actually generated for you and how much
sales have actually attributed so like I
was saying earlier ROI is really
important and social as a hard place to
do that this is a way that you can
actually show true true roi because
we're essentially saying that this
application because it was loaded and
actually interacted with you know 250
times resulted in fifteen thousand
dollars worth of sales so you know I
think it's it's interesting stuff and
it's tough to you'll have to deal with
as you start building social apps the
other thing is that the data sets can be
quite large so not all data can be
stored in a structured format and things
like browsers people just browsing
products browsing a website those are
expensive to capture and store and
techniques you can use for after the
fact doing analysis of those labs for
example you can look at for example web
logs to derive how much browse traffic
you received versus having to capture
these strongly structured objects and
then those challenges around how real
time you can make this right i mean we
use Hadoop and HBase and HDFS for doing
all of our data processing on Amazon we
run batch processing twice a day every
12 hours and it's it's nice and AWS
because you can scale out to more you
know Hadoop nodes as necessary there's
also a lot of real-time products out
there one came out of Twitter last year
I forgotten the name right now but it
basically what it allows you to do is do
data analytics and using Hadoop like
techniques but in a real-time way I'll
get the name other afterwards to give it
to you guys if you like it so the point
being what analytics is you're going to
be dealing with lots and lots of data
right big data every minute these are
some statistics that came out a couple
of months ago on facebook users share
over half a billion pieces of content
every minute and I'm consumers spend
over a quarter of a billion dollars
sorry quarter of a million dollars on
web shopping every minute so there's a
lot of data that's out there a lot of
people purchasing things if you can find
a way to blend purchasing and sharing
content together it's a big opportunity
we are using HBase on amazon for storing
all of our data we started out using
postcards and my sequel and run into
definite scaling problems and we've been
slowly transitioning a lot of that on to
hbase over the past couple of months
another I guess inside is to really plan
for things like data sharding and
partitioning from the beginning it's
very hard to do that after the fact
particularly as you know traffic changes
it's very difficult to switch out
infrastructure in a way that's that's
easy to do so planning for data charting
and figuring out how are you going to
charge your data ahead of time whether
you use things like browser ID or
customer ID or time stamping to do
sharting doing some analysis upfront and
trying to figure that will pay off I
think big big dividends in the
how do you open MapReduce are
technologies that you'll definitely
start using and we've also been using a
lot of search systems things like you've
seen and solar and also a product called
elastic search these are really good at
you know ingesting pretty pretty large
data sets and you'd be surprised how
many there's ways of doing things like
recommendations just using keyword
searching that actually works pretty
well you don't have to go and build very
elaborate you know machine learning
systems to do things like
recommendations there's some lightweight
ways that you can do that using things
like you seen in solar so it's a nice
way to get into doing some of these
things we're having to become you know
like a data scientist right okay one
more example is discussions this is
where users are having these
conversations around products and you
can see here these people are looking at
something and saying they wanted or own
it or commenting on it it's a couple of
pieces of activity here where people
have actually purchased product so all
this data is being captured and these
users are using this app in a very real
time way right the point I want to make
there is that social users in general
are very tech savvy these are people
that are spending a lot of time in
Facebook and Facebook has really set a
good standard for how fast something
should be i'm sure you guys probably use
facebook and you know it's a very
real-time environment right as people
are commenting the tickers are changing
you don't have to refresh the pages so
social users i think will expect that
same type of functionality and
experience on the social apps that you
built right so you've got to be able to
build apps that are really really fast
and respond really quickly and give a
really good experience some of the
things we've done have been to really
optimize all of our API calls for you
know sink single digit or even double
digit millisecond response time so 50
milliseconds for us is you know kind of
a high response time for something we
try and get it below that the only way
to do that is but lots of caching
minimizing accessing disk example all of
our database servers run on SSDs and you
know you're going to end up building a
lot of infrastructure to really support
things like caching
one of the other techniques that's been
really successful for us and actually
probably the I think the biggest bang
for the buck has been to use our CDN for
everything so CDN is typically are used
for static content right you push static
content to the CDN CDN is distributed
across the globe have servers and you
know different continents different
countries and so on somebody's pulling
down a piece of static content into the
browser it's coming off a server that's
local to where they are and so there's
you know less Network latency and things
things render much quicker in the
browser we've taken to add a kind of a
step further where we actually push semi
dynamic content to our CDN so you can
imagine that for users that are looking
at applications you go back here users
are looking at these applications here
they need to be real time but people
that aren't connected can all have the
same view right because they're
essentially looking at other people's
responses on this thing so one things
you can do and what we do is we actually
push semi dynamic content semi dynamic
content meaning the actual image of the
application there the Jason that makes
up the data behind it the structure of
the of the actual Dom we push all that
to the CD and every 60 seconds and what
that means is that we only serve five
percent of all of our traffic on our
physical servers the rest is being
served off CDN what that means is the
users get a really fast response time
and you've kind of saved your ass
because you only have to serve five
percent of the traffic now on your
physical servers if we you know if we
didn't have have this in place we'd be
we would need like 20 30 times the
amount of infrastructure that we have in
place today to deal with them with the
amount of traffic that we're receiving
so that's probably one of the biggest
takeaways I think today is to use CDNs
in ways that they weren't typically
designed for but will give you massive
scalability and performance improvements
and any other is pushing events in the
client without forcing a refresh so
using a lot more ajax in the browser and
when somebody performs an action
obviously that needs to get pushed into
some data store somewhere we don't need
to wait until the response comes back
before you refresh to you i right you
can do some Ajax magic
they're to give the user a much more
real-time experience and to improve the
performance of your app this this one is
really geared towards I think social
developers that are building enterprise
software so you're building social apps
you're reselling them to businesses one
of the biggest challenges and something
that comes up consistently for us in any
technology conversation we have is how
the your apps impact page load time
right page load time being how long it
takes for the actual web page to render
into the clients browser the reason is
such a hot topic is because customers
typically want any vendor apps to have
zero impact on page load time which is
virtually impossible right but that's
something that's kind of the gone if
they put down there is they want to have
zero impact and the reason they want to
have zero impact is because page load
time impacts conversion for e-commerce
companies and it impacts things like SEO
ranking and add rendering for media
companies so there's a study that was
done by Amazon a couple of years ago
they did some research into it and came
to the conclusion that every 100
millisecond increase in load time
decreases sales by 1% that's a pretty
big number right so you can imagine if
you're increasing it by 500 milliseconds
you're decreasing the sales in that site
by five percent and that can make or
break a company right so that's why
they're so picky on that and in on the
other side on you know media companies
it impacts ranking so it impacts their
ability to show up in things like Google
search and it also even impacts ad
rendering there's ad rendering engines
out there that won't render a page if
the time it takes to load exceeds a
certain time period so the very picky on
that and we spend a lot of time really
trying to optimize and getting down that
number there's a techniques you can use
in terms of where you deploy your
JavaScript libraries into the JavaScript
pipeline the execution pipeline and that
can improve you know prove that and you
can give your customers options of where
they want to do that we do things like
we you know asynchronously and do
basically asynchronously do
parallel loading of JavaScript into the
client we also do a lot of pre-loading
and lay loading of content from a CDN do
a lot of caching of API calls and
responses so really during the page life
cycle process itself trying to really
squeeze down the amount of time that
we're spending in rendering the apps all
right so this is I think my last example
discovery probably one of the newer
social techniques that's been making
headway recently it's it's a way for you
to kind of look at what your friends are
doing this is an example of a media side
it's not ecommerce we have media
companies to these are you can see here
you're looking at a page right and
you're seeing what your friends activity
is on that on that site right you're
seeing the articles they're reading you
seeing how many articles they read we're
showing most popular articles based on
activity and you know what are the most
socially active articles on this website
to do things like recommendations and
there's a concept called social proofing
and social proofing is basically what
it's meant to do is entice you to buy
something or to read something because
other friends you know in your network
have done something similar right and it
seems to work actually so for example
you can imagine you're looking at a
product or looking at an article you can
see that five of your close friends on
Facebook have read that article probably
a good incentive there for you to go and
read a to just out of interest right so
it's a way for that for companies to to
kind of upsell articles and products to
you based on the fact that other users
in your network have purchased at and
the way you do that is by mining data on
Facebook right you look at who people's
friends are you try and cross-reference
product or are to build a category
interest to those people and then you
would show those people in that list now
to do some of these apps I mean these
are I would say I mean they're not
cutting edge but people are trying to
continually refine these things and give
the best social experience for the users
right and some of these teams are apps
that you'll try out and you'll fail on
the right and you have to go back to the
drawing board and do something different
the
important thing I think is the ability
to do a/b testing on these types of apps
you know you want to find the best
social experience for your users but how
do you know what that looks like right
you don't know what it looks like and
the only way that you can figure it out
is by releasing features quickly and
getting feedback from users and refining
the process right and the way that we do
it and the way that I think most are
tips do it is using the lean model lean
start a model approach i'll give you a
link later on but lean startup is a kind
of a methodology for how you run a
company and how you're going to start
upon how you run the development process
in that startup the idea being that you
you build software very quickly you
release it quickly you do a/b testing on
your apps you measure you capture data
and then you use that data to learn so
whenever you're making decisions you're
not basing those decisions based on
instinct you're basing those decisions
on real data right for example you may
be measuring how many times a user
clicked on an application or viewed an
application you'd use that data to help
you kind of fine tune the application
over time so the very strong feedback
loop happening between launching an app
getting data learning from it going back
again making a change getting data
learning from it it's a constant
feedback loop of getting to the kind of
the perfect application of the perfect
social app excuse me the way we do it is
we do a split testing of apps so we
deploy two different versions of the
same social application with different
configuration it may look slightly
differently there may be it may be
completely different or maybe just one
tiny thing that's different and we
capture a lot of data on you know the
interaction rates with those apps
conversion rates and then use that data
to you know the feedback loop for us to
fine-tune the apps we've taken a little
bit further to what our customers to do
that too so they can actually deploy
themselves different versions of the app
and fine-tune the applications for their
business need right so you know a
socially engaging app may have different
needs on an e-commerce site and they may
have an immediate site so we give our
customers the ability to make those
decisions themselves
okay so like I said earlier there we
want on Amazon AWS which is their cloud
environment typically our experience has
been that can be unreliable they can
have outages we have we had pretty I
think two pretty severe outages this
year one was when I think a storm hits
their data centers in Virginia and then
another was I camera would exact details
but we were down for probably a couple
of hours beyond that there's Network
latency problems you have to deal with
between different servers running in
different different availability zones
and I think they have inherently some
slow performance problems with the EBS
volumes that's something that we've have
to deal with ourselves I mean these are
not things that you wouldn't necessarily
encounter yourselves if you're running
your own call and had your own
infrastructure so I think building your
software to be able to deal with these
types of problems is important anyway
regardless of what are you running in
the cloud or not some of the things that
we've done have been to architecture
system to handle failures and to fail
fast Netflix are one of the biggest
users of amazon's AWS they have
literally I don't mature exact numbers
but tens if not 50,000 servers running
in there all of their media streaming
happens out of Amazon so they've had to
deal with the fact that it's very
unreliable system and the way they've
done that is to expect any component in
their server stack to break at any point
in time so they don't assume
everything's going to be up and running
the assume servers will crash the assume
components will die they assume services
won't be available and they actually
built something called chaos monkey a
couple of years ago which is a piece of
software that you deploy into amazon and
it acts like monkeys that go around and
pull out plugs out of computers right so
they destroy the environment is best
taken and the idea being that it forces
you as developers to really build
yourself for it to be all account for
that right they open source this a
couple of months ago it's called chaos
monkey now I think but a really good
solution if you are thinking about using
the cloud is to deploy the simian basic
all the simian army of monkeys into that
environment let them go wild and see
what happen
system and it will force you to become
better developers and architects systems
in a better way and be able to handle
failures in a much more much more
suitable way all right I think I
mentioned this earlier about you know
working and social I think means moving
fast and releasing new products quickly
we we typically release often and we try
and do as much continuous delivery as we
can so we're continually doing
continuous integration which means
building or software testing it many
many times a day and pushing it into
different staging environments for
testing we used to release software to
production every day we used to release
a new version of our software every day
into production we've shied away from
that a little bit typically because what
we've seen is building social apps for
enterprise customers enterprise
customers aren't always ready for you to
move as fast as you want to move right
so they're a little bit more
conservative they don't want even though
it's a SAS platform they don't
necessarily want to change as frequently
as you might want it to so we found a
balance our balance right now is rolling
out a new version of our software to all
of our customers once a week and it's
you know for the most part it's a fairly
seamless process there's no issues but
it gives them a little bit of a comfort
zone knowing that we're not pushing out
new code you know every couple of hours
of every day the other thing we've done
is automate everything so all of our
releases are done by pressing the green
button on a web page anybody can do it
our developers they rotate amongst the
ops team and deploy software themselves
once a week and then roll backs are
automatic one of the problems that we've
come across and I think people will come
across in building social apps is it's
very difficult to do performance testing
because you just don't know how many
users are going to have right and to try
and anticipate that you might have a
billion users trying to perform its test
an environment for that is very very
expensive so there is kind of a
different approach that people seem to
be taking now which is to build in
really good metrics into your system
into your operational system and to be
able to monitor the health of your
system on a continual basis and then as
you do a production push of new code
look for degradation in performance and
if you see degradation
and performance royal dr software
automatically so instead of doing a lot
of grunt work upfront and doing taking a
more waterfall approach of you know
building software testing it spending a
few weeks performance testing it you
don't do that you push it to production
immediately and let the system rollback
if there's problems that really only
works if you have a way to like
elastically expand your system so you
can add more servers as load comes on
but the benefit of this is that it
allows you to really release software in
a more maybe kind of a non-perfect way
where you don't know all the answers to
whether it's going to work perfectly or
not but you have a safeguard that you
can roll back to software automatically
if you have a problem okay this is my
last slide in Java one I wanted to
highlight some of the benefits of using
Java that we've seen you know obviously
there's lots of different languages you
could use for building these types of
apps many social companies now are using
you know much lighter weight scripting
languages Ruby on Rails PHP for building
these types of applications the general
consensus is that it allows you to move
faster we found that the benefits of
Java for us has been around stability
it's a very stable platform it's been
around for many many years now right
there's a really good open source
community there's a really good
developer community and there's really
strong support in the enterprise so
going into most companies enterprise
companies typically to deploy Java
stacks in the past or well used to how
to fine-tune them how to operationalize
them such a well-known technology and I
well-supported technology in terms of
performance and scalability and you know
it's been around a long time there's
lots of different options in terms of
tuning the systems garbage collection
has been around for so many years
there's lots of different ways of doing
garbage collection now depending on your
system and the type of system you have
we typically are able to handle about
500 requests a second on each of our
application servers part of that is
getting our response times down so low
but you know the those are good numbers
to have and I think that will be
difficult on another types of stacks so
I think for enterprise apps rentboy
social apps it's
it's a good technology and it allows you
to you know gives you the Headroom to
scale but I think if you choose other
more scripting languages you may find
developers are more productive up front
but then your run into problems about
how to scale the system as you bring on
lots and lots of more users over time
and then the last point here is around
different language opportunities so you
know the JVM is a well-established
platform and you know there's always
been many different languages that
compile the bytecode and that can be run
on the JVM in the last couple of years
there's definitely been a big resurgence
on things like scripting languages and
functional languages and the benefit now
is you can start to do things with
things like Scala enclosure and groovy
which allow you to you know think about
things in a different way maybe use
functional programming to solve some
problems that you couldn't do you know
using object oriented programming and
then those things compile to java and
can run on your existing infrastructure
so you kind of get a really good best of
best of blend there where you can try
out these new languages and find ones
that really work for you and then also
be able to use all of your existing
infrastructure all of your existing JVM
infrastructure to run that code right so
from an operational perspective you
don't have to take on the you know the
burden of having to deploy a lot of new
servers and so on for us where we found
this to be really beneficial is we're
using closure for doing data mining
which is a functional programming
language and beyond just you know
allowing developers to try something new
it allows us to evaluate a new language
and to be able deployed out and all over
existing infrastructure without having a
huge cost associated with that and
that's it great yeah James that was
amazing you covered just amazing amount
of stuff there so thank you for all the
input I don't want to be a few minutes
for questions if there are any in the
crowd anybody yes
right so we should prob aquestion there
yeah the question was the stuff I
covered here has been actions that are
positive the fact that somebody likes
something or commented on something
those are all positive sentiment things
that happen right question was more
around what happens if people don't like
something whether they write some
product is crap on their blog right how
do you deal with that so it's great
question and there's lots of open source
technologies out there that do something
called sentiment analysis and what
sentiment analysis does is it's able to
look at blocks of text or sentences or
words and be able to derive whether it's
a positive or negative sentiment what
about you can say said is positive or
negative so you so you can classify your
data that way and stuff that's negative
you can't roll out right or not use as
part of the recommendation we do yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah it's a good question
so um you know I didn't show you there
but all of these apps have got something
called social sharing on or off and by
default social sharing is on so when
people are doing things it's been
published back to Facebook and we
capture data and you know and we make it
available to our apps that can be turned
off by any user and when they switch it
off we delete all of it all of their
data put on our system and Facebook and
then we remove those users from the
social proofing so they wouldn't show up
anymore right we haven't found many
people doing that to be honest I mean
most people find these experiences to be
interesting enough that they they trust
us enough with the data and trust the
snow for the apps to continue using them
yeah and that's like we already do come
more and more the case as people get
acclimated yeah I think so I mean I just
definitely you know there has been a lot
of concerns around Facebook data and how
it's used I think the younger generation
are a lot more open to letting that data
be used in ways that's going to give him
a better social experience I think
that's going to change I think yeah and
for developing inside the enterprise
right there's obviously a whole
different set of challenges around that
or in some ways some protections because
you might have policies in place that
are very clear-cut right so yeah yeah
yeah well thanks for the questions James
we're at it we're out of time but um
feel free to chat with James on the side
yeah let's the grounder standing person
