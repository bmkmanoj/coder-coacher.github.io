curriculum developer at Oracle in this
demo I will explain to you what solar
governance is first let's take a look at
a case study my company my company is a
telecom company that has been
implementing solar for a few years it
has been very successful and has been
growing very fast
it has also acquired a number of other
companies although it has high profit
margins however the company is currently
having problems let's hear what people
in the organization have to say hi I'm
Marco a developer at my company I spent
a lot of time creating a particular
service then a month later I learned
that another group had created exactly
the same service what a waste of time I
constantly start working on one project
but then I am assigned to another one it
seems that our group doesn't plan ahead
or know what the priorities are I spent
so much of my time fixing bugs I think
we have a lot of bugs because we don't
have enough time to test properly
hi I am Tom the enterprise architect of
my company
I'm trying to keep track of all of our
services in Excel spreadsheets but it's
a nightmare other architects have access
to the spreadsheets but don't tell me
when they update them hi my name is Biff
I'm a customer support representative
customers are really complaining about
the bugs slow performance and how we
promise but missed the deadline
I wish IT would get it together I am
tired of people yelling at me I am madly
I am the Operations Manager of my
company
our group worked over the weekend to
roll out a new application it turns out
that we had to roll back because it had
a negative impact on another critical
application my team visited all that
effort system performance is sometimes
really slow and it takes our team a long
time to figure out where the problem is
hello I am the CFO my name is Ravi IT
projects always go over budget we spent
a lot of money on implementing sowa
but I'm not seeing the return on
investment failure to provide effective
soul governance exposes your
organization to the serious problems
like lack of collaboration and trust in
shared services an effective
communication of priorities and the best
practices limited visibility of saw
assets and information for alignment
between organization girls purses and
policy enforcement no formalized a
reliable way to measure saw progress
business value and return on investment
now that you have a basic understanding
of what problems my company is facing
how can they solve these problems Solar
governance can help them what is so our
governance so governance has four key
components a soul governance framework
is a set of principles processes
structures standards
best practices policies and tools that
assist in defining an appropriate
governance model that enables an
enterprise to meet its stated goals this
governance processes and policies affect
the way stakeholders are directed
administered or controlled a solo
governance framework defines the rules
and procedures for making decisions
successful decision-making depends on
management that empowers the relevant
stakeholders to make informed decisions
and to act accordingly as well as access
to timely and accurate information on
which to make these decisions so our
governance establishes and Anna
miniaturist policies in an environment
to influence and enforce actions and
behavior that align with business needs
as as elements that an enterprise has
created acquired or leased that support
as business goals a key objective of
civic governance is the harvesting and
management of the key assets to ensure
that they continue to deliver on their
investments to summarize soar governance
is a process that you implement rather
than a product that you buy it helps
organizations develop and maintain asawa
that delivers Mirabeau and the
sustainable business value so governance
is the creation and administration of
policies to influence and enforce
actions and behaviors now let's go back
to our case my company adopted so
covenants as a solution what was the
impact of the solution we now have a
reference architecture and best
practices so when I need to create a new
service and can create it more
efficiently and quickly there's a clear
process to follow and I can reuse a lot
of services there are fewer bugs and I
have time to work on the really
interesting problems management seems
more organized and gives us clear
priorities I actually get to finish
projects that I start I'm much more
satisfied with my work
we finally have a central repository of
services so I'm get a view of service
dependencies across the organization I
can make policies and recommendations
about developing services we created a
reference architecture to ensure that
services are created more consistently
and with best practices and that they
work with each other at last promises to
customers are being met and there are
not as many bugs so IT is doing
something right
the customers are certainly a lot
happier and I'm not getting yelled at
anymore we can perform impact analysis
to ensure that new applications work
well with existing applications before
rolling them out my team is prepared
before we perform any rollouts
now I have a dashboard to view usage
metrics and I can tell what services and
business processes are performing well
and which ones are not reuse of services
increased efficiencies have brought
software development costs down I can
get metrics and measure the business
value of Sowa I'm finally seeing a
return on our so investment by adopting
soil governance an enterprise can lower
cost and a reduced risk improve
decision-making manage change
effectively align business strategy and
IT investment foster enterprise-wide
collaboration
and so much more hopefully you not
understand what is our governance is and
why we need it to see how you can
implement our governance using our core
