everything needed to begin developing
and so a suite 12c including an instance
of the Java DB database Oracle so a
suite 12c software and an integrated
WebLogic server it also includes
JDeveloper to perform development work
an Enterprise Manager and fusion
middleware console to administer the
runtime environment to prepare my system
for this installation I've installed a
certified JDK and downloaded this so a
sweet QuickStart installation file to a
local directory I've also created a
small shell script the script exports
the value of Java home and changes to
the directory where the downloaded jar
file is located
then it launches the installation
program by invoking the Java executable
from the Java home directory passing the
name of the jar file as a parameter to
begin the installation I invoke the
script
on UNIX and Linux systems the wizard
begins by prompting for the location of
the installation inventory file which is
a master list of all Oracle products
installed on this host for the purpose
of this demo I'll accept the default
directory
after you pass the welcome screen
specify the Oracle home directory which
is where the files will be installed
the host meets operating system and Java
requirements the installation summary
screen offers the chance to verify the
selected installation options and to
then trigger the installation the
completed phases of the installation are
indicated with green checkmarks when the
progress bar reaches 100% complete click
finish to dismiss the Installer or click
Next to see a summary I review the
summary information on the screen and I
choose to clear the start JDeveloper
option I dismiss the Installer the
installation is complete the next task
is to open JDeveloper and start the
integrated WebLogic server this will
cause a domain to be created the first
time JDeveloper started it offers the
chance to set some default behaviors
when the defaults are set start the
server
provide and confirm a password to access
the WebLogic server
creating a domain can take 15 to 30
minutes depending on your linux
resources
when the domain has been created the
running integrated WebLogic server pain
indicates that the creation is complete
and that the server is running as a
final check
I verified omein by opening a web
browser and accessing Enterprise Manager
to log in I use the username and
password I provided during domain
creation I'm logged into the default
domain the server status is shown as up
my environment is ready to support
developing an Oracle so a suite 12c</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
