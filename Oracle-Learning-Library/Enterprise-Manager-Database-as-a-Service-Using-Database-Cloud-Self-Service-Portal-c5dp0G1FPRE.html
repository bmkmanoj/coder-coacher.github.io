in this video we will demonstrate the
use of database cloud self-service
portal Oracle Enterprise Manager 12c
offers the most comprehensive database
as a service solution the key use case
is addressed by the solution our first a
user needs access to a new database
service with or without seat data the
two options here are first to deploy a
dedicated database on a virtual machine
or on shared physical infrastructure
this provides excellent resource
isolation and is ideal for packets to
enterprise applications the second
option here is to deploy collection of
database schemas inside of a shared
database this offers the highest amount
of consolidation and significantly
reduces the administrative and
maintenance overhead as we have fewer
Oracle homes and database instances to
manage the second use case is dated
around data cloning the two options here
are first the ability to create a full
clone we make use of our men back up
archives to enable this the second
option is to take a thin clone or as
it's known as in the product a snap
clone of a large database for this we
make use of the storage copy-on-write
technology which lets you create clones
of large databases again data bite-sized
databases within a matter of few minutes
and these copies are space efficient so
they consume very little storage space
the snap clone feature is more
appropriate for functional testing or
scenarios where developers or QA
engineers need access to large
production environments for testing on
bugs or other issues with the product
the full clone on the other hand is
useful for performance or stress testing
or even for environments or platforms
that do not support storage based
cloning technologies now let's look at
the database cloud self-service portal
we log in as a cell service user john
smith in this case the first thing you
would notice on this page is that it
looks nothing like the classic
Enterprise Manager summary or the
inventory peaches this is a special page
designed for cell service users in
enterprise manager a user can be
annotated with the self-service user
privileges and this ensures that when
they login they are taken to the social
service portal directly and are not
exposed to any of the traditional
management pages in Oracle Enterprise
Manager this is the database
self-service portal the first thing you
would notice is the list of databases
these databases or database services
have been requested by the johnsmith
user the second region is that of
requests these are all the requests that
created the database services and the
database instances the third region on
the top left is that of notifications
since every database request has a start
and an end time any databases that are
due to expire within the next week are
listed here the other notification that
you receive is for any new service
templates or any new content that is
published to the Service Catalog and
finally the usage region the usage
displays the amount of resources that
have been used against the set quota
limits
for example the current user is allowed
to provision then databases of which he
has provisioned three now let's see what
it takes to request a database for this
select the request button choose the
option database all database specific
service templates will now be listed to
the user there are numerous options
available the first two templates
indicate that they are based on armin
backups so they would be cloning they
would be creating full clones of a
database the third template is for
creating an empty du nord rack database
and the last template is for snap loan
let's choose the last template
we now see a very simplified a request
wizard it takes the request name this is
how the request would be identified we
select a zone which is a collection of
servers that could be based on geography
so we choose East Coast select a start
and an end time and provide a username
and password since this is a shared
environment we do not expose access to
sisson system accounts to these users
what we do is create a slightly less
privileged user who becomes the owner of
the database now this will be a primary
administrative accounts for all
operations related to deploying the
application or using the database once
all the inputs have been provided click
on the submit button we can see that a
new service has been scheduled
now while we wait for this request to
complete let's look at some of the
pre-provision databases this is a snap
clone database every database shows
summary for example the uptime the
status and some other useful information
it shows the connection details this
will be useful to connect your
applications it shows certain
performance summary on on the right hand
side and the key regions on this page
are the storage utilization which
indicates that our current database is
made up of multiple volumes and each of
these volumes has been allocated some
writable space the other useful feature
is that of snapshot and restore as the
self service users make changes to these
databases they can capture the state of
the database using a snapshot numerous
snapshots can be created to capture
different periods of database use the
benefit of a snapshot is that you can
restore to any of these snapshots at any
given time so this gives you the ability
to trim' travel through the different
state of the database this is very
useful in functional testing as often
the users would have to roll back any
kind of changes that have been made
now let's go back and take a look at a
different database the other class of
services that you can provision is
schema services the requested schema
service we click on a request button and
choose schema
there are two kinds of schemas that we
support one an empty schema and second a
schema template that has been populated
with some seed data so let's choose the
first template again a short wizard is
displayed to the user this wizard takes
in the request name a zone that you wish
to apply the service in since for every
schema request we create a dedicated
clusterware or dedicated database
service you provide a prefix for these
services you choose a workload size a
workload is essentially a
characterization of the amount of
storage memory and CPU that will be
consumed by the application that you
wish to run set a start and an end date
since the schema definition is comprised
of some sample data or seed data we can
provide a prefix for the schema in this
template we have captured the Oracle
sample schemas you can set password for
each of these schemas or you can set a
common one
and that's it click on submit to submit
this schema request now let's take a
look at a schema service target so we
have provision schema services of both
kind one with seed data and one empty
this is the schema request with Oracle
sample schemas the page will display
basic summary information like up time
and the database version it displays the
connect string and the master account
that you can use to connect to it the
next thing is export import we make use
of data pump export import to allow
users to take backup and restore the
state of their schemas for example we
see an export taken prior to an
application upgrade on the right hand
side we see details about the schema
since this schema was populated with
seed data you can see there are numerous
tables and objects that have been
created finally you can see the resource
usage and some activity that's happening
on this database service let's go back
to the portal finally all the features
available via the self-service portal
are also available via a rest web
service based interface you can find
details about our restful web service
API is in our cloud administration guide
this concludes the demo thank you for
watching
