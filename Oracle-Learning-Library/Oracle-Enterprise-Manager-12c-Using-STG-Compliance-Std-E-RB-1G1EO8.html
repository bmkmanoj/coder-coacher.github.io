Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series since its initial release
Enterprise Manager 12c has shipped with
many compliant standards based upon
Oracle's recommendations and best
practices
starting with release twelve 104
Enterprise Manager will also ship with a
compliance standard based upon disses
security technical implementation guide
or stig for Oracle database 11g version
1.8 revision 1.8 this new compliance
standard leverages several new
compliance features available in 12 104
including agent side compliance rules
manual compliance rules violation
suppression and some new bi publisher
reports therefore in order to use this
new compliance standard both the OMS and
e/m agent must be at version 12 104
documentation for this compliant
standard as well as other database
compliance standards can be found in the
Oracle database compliance standards
reference manual found on OTN the Oracle
database sting compliance standard
includes checks that cover both the
Oracle database as well as the Oracle
home or installation the stig itself
classifies checks into one of three
categories either scripted manual or
interview depending upon whether the
stig itself is providing the code that
the administrator can use to validate
conformance to that specific check in
the case of enterprise manager's
implementation almost all of the checks
defined as scripted have been automated
and approximately 20% of the checks that
were defined as manual have also been
automated the remainder were implemented
as manual checks that require manual
attestation viewing the stig compliance
standard
enterprise manager he will see two
folders one for the Oracle database and
one for the Oracle home checks opening
those folders will reveal the specific
checks that correspond to the checks
defined in the Oracle database Stig
selecting one of the rules while viewing
the Oracle database ting compliance
standard will show the details of that
rule including things like the name and
the description and reference URL as
well as the actual script or query in
this case that's being executed by this
rule that corresponds directly to the
check as it's defined in the Oracle
database take as with any compliance
standard and Enterprise Manager the
results of the Oracle database stink
compliant standard can be viewed in the
compliance results area of Enterprise
Manager this results can be viewed
across many databases for a single
database or for a specific check this
includes the current as well as
historical trend and score information
rules with one or more violations will
have an icon next to them which will
correspond to the specific severity of
that rule selecting one of those rules
and the violation events tab will reveal
each of the violation details including
the specific database with the violation
as well as the specific findings or
results of the check recommendations for
remediation law are also offered which
again correspond to the sting
documentation violations or findings can
now be either permanently or temporarily
suppress this allows for exceptions to
specific checks for specific databases
permanently or for a grace period while
issues for a database are being
addressed suppress violations no longer
will degrade the compliant score but for
completeness purposes can still be
reported upon during the suppression
operation the user during
doing the suppression as well as the
reason they are suppressing it is
captured for each check defined as
either manual or interview in the Oracle
Stig there's a corresponding manual
compliance rule in the Oracle database
sting compliance standard in Enterprise
Manager upon initial association of a
database to the compliance standard each
of these manual rules will generate one
violation
each users must in a sense attest to the
successful completion of each task by
clearing that violation they can again
similar to suppression permanently or
temporarily clear this manual check and
again the user attesting to the
completion as well as any optional
reason that they enter or information
they enter is also captured let's have a
closer look at the components of the
Oracle database stick compliance
standard and Enterprise Manager as
mentioned earlier the Oracle database
state compliance standard takes
advantage of the new agent side
compliance rules which essentially
formalizes the integration between
configuration extensions and compliance
rules we can see that there are two
stick related configuration extensions
one for the database instance target
type and one for the cluster database
target type when we view the details of
this configuration extension we can see
all of the commands that will be
executed for the checks associated to
the Oracle home or Oracle installation
and in the sequel tab we see all of
these sequel queries that will be
executed against the Oracle database
instance itself
for those that have been using
configuration extensions as part of
their custom compliance efforts in
previous releases it's important to note
that you do not have to manually deploy
these configuration extensions prior to
associating the compliant standard to
the targets the agents ID compliance
rules basically will deploy these
configuration extensions automatically
when you associate the targets to the
compliance standard itself likewise it
will undo ploy the configuration
extension when you unassociated argot to
the configure to the compliance standard
let's have a closer look at the actual
compliance standards for state
themselves as we can see there are two
state compliance standards one for
cluster database and one for database
instance target types by selecting the
name of the compliant standard we can
see the details of all of the checks
that are defined by this particular
compliant standard as previously shown
there is a folder for all of the checks
or the rules for the database
installation and a folder for the actual
checks against the database instance
itself by selecting one of the rules
Enterprise Manager will display the
details for that rule on the right hand
side we can see the name and the
lifecycle state in the description and
reference URL etc but we can tell that
this is an agent's ID rule because the
check definition is referring to actual
configuration extension and the alias
name within that and for convenience
purposes we're showing the actual query
that this alias is executing so you
don't have to go to the configuration
extension and look at this alias thing
to figure out what the actual query is
that
being executed to use the compliant
standard we simply need to select the
compliance standard and click associate
targets we can then click Add and we
will select one or more targets
click select and click OK
within a relatively short period of time
we should have results for this
compliance standard against that target
we can see the results by going to the
compliance results page here we can see
that the sting compliance standard has
one target that is evaluated in critical
status and no other targets and either
warning or compliance status there is
one violation that is critical 140
warning and seven minor warning and the
average score for the standard is 17
percent I can either click show details
with this highlighted or simply select
the standard to get more details of the
violations the status of this compliance
tab again we can see that there are two
folders one for the database checks and
one for the installation checks by
having the standard highlighted or
selected on the left I can select the
violations tab to get a entire list of
all the violations for all the targets
associated to the standard or if I'm
interested in narrowing the results down
I can open up a folder and I can see
that in any compliance rule with a icon
next to it ich will have error has at
least one violation for that particular
rule so by selecting this first
compliant standard here and then
selecting the violation events I can see
the list of violations just for this
specific rule in this case I can see
that this the test database that I used
for this demonstration has the violation
here being generated because the
application object owner account Oh II
is not disabled I can see exactly when
this violation was generated when it was
recorded
and details in the categorization that
of course the recommendation for the
guidance provided by Stig obviously is
to disable this account so I have two
choices at this point one is IQ thir can
go and correct the issue on the database
and refresh the configuration at which
point this violation will automatically
clear or I can suppress the specific
violation for the purposes of this
demonstration we're going to suppose we
want to suppress the specific violation
so we see that the rule name starts with
D G zero zero zero four so back on the
compliance results page again we select
the standard and this time we're going
to select manage violations here I can
see three tabs first is the list of
currently unsuppressed violations across
all targets for this specific standard
that I had selected I could use the
search button the search criteria to
narrow down the results to a specific
target or a specific rule or a
combination of both the suppressed
violations tab will show me the list of
any violations that are currently
suppressed giving me the ability to
manually unsuppressed them and finally
the manual rule violations are those
rules at which I must manually attest to
the successful completion to clear the
violation for those manual rules so
let's put in our start of our rule name
DG zero zero zero four and select this
specific violation here again I can see
that the actual violation that was being
generated because some rules may have
more
violation per target and then I click on
suppress I get here I can either select
to suppress it indefinitely mean
permanently it will still show in the
suppressed violations tab just will not
expire if I select suppress until I can
choose a future date that when this date
comes this violation will then go from
the under the suppress to fund suppress
state and show again in the compliance
results I am working on it you can see
that it's going to record the username
that actually perform the suppression
and this reason that I've entered here
ok so by clicking ok takes me back to
the window and you'll notice that the
state compliance standard temporarily
disappeared that's because it is doing a
really a shove this one's target that I
have assigned here so I need to refresh
give it a second to refresh in the
calculation score for that target you'll
now notice that I have dropped from 140
to 139 on the existing violations and we
can drill in and verify that if I look
at this I can see that this DG 0 0 for
no longer has a violation event
associated to returning to the
compliance results page I should
probably also see a corresponding
increase from 17 to 18 percent that
number will vary based upon the severity
in the number of violations etc
returning to the violations tab I can go
to the suppress violations tab now and I
can see this one violation that I have
suppressed and again by selecting
unsuppressed will manually unsuppressed
this violation
to the violation state and count against
the score and showing the results once
again while we're in the manage
violations area let's move on to the
manual rule violations tab to see the
list of manual rule violations again
each manual rule will generate one
violation upon initial Association to a
target users must manually attest to the
successful completion of that specific
check by selecting that violation and
clicking on clear violations similar to
suppression users can select to either
have this violation suppressed
indefinitely or for some until some
particular date in the future and can
enter a specific note here that will be
recorded along with the clear violation
by selecting ok this violation will now
be cleared in this case and you'll again
notice that the stick compliance
standard no longer shows
so I'll click refresh will show now that
we are down to 138 violations and we had
started with 140 finally we'll finish up
by looking at the compliance reports
available in the integrated bi publisher
there are a number of compliance related
reports available we'll start off with
looking at the summary report in which
you get to choose the framework and it
will show you some high-level
information including the current and
historic information that the least
compliant targets for the framework and
the details for each standard within the
framework remember there are two
standards one for database instance and
one for cluster so we've provided a
framework where you can report
compliance for both also there is a new
violation details report in which you
can choose a specific standard
this case I'll choose the steak and
click apply the single instance database
and I can see the rule violation details
for every target and every violation
currently for this specific standard
those violations that show has not
completed our manual checks that have
not yet been cleared or
attested to their successful completion
manual the others are standard violate
actual checks that have generated
violations this is the end of the
demonstration thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
