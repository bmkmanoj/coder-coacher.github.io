securely connects all your devices to
IOT cloud service gathers valuable data
from those services analyzes and
processes the data received in real-time
and delivers the process data to your
enterprise applications or other
integrated services so how do we get
started first we need to create a device
model then we create an IOT application
that will address a specific business
problem after the IOT application is
defined we register the devices that are
part of our IOT solution next we install
the Oracle IOT cloud service client
libraries on each of our devices once
our devices are successfully
communicating data to the IOT cloud
service we can monitor and analyze the
resulting data now let's step through
those tasks a device model specifies how
incoming data from a device is
structured it also lets Oracle IOT cloud
service know how to interact with that
device devices can support multiple
device models if the device model we
need isn't there we can add it here we
use the temperature sensor device model
the u RN serves as a unique ID the
temperature sensor device model defines
seven attributes to actions and to alert
messages a number of predefined system
attributes are also provided we can
create more attributes actions and
alerts if needed now that we have a
device model we're ready to create an
IOT application this application
monitors energy usage from a variety of
remote devices a quick sidenote in
addition to creating custom applications
Oracle IOT cloud service includes
pre-built applications that are ready to
use and fully configurable these
applications allow you to monitor and
track mobile assets in both indoor and
outdoor locations an asset monitoring
application can report the current
location of assets detect key
operational events such as malfunctions
and preventative maintenance needs and
report and authorize movement out of
assigned work areas but back to creating
an IOT application our next step is to
associate the IOT application to the
temperature sensor device model we
looked at earlier then define the
explorations that analyze and process
the data sent by the devices using the
temperature sensor device model we can
specify the device sources that we want
to process in the exploration adding
useful metadata such as longitude and
latitude next create the exploration and
indicate where the data is coming from
in this case the exploration source we
just defined once the exploration is
created simply publish it
next we integrate the IOT application
with an existing enterprise application
or other supported external services
like bi cloud service mobile cloud
service JD Edwards IOT Orchestrator or
storage cloud service the integration
allows processed data and alert messages
to be sent out for further analysis or
processing
we can refine the set of devices that we
want our IOT application to use the
default is that all the registered
devices that support the associated
device models are included in the total
devices count we can filter the devices
based on various criteria such as name
or manufacturer
now that we're done defining the IOT
application the next step is to make
sure that the device is included in the
scope of this IOT application are
registered with the IOT cloud service we
can register a single device or multiple
batch devices using a CSV file let's
register a single device activation ID
device ID and activation secret values
are present after registration we need
these values when we are connecting the
device we just registered once the
devices are registered we're almost done
we only need to download install and
configure the Oracle IOT cloud service
client software on the register device
as part of the configuration we create
device software that uses IOT cloud
service device client libraries this
software needs to include information
about the device models that the device
supports including the temperature
sensor that we associated in the IOT
application earlier when we start the
device software it activates the device
to start secure communication with our
IOT cloud service instance when the
connection is established we can monitor
the activities using the application
dashboard or from the IOT cloud service
