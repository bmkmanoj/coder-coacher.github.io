Oracle's index basic analytics my name
is Keith Laker I will senior principal
product manager for data warehousing and
big data and Oracle this is the first in
a series of podcasts that will look at
the core concepts behind Oracle's in
data basic analytics and examine in
detail some of the key features and
functions with each new release of the
oracle database oracle has invested
heavily in expanding its existing sequel
features and adding new sequel features
based on feedback from customers let's
take a quick look at how the list of
sequel in database analytics has evolved
over time obviously inversions five six
and seven we laid down the basic
foundations for sequel analytics with
functions for aggregations and advanced
data processing in oracle8i we extended
the aggregation capabilities by creating
the multi-dimensional like cube and roll
out features along with analytic window
functions and more on these in a future
podcast in 9i we introduced the concept
of grouping sects along with
hypothetical ranking this is where the
rank or percentile that a row would
hypothetically have if inserted into a
specific data set and this can be useful
for doing what if analysis we added
first and last functions and the ability
to create an inverse distribution in 10g
we added the sequel model clause that
brings a spreadsheet like approach to
data processing and more on this in a
future podcast we added advanced
analytical processing in the form of
data mining features and functions in
11g we added the pivot and hump it
features allows you to create
spreadsheet like cross-type reports
directly from a table using simple
sequel the extended the capabilities of
the window functions and we delivered
the recursive with syntax that provides
more flexibility for repairs recursive
processing compared to the
by Klaus and of course we added more
data mining features and functions in
database 12c we've introduced generic
top end filtering along with big data
features such as pattern matching there
are many advantages in using sequence
the foundation for delivering
sophisticated analytics firstly in
general database tools are designed to
generate sequel therefore once Oracle's
rolled out new support features
enhancements these improvements can be
immediately accessed by every single
tool such as bi reporting tools
application development frameworks data
integration tools data quality tools and
so on using sequel to deliver analytics
dramatically simplifies the development
process for a wide range of requirements
such as ETL workflows data quality
reporting etc by using ANSI standards
based sequel Oracle offers investment
protection two teams and partners lastly
these enhancements and new features
create more efficient sequel plans
through the use of internal
optimizations and we'll be looking at
these in a future podcast to help you
navigate all the features in the Oracle
database we've organized them under some
broad families such as ranking functions
window aggregates that allow us to
create moving averages and running
totals leg leads that allow us to do
into row operations reporting aggregates
and the new 12c sequel pattern matching
feature and we've covered the pattern
matching feature in an earlier series of
podcasts so please refer to that series
for more information on this feature as
you can see there's a large library of
psychoanalytic analytical functions
inside the Oracle database
so how do these features and functions
help us address typical business
questions if we need to know who are the
top 10 sales reps in each region we can
use a rank function if we need to
calculate a 90 day moving average for a
stock price we can use a moving average
with the window feature if we need to
know what's the percentage growth of
January 28 2010 sales / january 2009
sales we can use a period over period
comparison if we want to know what a
january sales as a percentage of the
entire year sales we can create
aggregates that compare numbers on
different levels to help you understand
how to use many of the sequel analytical
features here are some common basic
concepts the first one is partitioning
this allows us to group our input data
but please note that this is different
to the table partitioning feature the
next concept is order by this allows us
to order the data within these groupings
or partitions windows creates a window
or collection of rows within a grouping
and we can even point to specific rows
when we've completed all this the final
step is to apply any additional
processing over our result set for
example we might apply a final sort the
diagram explains the order of processing
when we execute a sequel statement
containing a sick or analytical function
or feature so that initially all the
joins group buys and heavy having
clauses our process
next the sequel analytics window
functions are processed and finally any
general processing is applied such as
sorting as a roundup for this podcast
here's a full list of all of the in
database sequel analytics that you can
use in your applications your data
warehouse workflows and your bi reports
and in future podcasts we'll be looking
at many of these features in more detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
