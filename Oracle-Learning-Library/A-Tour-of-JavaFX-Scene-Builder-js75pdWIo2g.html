presentation on the sim builder so my
name is Jean Francois Denise I am part
of the scene builder deployment team and
I am particularly in charge of the CSS
support inside the sim builder so today
I'm going to do a - a general view on
the sim builder but before to start the
presentation I want to say that this
year I'm happy to present the sim
builder last year I was appear also to
present the sin builder but for people
that were there it was not possible for
you to get access to the tool so it was
quite a challenge to present something
nobody could put the unknown okay so
this year things have changed so sin
builder is now available for you since
April okay so the safe harbor for me to
be safe on what I'm going to say and
show the program agenda first I'm going
to introduce concepts behind sin builder
and I like to do demos I think that
presenting a tools the best way to show
you how to use it so after ten minute
introductions I will jump onto demos
then I will come back to conclude on the
future on the sin builder but we'll
mainly demos of how to use it so the sim
builder so as I said it has been
available since April this year as
developer development build for our one
auto release one dot o rly that has been
available in August this year working on
Mac and Windows so today we start again
to put our built-in OTN so you can again
download the developer preview of the
next to come release the 1.1 so this
time it works on Linux mountain lion
also and Windows 8 beta
so what are the goals of the sim builder
what does the issues a problem this tool
is going to solve so when we design at
the sim builder the major goal was to
make you productive at creating Java fix
UI and productive in a simple way
without having to code
no Java code required to create your
your layout so there is also a second
goal very important goal because Java
effects is is new if you wish if it's
peps now more than one year old but it's
it's still a new technology so we wanted
the same builder to be a nice way to
experiment with the Java fix concept
nodes containers discovers layout policy
of the containers see how the children
are reacting to them etc so see the sim
builder has a mirror on top of the
JavaFX library there is no conduction
its effects as it is in the API so I
guess that we all know in this room that
when we do you an intensive application
the application create are complex so we
have all the time to be very careful at
structuring them at the clinica texture
of the application so this is also a
goal of the sim builder to help you
maintain a clean separation between the
UI aspects and the application logic one
thing also that I must say and say again
because a lot of people think that syn
builder is tightly coupled with an
NetBeans IDE it's not the case
syn builder if you don't know tit work
standalone we have a smooth integration
with NetBeans but really you can use it
with whatever ID you are using in your
daily job and you will see that in fact
we are monitoring the files whatever the
tool you use to to update the files
so if I add few words to define what is
specific to the same builder I will say
direct manipulation and instant
rendering so what does it mean it means
that you are going to directly
manipulate the JavaFX structure you are
going to reparent scale transforms your
elements by directly manipulating them
and as soon as you have applied an
action or set a property you will get
immediate feedback so we try to present
you what you will get at runtime
all the time in term of layout and in
term of styling so with JavaFX if you
are doing CSS but you're already doing
it when you start to change all these
teeny properties all around the place
change the padding change a background
color to get the feedback you need to
write your rules save it
build your application run finnaly see
that this is not what you want and start
again
we've seen builder as soon as you change
your rules you have instantaneously the
style that is applied so again
efficiency but doing UI is it's not the
end of the game if you wish we all know
that we need to bind to connect this UI
to the logic of the application so there
again we have put in place a process
that we think is simple is declarative
you are going to say what you want to
connect to your application and again no
Java coding and we don't generate Java
by the way it's not the kind of tool
that we do the Java you don't do there
is no java code you will write the code
using your IDE so something very
important is that the document format of
sin builder is a fictional so you can
see sin builder as a graphical effects a
milimeter
this is really what it is no more than
that
so I can't present sim builder we found
at least two slide on FX ml kind of
overview of what is a fix ml so it
appeared with Java FX 2 dot oh and it's
an XML language that is good at
describing the content of your sign
graph Thank You Nick
so it's similar to a maximal example and
I will say that it's really a language
that has been made to be very compact
very readable a lot of layers in the XML
structure have been removed to be very
readable very easy to to at the end
change by and because first of all if
XML has been designed to be edited by by
by you we are using the same builder you
could use us in builder to generate a
fix ml but this format has been done for
manual Edition first so very readable
very transparent so there is one
santander that is smell a bit the
blahblahblah it's easy cooperation
between designers and developers and I
can give you a concrete example there
since 1.1 we have now part of the scene
builder that is made of F XML file so
yes we do using builder to create part
of sin builder and now that we have this
F XML files our designers are much more
happy because the format we are
exchanging it's CSS file a fix ml file
so they like to fix ml so you can change
it obviously we've seen builder but they
can also change it by ant to perfectly
match the Photoshop or whatever JPEGs
they have and they want to look to look
like so before that we send small
NetBeans project with Java classes you
have to install the IDs I don't like
that so you have to build that not like
that so now it works well because we
have formats that help us cooperate so
concrete examples there
something that I particularly like in F
exam else there is a lot of features in
F XML but it's the ability to describe
your head and Tanglers directly in the
XML so you don't need to attach your
listeners to your to the source of your
heavens a lot of boilerplate code is now
removed I personally like that and
finally something that is very obvious
but because it textual format you can
use any text editor and in the same
builder we have made great attention to
generate a fix MLS that is transparent
very pure without a pack structure as a
developer if there is something that I
don't like it's when the output of my
tool is completely opak and I can't
change it so we've seen builder output
is very clean and weak up very well with
additions that appear outside of the
tool so you can change using your editor
and in builder will reflect your change
and in those away if your XML editor
support that okay it's a very short
introduction on F XML and now let me let
me show you the tool so I'm pretty sure
that now you have all sins the sin
builder tool it has been demonstrated in
values presentation so quick to of it on
the left this is where you have your
library of JavaFX component children
containers sorry chart shapes and so on
so you can search this library and from
it you drag and drop in this center part
it's where we are going to assemble our
content ok and on the right according to
your selection you have all the beam
properties of the currently selected
node so there I have
the button I have all the properties of
my of my node so last part it's the
Yaqui on the on the bottom left it's
where you can observe the containment so
there we have a button located inside a
container and you will see that in the
hierarchy you can change the ordering
you can reparent
and do this kind of hockey oriented
actions so the scenario of my first demo
is related to to this topic now is
securing java so i will not secure java
in front of you but i will try to secure
the java logo so i'm going to create a
keypad of 12 buttons and the user using
these buttons is going to unlock the
java logo and have access to it so it's
a joke obviously it's just a way to
present you the workflow of creating an
application using same builder and
netbeans ide 7.3 beta that has just been
out this morning by the way ok so first
thing i'm going to do is to change the
text of this button so now i'm going to
duplicate this button create a row of
roughly aligned content and duplicate
this row multiple time ok so I have
something that is roughly aligned I'm
now going to use in Builder features to
help me create the right container to
get this matrix layout so I am selecting
everything there and very nice menu is
arrange menu when you will start to use
it you will be you you will use it
multiple times so there you are this
wrapping sub menu that contains a list
of container so you can wrap your
selection inside a give
container so in my case there I want to
wrap this content in a grid pain and all
my buttons now are under the control of
the layout logic of the grid pain so
there my grid pain has been treated
contain my buttons and now I can perhaps
change some property of this grid pane
to add a bit more room to my button so
let's add five pixels err in h gap and V
gap okay so now the tedious part of this
demo I'm going to change all the text of
these buttons so to do that I'm using
the ER key so you can change directly
inside the arc is the text of your
button labels and other other controls
but I'm going to take the opportunity of
this long useless steps to provide you
with a nice tip you should know that the
order that is used by the fixed front
time when you do keyboard navigation
when you press tab and you have focus
that is dispatched around your buttons
so orders that follow the runtime is not
the one in the cell but is the one in
the grid pain so it can explain why
sometimes you don't get what you are
expecting so there I have this natural
order I am following the order I would
like to see when keyboard dispatching is
operated so now it's my del button to
delete my code zero and okay okay I've
done the the worst part so I am
selecting my grid pane and when you want
to work on the properties that are
layout oriented I'm going first to
select a column you have this layout
section I don't know the people at the
end of the room seat but
inspector you have properties with
general properties you see it okay
perfect then you have this layout layout
section so according to the parent your
selection is so there my grid pane is
inside the not one copy I have some
properties so I am going after this
introductory demo to present you see on
copy but there I'm going to the grid
pane properties and for each column I'm
going to change the original alignment
to of my column a bit centered the
content of my color to be centered okay
so I have this row keypad now I want to
password box that will display what the
user has typed and to make it obvious
that it is something used sorry to to
lock or unlock something I will add this
icon there on top so now I'm going again
to use a wrapping because this layout is
not perfect it's not well centered and
not perfectly vertically aligned so I am
selecting my three nodes there and again
arrange this time in V box vertical box
so in same builder so when wrapping we
automatically Center V box by default V
box is not centered
we just set this properties that we
think is is nice so okay I have this
keypad now the logo I want to to secure
my java logo okay so now I want to do
two actions I want to put the keypad on
top of the image and up these two
elements be perfectly centered one on
top of each other so again I'm going to
use a nice container of joy I fix
platform that is the stack pain as it
name says it is used to stack nodes one
on top of each other
so I'm selecting these two oh sorry
wrapping and this time stack pain and
there I have the image on top of the
keypad this is not what I want obviously
so you can use a Yaqui to change the
ordering the order inside the stack pain
children list and I'm going to put it on
top so we have now the keypad on top so
last step I'm going to style my keypad
using CSS because it's roads it's it's
not nice so to do that I'm going to add
a CSS file and to do so you select any
container it has a style sheets property
that is a list of URL to your CSS file
so there I have a demo dot CSS I will
not show it to you it's very
straightforward changing background
colors and so on so just to show you
what is going to happen now so as soon
as you add style sheets to the scene
builders in builder is going to go into
all the file and look for sty class and
present them to you in order to pick and
choose the stylist in order to style
your nose so there I am selecting my V
box and in the sty class property now I
have this list that come from the demo
dot CSS file so there something that is
obvious is background I want my keypad
to other note back background okay
otherwise the trick will not be very
very good so now I want to style my ten
buttons
and this time I'm using the stai class
digit button and we've seen builder
immediate rendering of your CSS rules
this is key you you will never
experiment or is it a bug but you should
never have something that is different
inside the content view and what you
have when you deploy your application if
there is something or you have something
wrong in your styling or the begins in
builder and you can obviously log it so
these two action buttons okay so I am
pretty done with my layout
oh no password field password field I
wanted to set a sty class also to it
just keep password okay okay anyway so
the last step and it is going to be very
common for you if you use a single there
is I'm going to remove all that is not
meaningful to my design so there I have
this hunk of pain that is the root of my
layout that has been very useful I have
put my image on the right being able to
work on my keypad and so on but I really
don't want it for my application so what
I do I'm selecting the root of what I
want then I go to edit trim document to
selection and now I have an ethics NL
that contains exactly what I want okay a
nice a nice feature so let me save and
I'm going to save it inside a NetBeans
project okay so what I want to show you
now is this output is keep out keypad so
ethics ml first thing you will find in
it a list of processing instruction to
import all the package that that
contains classes that are referenced
inside
yockeygal content then our root note the
stack pain it has a children that is an
image view that is the logo another
children that is this V box that
contains a keypad you can notice that
all the file you add to an F XML the
path to them are stored relative to the
F XML so if you have put your images
your CSS file and so on in the right
place in your let's say in a bins
project it will perfectly deploy at
runtime something I want to mention with
NetBeans 7.3 it's they have added
finally some supports to edit a fix ml
so all the attributes you can set on a
given element all the static constraint
you can have a look and see what does a
static constraint in a fix ml you have
all the all of them now so it's it's
very nice to to edit directly XML so you
have this a fix ml 5 what you do with it
there it's not the symbol the symbol
there never generate Java ok but I have
written by and or you can use NetBeans
wizard to do that this main class that
mainly calls a fixed cement loader to
load the affix ml at lot time it will
instantiate transform all the six ml
element into node and my root node is
set as the root of my theme and this
scene is set inside the stage
straightforward three lines of codes
anyway that can be NetBeans wizard does
that very well so now I'm going to
follow the process to bind my UI with
the logic of my application so I said
that you do that in a declarative way so
let me come back to sim builder I am
going to do two kinds of things first
I'm going to name some nodes and the
name of nodes will be injected inside my
F XML controller class
and we are going to see this controller
class but for now let's say you're some
node you want to manipulate from your
java code the keypad that you want to
fade it out at some point the texts the
password box you want to update it with
the code the user as type add so this is
a kind of note I'm going to modify from
Java code so there is this a fix ID
property that is key you have to know
the ethics ID properties that every node
has so there I'm going to set name site
a value that is keypad remember keypad
false and display for the text password
box okay so now I am going to say what
are the methods that are going to be
cold when you click on the button I am
just going to provide the names again no
signature no parameters so my ten
buttons and you do that in the code
underneath the layout of the code
section and there is this an action that
makes its clear when you have an action
that occurs it is going to call key type
it
so I prefixed with an ash this is F XML
requirement if this is a method it's
prefixed with an ash otherwise it will
understand it as JavaScript and this is
not what we want we want to say that it
is a method that will be called it's
name is key type okay so when daylight
is going to be pressed oops
don't forget - delete and okay let's say
it will be done and I am done I have
done this declaration of what I want in
my application now I'm going to use a
new feature of NetBeans but you can you
are going to see the output of it you
can write it by n but it's very
convenient from an XML that contains
this FX ID and an action I'm going to
generate a Java class
okay so right-click on it on the F XML
and make controller so the name for me
is not very well suited because it will
make it but it will also update it if
you do modification to your F XML file
it will update with the nice
capabilities that as NetBeans not to
erase your code and blah blah blah so
look at what it generated it generated
the class okay that implements initial
is able it's not mandatory I will but
important thing is that for each field
each node sorry that have an ethics ID
you have this at the fix ml private
field that has been generated it means
that when the fixable document is going
to be loaded all this annotated file are
going to be initialized with a reference
from a node created at lot time so this
is injection really the pattern is what
we find in server-side it's it's typical
so initialize it comes when you
implement initialize eyeball this is
optional if you have post load stuff
yesterday I show how to fill charts to
fill your container from this
initialization method and for all my
action it generated a method okay so
what do you have to do now to fill the
gap I'm going to write few lines of Java
code but I prefer to actually copy them
to to have a bit more time it's really
three or four lines but okay so when he
is type add what I'm going to do first
to fix the import and to format it a bit
so I am accessing to the current value
of the display so the display is not new
it is not nil it has been initialized
then I access to the text of the button
on which you clicked and I am
concatenating the two to update the
display when the light is colored so I'm
going to clear
so display and when it dawn occurs it's
where I'm going to start a small
animation to fade out and format it to
fade out so what do we do their first
line I'm emulating kind of validation
logic in your application validate this
code please if it's okay then I'm
creating a fade transition that is going
to change the opacity from one to zero
in one second of my keypad okay so let's
see if everything can be built there and
we will see what it happens when when I
run it
okay compilation one fine and let's run
it
okay so if I click I have this text that
is updated I can clean and type the
magic cake odd and I have a Java logo to
be free okay so it work it so this and
this first introductory demo that
covered the workflow and really all
these steps other steps you are going to
do when doing your own development now
that I am at the demo table I am going
to stay at the demo table and highlight
some important features of the sim
builder so I have four patterns
yesterday I presented several nozzles
but this one are for me the basics of
the sim builder on which layout I will
not cover CSS at all I'm going to focus
on on layout aspect and reuse so first
of all anchoring when you create a new
document we've seen builder by default
to get this hunk of pain root container
why did we choose this route ankle pain
because it is a nice container that
allows to kind of layout it allows you
to do some free layout you you can
position in absolute X and absolute Y
your content so let me take again a
button I can put my button where I want
and you can see that the sim builder
will help me showing me some interesting
places so it's quite common we have some
nice guides ER so that's one feature of
the anchoring of the ankle pain but as
its name say we can anchor children
inside the parent so what does it mean
it means that I'm going to express a
link between the edge of my children and
the edge of its parent and this makes
great sense
when you are resizing your application
and this is what we want we don't want
static layouts that don't resize okay we
want when you increase the width of the
eight you want your application like an
elastic to follow okay so this is on
kurung so to demonstrate anchoring I'm
going to have multiple buttons err and
configure each of them differently so
the first to do to do anchoring you go
to the layout section and you use this
widget there so you have this gray
rectangle it represents the children so
my button there you have the big white
rectangle that represents the parent and
you have this dashed lines that
represent this link or constraints that
you can set between the edge of the
children and the edge of the parent so
so first button I'm not going to change
anything the second one I'm going to
attach if you wish and you are going to
see why we say you touch this button to
the right this one to side and finally
this one for directions so when you want
to see your relay out in action you can
preview your layout in a window so there
we have what you will get at deploy time
so the mouse event and the key event
reach your note so if I am moving I have
multiple effector the first button
doesn't move at all there is no link
between its age and the age of its
parent so second button I have created a
link between the right edge and the
right edge of its parent so when I move
the right edge of its parent it's going
to follow it so third one I have
anchored on both sides so now it follows
the left that doesn't move and follow
the right that does move so what it does
stretch between the two and finally the
last one do that in the two dimensions
so let me change so you see the power of
Uncle pain so this anchoring is very
very usable and now I'm going to not to
prove it but to show you with a more
meaningful example so fit to parent so
I'm going to create a design that I have
just loaded so it's composed of two area
and the second area is split in two we
have a table view and we have a form and
we have very typical layout you find in
the enterprise so first I'm going to
delete it and to split my container in
two parts so surface of my container in
two parts I'm going to use a split pane
so a split pane is therefore exactly
that but as soon as I drop it on stage
you see that it's not well fitted to my
parent so typically what you do there
you are going to move it to the top left
corner you are going to resize it to be
perfectly aligned you are going to
anchor it and we do that in one single
action in modify you can call fit to
parent what it does let me show you the
layout so fit to parent automatically
uncle the children inside its parent
info edges and resize the children to
occupy all the width and eight available
in its parent so I can directly
manipulate the divider to change this
location
another split pane again fit to parent
you can notice the automatic anchoring
we have there I can change and preview
and I can already
see that everything is when the skeleton
if you wish the skeleton of my
application is properly dynamic okay so
now I'm going to add some content so a
treeview
on the left again modify fit to parent
what we see immediately is that a
treeview without any content doesn't
give you the feel of what it will look
like in your application so we have this
problem with charts also we have this
problem with table view list view we
need data and we don't have them we are
at design time there so we have the
feature in team builder to inject some
sample data the sample data is not going
to be persisted in your XML it just
there at runtime to help you figure out
what is going on so let me add a table
view and as soon as you enable this
feature to inject sample data it applies
to all your containers what I want to do
to create a phone oh no I want to add
some table column to show you some
direct manipulation so I can change the
name of my colon directly in place
because table column are hierarchical in
Java effects you can add sub columns
inside your column so drag and drop in
columns let me create this form quickly
this is a time that is very quick also
so three labels text field one two and
the text area multi-line text so typical
I'm going to select everything wrap in a
Great Dane and fit to parent so these
are really the patterns fit to parent
wrap in typical
so buttons let's say it is my submit
button okay I want to uncover it on the
right and on the bottom and let's see
how it does look like so now we have an
application that start to behave the way
we want you can see what happens all the
focus is dispatch this kind of thing
okay so this ends my second pattern this
fit to parent internationalization so
babsworld is not very well treated but
in this demo I'm going to do something
let me take a bit of water running out
of
towards the strings our symbols inside
the layout this is not what we do we
never do that we are we have all our
symbols inside bundle properties file
that can be used for
internationalization so this is a kind
of feature that if you don't have you
can't do I will say professional
application nobody put the string inside
the layout and particularly if your
application is international is able
international you want according to the
local of your of your client to adapt so
there I have we have a super hot so in
ensign builder I have this form and I'm
going first so it's a decoded text I'm
going to add a resource bundle to it so
a resource bundle in French with some
keys to translate this word in French so
what you have to do once you have added
this bundle I'm going to change all my
text with this code menu from there I
can replace with internationalized
string so mainly it means that now I'm
going to provide the key inside my
bundle so let's say key one I know that
it exists and I have automatic load of
the bundle and the value that is present
in the bundle let me show you this
bundle perhaps it's it can speak there
so key one is prone on key to is non key
through school and key file is nice on
hood was a key so now I can change all
my art coded text with a key value
anything builder replace it with the
value inside so bundle file and let make
a wrong name let's say I'm writing the
key that doesn't exist we make it clear
that there is no key for it
so you have your key prefixed with
percent that is F XML syntax inside and
ethics
then you will get this percent to
reference a bundle that will be provided
at lot time and so it's key five okay so
I have this layout in French and I can
change it now that it is international
is able and show in Italian how does it
look like so it's just a preview feature
but I think it's very powerful and it's
real cases there okay my last demo there
is also something that we really don't
want when we do layout when we do UI
it's to duplicate our content we want to
be able to have a kind of templates that
we are going to include inside other
layout so we use and fictional as this
capability from an XML document you can
include other XML document so there I
have straightforward demo typical use
case where I'm going to add a banner or
either to an application so everybody
does that
so this is my header it's an edge box so
or isn't an alignment that contains an
image view and a piece of string so I
have another lay out another XML file
that I'm going to resize a bit to import
this banner so to import a fictional you
can do it from the file system there a
new Jing file input a fix ml and I am
importing the banner hope here it is
then I can move it around and
interesting feature engine builder is
that from an included affectional I can
navigate to its project so I can open
this XML inside Singh builder so you
have a right if I right click there I
can edit
gotta fix em l so it means that I'm
going to reopen this affects ml from the
document that includes it let's say
perhaps I said it was too much there
it's just cool
okay I save this document and when I go
back to him to the document that
includes it sin builder has detected
that some updates occurred so sin
builder whatever the file you are adding
to your F XML image CSS effects ml we
constantly monitor Sam for update so to
get this quick feel that everything is
in sync
okay so I think that you have five or
ten minutes to conclude this talk so I
should have some time for some questions
in case you have some okay so we have
seen sin builder in action I have done
this demo on securing this Java logo we
have seen a demo of a selection of
features obviously actually yesterday I
presented seven patterns what I call
kind of patterns today for and when I
work it for my presentation I was able
to isolate 15 of them so we have 15
major features in the sin builder so
it's a new tool it's coming we are
trying our best to add features but
expect some new ones to appear obviously
so what are they they this feature so
this is a feature that you find in sin
builder 1.0 I will then speak few
minutes about 1.1 new features so we
have this library of Java FX 2.2 dot x
UI elements use so the buttons we have
also containers all the charts all the
shapes all the menus everything
we have extensive support for the major
containers and in particular we made
great effort to help you configure the
grid pain the grid pain is very powerful
but when but also comes with its
complexity so in the sim builder we try
to make the grid pane as simple as
possible
so direct manipulation resizing colon
row or this kind of thing so immediate
CSS rendering you you will experiment
that if there is no image rendering as I
said log a bug it's because we are doing
something wrong somewhere we have
support for effect so it's not a big we
allow you to stack you know the effect
you can change the effect and effect can
be the input of the of another so
interesting builder you can shine your
effect and set them on a node you can
import image media and effects ml files
so custom component support yesterday
during my both I presented how to
develop custom component we have an
initial support today you can't add your
custom type from the same builder you
have to edit manually affix ml then when
we load the fictionnal with the tech
Turkestan type we ask you for your
binaries where have your jars will have
your class so we can load your custom
type then you will be able to manipulate
it in scientism builder as you do with
the element of the platform so these are
features that is evolving we have
ability to inject sample data you saw
that so we have some I think they're
interesting automatic sizing features I
show you the fit to parent but there is
also one it done in the menu features
that is very nice when you start to set
preferred size to your nodes let's say
you want this to be 100 150 the bad
effect of that is that when you will try
to resize your application they will not
resize so you will stay
their preferred boundaries so we have
one menu action to remove of this
preferred size and come back to
something that allows a fixed runtime to
resize your note
so that is use computed size for a pin I
think you you know know where is the
menu previewing in a window in order to
to see in in the moral know mainly what
is interesting with previewing in a
window is that the mouse event and the
key events are reaching your note and
furthermore you can easily resize so you
can get a feel a better fill in this
window than you have in the content view
and finally the ability to add these
resource bundles in order to easily
International internationalized sorry
your layout and finally conclusion on
for this talk conclusion on the future
of the sim builder so we have new new
release on its way it's a 1.1 so we have
some theme we are addressing in this
release and the major theme is usability
announcement we want the tool to be much
more usable we want to increase this
capability of its usability so by the
way I take the open opportunity of this
presentation to tell you that we have a
usability study in October and we are
looking for participants so the reserve
the URL you can go and fill the form but
if you are interested at the end of the
tour come and see me give me your
business card your name your email if
you don't have business card and people
that are organizing this usability study
they will come back to you and ask you
if you understand and also they will
check your your profile because if
you're an expert in Java effects this is
not perhaps what we want to to target
but pepp people that are interested in
Java FX that really want to to start but
are not yet
X
felt's can be good candidates but if
you're interested just come to see me so
the two feature you are going to see
emerging in symbol during one dot one is
one the ability to add custom components
in your library in our library and CSS
troubleshooting so this is this new tool
I'm very happy that we have done is the
CSS analyzer so we have put in place
some things that help you troubleshoot
CSS troubleshoot because CSS can become
quite complex but also help you to
understand how to style all these teeny
parts you find in a control system arrow
this track system you can use the CSS
analyzer to start understanding how CSS
is working in GFX so these are the two
major features support for Linux
obviously we still have bugs we are
fixing them and all the feedback you can
provide us that can reach us from the
forums all the bugs I'm going to give
you the URL of our JIRA project our bug
tracking system schedule today you can
already get a 1.1 this is the one I have
used for my demo the 1.1 official
release should come first half of next
year and for more information one URL
giraffe is calm you will be redirected
to Oracle website Doc's not Oracle calm
so to load bugs very nice I think that
you know JIRA but we have this JIRA
application that is on Kenai you create
you an account and log your bugs it's
very nice to use you can search YouTube
for nice videos on the scene builder one
of my colleague Angela she made a very
nice job
very nice introductory videos we have
seen builder demo and yesterday I did
this both and I noticed that
has been recorded so when they will put
all the content online you can go and up
this in def layout and styling with the
Java ethics and builders that I did if
you are interested in some other aspects
okay so I'm done so now if you have any
question that I can answer I will be
Appy to do so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
