of open ID Connect were introduced now
let's look at authentication flows
available in open ID connect and how ID
tokens and user information are
exchanged open ID Connect defines three
authentication flows the authorization
code flow the implicit flow and the
hybrid flow the authorization code and
implicit flows are based on the low
flows of the same name the main
difference with open ID Connect is that
an ID token is also issued as these open
ID Connect flows are based on the same
low flows the types of applications they
are best suited for are also the same
the hybrid flow is a combination of the
authorization code flow and implicit
flow in this flow the client can request
ID tokens access tokens are both from an
authorization endpoint along with an
authorization code that can be exchanged
at the token endpoint for the remaining
tokens it's useful in situations such as
single sign-on for example where the
client application needs to immediately
use an identity token to access the
users identity it also uses an
authorization code to request access and
refresh tokens to get long live access
to resources
the hybrid flow offers more flexibility
with this token flow but it's less
secure than the authorization code flow
because some tokens are exposed directly
to the user agent let's look at these
flows in more detail in the
authorization code flow and end user
accesses and applications that requires
the user to authenticate after clicking
login the client application redirects
the user agent typically a browser to
the authorization endpoint of the
identity provider the user agent makes a
get request to the identity provider
passing the following information
received in the redirect the location of
the identity provider authorization
endpoint a response type set to code
which indicates this is the
authorization code flow the scope which
in this case is set to O
an ID email and profile the scope open
ID shows this is a request for open ID
Connect authentication and an ID token
the email and profile portions of the
scope show that this client is
requesting access to the end users
profile and email address the client ID
of the relying party registered with the
identity provider the state which is a
value set by the relying party to
maintain state between the request and
at the callback itself and finally the
redirect URI which is a location to
redirect the callback to once
authenticated the user is then directed
to the identity providers login screen
where they enter their credentials the
identity provider indicates the user and
asks for consent to the relying parties
request to access their identity with
consent given the identity provider
sends an authorization response message
from its authorization endpoint this
redirects the user agent back to the
relying party using the redirection URI
provided earlier this URI includes an
authorization code and any local state
provided by the client earlier the
relying party then makes a request for
an ID token to the token endpoint by
sending the base64 encoded client ID and
secret the authorization code and the
redirect URI the identity provider
authenticates the client using the
client ID and secret and validates the
authorization code and redirect URI
if valid the identity provider responds
back with the ID token from the token
endpoint the response also includes an
access token and an optional refresh
token the client validates the ID token
and if successful the identity is proven
since the original scope request asked
for profile and email address the client
sends the access token to the user info
endpoint once the identity provider
validates the access token it returns
the claims to the relying party and the
authorization code flow is complete in
the implicit flow there are two possible
scenarios in the ID token and access
token scenario the client application
requests both an ID and access token the
access token is used to request
additional claims from the user info
endpoint
in the ID token only scenario the client
application requests just an ID token
and request that any additional user
claims are sent within the ID token
itself let's first look at the ID token
only scenario after clicking login the
client application redirects the user
agent to the authorization endpoint of
the identity provider here in the
redirect response type is set to ID
token indicating the implicit flow and
that we're requesting an ID token only
additionally a nonce value is set to
mitigate replay attacks as before the
user logs in and consent to access their
identity is requested when the user
gives consent an authorization response
message is sent from the authorization
endpoint which redirects the user agent
back to the client the redirection URI
includes the ID token in a URI fragment
this ID token contains the standard
claim along with those from the profile
and email scopes the user agent needs to
parse the ID token encoded values that
were returned in the URI fragment and
then pass them to the clients processing
logic the user agent follows a redirect
URI
but retains the ID token the application
returns a webpage that contains a script
the script can extract the ID token from
the full redirect URI the user agent
executes the provided script and passes
the extracted ID token to the client
application the client application
validates the ID token and now has proof
of identity and all the claims it
requires in the ID token and access
token scenario the flow is almost the
same except in the initial redirect we
use response type equals ID token token
after user authentication and consent
instead of just an ID token the identity
provider also sends an access token in a
URI fragment the client application
extracts the ID token and access token
and validates the ID token because the
ID token doesn't contain the profile
claim the access token is set to the
user info endpoint once the access token
is validated the claims are returned to
the application
the hybrid flow is a combination of the
authorization code and implicit flows
tokens can be returned by both
authorization and token end points where
the tokens are returned from depends on
the response type specified in the
redirect URI the response type can be
set to either ko token code ID token or
code ID token token if for example the
client application chooses code ID token
the user agent redirects to the identity
provider passing the response type
equals code ID token along with this
scope it requires the end user logs in
and is asked for consent after consent
is given an authorization message is
sent which redirects the user agent back
to the client application the
redirection URI
includes the authorization code and ID
token the ID token is validated in the
same way as described in the implicit
flow the authorization code is then sent
to the token endpoint the same way as
described in the authorization code flow
once validated the access token is sent
back along with another ID token this ID
token is compared to the previous one
for validation because the client
application requested scope equals open
ID profile the access token is sent to
the user info endpoint to retrieve the
claim
in this video we looked at the different
flows developers can choose from when
enabling client applications to use Open
ID Connect we looked at how open ID
Connect allows client applications to
verify an end users identity and obtain
basic profile information about that
user using REST API s we also saw how
open ID Connect provides client
applications with the when where and how
the authentication occurs and how it can
be used to allow federated single
sign-on to learn more about cloud
standards and protocols please check out
