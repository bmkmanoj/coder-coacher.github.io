curriculum developer at Oracle in this
first of a two-part demo I will show you
how to request and activate an Oracle
cloud trial service part 2 will show you
how to administer the service including
the management of users and roles you
can easily make self service requests
for an Oracle cloud service via the
cloud oracle com website the main page
of the cloud oracle com website shows
the wide range of oracle cloud services
some of which are generally available
others of which are available for
preview when I click the try it button
at the top of the page the service
preview page appears showing the four
services with triad buttons by which you
are directed to the Oracle store to
perform self service requests for trial
accounts those for services are Java
database talent management and customer
service and support before we proceed
let's pause for a moment and view a
diagram of the cloud service
provisioning workflow so that you can
get an idea of the different roles and
applications used to request activate
and administer an Oracle cloud service
the first step is for someone acting as
a buyer to order a free trial or paid
subscription to one or more Oracle cloud
services either by clicking a try it
button in the cloud oracle com website
or by going directly to the oracle store
website while placing the order the
buyer designates who will be the initial
account administrator the person
designated as the account administrator
receives an automated notification email
to activate the service while activating
the service using the my account
application in the cloud oracle com
website the account administrator
designates who will be the service
administrator and the identity domain
administrator
traitor a key task of the identity
domain administrator is to define the
users and the user roles that will give
users their access privileges this is
performed in the oracle identity console
of the cloud oracle.com website the
identity domain administrator creates
users and roles for all of the purchased
or trial cloud services the job of the
service administrator is to develop and
administer a particular cloud service
using the my services application in the
oracle identity console of the
cloud.oracle.com website one important
task is to assign roles to each user of
the cloud service another task is to
provide all the cloud service users the
URL and signing credentials to access
the service here is a list of the six
steps I just discussed this part 1 of
the Oracle cloud service provisioning
demo will focus on the first three steps
littering Oracle cloud services and
activating the services part 2 of the
demo will cover administration of the
service including the management of
users and roles keep in mind that
depending on your organization size and
structure the same person can be
assigned to perform several of these
roles let's return to the cloud oracle
com website and click try it in this
demo we will request a trial account for
the Oracle cloud database service under
database click try it you must have an
oracle com account click Sign In if you
already have an account otherwise click
create an account I already have an
account so I'll click sign in enter your
oracle com credentials
and click sign in enter or confirm your
account information then click Next
enter your credit card information to
validate your identity this is a free
trial so your credit card will not be
billed as you can see my credit card was
previously validated so I can just
proceed by clicking next you then see a
service details page with fields for you
as the account administrator to
designate who will be the service
administrator and who will be the
identity domain administrator before I
fill in this information let's go back
to the slide showing the provisioning
workflow to review the purposes for
these two administrator roles you are
currently logged in as the account
administrator you are about to designate
the service administrator who will
manage this particular database service
and assign roles to users and the
identity domain administrator who is
responsible for defining users and roles
for all of the cloud services that you
order depending upon your needs you can
assign these roles to yourself or to
different people now let's return to the
service details page that you are
filling as part of your cloud service
order notice the identity domain name
when you request a trial service the
identity domain name and service name
are automatically assigned to you when
you purchase a service you can customize
the identity domain name while you as
the account administrator can assign
different people to the roles of service
administrator and identity domain
administrator for the sake of simplicity
in this demo I will assign myself to
both
rolls notice that by default the
identity domain administrator has the
check box filled to be the same person
as the service administrator so I will
now click Next on the next screen read
the terms and conditions of the user
agreement click the I accept check box
and click Submit request
the next screen shows that your service
request has been submitted at this point
you will receive an email once your
request is processed you receive an
email like this to activate your order
click the activate order button a window
in your browser will open to a sign-in
page for your Oracle account enter your
username and password the same
credentials you use to sign up for the
trial service
you
then click the Sign In button the Oracle
cloud my account application appears
showing the service information click
activate service a message shows that
your service has been submitted for
activation when your service has been
activated you will receive a second
email providing useful information about
your service the email shows a temporary
password for the service you just
activated you will use this password
next to login to your service you are
now ready to log into your database
cloud service switch to your browser and
click the my services link in the
toolbar make sure the correct data
center is selected where your service
was created and click Sign In to my
services enter your username your
temporary password from the notification
email and the identity domain for your
service and click Sign In oracle
identity manager opens at a password
management tab when you log into your
service for the first time you are
prompted to change your temporary
password enter your temporary password
in the old password field then enter
your new password twice based on the
password policy in addition choose three
challenge questions and provide answers
for each one to help you if you forget
your password there is a drop-down menu
with four questions from which you can
choose then click Submit
my password and challenge questions were
set successfully and I'm logged into the
my services application as the account
administrator I am now ready to launch
the Oracle cloud database service click
launch service when you launch the
Oracle cloud database service it opens
at the application Express homepage I
can now begin creating my database
applications and that's it you've now
seen how to request and activate an
Oracle cloud trial service I encourage
you to watch part 2 administering a new
Oracle cloud service to learn how to
administer the service including the
management of users and roles
I'm Rick green thanks for watching
