people's code but I don't really know
what I'm doing
Florida's job can I really learn to
program from a game have you ever had
thoughts like this if so I think you'll
be interested in this programming course
my name is Nick and I'm a senior
curriculum developer and game designer
at Oracle Java puzzle ball is a public
game created in Java with game modes
meant to help build an understanding of
key Java programming concepts including
object or to thinking and class design
static versus instance variables
inheritance and lambda expressions real
serious and complex stuff but it's done
in a fun way that's intended to prepare
you to write code after you play and
feel more confident about programming we
found that when the material gets
presented this way people thoughts often
become I usually program by hacking
other people's coats but I don't really
know what I'm doing
so this would be a great way for me to
understand the concepts do you have a
course that's only this game yep that's
what you're watching right now but I'll
be sure to point out other resources
from Oracle where you can find even more
information or does job how's this game
mode different what does the code look
like these are questions players apps
because they felt confident and cured to
have a conversation that would help
build their understanding this course
and game rely on the enjoyment that
comes from learning by exploring
learning by doing thinking through
challenges it's not meant to be
memorizing meaningless technobabble
can I really learn to program from a
game I get the hesitancy there's a lot
of examples of ineffective educational
games out there but thankfully in the
case of Java pull the ball this question
becomes
can I have a copy if the kind of game
people have gotten into four hours the
puzzle get you thinking like a
programmer without even realizing it
when it's incorporated into a course
lectures and technical details make a
lot more stem that's been the case with
most testers and I hope that's the case
for you too if you've signed up for this
four-week free massive open online
course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
