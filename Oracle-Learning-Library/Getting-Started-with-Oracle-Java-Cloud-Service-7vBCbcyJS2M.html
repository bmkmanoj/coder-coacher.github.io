involves these main tasks first creating
a service instance in Oracle database
cloud service Java cloud service must be
associated with a relational database in
order to host the Oracle Fusion
Middleware schemas next creating a
service instance in Java cloud service
then locating tools to further customize
and manage your instance and finally
deploying a java application to your
instance first i'll create a service
instance in oracle database cloud
service after logging into oracle cloud
open the database console
you
as with all Oracle cloud
services when I create a database cloud
service instance I can choose from
several different building options and
software releases
I'll pay particular attention to the
database name and password I'll need to
know these values again when I create my
Java cloud service instance
in order to administer the VMs that make
up my service instances I need to
configure SSH keys to save me time I'll
let Oracle cloud generate matching
public and private key files which I
could then download to my local machine
if I need to remotely log into a
database VM I'll supply the private key
file
Oracle cloud automatically backs up data
from my database and Java service
instances and older backups are moved to
Oracle storage cloud I need to provide
the name of a storage cloud container
along with the credentials to access it
to save time I'll let Oracle cloud
create the container for me if it
doesn't already exist
after my new database instance is
provisioned and running I can move on to
the next task
now I'm ready to create a service
instance in the Java cloud service
you
just like with the database service when
creating a Java cloud service instance I
can pick my billing option as well as
the product version
I choose a compute shape that meets the
CPU and memory requirements of my
application I provide the same public
key file I downloaded earlier so that
I'll be able to remotely log into my web
logic the ends by using the matching
private key
you
next I need to set the initial
much a cluster
I enter the admin credentials for the
new WebLogic domain
then I enable remote access to the
WebLogic admin consoles
I also select the database cloud service
instance that I created earlier and
supply the credentials to connect to
this database
you
because I configured my web logic
cluster size to have value greater than
one Java cloud service can automatically
provision a load balancer to intercept
and distribute incoming client traffic
across the servers in my cluster once
again I have the option to provide my
storage container and credentials older
backups of my Java service instance will
be stored at this location
you
now my new Java services
provisioned and I can periodically check
its status
after my new Java cloud service instance
is up and running I can customize its
configuration to meet my application
requirements by using several different
administration tools for example I might
need to search WebLogic log files to a
JDBC datasource or create a JMS server I
can accomplish these tasks from the
standard WebLogic server console the
available functionality is the same as
your on-premises WebLogic environments
you
alternatively I can use the Fusion
Middleware control console to also
configure monitor and manage my WebLogic
domain
you
there may also be times that I need
monitor tune or troubleshoot the load
balancer in this service instance in
Java cloud service the load balancer is
implemented with Oracle traffic director
and that can access the traffic director
console to perform these types of tasks
you
finally I'm ready to deploy my java
applications to my new Java cloud
service instance
I have all the same deployment options
as I have in my on-premise WebLogic
environments I could use the Fusion
Middleware control console or the
WebLogic scripting tool for example but
in this case I'll use the standard
WebLogic server console to install my
new application
you
in this typical scenario I browse to the
deployment archive file and then target
the application to my entire cluster
you
after uploading and installing my java
application I can start it
because I enabled a load balancer my
clients will access the application
through the load balancers public IP
address
you
thanks for watching this video about
getting started with Oracle Java cloud
service a companion tutorial is also
available that documents all the steps I
just presented
welcome to the cloud</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
