CSS extension language which is
transformed to CSS by the developer
tools when you compile and deploy the
application with sass files you can
extend the CSS to change specific parts
of the style definition during this
video I'm going to show you how to
create an extension module that makes a
few simple changes to completely alter
the appearance of a basic SCA site the
best practice for customizing CSS is to
create a nice-ass file and custom module
the new sass file is combined by the
application resulting in the CSS cascade
that implements your style changes this
customization has a couple of steps in
it first we create the custom module and
then we add it to two different
locations in the disturb JSON file let's
begin by looking at the existing site
this is the basic SE a site for no
customizations what we want to do is
implement a new theme with the dark
background and light colored fonts we
can do this with just a few simple CSS
changes the first step is to create a
custom module this is knowing here I
named at 3:00 a.m. in my local SCA
source files I put all my custom modules
in an extension directory within the
modules directory now my custom module
directory I have a subdirectory named
sass and within that directory is my
custom sass file which I've named
underscore three HMS CSS it's important
to remember that the file name must
begin with an underscore let's look at
the custom sass file these are the color
variables that I want to override to
Bruce my 3:00 a.m. theme
now let's quickly look at the original
color variables they are defined here in
the base styles module inside the sass
variables folder we have a file named
underscore colors F CSS this is the sass
file that defines the base color
variables for a CAA remember we don't
want to make changes to this file
because future upgrades may overwrite
them that's the reason we're creating a
custom module to override certain styles
defined here now let's go back to our
custom module in the root of my custom
module directory is the NS package JSON
file this is a configuration file that
determines which files are combined in
included in suite commerce advanced if
we look at the file we see that it uses
wildcards to specify all of the sass
files in the custody module for this
module we have only one sass file and we
could specify it explicitly by name if
we wanted to
next we add our custom module to the
distro JSON file this is a configuration
file that defines which modules
including custom modules are combined
and included into e-commerce advanced we
need to reference our custom module in
two places in this file first we add it
to the list of modules I'm going to add
it as the first module on the list next
we need to add it to the dependencies
array for test config that's application
shopping I'm adding this as a dependency
for shopping only which makes this
customization available only in the
shopping application under the control
left search for base S styles and there
will be multiple results returned for
each of the applications so I need to
make sure that I'm adding to the
shopping application but because of the
different dependency structure
I could easily define separate styles
for each application so let's replace
this bit of code here with our modified
code this splits the loading of our
module into three parts the first part
loads the main variables and then we
load the 3 a.m. module which has our
redefined variables and then we load the
remainder of the basis tiles modules so
that they will use the new CSS that was
redefined by the 3 a.m. module
from the command window I'll never learn
gulp local in my local SD a source file
directory to deploy the changes to my
local server and now if we view the site
on our local server we see that our new
theme is in place thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
