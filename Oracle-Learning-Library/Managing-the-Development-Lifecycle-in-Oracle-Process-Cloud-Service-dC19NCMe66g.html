composer I can publish validate test and
deploy an application publishing an
application makes it available to other
participants in the shared space I
summarized the changes in the comments
field and create a snapshot snapshot
save a copy of the latest version of the
application which can be used later to
compare revert back to or deploy a
specific version it's a good idea to
validate an application prior to testing
it to ensure there are no errors next I
deploy the version I want to test to the
runtime environment and use the
application player to ensure the
application behaves as expected and add
myself to the roles defined in the
business process this enables me to
perform the user tasks as the
application player runs through the
business process as the player passes
through each flow element and sequence
flow it outlines the path it takes
through the process and stops at each
flow element that requires input once
the business process plays successfully
I tested in workspace where I can
simulate the end-user experience I
terminate all running instances of the
application by end applying it as an
admin once the application is
successfully tested I deploy it to my
local server or to a remote server in
the wizard I specify which application I
want to deploy in the next step I
customize the web service connections
for the application since this
application has no connections I leave
it as is I enter my name password and a
revision ID this deployed version will
override the current deployed
application and become the default with
the application successfully deployed I
assign users to the roles this is
covered in the managing application
settings video then end-users can start
using the application in workspace for
