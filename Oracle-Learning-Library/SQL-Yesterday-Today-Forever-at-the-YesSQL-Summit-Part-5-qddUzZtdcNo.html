young developers who are you know Thank
mongos cool not even know about Oracle
yes Oracle's engage in a number of
initiatives around reaching the next
generation of developers honestly it's
tough going and we've got catching up to
do but we have an Oracle Academy program
that has Commission's with hundreds of
universities and thousands of professors
helping them build curriculum around
Oracle relational database generally
people generally we are going to meet
ups reaching out into these open source
communities and letting them know that
our offerings are getting stronger and
more reliable for them so for example is
now a node.js driver so you can build
JavaScript applications against the
Oracle database through this driver so
we're getting a lot of the pieces in
place so that are so developers who are
new to Oracle new DC will be able to
engage in phonology with a much lower
barrier to entry that is ever impossible
for it of course cloud database it's
going to be another very big part that
sounds crazy yeah so yeah the other
questions I get how do they make a
sequel cool okay so this is a yes single
conference and things one step is like a
tank oh cool again and should we I think
seems live as we should as ubiquitous I
mean like it's ninety percent
or D little databases like we should be
making a sequel cool or key man okay
last question I did anybody else and
ship it on that okay last question so
what is oracle doing a phenomenal sequel
and maybe a dude like what our
functionalities are we having and maybe
sharding or JSON support yeah i'll tell
take that over the years whenever
interesting new ideas have popped up in
the database space one of the
interesting thing is because oracle and
relational database and general have
this declarative language to the sequel
language and customers write
applications at the sequel level we are
free to innovate in the infrastructure
of the database you know with our query
optimizer our access methods are fair
liquori all that stuff we are free to
change wide widely and as long as it
makes your sequel applications run
faster and the better performance
customers love it and so a lot of the
ideas that have come out over the years
you know like parallel query in the 80s
and you know clustering scalable
clustering technologies and now charting
are all transparent in the
infrastructure of the database and we
are free to add them to oracle and
customers will get the advantages of
interesting
like sharding is something that
everybody's all excited about now that
is what makes you whip scale supposedly
well in oracle 12c are two we're
introducing sharding into the the
product and it's always going to be
completely transparent to your
application so all those applications
you wrote over the years can now be
sharted now charting is actually one of
these things work if you want the
highest performance actually you have to
actually not be completely transparent
to your application because you have to
give us the shark and tell us you know
it shard you want this operation being
backed against but we also give you a
way of just saying here's a sequel
statement Oracle you just figure out
which shards have the data and go do it
for me so we'll do that as well but you
know shorting is a good example
something were you know assimilating
into work and you know that that suppose
that advantage of no sequel will go away
with 12 CR 2 we've also added things
like JSON that's in 12 CR 1 and so
relational model is very flexible and a
lot of these supposed advantages of no
school systems are just going to be
assimilated into our own databases so
customers who want you know Jason they
want schema-less they weren't sharding
whatever all that's coming along with
Oracle sequel and more about relational
databases are including pretty much
everything that people think is
interesting about no sequel so you know
most developers I think will be very
happy with what they get with with
Oracle versus no sequel database because
they get you know all the functionality
of SQL and they get a standard interface
and all the other benefits of sequel as
opposed to going with no sequel where
you know whichever no single engine you
code against you lock yourself in
forever it's there's no standards and
people used to really not like being
locked into products that individual
products especially in this space where
the vendors are likely not to be around
five years so so anyway yeah there's I
think customers one of the nice things
about relational databases is they do
absorb any good idea that comes up in
maybe no competing date imaginary Thanks
okay we're coming up on time I think
it's a lot like about three minutes till
12 10 and as much time are there any
final comments people like them add the
sequel of going to go away what can
anything ever replace equal it possible
I think like you said the work Graham
couldn't put it Larry you know we are in
a fashion industry and you know three or
four years ago sequel went out of
fashion I think sequel is coming back
into fashion do communities all behind
sequel it specifically again I don't I
don't think
a question about that and I think the no
sequel stuff is actually becoming less
cool you know it's all going through
cycles and sequels is now on the upswing
again no sequel stuff is now going back
on the downswing and yolks but again no
sequel one sequel have coexisted for
four years and they'll coat this for the
next four years as well so you can know
how shouting in bread and the comics I
mean that's a great weight in it because
like now sequel getting rule again
that's right there's okay thank you all
for coming I think it's a lunch break</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
