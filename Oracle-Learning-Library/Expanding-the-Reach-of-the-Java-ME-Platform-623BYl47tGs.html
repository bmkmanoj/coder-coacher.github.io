Andrey koreshkov who's been working on
the engineering side in Java me for a 10
years so we're working today we're
talking about the ways that we're going
to expand the CLE sea and the Java
platform for Java ME it's been kind of
stagnant for several with many years and
we've got a couple of initiatives that
we want to put forth so today we're
going to talk about you know several
top-level topics you know the overall
platform the individual specifications
that go into the platform for cldc the
embedded profile a device access API
support for mobile and then we'll kind
of wrap it up with a look ahead so one
of the new initiative in Java ME eight
is to get better alignment with java SE
eight and they've realigned the
schedules and the functionality so that
we can have coordinated releases with
the same sort of basic functionality in
both Java ME and NSE and we'll get into
the details a bit later the idea is to
really make it so that when you're
deploying a platform using Java ME you
get to make a choice between sort of the
footprint and functionality if you need
more functionality you have to pay more
it takes more footprint if you really
don't need a lot of the functionality
you can fit in a small footprint we're
trying to build the overall platform to
leverage all the capabilities of the
toolchain and developer experience API
experience that come from SE and the
large large number of se developers to
be able to make it so natural for them
to be able to program mobile and
embedded devices and at the same time
we're also trying to take some of the
working on taking some of the
technologies from Java ME like the
location API s and Bluetooth sensors and
messaging and make them applicable to
the java SE platform so there's sort of
a bi-directional Papa Papa gation going
on the clearly there are a lot of
programmers and we want to try to
leverage their their expertise across
the platforms so we've been looking the
last five years have seen you know huge
changes in the Java market and devices
several of the initiative the older
versions of Java ME have been sort of
surpassed in capability and
functionality by Android and much more
capable devices but we're finding that
there still is a sort of a huge market
in embedded devices in very small and
devices where the newer the newest or
more popular technologies and mobile
phones are still too big to operate
effectively there's a lot more
flexibility and variability in in mobile
devices are embedded devices and the
approach we're taking should allow the
platform to work on those multiple
across a broader range of devices so the
overall breakdown in Java platform
targets java SE at the ten megabytes in
up platform if you've been attending any
of the java as the embedded talks that
are going over in the hilton they've
laid out a tiered structure to bring
java SE to two bigger devices our sort
of core market is you know ten megabytes
in below part of the definition is sort
of the one to 10 megabyte range but
there are some proof of concepts and
work being done to try to take it even
smaller and then sort of at the bottom
and and for some very specific
applications java card provides a very
secure solution in a very small
footprint you're all familiar with every
place the java shows up in the in the in
the devices and we're trying to expand
the range of where java can be applied
portably so the big release themes for
this job Emmy release our platform
modernization bringing the AP is the
language is up to up to snuff with java
SE and add the should improve the
capabilities of the vm the languages and
the libraries the some of the key
features have to do with aligning the
tooling so that the same tools and
netbeans in debuggers and eclipse that
you use with with SE you'll continue to
be able to use there's been support for
Emmy for a long time with the the Emmy
SDK which is actually the talk after
this one and that's going to continue
including better support for on device
to device
and profiling the target of the overall
market is as I said sort of small
embedded devices and a broader range of
m2m modules at the edges communication
modules healthcare devices and smart
meters just to name a few examples so
what's Java ME eight it's a
cross-platform Java development platform
it's updated from the previous versions
of cldc which are now five plus years
old and I've sort of back with Java 142
in terms of compiler language support
and API functionality so we're
trying to target a broader range and
that means that we need to sort of
surface the complete a more complete set
of AP is the here you can see the Java
me has provided a great number of
optional packages for in over the last
10 years to hit all kinds of topics from
graphics to to secure solutions with
seth messaging bluetooth and all of
those optional packages carry forward
into this broader embedded space there's
an opportunity to do some new new
vertical or some new j srs which the
target particular areas of the embedded
market which will fill in or over time
the three primary components that were
working on now that we've sort of
developing now are the the base cldc
eight configuration with the Java 8
language support and the Java embedded
profile which is the successor to both
and mid p drawing the best from both of
those and being more flexible and then
I'll talk a little bit today about a
device access API that provides an
opportunity for java applications to
talk directly to peripherals talked
connected two cpus and development
boards at a very low level so it's very
exciting actually this week we've
finally submitted the to jsr s4 the CLD
c 8 4 and 4 to the java embedded profile
they're up for review on the on the JCP
website and what's so starting with JCP
process for that we've had good support
from a number of sort of well known
vendors both mobile and embedded and
we're looking forward to their
cooperation and contribution to the
development as with anything else in the
JCP and with the community you know
we're looking for input and feedback and
people to get involved so let's go ahead
and look a little bit more about CL e c8
and what's new since cldc is a strict
subset of java SE many of the features
are sort of familiar to people they're
just going to be new to CL dc-8 so we're
synchronizing on the language features
so that we can use the same compilers
that are used with the main Java program
up a platform the virtual machine is
getting a bit of an update to be able to
support some of the new canoe features
that the compiler requires and the
language features required but we're
still trying to keep the footprint very
small and very conservative because
there's still a lot of opportunity at
the bottom end of this footprint range
as well as in the in the mid-range we do
at this point cldc needs to be backward
compatible we expect the CL dc-8 to be
used in many of the same places in to
supersede the current cldc one that one
specification and then the other kind of
high-level thing we're doing is the the
genetic connection framework GCF over
time had bits and pieces that got part
of it in the cldc spec and part of it
was in the mid piece back and part of it
was in the cdc spec and then there was
even a JSR for java SE that included
part of the part of the GCF
specification so we're consolidating all
of that into a single spec so a bunch of
language features that are sort of
they're not new to java but they're
going to be new to cldc are things like
assertions generics autoboxing there are
static imports if you use java SE these
are just sort of everyday things some of
them make it easier it's easy to write
code and some of them probably would
have worked before as well without any
platform support but things like strings
and switches and the multi catch and
precisely throw some of them are
subjected sugar but they really make the
code easier to write
but there are thing also features like
try with resources that makes it easier
to clean up exception then closed except
on exceptions and close connections that
require language support or library
support so on the library side there's a
bunch of new new API is related to niño
the new i/o features in java SE we're
looking at a subset of java of niño
file or a file access api that's
compatible with java SE but fits in the
footprint and then there's for a while
there's been a subset of the niño
buffer support that has been used by the
graphics package but it will it may have
a more broader applicability in devices
one of the new features that we're going
to build on a little bit later is the
service loader API that's in Java SE
that allows or the late binding of Java
interfaces to implementations of those
interfaces and that's a very powerful
mechanism that we're going to use to
build some service loader framework and
you know to talk yesterday by with Andre
about how that how that work is going to
work and I'll cover a bit of it today
and then finally there's more of a
collections update the collection
support that was in CLE c11 was sort of
very minimal but in order to support the
language features like the enhanced for
loop that uses iterators and the there's
more library support needed from the
collection side and we're looking at
broadening the set of collections api's
to be able to support the kinds of
programming that developers want to do
at that level but that's sort of into in
in work there's a the java SE logging
api seems like it's a very useful
feature for a bunch of devices that need
to be able to be monitored and we're
looking at a subset of that to fit in
small devices and then some small things
interfaces to support comparable that go
with the collections api's closeable and
auto closeable interfaces are the sort
of the API constructs that enable the
try with resources compiler
functionality and then support for sort
of compile-time annotations so that
you're it's possible to use more
sophisticated tooling on the
compile time and build time side to
manipulate your application that are in
the scope of the CL dc-8 the we didn't
extend the support for annotations to
the runtime because it adds quite a bit
to the footprint of the application
classes and to the the runtime of the of
the vm it didn't seem like it was worth
the trade-off so on the generic
connection framework the we're
consolidating as i mentioned from these
other specifications all the
descriptions of the individual
connection types for HTTP socket there's
we've sort of meeting some requirements
that we've detected along the way for
the application to be able to select
which access points get used in
particular connection so there's a new
API is there and a new connection option
API that makes it possible when you're
opening a connection to apply extra
parameters as before this connection to
support for different connections for
HTTP HTTPS Datagram sockets secure
sockets is before one of the new
features in this API is this time is the
support for multicast which is can be
useful for conducting you know multicast
DNS and bones your type applications
where you need to sort of spontaneously
interact with other devices on your
local network without love having
pre-planned the IP addresses or how to
talk to them so beyond GCF obviously
another another focus is just making
sure that all the current development
tools that are used for java SE are you
know also applicable to Java ME so here
you know as usual the sistent we're
going to use the standard compiler
standard set IDE functionality the emmy
has always had a component of the the
sdk that provided emulation and support
for development of applications that
support is going to continue and
continue to be integrated with the Ides
and the runtime and be enhanced for sort
of better on-device debugging and better
emulation obviously to support debugging
and a lot of sort of working more
closely with the while you're doing
development you need to be able to debug
have debug structures in the class files
so that tools can use them but in the
runtime you really don't need the
debugging structures and so in this
context they're going to be optional in
the in the production systems so I'm
going to invite Andre to talk about the
embedded profile in the device access
API so hello and talk about Joe and edit
profile as you see heard from Roger we
have filed a new GSR for that and that
embedded profiles the profile is
actually what sits on top of cldc to
provide the core functionality in order
to be able to actually run your
application to you to have the proper
life cycle and serve the basic needs of
the applications on virus and embedded
environments so as you can see the API
is covered by DJ stars or core ones
that's what concerns like application
installation upgrade and removal their
multitasking requirements which is new
to a MP area there are system properties
stuff in order to know get proper
information of the configuration of your
device and like them the environment
you're running in also it covers
application management API which shall
be talking a little bit late later Lance
model which both consider those
applications generated events and system
generated events in order to track the
runtime environment better push registry
as always to support OT location of the
applications resistant storage it also
addresses that needs the UI needs for
the devices which do have you I like
HDMI devices as well as some some API to
control your cellular or actually other
type of networks in order to
better align or better dress the
requirements for the communication most
of the features come into this embedded
profile are going from there actually
from the meat p from the mobile area but
as well as we are adding the new lady is
so this is kind of list of with the ice
which is neutral int this inter process
communication in order to support
support multitasking and enable
solutions comprised out of separate set
several applications running together
and performing a single task or related
tasks shared libraries to minimize the
footprint and to enable their use the
binary code the notifications autostart
l screensaver and I'll screen
applications for the HMI devices
opentype fonts to build better you is a
mess epi and last but not least here is
the power management which is critical
for embedded devices we have a proposal
for for the new API for embedded device
because lots of embedded devices where
with display have a kind of simple
simple user interface probably like a
one or a few lines of text so there is a
new UI API to address that needs in
order not to you know not to have the
full-blown LCD UI or whatever more
powerful API so it supports line array
into this place it supports events i'm
scrolling and like limited color support
of course with necessary information for
the application to adapt to particular
configuration for the devices which has
better better displays we support
LCD UI as equity with some extensions to
better you know address the current
state of user interaction models like
multiple and touch support the gestures
and stuff like that mi CPI is actually a
new thing here it was never part of any
specification before it allows the
application to control the AMS
application management system of the
java runtime so the application is by
using this API is able to initiate the
installation removal or any life cycle
changes of the other applications to
monitor their state the running status
the installation progress all necessary
hooks are provided in order to to have a
proper control over the security of all
ms operations so that you can track
whether your application see signs in a
proper way or whatever security
questions AMS might have which in my
period typically were you know provided
to the user to answer for and here they
could be automatically you know managed
by the application which is uses a mess
API so well this epi actually allows to
build any a mess front-end like for with
the user interaction for mobile world
for example or any automatic or remote
control system fully embedded and if you
if you go to dim grounds actually we we
show our Joe any embedded platformer
least three to two the first products
from Oracle which supports an embedded
platform and as part of that we do have
implementation of this ms API and you
can see that
they're a mess on the device could be
remotely controlled with telnet like
connection through the ethernet to the
board so you can install applications
and monitor the status and actually do
whatever needed remotely from the
console services framework as Roger
mentioned there is service loader a.p i
part of co DC specification the new CDC
specification and embedded profile
enhances it more ads the proper binding
to the AMS to allow have the full-blown
framework to for applications to act
like a services for another applications
so as Roger said with we had a talk
yesterday with regards to that but going
like insured this is this framework
allows the application or a shared
library to export a service provider
which is actually implementation of some
interface and another application or
java runtime itself can use that service
provider by only knowing that the
interface which which defines this
service the service loader a.p I from
CDC would allow the application to
enumerate all the providers of
particular service so there can be zero
mutations or one or more than one and
all of them are availa available to the
client application by means of accessing
this service loader so some visual
features of this framework is an ability
for the library to export interface to
declare that it supports that it
provides ordnance the interface and
ability to declare dependencies so that
the MS can bind during
during the execution of the application
can bind the service provider with a
service consumer it's the there are
security requirements to avoid having
any you know security holes opening
security holes by allowing to execute
service provider in the context of
running service consumer application and
well yeah the last bullets I used to you
know show that this particular framework
is not kind of IPC type of thing but
instead it binds or runs the service
provider in the context context of
service consumer application so that
they are all executed in single Java
process and have the same security
context as cotc doesn't provide across
all their support now so the main
components of that framework is service
loader which is defined in cldc this
service provider interface well that's
Java interface which should be known
both for a service provider and service
consumer in order to communicate
together the applications or libraries
which provide the proper provider and
consumer code as well as same as
requirements in order to track or and
bind the applications together to to
complete the functionality so that's
that's what we have proposed for Joe any
part from eight and now move into
something completely new to java area we
have a proposal to have so called device
access API which is specifically
targeted to address embedded needs the
needs of embedded devices so what's that
this is kind of low-level API in order
to access the
capabilities which are typical for the
embedded devices to you know to control
the embedded devices like pee videos and
to get an information out of that this
is an optional package so it's not
necessarily present so on your system
but of course well when it makes sense
it should be there it's designed in a
way to be compatible with Java Sea so
Java Sea embed it can also leverage this
this API for the same purpose so simple
diagram on how the structure of the
stack could look like so there is a Java
VM we still dc-8 specification down
below on top of that we have embedded
profile together with device access API
and the application which can leverage
this device access API to provide the
functionality 4422 controlling the
devices like a touch screen for example
or more simple gpio type functionality
so well devices say device access API mo
mostly talks about pre feels so what are
the pier feels actually there these are
any type of of hardware functionality on
your embedded devices and that could be
controlled like individually if it makes
sense or in a group sit if it makes
sense so that there are lots of type
types of that period feels and well
probably it would be better to show some
some of them for you to get an idea so
this could be GPIO pins which could be
controlled individually or other groups
the pores I to see OSBI buses to connect
to a remote so you're not not on cheap
devices ADC and DAC devices
to get their readings of whatever
measuring devices you have or to control
like service or whatever communication
buses like wart or you start memory
mapped devices also the CPI includes
abstraction on top of 80 comments to
control modems or modem type devices
which support them watchdog which is
typical for embedded pulse counter as
well as the CPI is designed in a way to
allow the implementation to extend it in
a proprietary way for example so like we
ms or platform integrators could enhance
its even more to support the proprietary
type of devices which are essential for
any particular you know hardware so on
and in the words over back to Roger
Thank You Andre so we've talked a bit
about how we're expanding the platform
the target embedded and then the
question comes back around to well how
are you going to continue to support
mobile so the the specifications
themselves are going to be a bit more
have more option ality and more features
the subset of the things that are in the
spec will be well still cater to the
existing mobile use cases and they'll be
more you know more of an opportunity in
the mobile space to use some of the new
functionality in the specifications so
we believe that developers will actually
have access to a bigger market because
the platform developers for a me will
have a bigger market because there will
be with dressing more a broader range of
devices than just mobile so far OEMs
will be able to put more you know take
some of the new features in the embedded
spec and use them in mobile deployments
and the sort of the RI and the offerings
from Oracle will support more sort of
binary it more support in the runtimes
the we're obviously continuing to work
in the JCP with with the whole platform
and we're going to encourage the other
active mobile companies to continue the
development of their specifications in
the mobile feature
is in the JCP ms a sort of the umbrella
spec 44 they're the sort of current but
slightly old mobile spec we're going to
continue to support that with the
existing products and hopefully with new
ones as it's maintained in the JCP so
just some examples of the things that
are being included in the embedded
profile that would be useful in mobile
space shared libraries we've mentioned a
couple of times as being away new way to
package applications the sum of these
features were sort of pioneered in the
mid p3 spec and they're included in this
broader platform spec as well support
for screen savers and idle screens
multiple displays as a API for
notification of events just your API or
touch API that we mentioned before in
the UI there's there was support
proposed for sort of user provided fonts
for the go with user I user application
and then one of the biggest issues in
mobile that needed address to be
addressed in was the sort of the
security model which didn't make which
sort of interfered with easy ease of use
and that'll be relaxed and simplified as
as part of the specification sort of
another view of the the features of the
embedded specs I apply to mobile phones
the sort of continuation of the
application packaging and provisioning
infrastructure that's used and in mid p
and then MSA applications there's a new
API to get information from the cellular
connections of the SIM card or the
weather if whether it's 3g 4g all of the
network information is there's a new API
to get that to the application you'd be
able to get that information there's a
event system that allows you to monitor
things like battery level and to pass
application events between applications
through the event API the xapi I also
includes power some control over power
of the device and be notified of changes
in power events the inner application
communication mechanism of mid piece or
the
a named pipe kind of arrangement if
you're familiar with linux is part of
the the embedded API there's support for
the full RMS or the record management
store from from mid be with the
enhancements that were in mid be for
tagging records as well as a sort of a
subset a smaller version of SMS is being
considered a bunch of changes to in the
security policy requirements that
influenced the way that mobile
applications prompt that are didn't
prompt those are actually for embedded
there's very little need for user
interaction and then the AP is for
dealing with the user interface are also
necessary the embedded stack is also
creating a new sort of text or single
line oriented display because there are
a lot of embedded devices that don't
have bitmap graphics but they have a
character oriented display and then
continuing support for media in the way
that was done in mid be the other the
device access API potentially can
contribute in the mobile space for us
for access to USB and you are or serial
port access from GCF and from the CL you
see specifications obviously we've got
continuation of the support for HTTP
connection sockets and the new multicast
support and the ability and with access
points for the application to be able to
choose which you know whether it's a
Wi-Fi connection that your application
wants to use on a phone or a wider wide
area network access and then from CL you
see the base platform you know full
support for languages and the updates to
libraries so that sort of covers the the
current thinking and the planning for
for Java ME eight we're also looking
ahead to Java ME nine that the they've
tried to plan features into releases
with predictable schedule so we're going
to continue the architectural alignment
and the feature alignment with java SE 9
one of the big features in se9 is
expected to be the
the modularity mechanisms we want to
bring some part of that to Java ME so
that the same mechanisms for
distribution and packaging of modules
can be used and Java ME I'll have to see
exactly how that works out because we're
still going to be operating in a
constrained environment and need need to
make sure that the artifacts are
designed properly we're going to do a
little bit more of the separation or
sort of clean up the API so that it's
easier to have a subset of java SE and
improve some of the virtual machine
interactions so that there's more
synergy and similarity between the VMS
or at least the applications view of the
vm between SE nme that probably some new
you know the new api is for embedded
devices they're sort of constantly
looking for feedback and what to develop
and then continuing the the mobile
support for mobile and from the java SE
development tools just an example of the
kind of thing that would be you know
we're going to pursue and figure out a
line apparently the location API is from
it's a nokia api and it's but we need
location to be an API that works across
the java java platform with Java ME or
se so you know we're working on figuring
out how to migrate the api's to an API
that looks like it fits on SE and you
know it works well with SE the API style
designs functionality access to services
and yet still is applicable on the Emmy
side so there's a bit of work to do
there around the folks that are
interested in location and again you
know location is one of those things
that doesn't just need a GPS to work
sometimes you can tie it into a web
service that will reverse map your IP
address and sort of tell you where you
are and one other addition that's needed
around location is access to the
accelerometer and compass things that
you might need if you're building it
either navigation app or sometimes even
just a little you know game player app
having an API there that works across
the entire platform would be a real plus
both for Java ME ME ME in
in java SE embedded in tub fe so we'll
probably do some more in modulation area
around the API to make it a better fit
you know to take advantage of the module
system in Java sc9 and also be able to
target a broad range of and scale of
devices so I already mentioned that so
the platform definition is largely you
know is done through the JCP which is
sort of separate from the product
definition this is mostly about the with
standards proposals so the activities
were conducted we started in Java ME in
the JCP are these two gs are proposals
for cle c8 and the embedded profile and
with the at this point we're not
pursuing any new new specifications
specifically targeted at mobile but the
embedded profile provides a lot of
support in the mobile space and we
expect to you know with the schedule for
which since we've aligned our schedules
for Java ME with java SE and the java SE
schedule is targeted for a year the Java
ME schedule pretty much follow along but
stay tuned so in summary I think we're
trying to expand the program the
platform to work for the needs of small
embedded and the device market as well
as the potential for software developers
to create service services and service
providers and you know the big
initiative is to align the Java me SE
api's be able to build on the ecosystem
in the developer pool for both Sen Emmy
and you know from our perspective since
we've been a little bit on the sort of
hiatus of standardization update on Java
ME it's a big step to get this
development that being done in in the
JCP and to get people involved in
contributing so just looking back in
terms of a roadmap in 2012 we've shipped
a couple of updates to previous
specifications and products around Java
ME embedded 32 with support for embedded
devices based on the existing
specifications and some
specific extensions and device api's and
the SDK to go with it developed support
development I think you know the next
year we it's also expecting to update
that to include more to be better
tailored and meet some feedback that
we've got will get from developers and
then aligned at the end of 2013 the the
updates to the specifications and the
platform for Java ME embedded and
updating the tools with the Ides and
then beyond that we'll figure out a plan
to work with se9 so a couple of talks
we've already sort of missed a couple of
talks or there were a couple of talks
about more specific areas here of CLE
see the service platform and I think
this morning there was a talk about the
new platform for ubiquitous computing
but still yet to come is the so there's
a talk on the SDK developing java mobile
embedded applications with MES dk2 and i
think that's actually next around the
corner and then the IM p talk which is
actually we've in the meantime it got
renamed this is the talk talk at three
o'clock tomorrow is the embedded profile
talk by the spec lead so thank you very
much for coming and listening and if you
have any questions feel free well I
think we have there is support round
rate for on-device debugging today the
it basically it's it's a proxy that sits
between the normal set of debugging
tools insta-tox the normal protocols and
it talks directly to a private protocol
to the vm i think that's being enhanced
and so they're more tools yeah actually
well that's that kind of thing exists
for my belief forever or from the start
in germany world that there is a proxy
running between actually one like on a
host which translates the request from a
debugger to do
from Java debugger into some more
compact format going through some remote
channel to do to the device to the vm
running on the device we are enhancing
that in order to provide more support
like more debugging features as well as
monitoring like you can you can monitor
the state of your memory for example and
network connections on the device so all
of that are in real time going from the
device to your proxy and you can query
from the NetBeans or from SD key the
query that proxy and have an up-to-date
picture of all of the things in java SE
there is a tool visual vm which is a
very good tool for monitoring objects
and footprint and i believe this the
Praxis being enhanced the visual vm can
monitor now and actually we are we are
going towards conversions of the tools
used for SC and the new worlds so we are
targeting to address the the same
monitoring tools as a serious
they don't be still a separate proxy but
it will talk to visual vm yeah visual vm
is a very sort of a high-level tool but
it it uses a very generic a protocol to
talk to the vm to get information from
it this enhancement is is making that
same kind of proxy work with smaller
devices the specific device manager is
in that's in the SDK and it's mostly the
emulation and emulation tool but the
direction is to have better integration
of you know physical devices with the
the ID environment I actually I would
encourage you to go to the SDK talk at
eleven-thirty and then I think they will
be able to explain more about the actual
architecture and the way it's being
implemented parser oh jeez on
I so sorry what was the first API how
Jason so at the moment where there is a
JSON API and development in Java EE and
we've been looking at it to see how
applicable it would be to Emmy and to
try to influence so it would be but is
that sort of and java SE is doing the
same evaluation because that seems like
a very common need we haven't yet sort
of committed to try to put the json api
into as a component Java ME it would be
you sort of need to gauge the need but I
think it is very common lingua franca to
talk two things but it would be an
optional package kind of thing that
would be used where needed but we
haven't there's no current plans to do
that will make an OE actually
considering the development of the
strategy with regards to communication
with with the back end like with service
servers databases like identity
management all this enterprise stuff of
course with the current technologies
it's for for the embedded devices we are
looking at it includes two heavyweights
communication protocols and too much
data to be transferred so we are
thinking alone on having some kind of
proxy between them probably running on
some some java java SE capable devices
but we are kind of still in defining
this to our strategy towards that yeah
this is this is one of the challenges of
centralia scale from you know a few
hundred k 2 10 megabytes we're in a 10
megabyte system you can put you know
lots of stuff when you have to deal with
a really small device you have to
constrain what you want functionality
you want to achieve probably have to
constrain the protocol you talk to it
and this proxy technique is you know
seems like a very good way to bridge
that take a link in the same
functionality it's okay to parse JSON
the embedded device but once you start
you know to pulling in the data it will
become so much so it will just slow your
hip hinge right
oh well our actual our experience shows
that s qi t is too heavy weight for our
types of devices well i think this is
another place where in the 10 megabyte
in of things SQR whites fine yeah but in
the two megabytes of things it's so so
actually I know our product by itself in
some configurations include their school
light and although there is no no no api
to use it but as a product that there
are some features of the product which
uses that engine but we see that it so
we can only use that for you know for
big configurations and actually like for
the devices we for example heads in our
had supported in our 32 to release which
we just released recently it's not
possible to help we are evaluating or
kind of thinking about probably
supporting some know a screw type of
databases so something in the middle but
that's still not in our old map it's
just of india there's probably need for
better database support but it's not
figure out exactly what features you
need and i'll trade out to fit that
sounds like a problem with well familiar
with all right thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
