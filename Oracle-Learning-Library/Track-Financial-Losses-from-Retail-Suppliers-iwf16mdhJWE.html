retail suppliers with Oracle Stream
Analytics platform.
It runs on a big data stack and is
powered by spark streaming and Kafka
messaging run time. To track financial
losses from retail suppliers, login to
Oracle Integration Cloud that has
streaming analytics provisioned. Click the
user profile, and then click System
Settings. Verify and enter kafka
zookeeper connection and runtime server
details in the Environment tab. Then,
click the Analytics tab to verify the
analytics settings. You need to create a
few artefacts to build the solution and
make up the base stream of supplier data.
These artefacts are: the streaming source
of the products' transactional events, the
suppliers' database connection, a target
for supplier analysis, an underlying
Kafka connection, and finally, a reference
to a specific database table which
provides more information for the
specific supplier. Start by creating the
solution pipeline. Click Create New Item
and click Pipeline. Then, provide a Name, a
useful Description, and Tags for
searching artefacts later in the catalog.
Select Sales Transactions as a streaming
data and click Save. Now, we'll add more
capabilities before publishing the
pipeline. Add a new query stage in this
pipeline by clicking Add a stage, and then
select Query. Provide a Name and
Description, and click Save. Now, specify
the source correlation properties. To do
that, click Add a Source, select List of
Suppliers as the reference, click Add a
Condition, and select the Product field
of the reference equals with the Product
field of the stream. The Product, the
stream and the related table information
are joined together instantly, providing
valuable information for later decision
making by the application.
Using the built-in expression editor add
a new query stage to analyze the
calculated results. To do that, click Add a
Stage and select Query. Provide a Name
and Description, and then click Save.
Click the Product Line column, then the
Expression Editor icon, enter Quantity
Sold multiplied by Unit Sale Price, and
click the Apply icon. Right-click the
calc column, select Rename, and rename it
to TXN revenue to indicate transaction
revenue. Click the Expression Editor icon
on the live output table, enter the
expression as Quantity Sold multiplied
by Unit Cost, and click the Apply icon.
Right-click the calc column and rename
it to TXN cost to indicate transaction
cost. Click the Expression Editor icon,
enter the expression as TXN revenue
minus TXN cost, and click the Apply
icon. Right-click the calc column, select
Rename, and rename it to Profit Loss. This
way you can calculate the transaction
costs, the revenue, and the associated
suppliers' profit and lost amounts. Now,
add a new query stage and implement
filtering to show events that have
negative amounts or losses. To do this,
click Add a Stage and select Query.
Provide a Name and Description, and then
click Save. Click Filters, click Add a
Filter, and then specify the Condition as
Profit loss lower than zero. This will
specifically identify the losses
discovered in the streaming data.
Now, click the Expression Editor, enter
the Expression as ABS of the Profit loss
column to obtain the absolute value of
losses, and click the Apply icon.
Right-click the calc column, select Rename and
rename it to TXN loss.
Now, right-click the Profit loss column
and select Remove from output. You've
provided an absolute value for the loss
amount and removed unwanted columns from
the live output stream. Finally, for our
visual analytics features, use the
expression builder to provide a value
for transaction time. To do that, click
the clock icon to add a timestamp to the
live output screen, right-click the event
timestamp column, select Rename, and
rename it to TXN time to indicate
transaction time. Now, you can create a
Target for the pipeline. To do that, click
Target on the pipeline and select
Supplier Analysis as the Target. Finally,
make sure that all the required columns
are correctly mapped so that the live
output screen shows the required
information. Now, let's add some visual
representations in the pipeline on our
Losses Only stage. To do that, click the
Losses Only stage in the pipeline,
select the Visualizations tab in the
Losses Only stage, click Add a
Visualization, and then select Bar Chart.
Provide the Name, Description, and value
for the y-axis and its label. Then, add
the value for the x-axis and its label,
select Save as a Slice for future
reference, and click Create. As the new
streaming data flows through the
pipeline, the bar chart builds
continuously giving immediate feedback
on the losses. Now, you can finally
publish the pipeline to the spark
streaming runtime. To do that, click
Publish, update the application settings
as required, and click Publish again to
build the final application and redeploy
it to the spark runtime. When you've done
that, the published pipeline is in the
catalog. So there it is, a complete
end-to-end retail supplier analysis
solution, built not in weeks or days, but
in minutes. Find out more at
