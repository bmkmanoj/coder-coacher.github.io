Product Management for a new area
relatively speaking which we call the
autonomous health framework which
basically addresses the fact that our
cluster environments for oracle
databases have gotten more complex
because we're consolidating more
databases nodes are getting bigger
servers are having more CPUs and more
memory and so the result is there are
more moving parts and it's much more
complex to maintain availability in
service levels and so we recognize that
we over the years we've created a bunch
of tools such as Ora check-in QoS
management and sequel plus and a variety
of utilities such as Seaview and what we
call trace file analyzer and these all
dependent upon customers running these
at the time they are experiencing issues
that led to the real number one problem
is reaction time you had to be notified
before you actually could take action so
we've decided to make all of these tools
run 24/7 put them in daemon mode and
notify you with some intelligence as to
the targeted problem that they're
observing and actually build upon this
framework more intelligence into the
tools such as for example we have a new
tool we're introducing called cluster
health analyzer which builds on the
metric gathering and ash data within the
database that we've had for years but
haven't done the second level analysis
for you we've a lot required you to do
that analysis and so we are doing it now
for you and therefore surfacing issues
before they actually become problems and
giving you alerts to actually do
something with it
on the performance side we're allowing
you to give a service centric approach
to your databases so that you can get
health of all your services at once and
set performance levels set objectives in
a way that you can get alerts if
something goes wrong and immediately
know where the bottleneck is and do
something about
so the idea here is to have a
comprehensive autonomous network running
24/7 that will actually keep your
cluster healthy and alert you in advance
should degradation zuv occur this is
available in Oracle release 12c release
2 and it is available with the Oracle
Grid infrastructure and it supports all
types of RAC databases both rack and
rack 1 node</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
