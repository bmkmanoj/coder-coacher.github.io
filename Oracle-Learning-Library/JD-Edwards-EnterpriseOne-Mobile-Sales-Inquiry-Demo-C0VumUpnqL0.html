within the JD edwards enterpriseone
mobile sales and Corey module the
functionality is intended for a sales
person who's at a customer site it needs
to look up information on the customer's
orders determine the current
availability of an item and give the
customer the starting list price of an
item these are simple inquiry tasks that
do not allow the salesperson to edit the
information or create new sales orders
for this demonstration i'm using an
iphone a click the sales icon on the
home screen to launch the application
when i click on that icon i am taken to
the user authentication page enter my
username and password to login this is
the same user sign on and password as a
standard enterprise one application and
uses the same security model this is the
entry point to the mobile sales inquiry
from here I have links to the sales
order inquiry where I can view both
current and historical orders item
availability where I can locate
available quantities and locations for
an item an item based price where I can
inquire on the starting list price of
our an item this demonstration shows you
how to search for sales orders for a
specific customer filter the orders
based on document type and then review
the details of the sales order this
demonstration will also show you how to
locate the total available for an item
in multiple branch plants view the
details for a specific branch and then
view the price for the item in the
selected branch first I will select on
the sales order inquiry auction this is
the sales order search page which allows
you to filter the fields that you want
to use to locate sales orders the search
filters enable you to locate desired
sales orders because we are searching on
both the current sales order and
historical sales order tables one of the
top five fields are required the sole to
ship to order customer p 0 or item
number to help with filtering the
records I want to locate the customer
based on their name so I'm going to
click on the search icon next to the
soul to I then
click on the customer name and enter the
text that I want to search on when I
click the search button the system then
searches based on that text that I enter
basically the system shows me the
results in essence having a wild card
before and after the text that i entered
the selection criteria that collapses so
i can see more results on the screen so
imagine that I'm rolling my finger up
and down on the list to locate the
correct customer number that I want to
select when I find the customer number i
can simply click on that value and
notice the back arrow that back arrow
brings the sold to number back to my
sales order search I can also select
more search options to limit my sales
order even further so I expand the list
document type and branch plant are multi
value fields I can actually add to the
document type list by entering a value
in the field such as SD and clicking the
green plus button this adds the document
type to the list that I want to filter
on I can expand that list so i can
actually view the sales order types and
if i click the red X that's going to
delete the document type from my search
criteria the search on date allows me to
determine which date from the sales
order I want to search based on request
a date promised a ship date and so on
today- and today plus enable me to pick
the number of days backwards and
forwards from today's date that I want
to find sales orders for this
demonstration I want to look at all
records in the past so I'm going to
leave today- at no limit but I only want
to look forward 30 days so I'm going to
select the list for today plus
and then select 30 days from the list
now if I wanted to I could save these
values and then the next time I come
into the sales order inquiry the values
will be populated for me these are based
on my user profile so each person can
actually save their own unique filter
values if i enter other values and i
want to get back to my saved values i
can click the restore button and if I
want to clear all values in my search
fields I just simply click the Clear
button now I'm going to go back to the
top of the page and click search so I
can actually get my results from this
search from here I can review a summary
of each order that met my search
criteria the system dynamically
calculates the total number of orders
and the order types it also displays the
number of orders at the top the document
types in the list are available based on
the search criteria that was met by my
filter field I can limit my orders
further by selecting on a document type
I'm going to select s4 which is my
transportation sales orders and click
done and you can notice the number of
sales orders went from nine to seven
because i only have seven transportation
sales orders i can review my soul to and
shipped to customers my sales order
number and document type the branch
plant that it's shipping from my request
a date and my total order ml if i want
to see more detail on the sales order i
simply click on the line i can then see
more information for each of the detail
lines on the sales order it first gives
me a summary with the item number the
quantity and the extended price I can
expand for each item and view even more
information such as the unit price the
requested date ship
date shipment information and the
statuses of the sales order line if i
want to go to the next sales order i
simply click on the arrows at the top
right so i don't have to go back to the
summary page so i can scroll down to the
next sales order and review its
information now I'm done viewing the
sales order and I want to return to the
home page so i can click the home button
at the top of the screen now i need to
inquire on the availability of mine for
a customer i select item availability
from the home page again i have some
search fields that i can use to
determine what I'm looking for I want to
find the availability for item 2 20
which is a red touring bike and branches
10 and 30 notice that these branches are
already displayed this is because I save
the values in a previous session item
number is required to view availability
so I'm going to go ahead and enter item
number 220 I know my item number so I
don't need to go find it the unit of
measure is displayed as each but if I
leave that blank it's going to use my
primary unit of measure so now i'm going
to click on search and i can see my
total quantity within the two branch
plants that i selected i have a total of
eight thousand and five i also see the
details of each of those branch plants
branch plant 10 has 1779 and branch
plant 30 has 6226 my customer typically
gets sourced out of branch plant 30 so
I'm going to click on branch plant 30 to
get more details for that branch I can
now see what where the quantity is
located for each lot and location for
the item so there is plenty of stock for
my customer for this item the customer
doesn't typically purchase this item so
they want a starting list price I can
simply click on the price button and
jump over to see the starting price for
this item so item 2 20 in branch
30 has pricing set up in the base price
table I can see my price based on
currency and based on unit of measure so
in this example I have each's and I have
pallets this is really just the starting
price for my customer I can give them
the price and then we can discuss
discounts that may apply to them if i
needed to i could click the availability
button to go back to the item
availability and look at inventory in
another branch or i could click on the
filters icon to go to the base price
search form and look for the price of
the item in another branch I have now
found all the information the customer
requested so I'm going to return to the
homepage this concludes demonstration
