and configure catalog permissions want
to enable your group of sales analysts
to create and run analyses against
specific catalog content create a custom
role administrators provision users
through the use of application roles
which control access to functionality by
providing authentication use the console
to create and manage application roles
there are two types of application roles
predefined and custom predefined
application roles are sets of privileges
that determine what users can see and do
in Oracle bi cloud service your own
custom application roles enable you to
secure folders analyses and other
content stored in the catalog the first
step is to create your own application
role next change the privileges of the
new role to assign a parent application
role privileges are inherited from
parents so a user who is a member of an
application role inherits all of the
privileges associated with the parent
application role this enables any member
of the new role that is provisioned by
the parent role to use all of the
functionalities such as create and
analysis now add members to the new role
search for the user names that begin
with the letter J select Jamie black and
Jennifer Jackson the final step is to
set access permissions on catalog
objects for the application role
navigate to the catalog object and open
the permissions dialog for an object
catalog objects can include folders
dashboards analyses and so on search for
the new role when you configure catalog
permissions for your own application
role the members added to the role will
also have those permissions set the
level of permissions
to ensure that your changes work
properly sign-out is the administrator
and then sign back in as Jamie black a
member of the new role open the analysis
for which you changed the permissions
now you know how to create your own
application role and configure catalog
permissions to objects for the role
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
