administering pdb as a service
self-service portal we show you how to
create a data as pool for pd bees as
well as corresponding profiles and
templates for later deployments by self
service users first of all let's connect
to enterprise manager as a cloud
administrator before we define the
database pool surf service users will
use to request PDP's from we are going
to look at the set of servers we will
use to host CDs this set is called a
zone one is already created and we will
use it but let's have a quick look at
how it was defined as you can see the
zone is called bronze in reference to
the Oracle Database 12c ma a best
practice servers level tears for
database as a service these pool
contains servers hosting single instant
CD B's the development of test type of
placement policy is defined for maximum
CPU and memory allocation these lows to
filter out out burned servers when
deploying to this pool two servers are
part of our browns Zone and name
credential was created to access the
servers one role was pre created and
assigned to this zone to a low access of
its servers to self-service portal users
we can now cancel this operation and
confirm next step is to define the
database pool containing CDs
used for future PDP's deployments you
can do so from the database cloud
administration portal the database pool
we want to create will be a set of CD be
instances running on host within the
define bronze zone and used for PDB
provisioning so let's give it a name
then a description and then let's select
a pre created credential so for the
hosts we don't need one for the grid
infrastructure as this is single
instance and one for the database which
has been pre created then we need to
define the zone so it select bronze here
then let's select the platform linux x86
64 and then the target type which is
going to be database instances and the
version 12 101 in this case now we need
to add CDs that will be useful
provisioning on both host and you can
see that we have two one on each OS so
let's select them and they're going to
be used to provision our PBS and that's
basically it so click Next so you cannot
define placement police's allowing you
to set maximum ceilings for resource
utilization so for the PD bees let's not
exceed 50 in this case and for workloads
let's specify ninety percent for the CPU
and ninety percent for the maximum
memory utilization resource manager will
be used for the CPU management and you
are ready to create your pool click
Submit now the pool is creating and this
is done so we now need to look at the
request settings and here we're going to
leave all the defaults in place so for
the future requests
during period no constraints default
retention and purging duration so you
can click apply you can now define kotas
for your roles here we already assign
kota values to the SS a underscore user
role the specified numbers represent the
aggregated amount of corresponding
resources one user can occupy at a time
time to create profiles and templates a
profile is basically the source data of
your future database deployments here
two profiles already created and we are
going to see how to create one you could
use for a non CE db2 pdb migration
scenario you now need to define the
reference target so here we have
different types but it's going to be a
database instance since ref DB in our
case so you select that one as your
reference target and then what you do is
that you want to create an export of
that database you need to define the
credentials so for the host itself and
then for the database so for both of
them we are going to use the predefined
name credentials and then you can click
Next you now need to define the export
type you want to do which is going to be
a food that I've as export then add the
directory location for your dump file so
we're going to choose the data pump dear
directory so we select it then you can
constraint the maximum file size for the
dump file 700 let's say megabyte and you
can choose the log directory so we keep
data Pam dear in this case and then you
can click next next step is to define
the profile information like its
location inside the software library a
name and a description
as well as the database version in this
case here we can safely use the proposed
default values click Next you can now
review your profile and click Submit to
create it but here we won't do that
because we already have one created so
we're going to cancel this operation you
now need to create the template which is
the object provided to the self-service
user to provision your pdb so you create
one for pluggable databases you give it
a name then a description and a profile
profile that you already defined for
your pluggable databases there is only
one right now so you can select it from
the drop-down list here then you need to
add zones and pools so select the zone
there is only one that we are going to
use if you remember this is for single
instance pdb provisioning containing two
servers and then associated to the pool
of database instance the CDB instances
that were created so there is only one
right now one pool so you select it then
you need to specify the share location
this is where you're going to put the
dump files from your export this is a
directory created on all the nodes so
here it's going to be scratch pdb dams
last thing you need to specify is the
pluggable database prefix and then you
can click Next you need to create a
template configurations which represent
the expected CPU memory and storage
requirements for each of your templates
so we are going to create one which we
call tini and for which we're going to
specify values for CPU memory sessions
and storage so these are relatively
small
then let's create another one that we
call small with slightly bigger values
in this case for the workload let's
click create next we need to set the
default workload so it's going to be
teeny in this case and next step is to
define a role for your pluggable
database administrators so we're going
to create a new one and as you can see
we have a number of privileges that are
automatically ground through that role
to your administrator click Next you can
now change some of the initialization
parameter values we won't do that here
so you can safely click Next in this
case then you can run scripts before and
after creating your database or when you
delete it we won't do that here so you
can also click Next then you can assign
roles to your templates so that it can
be used by the social service users so
here we're gonna make sure that the SS a
underscore user role is selected then
you can click Next and review your
template information and then click
create and the template is created right
now so you are now in a position where
we can switch to the self-service user
to request these templates so you can
log out in this case then connect back
as a cell service user in this case is
going to be john smith from john smith
database portal you can now create
requests to deploy pluggable databases
so let's create one and you need to
select the template so this is the
template we just create
to clone Rev DB so we select this one
then we need to specify a name for the
request so John Smith one here and a
service name to access the pdb so my ref
PD here and then you need to specify an
administrator that will be given the
special privileges you asked for your
template then you can create submit and
your request is now running you refresh
it multiple times until it is succeeded
so now in progress and our success so
you can verify what was going on for
this request so you have a list of all
the execution steps here including the
create pluggable database and now what
you can do is go back to the
administration pages as user sees man
for example to look at the created pdb
so to make sure that it was deployed so
from the summary page you select the
targets so you look at your databases
and then you can see that you have my CD
one containing pluggable databases and
one that was just created rev DB 0 0 so
that's basically it so you see and to
end how to deploy this pdb so thank you
very much for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
