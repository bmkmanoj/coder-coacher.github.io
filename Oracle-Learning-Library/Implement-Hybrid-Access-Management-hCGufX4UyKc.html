with Oracle access manager or OEM to
create hybrid solutions that provide
existing on-premise users access to the
cloud in this video you'll learn how to
integrate Oracle Identity cloud service
with OEM to allow users to login using
federated single sign-on in a federated
single sign-on environment users
authenticate first with an identity
provider and then use an authentication
token to access content provided by a
service provider in this integration
will configure OAM is the identity
provider which creates a sam'l token for
access to Oracle Identity cloud service
the user from OAM is mapped to a user an
Oracle Identity cloud service without
the need to re-authenticate first we
configure OAM as an identity provider an
Oracle Identity cloud service
then we configure Oracle Identity cloud
service as a service provider in OAM
last we test the federated login and
enable it so let's get started
in order to configure OAM as an identity
provider we need to export the sam'l 2.0
metadata in the OEM console next we
configure a new identity provider an
Oracle Identity cloud service and import
the metadata file the metadata file
contains information such as endpoint
URLs and signing certificates that allow
trust to be established we're using the
users email address as the mapping
attribute this attribute is used to map
the OAM user to an Oracle Identity cloud
service user Oracle Identity cloud
service supports the sam'l 2.0
Federation standard as a service
provider and accepts the valid sam'l
token as a relying party
now that OAM is configured as a sam'l
partner to Oracle Identity cloud service
we need to configure Oracle Identity
cloud service as a partner in OAM
service providers are configured in OAM
as a partner under identity provider
management we set the email address as
the name ID value in OAM for the partner
this attribute is used to map one and
only one user in the Oracle Identity
cloud service back in the Oracle
Identity cloud service console we can
now test the Federation before enabling
it
with an enabled identity provider we can
also activate the login chooser the
login chooser allows us to authenticate
with either the identity provider or
Oracle Identity cloud service with the
configuration complete we now have a
choice when we log into Oracle Identity
cloud service we click the identity
provider link for a federated login
using sam'l when we click the link were
redirected to the identity provider for
authentication a sam'l assertion is
created and sent to Oracle Identity
cloud service in a browser post
operation if the assertion is valid were
mapped to a user in Oracle identity
cloud service and authenticated there as
that user after login the identity cloud
service homepage is displayed confirming
that the integration is fully functional
since the oracle identity cloud service
includes an ability to edit your User
Profile and reset your password we need
to configure our user as a federated
user a federated user can no longer
change their password on Oracle Identity
cloud service federated users manage
their passwords at the identity provider
in this video you've seen how the Oracle
Identity cloud service can be integrated
with Oracle access manager we configured
Oracle access manager as an identity
provider for Oracle Identity cloud
service
the completed configuration allows users
to first log into OAM is the identity
provider and an oracle identity cloud
service using their federated single
sign-on token this video is based on an
oracle by example tutorial on the Oracle
