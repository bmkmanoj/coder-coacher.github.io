people in Oracle content and experience
cloud is from within a group you can
join groups created by others or make
your own sharing folders and
conversations with a group gives
everyone in the group access just as if
you had shared the item with each group
member individually before making your
own group it's a good idea to see if
someone else has already added you to a
similar group or if a similar group
already exists that you can join note
that some groups may have a private
membership we mean you can see the group
and add them to anything you share but
you won't be able to join if there isn't
a group to join that meets your needs
you can make your own and add others
anyone you add to your group is included
when a folder or conversation is shared
with the whole group be sure that when
making a group you follow any guidelines
your organization has such as how to
name a group or who to include make the
group public or private by selecting
whether anyone can use the group or if
they have to be a member you can also
choose whether to let people add
themselves useful if you're expecting
the group to be very large or if a group
manager has to add them which gives you
more control of membership for smaller
groups you can choose who can manage a
group when you add them that's it once a
group is created you can search for
groups and share folders and
conversations with them just like you do
individuals quick and easy thanks for
