a retail customer who wants to run
production on Prem and dev tests on
Oracle cloud so here I am logged into
enterprise manager that is this is the
database tab where we see two container
databases one running on Oracle cloud
and the production running on Prem the
production database has two pluggable
databases one of them is sales prod so
before i do anything let me show you the
data that's there in sales prod this is
the customer details table which has
four columns and one of them is the
email ID and another is the credit card
number so what we are going to do we are
going to clone this pluggable database
on to Oracle cloud and do masking in
context of the cloning so let me go back
click on sales prod go through the menu
learning clone to Oracle cloud this
kicks of a wizard where most of the
inputs are already filled with the
information that's in enterprise manager
as I go through the wizard the third
step in the wizard lets me provide the
masking definition the masking template
so again let me shift and show you the
masking definition or the customer
details table if i look at the format it
shows me that the masking is defined by
a PL sequel package which is randomizing
the credit card numbers again going back
so select the masking template and clone
so this kicks of the cloning workflow
which unplugs the database transfers the
data files plugs the database on oracle
cloud so while this is going on let's
look at one of the targets that was
already closed
I am now in the context of the container
database that's running on Oracle cloud
and it has a sales day of database so
clicking on it takes me to the home page
of the database for the DBS out here you
are familiar with this home page right
you have the performance management
graphs you can monitor the sequel
sessions you can monitor the incidents
and problems but the most interesting
thing here is this cloud icon right
which lets you distinguish from other
databases running on Prem so what I'm
going to do here is I'm going to run a
sequel the same sequel that I ran on
Prem provide some Corrections on
formatting run the sequel so this
returns the data as you see the data
here is redacted for the email id and
it's masked I don't expect you to
remember the credit card numbers but
trust me they're mask while cloning onto
Oracle cloud now masking is great when
you are setting up databases in a secure
way but your auditors and compliance
officers are still going to ask you what
about the compliance of all the
databases whether they're running on
Prem are on Oracle cloud so enterprise
manager provides a compliance dashboard
which gives you a single pane of glass
view of all databases whether they're
running on Oracle cloud or on-premises
for the PCI compliance and you can see
how the databases are performing with
respect to that compliance so these demo
shows three things one we have a single
pane of glass management for databases
whether they're running on trim or an
Oracle cloud it provides the facility to
clone the database at masking in context
of the cloning and number tree for your
security officers and compliance
officers we have a single pane of glass
reporting in terms of compliance and for
those who want to play around with this
product we have a hands-on
app where you can actually play around
with these features thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
