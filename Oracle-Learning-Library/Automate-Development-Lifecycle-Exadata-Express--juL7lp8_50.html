application development across multiple
Exadata Express instances using
developer cloud service
in developer cloud service I'll create a
project with an optional git source code
repository to which I will upload the
connection credentials for my
development and production
exadata Express instances I will build a
Hudson job with sequel CL steps to
export an application from the dev
instance and import it into the prod
instance this is a simple example in a
real environment you'll likely have
multiple Exadata Express instances for
development testing QA production and so
on
in my Exadata express dev instance I
used the app builder theme roller to
change the sample database apps
background from blue to red for my
simple example I will use developer
cloud service to orchestrate the
advancement of this modified app from my
Exadata Express dev instance to the prod
instance
from the Exadata Express cloud service
console I downloaded the credentials zip
files from my dev and prod instances to
my local computer
sequel developer is an Oracle developer
IDE for creating and executing sequel
and PL sequel scripts
I used sequel developer to clone a local
git repository pointing to the git
repository of my developer cloud service
I added and committed the two
credentials zip files to the local git
repository
and then push them up to the remote git
repository in my developer cloud service
in my developer cloud service code page
I now see my dev and prod credential zip
files
I create a new build job in developer
cloud service
first I go to the configure page select
the source control tab and specify git
as the source control I point to the git
repository to make the credentials zip
files accessible to the build job
next I go to the build steps tab and
from the add build step menu I select
invoke sequel CL as the type of build
step
my first build step will use sequel CL
to export the sample app from my Exadata
Express dev instance I specify the apex
host scheme a username and password of
my dev instance
I don't know the system generated
password for the apex host schema of my
Devon prod instances so for each
instance I go into the apex sequel
workshop to change the password to one
that I will know
back to the developer cloud service
build job I point to the credential zip
file from my dev instance I specify the
default DB access connect string for my
source code I could specify a sequel
file but in this example I've entered a
sequel statement to export the dev
sample app to a sequel file in a temp
folder
I create a second sequel CL built step
to copy the modified app from dev to
prod I specify the host schema username
and password of my prod instance I point
to the credential zip file from my prod
instance again I specify the default DB
access connect string my source code
does two things first it sets the apex
workspace ID for my prod instance PDB
because the default workspace IDs are
different between dev and prod pdbs then
it executes the exported sequel file to
bring the modified sample app into my
prod instance
I can easily find the workspace ID of my
prod instance by opening its app builder
opening the help drop down menu and
selecting about
the about application Express dialog
shows the workspace ID
before I run the build job let's check
the sample app in my target prod
instance
it's showing the apps default blue
background my build job should copy in
the updated app from the dev instance in
which I changed the background color
from blue to red
back in the developer cloud service I
click the build Now button to execute
the steps
a progress bar will show the build jobs
progress
when the build finishes a checkmark
indicates the build was successful I can
view the console output to check the
build execution
here we see the console output
now let's go back to the sample app in
my target prod instance
and now we see how my developer cloud
service build job orchestrated the
promotion of a modified app from my
Exadata Express dev instance to the prod
instance
