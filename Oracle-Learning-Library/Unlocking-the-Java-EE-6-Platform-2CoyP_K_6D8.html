of the NetBeans team and with me I have
chatted gbg from the prime faces team
and today our session is called
unlocking the java ee 6 platform the
java ee 6 platform provides a
lightweight set of specifications to
create really quick and easy to create
MVC based applications what we want to
do in this session is show you so this
is actually also the last slide of the
of the presentation because we're going
to begin coding and I'll start on the
model layer and show you what the JP I
specification gives us what the bean
validation specification is about move
to the controller layer and have a quick
look at what what servlets in java ee 6
provide an ejb s will move to the view
layer to jsf and you'll see how i will
set up some simple primefaces components
and then chart i will take over and add
more interesting more impressive
components from the prime faces
component sweet by the end of the
session you should have a really good
idea of of the basic components of the
Java is X platform and you should
understand how all these different
pieces for together the argument you
will be making is that the key to
unlocking the Java is X platform is
NetBeans at least partly because the
people working on Java EE 6 on a
specification on on the and on the
related tools are all found within the
same organization which is Oracle which
is really convenient people working on
Java the language on the JDK and and on
all the related technologies are found
in the same organization as where the
central key tool was found netbeans
NetBeans is really the tool provider for
the for the Java platform and in this
case for the java ee 6 platform to get
started I'm actually using NetBeans IDE
73 which came out in a beta release
yesterday I'm not using the beta release
i'm using the a daily build from the day
after the v beta release because i want
to show you some cool new features that
might not be aware of that may have as a
side effect that things might go a bit
sluggish at some points but i think
we'll be fine also in both of our
demonstrations we will just be using
plain old NetBeans exactly as we
downloaded it we didn't install any
plugins no magic tricks it so exactly as
we found it when we installed and
started up the ide click Next so first
of all we're going to be creating a
maven based application because it turns
out that most new projects are based on
maven since it has so many convenient
features such as having a project
structure defined within itself and so
that you don't need to do that yourself
so we'll be creating a maven based
project but what it will do is it's
going to display data from a database
that we have registered in netbeans and
it's a sample database that comes with
the NetBeans IDE it's a Java Derby
database will view the data and you can
see here on SQL query and wheeler that
let's run the query okay curry is run
and here are the records in our database
a customer table within our Derby
database on top of this table we have
all sorts of functionality you can
insert records add records whatever so
in fact this is a database tool found
with the NetBeans where you can actually
manipulate the records directly on
director in your in your database and
this is these are the records that we
want to see in our application we're
going to deploy these this application
to glassfish and I have glassfish up and
started already okay so we start create
the application and we'll call it
customer viewer click next we see we
have glass fish I have Java 686 a java
ee 6 platform which means i will have
that registered in my palm file pom file
opens you can see i have set in the
dependencies here now java ee 6 but you
want more than that ultimately we also
want to have primefaces support which is
our view technology once you get to the
view layer will be using this let's
begin by setting it up so we're going to
include javaserver faces you can see
that in a Java EE 6 on the view layer we
can choose between facelets and JSP you
can continue using JSP but once you get
to the view layer you'll see that you
can also thanks to face let's style our
view so we can use CSS stylesheets
thanks to face of its that is one of the
advantages that you see once we get
there I'll choose primefaces the nice
thing about primefaces is that it's
bundled with netbeans ide so there's no
extra installation steps and also what
you find out from charter is primefaces
itself is created in netbeans ide and
here we go we have a basic application
we can remove the JSP and page since we
don't actually need that and when we
look in the web.xml file I'm just
realizing that this might be quite small
font if you are sitting in the back
somewhere so I'm going to just change
the key map so that I can zoom so this
out mouse wheel up I don't have a mouse
so out- and
Plus ok
so what you can see in the web.xml
deployment descriptor is first of all
that we have a we have set here index
HTML as the first page that the user
will c dot XHTML is the Faceless
extension file it faced with extension
we see also in here welcome primefaces
and inside welcome primefaces we see a
primefaces prime veces layout primefaces
components and so on so let's deploy
this application just to get started and
see something already
applications deployed to glass fish and
still deploying
so I'm deploying to the embedded browser
which is part of 7.3 oh there it is ok
so you can see there is an umbrella
browser and you can see there the
slowness detected sign which you get in
the builds and in the betas and you can
report back on these slowness reports
anyway here we see a deployed
application deployed inside NetBeans in
the embedded browser click on the page
and here is our starting point our prime
faces layout with one primefaces
component and and a convenient thing
just to show you is that once we go back
into a primefaces file we could make a
change but no from Java oil save the
file and then refresh the browser and
there you can see and make any change in
the application and the applications
redeployed refresh the browser and
automatically you see your change so
there's no need to physically redeploy
an application once it's been deployed
so just add some h1 tags around this
save it again
and refresh okay so we have a basic
application set up with a basic layout a
faceless component so let's not look at
the Java EE 6 platform on the model
layer the java ee 6 platform provides a
standardized way to access standardized
way to access data and that is via the
java persistence specification so which
means that for each of the tables in our
database we need to have a entity class
a JP a class with special annotations
making it a JP a class with a
persistence or XML file which is the
official place to store the database
connection we need to have this file
plus all of the different classes for
the jpa class jpa entities we could
create all of that ourselves and spend
quite some time doing that or we can
just generate this so there is a
generator entity classes from database
we choose our connection we see all the
tables available in our connection I
choose customer there are foreign key
relationships with two other class to
other tables so they are included
automatically and we can see first of
all you can see the database table name
the class name that will be generated
but also potentially this is not the
first time we are in here and
potentially we've we've changed
something in our in our database and we
want to come back and regenerate the
entity classes in that case what we
would see here is in addition to knew
you would also see an update so that
would actually update the the existing
class and keep the changes that you had
made to it so this is really convenient
for and for making changes to a database
generating code and then once you've
made changes again you can regenerate
those classes what you also find is that
you're going to get a persistence unit
which is the persistence that XML file
which stores the database connection
we're going to have named queries to
simplify the our coding so we won't have
to actually physically type SQL queries
we can also see that this code generator
let's specify what types of collections
we are going to have generated in our
classes collections Lester sets and
various other settings so we can really
customize what is going to be generated
here and then the end for each of the
table to be selected we find that we
have a java class created now this Java
classes conformed to the JPA
specification we look inside here and we
find annotations and these annotations
and the JP I specification in general is
really convenient for a tool not
NetBeans IDE because it means we can
identify quite easily which of our
classes in the in an application or
entity classes by the entity annotation
that is set on the ones that are entity
classes you can see in addition that
there are named queries so we have an
end query annotation in so instead of in
our code having to type that entire an
entire query that you see there we will
be able to say customer got find all and
you also see that we'll have a nice and
easy way of accessing these different
named queries and anywhere in our
application so this is what the JP I
specification provides the bean
validation specification which also
works on the mono layer provides a
standardized way in which you can set
validation rules on your Java classes
for example I have here a size
annotation from the bean validation
specification setting the maximum size
that the city value can be 225 and if
the user enters something more than 25
they will not be able to enter that data
into the back into the database so this
information is generated from those
tables that we selected before now it's
also very nice is that in addition to
setting something like size we can also
use another annotation which comes from
being validation which is pattern so the
the pattern annotation that you specify
a pattern and which the value that the
user enters must match in the case of
NetBeans we have hard-coded into the
code generator that
if your column is named phone or fax or
email in those three specific cases we
will generate a suggestion for you so
this is why it's commented out so you
can see here a pattern annotation with a
pattern that would match a phone number
a pattern and this in this case a
pattern that matches a fax number in
this case for an email so giving you a
starting point for for correcting your
own patterns and this is what you get on
the a model layer what you also get here
is the persistence XML file so this is
the standard way in jp-a to store your
database connection so you can see it
and we can also see in here that we can
that this particular persistence.xml
file includes all entity classes in this
particular application which means once
we can get out of this persistence XML
file elsewhere in our application we can
via this XML phone get out of the
underlying classes and via those classes
have access to the database what is nice
about NetBeans and this is the single
reason why I'm using this very recent
build is that you can run JPL queries so
to do that we first need to build the
application so a new feature in 7 dot 3
is the ability to to right click on a
persistence XML file and actually check
whether this query works and what the
query results are without needing to
deploy the application or needing to
deploy anything at all so you can see
here run JPL query and here is our
persistence unit and click here and if
we get nothing then that's completely
possible but this is the idea anyway so
if you get nothing at this stage of the
game this there is support for this in
the in the java SE project type and
already in 7 dot 3 beta but in the
seventh or three final release you also
see this in the maven based project type
but as i can see here this is not
completely working yet
but this is what that okay let's
actually enter a query so let's say
select let's just like one of the
existing ones that we have in our
the queer is being executed at the
bottom here this may take a moment okay
ok
let's try this
ok
here it is okay ground data in the end
we got it okay so without needing to
redeploy our application we we can
actually see the the data that our
persistence unit makes available and
however and without doing this this run
query we could also create some servlets
that quickly check our database
connection so moving now from the model
layer to the next layer to the
controller layer we can create some
servlets so here we have the ability to
create new servlets so let's say verify
jpa verify JP a connection servlet the
places in a package so let's and prior
to java ee 6 you would need to always
register your service in the web.xml
file with java ee 6 with the servlet 30
specification unit can now use
annotations to do so so you can see here
we have an annotation and we want to get
hold of our persistence unit so we use
we can use an entity manager in this way
and we have a bunch of code generated
for persisting and changes or instead we
can simply type entitymanager a.m. and
then annotate this entity manager
and now that we have penetrated our
entitymanager we've you have in fact
injected it into our servlet having
injected it into a servlet we can then
refer to it and within our code am
correct named query you could also
return a typed query so to ensure that
we get the correct type back and play
some quotation marks use code completion
and find our named query from unnamed
query you can get our result list and
then return to our embedded browser we
have a URL pattern that we can paste
into the embedded browser here it is
okay so this doesn't look very useful
yet I'm going to close the service
window because it's not really needed
this stage doesn't look so useful yet
now what's really cool is that once we
hold down the control key and move the
mouse over the query we can see the the
SQL query underneath a that's being code
so select see from customer see you can
also click on this to jump into the
class and once inside the class let's
change the two string to be a bit more
readable name plus something else city
save the file go back to the browser
refresh the browser yet and there it is
refresh the browser and now we have our
names and cities so we've we've checked
our our connection first of all with the
new feature in 1973 of being able to run
the JPL query and secondly via servlet
and servlets are really simple to create
a really lightweight require no
registration the web.xml file anymore so
moving from the model layer to the next
layer to the control layer in our MVC
application we find that in the java ee
6 platform for that purpose we have each
IVs
ejb is used to be really heavy weight
components in an application however in
Java e6 with the ejb3 specification
things become a lot easier we will
create a customer session bean we put it
into the package with beans and we click
finish so what you see is we have a
plane or Java object with an annotation
and this is now a session bean not
implementing anything not extending
anything alt inserts to create a new
business method and we'll call it get
customers it's going to get customers
which will return the list of customers
and once we've done that we can again
inject our entitymanager into the this
time into the session bean you could go
and copy it again from the servlet but
it takes about as much work to retype it
since it's so trivial almost and then we
can say entitymanager correct named
query and and our query and our result
list then again we can correct another
servlets to check whether our session
bean works so Craig yet another servlet
verify a session being a customer
session being servlet again we won't
register it and
injecting into this servlet our
enterprise being you can do this via a
nice tool that is provided for that
purpose so we inject our session bean
via at ejb and then in our code our
customer session being get customers so
this caused the underlying method that
we've defined in the session bean which
in turn passes the named query to the
entity manager and we return the data up
into the session being so we could run
this but we would get the same result as
before so let's move to the next layer
so on the model layer you've seen the JP
I specification you've seen the bean
validation specification in action
moving to the controller layer you've
seen servlets and session beans so that
session teens are really the place where
all your business logic goes and on the
highest level and the view layer we have
our primefaces files so here we have
welcomed primefaces closed all the other
ones now what you would like to have is
our data displayed inside this file so
I'm just going to I'm going to run it
again I've lost my browser and let's in
here insert a jsf data table which is
the place where we can use expression
language to get out of the underlying
session bean and for that again there is
a nice tool jsf data table and can be
generated we have here a data table as a
starting point not only if we were to
press control space here we should be
able to see our session bean but you
don't see it because our session bean
isn't yet a named session being so
returning to our customer session bean
we now have a another specification in a
java ee 6 platform which is the CDI the
context and dependency injection
specification
and that requires us to set named as an
annotation on a session bean and get the
import statement and then also we need
according to the specification to have a
being start XML file where we can set up
rules for injection in this case will
take up all the default settings so
we're not going to change them but you
can see that the specification is now
completely met all the requirements are
met and we can go into our view layer
and look for our customer session bean
find the customer session bean and dot
customers which means when you hyperlink
into it which means get customers so
we've now injected our transaction layer
into the view layer which is a new thing
that you can do in java ee 6 so let's
add some columns so here's one column
and you can use item dots it's a name so
now we actually referring to the and
columns in our table name city again we
saves the file we refresh the browser
and there we have our data so let's go
back you can see this really minimal
amount of coding involved in setting up
a basic application with some with some
data access like this save the file
return refresh the browser and we have
our own next column now before switching
over to to chat I and a complaint one
could make is that this isn't really a
crud application it's just viewing data
and part of my defense would be well we
did name the application customer viewer
but if we were to want to turn this into
a real crud application one could also
choose jsf pages from entity classes and
doing it doing this which we didn't do
before we chose entity classes from
database if we were to choose jsf pages
for entity classes we can choose the
classes for which we want to have crud
nality click next and now for each of
the entity classes we selected four
different facelets files will be created
a file for for viewing for editing for
creating new new records for that
particular table in the database however
those files will be corrected can be
customized so you can see a customized
template so here are the templates that
are used internally by NetBeans to
generate the code that you will see next
which means that you could go in here
customize these templates to add your
logos and your special banner and your
special components that you would like
to to show and then generate and then
complete this and wizards and your
templates will be used to define what
comes out at the end of it so you can
really generate your entire application
in that way what we find is that we now
have a folder called customer because we
have a customer we had a customer entity
class order for discount code micro
market each of these originally the
tables now the entity classes have their
own folder with their own files within
them if we were now two again refresh
the browser index dot X HD now we see
that not only do we have the professor's
welcome page so what's what's been
generated is not only all of those files
but also the index facelets flower has
been has been changed and if we click on
the show or customer items what we get
is a complete crud functionality for the
underlying customer table so we have
view edit destroy we can create new
customers and store them into the
database and this would actually this
actually changes the database once
you've saved and your changes and this
is therefore not only useful you know in
the case where you're creating your own
applications are you need productivity
tools but this
also really useful when you are learning
about the java ee x platform because at
that stage it really helps to have some
code in front of you that you know for
sure follow the specification so
following this process you do end up
with code that exactly follows the
specifications guidelines and patterns
and and requirements now this is the
application that I'm actually leaving
with chat ID to continue adding
primefaces components to so handing now
over to the cha-cha okay thanks you've
done so my name is chatot ug I'm the
prime phase project lead anyone any
prime face users here wow it's good so
in this part let me cover primefaces as
an overview in case you don't know about
it it's the it's a javaserver faces
components with it provides rich user
interfaces and we have liked more than
100 components not that one
ok
so it's the websites Prime tasted or and
Prime face has more than 100 components
like tabs accordions all kinds of rich
stuff you need to develop a rich
Internet application and it's only one
jar you don't need to have any
dependencies the jar is not like a giant
chess 1.6 megabytes and it's is powered
by GSF to API so for Ajax and we also
have some extensions there's a mobile ad
on based on jQuery Mobile so we have
mobile component renders for mobile
environment and we have the theme
framework we have currently have 35
themes based on Team roller so you can
generate your team's easily without
moving in CSS and he also the push
framework powered by the famous
atmosphere framework which is come
becoming the de facto standard of push
frameworks which you can do WebSockets
long pole engaged it's streaming server
site events and whatever kind of
transport units with graceful
degradation and it supports many web
servers and browsers so it's not only
WebSockets so you can use it in many
different environments so Prime face is
currently the most popular jsf
components wit with being like 15,000
members in the forum and this is only
the registered part so we expect grab
the ability to have more than that and
75,000 postings firms and its really
growing so back to our application i
will now take over from what has been
done so far and this is actually for
cough i'm not going to use that laptop
so let me just sit down so I before
working on the cycle and managed to save
a customer because of a constraint so I
will just list them list the customers
and I will show you how to create a form
to create a customer but I'll not
actually say it because of some weird
exception i got and
and solving that will require more time
than we have so we have the customer
manager and we have the customer here
now netbeans we're using that means we
are generated these entities now we can
take this further and generate the UI
from this entities to speed up our
rupted to our development speed that's
what back we actually do every day when
we develop java applications actually
and by the way primefaces develop in
netbeans so you can see the trunk and
the branches here as well so first thing
to do is I would like to create with a
template so here I have netbeans will
game in facelet template makes me
netbeans is nice to provide us some
default CSS stuff as well so i will
choose this one let's call it template
one and i will place it inside web-inf
so that nobody can see my templates so
here is a sample template let's call it
java he unlocked sorry about my voice
i'm having a cold so it sounds weird
even though in prime phase community
today call me Optimus Prime so in the
morning I was really sounding like hey
you know I am Optimus Prime and I wish i
wish my sound this stays like this for
now so here's our template we have the
top part a left part and content part
now I would like to create a new
customer page this is facelet template
client and let's call it new customer
and the folder is well it's here and the
template is our this facelet a template
one it's you I composition and here it
is now here is our template let me just
start
we don't need sorts or just yet so
here's our template using that nice
netbeans layout now here I can just
insert some code here and choose jsf
form from entity well it will ask for a
managed bean sorry backing bean so let
me quickly create those as well so i
will create a new package I like to have
my Jessa baking beans whether they are
CDI or regular Jessa pins in interview
package so new customer review that
would be a CDI be named and request
scoped and we have a customer here
we have the getters and setters and also
let's initialize it on page load using
it postponed struck there are other ways
but this is something I like so new
customer okay so here's our bean now I
can tell netbeans to use this pin when
it generates the form so jeiza formed
from entity here is our customer a
NetBeans automatically scans entities
and provides this list and here's the
management property so here you can use
this checkbox to generate the read on
the wheel with only labels and now we
are generating and edit so here is what
NetBeans gives us with forms and you can
see for everything every property it has
labels input.text and things like that
so these are using H which are regular
jsf components so I will just try to use
P which is the prime face stuff so first
let's do this again and I'd like to show
you how to customize this and now here
there is this nice feature customized
template edit form template now this is
a free market template and here we have
you can if you are familiar with free
market stuff you can write advanced
templates using this for example if this
is a date field you can use a previous
calendar if this a number you can use
spinners sliders any kind of inputs so
here I will just use instead of for
example a chat they will p up label and
p.m. text for that inputs and I'm just
statically replacing this stuff soap
input.text areas here as well so again
this is a way to customize sorry change
this
okay so let's generate this and now I
actually don't need this stuff as well
so I don't need these parts I've just
show you the simplicity oh I didn't let
me do it by hand I forgot to edit it in
the template ok so here is a sample form
generated by netbeans and it's using a
template in template1 everything seems
fine also let's add a comment button
here to save our stuff will you save
icon you I i can check actionlistener I
don't have the method here so I need to
write it as well cost new customer
let's say it safe and let's add a girl
component here growl is like the max
grow like messages and give this one an
ID like grit or messages ok so our
method will just let's get a customer
session bean say being and actually it
doesn't have any personal time I will
just comment this out for now but
actually if we didn't have that funny
exception i would have show you that
actual persisting but it's not an issue
so here we can add a faces message faces
message severity in for success and done
and let's add it to the context and
clear the form x ok so that's it and now
the last thing is that i'm updating the
format ajax so let's see if this thing
works also let me this we have this i
usually use XHTML
okay let's run it so we have generated
UI for the new customer and we have the
new customer view as the backing bean
it's the CDI bean and we have a button
to save the purchase the customer and
display a nice message what was that new
customer okay
oops so I just need to get this as well
so that facelets is fine with static
parts so okay so here's our
page here with headers and the other
parts so here's a prime faces input.text
with teams and things like that let's
say test customer ID that should I we
should have left out so we can have this
be clear displayed other things as well
but you can see that this is the basic
stuff now you're running out of time so
i would like to create a quick another
template facelet this time I would like
to create a PF template primefaces
template and compare this one here so we
have the prime faces
so I have this primefaces layout
component with full page true and I can
have P layout unit for North another one
for the left side and another one for
the centre-right west center and let's
make this one so here I can have a p
menu component just like junk-rated so p
sub menu label menu and a menu item for
that outcome new customers and that's it
so I allowed I'm now changed this page
to use this new template and the prime
faces phones can be a big oops a new
customer so we have this better looking
thing sorry layout right now and here in
this PF template let's reduce the size
all primefaces components get UI widget
so I can just use this one to reduce the
font size
okay looks better and we've forgotten to
add new customer yeah so here's a new
customer page and we can make this
collapsible true and this one replaced
this panel grid and use AP panel header
customer toggleable true all thanks to
NetBeans discrete code completion is
really great and that's it we have a
nice-looking form here with flexible and
we can even do things like other
apportions so the UI becomes really
let's say moving and primefaces other
components like instead of key panel you
can save p field set and replace this
legend
and you'll get a filter and things like
that so so this was the new customer
page now I've quickly create a data
table wait to list all these customers
so this is like list customers using our
template PF template and also we need a
baking beam for this like list customers
view and this one has this
I can also use JC pins NetBeans will
also provide this code completion to us
so we can have a list of customers
let's say list and get it and set it for
that we actually don't need a setter one
that's it and the customer session being
here
being and
let's load these stuff
ok so here is my bean now I can in this
list customers view I can click right
click again insert code this time jsf
data table from entity and our entity is
this one and the properties list
customers view so again we can have
instead of we can have p columns here
instead of age columns and p data table
so let's generate it
so here's a data table it lists all the
stuff so i will just get rid of some of
these like the long ones and okay so i
can just remove this one as well f use
okay shut down so oops there's a problem
thump it's off this here's a data table
now what was named new customer and
let's also add it to our prime phase
template list customers you can have
icons and things like that here as well
p is not found and netbeans will
hopefully give me that or we can just
the last time I tried yeah Thank You
netbeans and I'm not saying that because
he's with me right now so but partly
well so let's add a header
list customers here we go yeah it looks
better up right then there what you can
show with H data table and now we can
have more stuff like pagination
paginated true rose five and we get Ajax
pagination let's make the sortable by
name sort by item and the good good
great thing about this again another
knitting stuff that it realizes that
what kind of pin is being displayed and
it gives me code completion here as well
so sort by here so here I have a jack
sorting and pagination I can also have a
filtering as well for item name so i
have filtering for that stuff as well so
i think i am running out of time wanting
to show you is you can have in this list
customers wheel let's create a customer
called select less a customer getter and
setter for that and let's select a
lecture out select the stuff from
datatable from our UI layer and we can
have that like five different ways of
selections in primefaces and one is
using it the default one a list
customers view customer and we can have
some instant selection as well so that
we can hook into the selection and here
i would like to have a dialogue
and again caught generation for bitnet
pins this time I will create the GSF
form but i will use the read on the view
so and i will just remove this stuff
give this one an ID like grid and that's
it now whenever I click something on
complete update
on complete
so I'm updating the dialogue and showing
it so here's our dialogue and oops
oops oops and I need to define a rocky
as well item customer ID okay that
should do it and here whoops
I can have some nice effects for this as
well make it model show effect fate for
example I the fate
let's try it now it fades and the
exploit doesn't work in a layout but
here's the base guide there are lots of
different selection mode and one final
thing that we could show is for example
if you have some repetitive stuff like
this every time you are displaying this
specific customer in a dialogue in some
other page and if you think that like in
a regular Java code you are repeating
yourself but what would we do as
developers we create a method right here
we can have right click where for
example you have a dialogue that we put
on different pages and we can select all
the stuff and natal NetBeans to refactor
it and convert it a composite component
and say customer dialogue customer via
della and we can just call it our app
from ray yes whatever so NetBeans will
create a composite compound for us and
wrap the stuff inside as a composite
component now I can go to if you check
out the folder structure here it is and
now you can just create a CC attribute
to make the anything inside this
customizable name let's say value and
this customers view customers
so now it becomes whatever being passed
from the composite component we can have
here the value is list customers we have
customers so that i can use this
composite component every time and
whenever i need so actually that one are
is not enough to show the capabilities
of NetBeans and of course july and all
the things but that's it from me for you
for the UI layer just check out prime
face the vm session tomorrow dedicate on
primefaces or one hour which i'll be
discussing the all the features and
roadmap of the project so i think i'm
done for my part perfect so there's
another session that focuses more
specifically on primefaces which is on
thursday from 3 30 to 4 30 code
primefaces ultimate component suite
which will be about prime emphasis from
the very beginning we also recommend it
to get this book from the java one book
store excellent book describing how java
ee 6 development can be done in with
netbeans 7 and the author is here and i
also is right here ok thank you very
much for attending and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
