is to allow requests from only
registered applications would you like
to route every request to specific
service URLs based on a configurable
HTTP header Bob sure would he it's too
many anonymous requests
he needs to balance the workflow of his
api's and allow requests from only
registered applications
luckily Oracle API platform cloud
service can help this service helps Bob
configure API policies so that he can
secure and manage the routing of his API
requests Bob needs to add and configure
to policies for his API those policies
are key validation and header based
routing after the configuration is
complete it needs to deploy or redeploy
the API to a gateway and then validate
the applied policies here bob is
implemented api's through the API
platform cloud service management portal
from the API implementation page Bob
applies a key validation policy to
service requests from only registered
applications this policy enforces the
presence of key values either as query
parameters or as HTTP headers to include
a valid application key it can find his
registered applications listed on the
registrations page from a different
policy category Bob applies a header
based routing policy which helps to load
balance the traffic to the API he
defines the header conditions by adding
a header name expression and value as
well as the service request URL to route
the requests when these conditions are
met the request is routed to the
specified service request URL Bob leaves
the default service request URL in case
none of the conditions are met once the
policies are applied while proceeds to
save the changes before deploying his
API to a gateway he is able to redeploy
the latest iteration of his api because
he has the proper grants to the Gateway
after the API is deployed with the new
policies Bob validates him by using a
rest client because he forgot to include
his application key as part of the
headers he
gets an error every registered
application has an application key which
is found in the application settings
page in the management portal or in the
applications overview page in the
developer portal once the header
includes the proper application key the
response displays the corresponding
output from the implemented API when Bob
sends another request only this time
including the routing header his request
gets redirected to the corresponding
service URL based on the routing
