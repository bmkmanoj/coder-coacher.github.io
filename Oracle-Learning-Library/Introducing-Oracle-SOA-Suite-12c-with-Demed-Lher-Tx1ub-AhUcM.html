product management at Oracle I am part
of the engineering organization my role
is to define the product roadmap as well
as evangelize the product as we're doing
today
now we need to talk a little bit about
our brand new release or call it sorry
12c which is a very exciting release
with a lot of new features so let's talk
a little bit about the drivers beyond
that realities when we started designing
the product we thought about two things
one industry trends these are things
that CIOs need to embrace in order to be
able to innovate in different shape
moving forward and on the other hand we
also had user feedback we at this point
in time we've got thousands and
thousands of customers using Oracle SOA
suite 11g around the world and this
community gave us a lot of tremendous
feedback on the product and how we can
make it better moving forward let's
start with looking at industry trends
three things are top of mind for CIOs
today mobile cloud and Internet of
Things let's start with mobile 90% of
CIOs will be deploying new mobile
applications in 2014 that is 90 percent
so as you can imagine Mobile is at the
top of everybody's agenda today and
having a strong integration backbone is
very very important to support a
sustainable growth of mobile strategies
Mobile should really just be one channel
in a multi-channel strategy it's very
important to have a cohesive integration
backbone to support that so we already
had support for rest in source we'd 11g
but these mobile frameworks require a
lot of rest but also Chasen so what we
did is that we added a lot of support in
the tooling for Jason in 12c we're
talking about wizards to to create new
adjacent objects we're talking about
automated conversions from XML to rest
as well as new rest bindings so
basically a strong stronger support for
rest and JSON in source with 12c that's
one in order to
got the adoption of mobile throughout
the enterprise we also have a great
feature in order to support mobile
interaction and that is we have a
built-in cache in service bus what that
gives you that it really improves the
latency of these mobile applications
because now instead of having to go back
to the backend applications all the time
let's say to retrieve a customer profile
we can actually serve an information
right from memory and as you know mobile
users are very impatient one second
delayed is is always too long that might
be enough to - for them to give up on
the mobile application so latency is
very very important and having that in
memory cache in front of your back-end
systems is really a key to to improve
your mobile adoption so that's on the
mobile side now the other thing that is
ticking the industry by storm is cloud
on the cloud cloud side a cluttered
option has been rising at a very fast
clip line of business owners go out and
adopt a new cloud applications typically
based on on on usability now what that
leaves IT department with is the task of
integrating these cloud applications
that reside outside of the company
outside of the firewall with the rest of
the enterprise systems that reside on
Prem what we did in 12c is that we added
a lot of Clawd adapters pre-built cloud
adapters are going to make that task
much easier basically the goal is to
reduce the distance between these cloud
applications and young prem systems
these cloud adapters include graphical
wizards to basically connect to the
system's capture credentials store them
in a secure fashion and then show you in
a very graphical and very intuitive way
all the objects yeah and you have access
to so the goal is really to make these
cloud applications look like a
non-primary application as easy to
integrate as with a non-prime
application and then in the end you end
users should not see where an
application reside for them it's
transparent whether it's on Prem whether
it's on the cloud
should be all transparent should be all
integrated on the same platform you do
not want to have to integrate platforms
on top of having to integrate
applications so that's for the cloud
part now the last industry training I
want to talk about is the Internet of
Things Internet of Things is basically
about all these new devices that are
emerging all over the place all these
always connected devices we're talking
about things like temperature sensors
we're talking about GPS enabled phones
so all these devices need to contribute
to your enterprise systems and processes
but the problem with this is that these
devices tend to generate information at
a very very fast rate this is really a
sea of data that your back-end systems
would not even know what to do with
we're talking about thousands and
thousands of messages every seconds
we're talking about potentially
thousands of devices deployed so you do
not want to simply forward an
information to enterprise systems what
you want to do is extract interesting
information and interesting patterns out
of this and then transfer that to
enterprise systems let's say for
instance when you detect a specific rise
in temperature in a data center you want
to automatically generate a ticket
support ticket in your new back-end
systems right but you need to want to
capture each and every temperature read
you do not care about this so for that
what you want is a product that we
called Oracle even processing that is
going to be basically extracting all
these patterns and all these relevant
information very valuable information
and then convert them into actions on
the backend by providing this
information to to the Oracle SOA suite
so this is how we're going to be
tackling Internet of Things this is how
we're going to basically integrate these
devices within enterprise systems so
three things we talked about mobile how
we've been improving the the featured
source we to better support rest and
chasten cloud through our cloud adapter
strategy and also Internet of Things
with Oracle even even processing to
bridge
gap between your devices and you
enterprise systems
