documentation video series on advanced
clustering
advanced clustering is an enterprise
specific clustering solution that uses
data mining to create store groupings at
different product levels using a variety
of inputs these inputs include
performance data such as sales dollars
sales units and gross profit product
attributes such as brand color size and
fit soar attributes such as climate
store format size and servicing
distribution center third party data
such as demographics income ethnicity
and population density as well as
customer segments
in this session I'll be showing you how
to generate a store cluster
after logging into the advanced science
application I'll select the advanced
store clustering overview tab
where I can see previously created
clusters and then I'll select the tasks
icon
where I'll select advanced store
clustering and then generate store
cluster
the generate star cluster tab is used to
create clusters and then model the
clusters with various scenarios in order
to determine the best clusters it
consists of three stages cluster
criteria cluster results and cluster
insights to generate a new cluster I'll
select the create new cluster criteria
icon
on the new cluster criteria pop up in
the name field I'll need to enter a
unique name to identify the cluster
the cluster by field is a predefined
group of attributes that include
consumer profile store attributes
product attribute profiles product
performance mixed attributes customer
profiles and product forecasts these
criteria types are sets of attributes
for example store attributes are the
properties of a store these properties
can include ethnicity store format and
store size once you choose the
merchandise level for the cluster you
must select the hierarchy type the
hierarchy level and the hierarchy node
these are specific to the merchandise
level you select then choose the
location level for the cluster you'll
also need to select the hierarchy type
the hierarchy level and the hierarchy
node these are also specific to the
location level you select you can also
select by name a predefined template
that can be used to create a cluster
hierarchy moving on to the effective
period area you can define a time
interval for the cluster by either
choosing a period from the list provided
or by selecting a start date and an end
date to define the effective period you
select either planning period fiscal
period or select a date in the source
time period section under source type
select historical sales data for
clustering and view contextual data to
analyze cluster performance you can
specify more than one time period and
assign different weights to different
periods in order to place more or less
emphasis on different periods source
time periods are available for all
cluster criteria with product and
performance or mixed criteria when
performance metrics are used for
clustering these define the historical
data used for the calculation this time
period also defines the historical data
used to display BI when sales metrics
are shown from the period level
drop-down select from fiscal year fiscal
quarter fiscal period or
school week once you select the period
level you select the starting and ending
subdivision within that period the wait
field is used to define the weight given
to the historical data from the defined
time period once finished I'll click
Save
this takes me back to the all cluster
criteria page on this page you can
create cluster criteria and define an
initial cluster you can modify the
configured primary scenario or create
another scenario to perform what-if
analysis first selected cluster criteria
you can also view or edit cluster
criteria the characteristics of the
cluster are displayed in the cluster
criteria pop up you can also copy delete
and execute cluster criteria if you
highlight the cluster criteria you can
examine the details above that cluster
criteria which are displayed in a pop-up
the details include information about
the cluster criteria and the scenario is
created for that cluster criteria
you can also filter all cluster criteria
on this page now let's go back and look
at the cluster we created you can view
the status of the cluster which shows
created ready for approval completed
with errors approved or rejected the
number of attributes listed are the
number of attributes used in the cluster
the columns also show the maximum and
minimum number of clusters in the
cluster process notice the status of our
cluster says created to generate the
cluster you'll need to click the execute
selected scenario icon this changes the
status to execution in progress in order
to see the completed execution you'll
need to select the Refresh icon until
ready for approval shows in the status
field after executing the scenario I'll
click Next
which takes me to the cluster results
page the application uses the data and
the parameters you defined in order to
group stores together that are most
similar according to the characteristics
that you selected and two separate
stores that are most dissimilar the
scenario results page has three tabs
clusters cluster composition and cluster
hierarchy the clusters section provides
the cluster results for each individual
cluster in the scenario in either a
table view or a graph view the
attributes displayed depend on the
cluster by option chosen in the cluster
criteria stage the graph view shows the
percentage for each attribute in the
cluster
the summary section provides an overview
of the characteristics of the scenario
the status field shows Medi for preview
ready for approval approved or rejected
the optimal number of clusters is the
optimal number of clusters determined by
the optimization the application also
compares executed scenarios and ranks
them a value of 1 indicates the best
scenario the minimum and maximum number
of clusters is the number you provided
for the maximum and minimum number of
clusters to calculate the largest and
smallest cluster provides the size of
the largest cluster and the smallest
cluster in order to show the range of
values system preferred indicates
whether the scenario is the one the
application prefers and user preferred
indicates whether or not the user
prefers this scenario the columns here
include the name you assign to the
cluster you can also rename the cluster
by selecting the cluster name and then
the actions drop-down menu select rename
cluster
you
the score is the value calculated at the
level of the store and then average to
the cluster the probability expressed as
a percentage of a store being present in
this cluster rather than any of the
other clusters the has low score
threshold can be defined in two ways the
default threshold is calculated as a
probability that a store exists in any
one of the clusters and the user can
further override this threshold at the
time of deployment by each cluster by
the number of stores filled lists the
number of stores in the cluster and the
percent of total stores is the
percentage of the total stores that the
number of stores represents and the
nearest cluster name is the name of the
cluster that is most similar to this
cluster in the has outlier field
indicates a cluster with the number of
stores below a threshold for example the
number of stores are below a certain
percentage of the number of stores in
the cluster
and this icon allows you to detach the
table from the user interface for better
viewing
you
the scenario optimality graph indicates
how the system identifies the best
number of clusters for a given data set
it starts with a small number of cluster
centers and searches for the number of
beyond which there is little improvement
in the mean squared distance or MSD at
this point increasing the number of
cluster centers anymore only decreases
the MSD by a small amount and the
marginal improvement is small the
cluster composition sub-tab breaks down
the cluster into its component parts
it lists doors in each cluster and their
attributes
the graph view shows the centroid of a
cluster and allows the user to compare
each store with a cluster centroid
the scenario list section contains one
table with details about each cluster
here you can approve or reject a cluster
after cluster is approved it is
available for other applications
in the explore data section the BI
displays the data distribution of the
location by each participating attribute
as well as other configured
informational attributes advanced
clustering identifies the bins based on
the underlying data and displays the
histograms it provides the percentage of
stores that are present in a location
for example a company may have 45% of
stores in cold regions
in Category variability you can analyze
store variability you can determine if
it is worth creating store clusters for
the selected categories in the selected
location attribute group variability is
used to analyze the most significant
attributes product or location for a
specific merchandise in a selected
location the attribute group variability
section shows attribute graphs for
location and product indicating the key
attributes that are driving sales
performance the attribute variability
section for each attribute group shows
the sales variability for each attribute
value in the selected stores it
calculates the index for the attribute
group indicating attribute significance
now let's move on to the cluster insight
stage you can use the insight stage to
analyze a scenario its clusters and its
hierarchy based on performance and
attribute contributions prior to the
approval of the scenario
the attribute-value dissed by cluster
chart shows a comparison of sales within
the average value distribution by
clusters the y-axis is sales retail and
the x-axis is sales units the Z bubble
size shows the average value for the
selected attribute for the cluster the
sales retail versus sales units chart
shows a comparison of sales retail and
sales units the y-axis is sales retail
and the x-axis is sales unit the Z
bubble size shows the gross margin
retail for a cluster the cluster average
comparison chart overlays the centroid
of the cluster and provides a comparison
of cluster averages so that you can
rename the clusters based on the
information in the graph
the cluster composition chart shows the
stacked contribution of each attribute
by percentage for each cluster you can
use this chart to determine which
cluster contributes the most for an
attribute by viewing the clusters
side-by-side in the cluster insight
section when selecting a cluster under
the primary scenario you can see that
the stores and product attributes are
analyzed and compared to identify the
most prominent selling attributes within
a cluster this indicates how the store
and product attributes are correlated
and what each attribute in the specified
cluster contributes to sales you can
make inferences about which attributes
in the cluster contribute to significant
sales and the potential attributes that
should be considered for assortment
planning in order to improve sales even
more with both store and product
attribute graphs you can see which
location attributes drive the product
attribute sales
the approval step is the last step after
the review and any manual overrides for
the scenario are completed the scenario
results are a set of clusters that are
effective for a merchandise location and
calendar combination the batch export
process selects the last updated
approved cluster to deploy to the
subscribing applications using an
interface file you can reject and
already approved cluster and deploy it
if the selected scenario results are
better now let's go back and take a
quick look at the scenario compare
option
the scenario compare section shows two
clusters of your choosing side by side
so that you can compare the main results
of each using the same characteristics
used in the scenario results and the
scenario lists you can select two
scenarios from the list you compare the
scenarios you select from the scenario
lists are shown side-by-side to
facilitate those
in this session I showed you how to
generate a store cluster which included
