project costs create the initial project
budget and then adjusted using budget
changes and transfers record actual
project costs view cost organized by
cost breakdown structure and analyze
budgets and actual costs over time let's
get started on the cost sheet page
project costs are organized by cost
breakdown structure add new CBS codes to
the project or import workspace codes if
you use workspace codes costs can roll
up to the workspace level costs can also
be viewed by category labor for example
categories can be defined in more detail
than CBS codes now let's look at how to
enter costs on the budget page enter
costs that make up the initial project
budget and assign CBS codes to each
after the initial budget is approved
make adjustments by entering changes and
transfers budget changes and transfers
used detailed line items that specify
the budget items they apply to and the
costs involved a simple approval process
is available for budgets budget changes
and budget transfers submit a change and
select the users to notify the users
receive notifications and an authorized
user executes the approval the approved
change is added to the budget item
details the change is also reflected in
the current cost enter actual costs
using line items with details such as
the cost and CBS code actuals are
initially assigned a status of pending
and can be confirmed by an authorized
user back on the cost sheet we see both
the budgets and actual costs that have
been entered configure custom fields to
analyze these the remaining budget field
has been configured to show the
difference between the project current
budgets and actual cost edit the sources
of these figures for example view budget
costs entered on the budget page and
display budget costs from the project
scope let's finish up by looking at the
cash flow page here we can analyze the
project budget and actual costs using a
time phased view of these figures
