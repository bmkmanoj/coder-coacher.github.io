cloud control 13 scene demo series this
demonstration will show you how to
create a basic report in bi publisher
against cloud control 13c target data
and the bi publisher honors cloud
control target privileges in this
demonstration we will see how to create
folders for our reports how to create a
data model that our reports can be built
upon how to use the report wizard to
create a report and how to use the
layout editor to modify that report you
can use the links here to jump straight
to each section or just move to the time
for the sections now that we have
assigned bi publisher privileges to our
Enterprise Manager cloud control users
we can start creating our own custom
reports as part of the integration
between bi publisher and Enterprise
Manager cloud control a shared folder
called Enterprise Manager cloud control
is created within bi publisher this is
the folder hierarchy that is displayed
within Enterprise Manager cloud control
however we should not extend the
hierarchy or add our own reports to this
structure as future patches and updates
may overwrite our editions site-specific
reports should be created in their own
folder hierarchies although on the
surface this seems cumbersome if we
remember that the report hierarchy
displayed within cloud control is merely
a punch out to bi publisher itself it is
no more onerous than running the
out-of-the-box reports let's login to bi
publisher to create a folder for our own
reports to do so we need to log in as a
user with the amb IP administrator role
which in our case is their admin user
we'll create a folder called custom
reports under shared folders
you
next we need to modify the permissions
on the folder to allow our fellow
Enterprise Manager Claire control users
to access the folder and its contents
will allow anyone with the MB IP auto
role to read write and delete items in
the folder
anyone with the MBI particular role to
schedule reports in the folder and
anyone with an am VIP viewer role to
read and run reports in the folder
we'll also elect to apply the same
privileges to all items that are created
in the folder bi publisher reports are
composed of two parts an underlying data
model and the layout for displaying
information retrieved through the data
model I'll create a data models folder
to keep the two separate
you
we're going to create a report that will
let you select a managed database and
display some tablespace information for
that database as both a graph and a
table of data and we will need three
things in our data model to realize it a
parameter to display on the report so
the user can select the database to
report upon a list of values to populate
the selection parameter with database
names and a dataset to extract the
tablespace data from the repository
filtered by the parameter value and
reports is the Enterprise Manager cloud
control user to whom we'd granted the
mbrp author role so let's login to bi
publisher as they user
start the data model creation process by
clicking the create data model button we
will specify its location in the folder
hierarchy and when we save it let's
start with a list of values
we give it a name and we'll create an
SQL query against the am reposed
datasource to populate it the in reponse
datasource
was created for us as part of the
installation process I'll use the query
builder to create the external query the
search field will dynamically filter the
list of available objects as we type
into it drag the objects you want to use
from the list and onto the Builder pane
I want to select instance name and
target GUI D tuplets to populate my list
of values so that the instance name can
be displayed but the target geo ID will
be used as a key value in the background
this means I need to ensure the display
field is first and the key value is
second
so I used the conditions tab to reorder
target to you ID and instance name
appropriately clicking on results runs
the query so we can confirm that it
works it's working okay so we'll save it
now that we have our list of values
we'll create a parameter so it can be
displayed we give the parameter an
internal name
and a display name that will be seen on
the report for this demonstration we
will restrict the selection to a single
value as the final piece of our data
model we create a data set for the
tablespace data this will be an SQL
query using the am repose data source
we'll use the query builder and filter
the object list
then drag the objects we want to use
onto the Builder pane
the query builder lets us join the two
objects by selecting a column in the
first object and second
it displays the join and if we hover
over it we see the definition of the
mapping we just created next we select
the columns we want to use in the data
set
you
and add a condition on the target GUI D
column to whatever is selected in the
parameter
as this column is only present for the
purpose of filtering the results we will
uncheck the show option save the data
set now we can save the data model to
the custom reports custom data models
folder that we created earlier
you
bi publisher allows us to generate
sample data for the data set that can be
used later to visualize the report as we
build it click View data to run the data
model query we see that our parameter
behaves as expected and by clicking view
we see the XML document that is returned
by our data model let's save this the
sample data for use later on
now that we have our data model we need
to create a report to display the data
we can select new report from the
standard menu or use the create report
button on the home page or simply use
the create report button right here on
the data model page the guided report
wizard makes it simple to grow a basic
report without the need for using the
layout editor
it's simple matter of selecting the data
model to base the report on although in
this case Bips anticipated that we want
to use the data model we were just
editing
then we choose the guide me radio button
and then we click Next to proceed
through the guided steps the next step
in the garden report wizard is to select
a layout for our report
I want to portrait layout with a page
header where I can display the database
name and version and a chart and a table
layout to display tablespace data
notice that the steps to be executed in
the wizard change as we select different
layouts click Next to move on to the
next step which in our case is to define
the chart bi publisher displays three
hot spots where you can dropped fields
to be displayed as chart values series
or labels I want to display tablespace
size and used space on my graph so I
drag those two columns to me values
notice how the report wizard uses the
sample data that we saved earlier to
show us how the report will look the
tablespace name should be the label so
let's drag that to the label field click
Next to move on to the next step which
for us is to create the table of data bi
publisher automatically uses the field
to be dragged under the chart we can
move those fields or delete them I want
to display size and used size so first
I'll check what column is missing then
drag it to the table again vio publisher
displays our sample data
I'll let the I publisher add a grand
totals row click Next to save the report
with the option to view it or further
customize it using the layout editor I
want to view my report before doing
anything else so I'll click finish and
save my report in the custom reports
folder
you
you
now the report opens and I can use my
database instance parameter to switch
between databases
let's see bi publisher honor the
Enterprise Manager target privileges
first to ZM user one who has view
privilege on am 13 rep Noi CL databases
then as AM user 2 who only has view
privilege on the OIC on database
you
the report wizard has given us a
functional report but I want to change
the title one add some information to a
page header but I got the report wizard
to include to make changes like that we
need to use the bi publisher layout
editor so once again when log in is the
AM reports user and click the add link
for our report either from the list of
recent reports or from the catalog which
takes us to the reports homepage
here we see the data model that the
report is based on together with the
layouts used to display the data for
this report it's possible to have
multiple layouts among report allowing
you to view the same data in different
ways the wizard created a layout for us
and that's what I want to modify so I'll
edit that first I'll modify the chart
title to something meaningful for this
report
I want to display the instance name and
version of the selected database so
we'll add a grid under the title to hold
that data
you
in the top left-hand cell I'll add a
field label for the instance name
you
and likewise in the bottom left-hand
cell for the daily base version
and then I can drag the instance name
and DB version fields from the data
model on to third port land
and I'll adjust the column width to suit
the labels
I'm happy with that layout so I'll say
and now when we open the report we see
the modified layout thanks for watching
this demonstration
