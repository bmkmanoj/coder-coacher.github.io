on how to do host consolidation using
Enterprise Manager consolidation planner
consolidation planner is a wonderful
tool for planning consolidations without
having to use spreadsheets or other
time-consuming manual methods I'm going
to show you how to consolidate multiple
legacy host machines into a single
Oracle Exadata database machine quickly
and easily you can also consolidate to
non exadata destination servers if you
need to after you login to Enterprise
Manager locate consolidation planner on
the Enterprise drop-down menu you'll see
a list of consolidation projects if
there are already projects there
consolidation planner allows you to
create consolidation projects and in
each consolidation project you can have
multiple scenarios in it that you can
compare to see which scenarios best meet
your goals for that project let's click
on create project to start a new
consolidation project we'll name our
project
exadata consolidation because we want to
consolidate some legacy hosts onto an
Oracle Exadata that we have or that
we're considering buying we'll choose
from physical servers to physical
servers as our consolidation type we
could also choose from physical servers
to Oracle virtual servers if Oracle
virtual machines were our consolidation
targets now we'll click on add servers
to specify the source server that we
want to consolidate into the destination
Exadata machine will also filter our
targets well we want to select database
servers from the running target type
drop list then we'll check cluster
database and database instance
that'll give us all of the hosts that
are running databases we can also filter
by other parameters like network domain
CPU vendor and so forth but we won't and
instead we will go through and pick the
servers that we want to consolidate
here we can see the resources used and
available for each of the hosts that
will be consolidating because
consolidation planner uses the actual
resource and performance data stored in
the Enterprise Manager repository
our resource estimates are very accurate
now we'll specify the number of days
worth of resource usage data to collect
the default is 21 to 90 days but we can
change it to whatever time window we
want fact with consolidation planner we
can start at 0 days so we can use right
away the data that Enterprise Manager
has already collected we don't have to
wait to collect data for several weeks
like we might have to with other tools
we can choose pre-configured scenarios
as well but we want because shortly
we'll be creating our own custom
consolidation scenario so we'll just
submit this now we can see that our
project is scheduled to be created we
get a confirmation message at the top of
the screen and then we can click the
refresh button to see how it's going
once it says collecting over minimum in
the status then consolidation planner
has finished its work on the source
servers now we just need to select the
destination servers or set of servers
that we'll be consolidating into we'll
do that by creating a scenario or more
with our project highlighted we can see
the details down here will click on
create scenario to create our scenario
well name our scenario exudate 1/2 rack
will focus on CPU and memory as our
resource requirements that were most
concerned about for applicable days
we'll choose all of the days we could
choose weekdays or weekends but we'll
choose them all and then for resource
allocation out of the three different
plans that we have available we'll stick
with the default which is conservative
and then we'll go on to the next step
for search server compatibility we will
leave all of these blanks and what that
will do is enable all of the target
servers that we've chosen to be canned
for consolidation onto the exadata for
destination candidates will use new
servers and then since consolidation
planner has out-of-the-box support for
Oracle Exadata database machines will
pick the database machine configuration
that we want and select it and in this
case it will be a half rack for maximum
allowed resource usage we will stick
with 75% CPU and 90% memory which of the
defaults which specify the maximum
allowed resource utilization on the
destination servers after the
consolidation is completed for server
mapping will stick with automatic
mapping consolidation planner uses
sophisticated bidding algorithms to
optimize the distribution of the source
servers on to the destination servers we
can override these mappings manually if
we'd like but for this one we'll just go
ahead and accept these defaults and
click Next now we'll do a quick review
of the parameters for the scenario
creation and submit when the scenario is
calculated we'll see analysis completed
by its name by clicking on the scenario
we can see all the information about it
including where it was mapped to and
even with the combined workload we see
that the memory utilization at peak will
be about 70% and the CPU utilization
overall will be about 38 to 40 percent
in addition there's the very convenient
heat map and this will tell us day by
day through the monta period collected
for this particular workload what the
workload distribution will be on an
hour-by-hour basis so we can see here
that on day 16 of the month there'll be
very little utilization here and then
from days 22 to 25 maybe for end of
month processing there'll be about 60 to
70 percent utilization and that's a very
comfortable range and then this will
also give us some indicator of where we
can add extra workload during what days
or what times of the day then finally we
can create one or more other different
consolidation scenarios to compare with
this one and we can do it much faster
than any manual method starting
immediately with the actual performance
data that we already have
so please try consolidation planner it's
an easy to use very useful tool thanks
