for the sybase ase plugin for Oracle
Enterprise Manager 12c today we'll be
reviewing the updated 12 dot 1040
plug-in including its new features and
monitoring capabilities throughout this
video we'll see how the Oracle
Enterprise Manager sybase ase plugin is
such a great individual solution for
monitoring your sybase ase environment
its integration with Oracle Enterprise
Manager makes it an ideal solution for
any heterogeneous database environment
before we get started let's review what
we will be covering in this video we'll
be going over the plug-in support
capabilities core features some of which
are new to this release and others that
were introduced last release and finally
the plugins integration with OEM the
sybase ase plug-in is compatible with
the current OEM release of 12c release 5
it includes support for sybase ase 15 7
and 1600 or higher so getting started
you can see I have already logged in to
an Oracle Enterprise Manager 12c cloud
control web console and navigated to the
enterprise welcome page from here you
can go to the enterprise summary page
through the enterprise menu located at
the top of your screen in the inventory
and usage graph to the right you are
able to view your sybase ase databases
you can drill down to the details using
the inventory and usage details page
here you can see various details such as
target hostname version platform and
more from here you can also click a
target's name to go to that targets
homepage another way to select a target
is through the all targets page you can
navigate to the all targets page from
any page in cloud control by selecting
targets all targets once at the all
targets page we can find and view our
sybase ase targets you can refine your
search by selecting the sybase adaptive
server enterprise target type from the
left navigation pane this will filter
the list of targets to only targets
relating to this plugin clicking on the
deployed target will bring us to the
plugins home page the first thing we'll
look at on the plugin homepage is the
summary overview the summary overview
provides details of the database status
uptime server name and sybase version
also in this overview administrators are
given the ability to run jobs to start
up or shut down their sybase ase these
jobs can be run by clicking the specific
buttons next to the ASE status
confirming the job will start an oem job
in the background
at the bottom of this view are links to
the analysis and performance pages
clicking these links will bring us to
each of these pages will visit them in a
moment next to the summary view is the
database instances table in this table
each database associated with this
monitored sybase ase will be listed as a
row with status size and space available
if you click on a column header the
table will sort by that metric type more
detailed data about the sybase ase
database is displayed in the second and
third rows of this homepage this data
includes the memory statistics top
processes by cpu usage in a bar graph
and line graphs for the worker process
memory connection utilization data cache
hit ratio and device io hovering over
the line graphs and bar graphs will
display call-outs with details on the
specific data points at the bottom of
the home page you can find the standard
OEM incidents in problems and job
activity views here you can quickly view
any incidents that have occurred from
metric thresholds and other problems
mousing over the incident will give the
full description while clicking it will
bring you to the incident manager next
we'll navigate to the analysis page by
clicking the link we looked at earlier
in the summary panel
this analysis page is broken into two
main sections the top five sequel
statements and the top five wait events
the top five sequel statements can be
organized by cpu time wait time or
memory while the top five wait events
can be organized by weight time or
weight count after selecting the metric
to view each graph can then be filtered
to show different sections in time by
day week and month hovering over
different points in the graph will
display detailed information on that
metric point the table below the graph
offers detailed information about the
top five sequel statements for the given
graph selectors mousing over the query
in the table will give a more complete
view of the query moving down to the top
five wait events graph again we can
hover over the lines to display detailed
data points using the targets contextual
menu will now navigate to the all new
target performance page as you can see
the performance page is broken down into
three key performance indicator
categories connection memory and
utilization each of these categories
contains historical data on the define
metric you can change the length of the
historical collection by utilizing the
radio buttons at the top of the page the
three pages we have just covered display
some of the most critical sybase ase
information however to view all of the
metrics collected by the plug-in will
navigate to the all metrics view
here the metric
that are organized into metric groupings
the most recent data collected can be
viewed as well as some historic values
that are stored by the plug in these
metrics explore the breadth of the
plugins ability to collect data from the
sybase ase environment to explore a
metric further expand the metric group
in the left column and then select one
of the specific metrics you wish to view
the value is collected for that metric
are then displayed in this table on the
right as you can see clicking on a row
in this table splits the page
horizontally into two sections the top
section shows the average low high and
last known value in the bottom section
then graphs the historical values of the
selected row over time the timeframe can
be changed by selecting the view data
drop down menu above the top table now
that we have a good understanding of all
the metrics that are collected by the
plugin let's review the available
incident thresholds that we can utilize
to alert us in the case of a failure or
problem setting incident thresholds and
collecting historic data on these
metrics can prove to be a very
beneficial aid in alerting
administrators of potential issues to do
this we'll navigate to the metric and
collection settings page if desired you
can fine tune these thresholds for each
of the metrics in this list to a
specific value this metric in collection
settings page is already predefined
without of the box thresholds for some
of the configurable metrics this release
comes with three new out of the box
monitoring templates containing
predefined metric thresholds to view the
monitoring templates will go to the
monitoring templates page
you can filter the search by selecting
sybase adaptive server enterprise in the
target type menu and clicking the arrow
to the right the sybase ase plugin
includes efficiency traffic and
utilization templates the last thing
we'll look at are the business
intelligence publisher reports
the sybase ase plugin
is shipped with over 17 out-of-the-box
reports containing key metrics for an
example let's take a look at the report
for sybase ase performance statistics as
the report loads you'll see that the
data is logically organized for quick
viewing and easy printability the sybase
ase bi publisher reports are also great
for analyzing trends in data and finding
stress points in your ASE environment
before they occur and that concludes the
screen watch for the sybase ase plugin
thank you for taking the time to watch
this brief demonstration hopefully you
have found this video to provide good
insight into the updated sybase ase
plugin and how it can add value to your
infrastructure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
