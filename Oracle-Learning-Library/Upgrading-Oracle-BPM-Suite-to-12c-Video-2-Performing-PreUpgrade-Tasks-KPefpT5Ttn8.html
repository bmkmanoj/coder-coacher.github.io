performing pre upgrade tasks this is the
second in a series of eight videos about
upgrading Oracle BPM to 12 see if you
haven't yet seen the overview video take
a look at that one first it'll give you
a high-level introduction to the entire
upgrade process that I think you'll find
useful in this video we focus on pre
upgrade tasks preparing for the upgrade
is perhaps the most time-consuming phase
of the upgrade process but it is
critical for success there are five main
subtasks that you need to perform prior
to the upgrade let's go over each of
these in turn starting with reviewing
the documentation there's a wealth of
information available and I'd like to
help you get oriented the document
titled planning and upgrade of Oracle
Fusion Middleware introduces Oracle
Fusion Middleware 12c to experienced 11g
users and explains among other things
where to get product distributions and
upgrade tools it describes in detail the
supported upgrade starting points so you
can determine if your version of BPM can
be upgraded if your operating system is
supported your database your topology
and so on it provides detailed
information on what to do to bring your
environment into a supported upgrade
starting point you can then read about
recommended backup and recovery
strategies as well as what to do to
prepare your Oracle databases for 12c as
its name suggests the interoperability
and compatibility guide helps you
determine whether various fusion
middleware components of different
versions or releases will work together
in a supported configuration for example
certain components in your environment
may need to be updated before you
upgrade to BPM suite 12c this document
will
I do through the process of identifying
relevant components determining version
information and avoiding specific
interoperability and compatibility
issues there are a lot more documents
than the two I just mentioned in fact
there's a set of pages that organizes
the 12 13 documents to make it easier to
find what you need this is the upgrade
and patched tab of the install patch and
upgrade page for 12 13 it includes links
to help you plan execute and
troubleshoot your upgrade the install
tab links to resources to help you
install your development environment
your production environment and
additional products the books tab
provides access to 12 13 books that
address administration concepts
installation interoperability and
upgrade and patching each title is
available in a variety of formats of
particular interest to us in this
conversation are the books in the
upgrade and patching section notice
there's an upgrade guide eddicated to
upgrading so sweet and business process
management as you probably already know
the upgrade video tab has links to all
of the videos in this series finally you
can access the release notes from the
common tasks section of the homepage
release notes include late breaking
issues that may not always be documented
elsewhere throughout the videos will
provide links to documentation on
specific topics but we highly recommend
a careful reading of the relevant
documentation before you begin your
upgrade after you review the
documentation and verified that your
environment meets the system
certification compatibility and
interoperability require
the next task is to create a complete
backup of your 11g environment including
the database why much of the upgrade
occurs in place meaning that it makes
changes to your existing installation
that cannot be undone if anything goes
wrong you will need a full backup to be
able to restore your environment and try
the upgrade again there are a number of
additional pre upgrade tasks that are
critical to perform at this stage if you
are using a 32 bit operating system
upgrade to 64 bit and verify that it is
working properly create and upgrade a
test copy of your production environment
a clone to identify and resolve any
issues before upgrading the live
production environment the administering
Oracle Fusion Middleware guide has a
section on moving from a test to a
production environment and you can use
the techniques described in that
document to go the other way creating a
test copy of your production environment
also note that so a 12c uses work
managers for the most part so any threat
configurations in your so ax 11g
application will not be carried over
when you upgrade use your test
environment to tune your application and
capture performance tuning settings
which you can then reapply right after
the upgrade minimizing downtime for
details refer to tuning the so
infrastructure in the tuning performance
guide to save time migrating 11g data to
12c purged any instance data that you no
longer need to retain you can get
information on purging scripts in the
document you see listed here it's a good
idea to resolve faulted or suspended
instances as well to leave fewer loose
ends the upgrade will overwrite some
startup scripts and configuration files
so if you have customized these save off
a copy before you upgrade so you can
reapply those customizations after the
upgrade is complete
these tasks and others are important for
you to consider before you begin the
upgrade in earnest and they are
described in more detail in the
Performing general pre upgrade tasks
section of the upgrading so sweet and
business process management guide the
next free upgrade task has to do with
upgrading file based policy stores file
based policy stores can be configured in
BPM 11g although they are not
recommended for production environments
BPM 12c does not allow file based policy
stores at all so if and only if your 11
g environment uses one you need to
create a database based repository and
reassociate your policy store with this
new repository after validating that the
repository is working correctly you'll
need to backup your environment one more
time you can get details on reassociate
spalla see store in the section titled
reassociate the opie SS security store
in the Oracle Fusion Middleware
application security guide for the 11g
release of course if your 11g
installation already uses an LDAP or
database based repository then you can
skip these steps so you've reviewed the
documentation and ensure that your
environment met the requirements you've
done a full backup and performed a few
other tasks to prepare your environment
for the upgrade and if you previously
had a file based policy store you've
upgraded that to a database based store
and taken another backup now you're
ready for the last of the pre upgrade
tasks installing the 12c infrastructure
and so a BPM software we devote an
entire video to that subject until now
it's been mostly talked but starting
with the installing 12c software video
you'll get to see some demos I'm Rosie
pillar thanks for watching and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
