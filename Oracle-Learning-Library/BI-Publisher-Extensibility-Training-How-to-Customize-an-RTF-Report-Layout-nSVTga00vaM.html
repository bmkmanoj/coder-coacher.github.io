training in this lesson I will
demonstrate how to customize a report
layout
this will include downloading an
existing report layout modifying it
using the template builder forward
add-in and uploading the customized RTS
back to the report the first step is to
navigate to your report within the VIP
catalog
once you have navigated to your report
click on the Edit link once the report
definition is opened up click on the
viewer list link in the top right hand
corner this will show a list of all the
layouts for the report click on the one
that you wish to modify and then save it
to a local directory be sure to give the
report a new name once you have saved
the report layout to a local directory
open it up using an MS word in this
example we're going to add a new column
to the table showing the customer ID the
first thing that we need to do is add an
additional column to the table we can do
this by right clicking on the mouse
once the new column has been added we
can type in a new column heading
the next step is to select the data
field from some sample external data
that I've already loaded using a bi
publisher add-in I won't demonstrate how
to load data in this lesson but if
you're interested I demonstrate how to
generate sample data and how to load it
into your RTF layout and their lesson on
creating a report
you
from listed fields select the one that
you wish to add to your report and then
click the insert button you see that the
selected filter has been been added to
your report
finally said the report layout next
bucking the report on the VIP server in
the lister layouts click on the green
plus sign to add a new layout
and then upload the new layout they've
just customized
you can then run the report and test
your new layout on the run report screen
enter appropriate values for all the
parameters and then click apply you can
then view the output for your new report
on the appropriate tab that's the end of
this lesson in which I've demonstrated
how to customize a report layout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
