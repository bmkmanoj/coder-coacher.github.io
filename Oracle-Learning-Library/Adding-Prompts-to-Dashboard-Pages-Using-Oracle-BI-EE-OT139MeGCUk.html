Oracle bi I'm a sales manager and I want
to create a dashboard prompt for brand
and then I want to add the prompt to the

the sales performance dashboard first I
must find the analysis I enter brand
revenue in the search field and then I

is displayed in the catalog page I click
Edit before I create a dashboard prompt
for brand I need to review the brand
revenue analysis if the analysis does
not contain a filter I need to add one I
click the criteria tab I review the
filters pane I don't see any filters in
the filters pane for the prompt to work
properly on the dashboard I need to add
a filter for brand that uses the is
prompted operator adding a filter with
the is prompted operator for a filters
column flags the column is ready to be
filtered by a prompt this means when a
prompt is used results include only
records where the data in the column
that is prompted matches the user's
choices I click the create a filter for
the current subject area button in the
filters pane and then I select brand
because I want this column to be driven
by the dashboard prompt I select is
prompted in the operator list I click OK
in the new filter dialog to create the
filter I see that the brand filter is
added to the filters pane I need to save

prompt I am ready to add it to the sales
performance dashboard when I originally

dashboards in the global header and then
I select sales performance from the list
I want to edit the dashboard to add
brand prompt so I click page options and
then I select edit dashboard in the
catalog pane I navigate to brand prompt

column or section for the prompt in the

the same section directly above the
brand revenue analysis I drag and drop
brand prompt in the page layout area
I want to save and run the sales
performance dashboard I click Save and

brand prompt has been added to the sales
performance dashboard I want to ensure
that the prompt works so I select biz
Tech and home view in the brand list I
click outside the list and then click

the prompt is applied properly and the
brand revenue analysis is redisplayed
for bids tech and home view now that
I've created the brand prompt and added
it to the sales performance dashboard my

brands that require additional effort to
increase sales and target revenue thanks
