industries want and need to be more
responsive to its customers to
understand its customers issues before
they do and be instantly responsive to
the unique requirements of its customers
no more so than in the retail banking
sector were the ability to bring
together every aspect of a customer's
interaction with the bank across every
divisional group such as mortgages loans
insurance etc enables a bank to provide
a customized perspective of that
customer making him or her feel special
and to understand how new services not
yet procured by the customer can be up
sold in essence these 360 customer
platforms need the ability to blend
historical customer information with
real-time up-to-the-second streaming
data this core technology would be
streaming analytics from Oracle now the
streams of data can arrive from both
transactional and non-transactional
sources so instantaneously one can
understand the full context of a
customer's interaction with the bank
over a temporal period
here we can see the defined system
settings for the cafe and spark clusters
that will be used for the deployed
solution firstly we create the relevant
connections to the data transportation
layers and the database
created references to various persisted
database table information provides the
ability in the subsequent created
pipeline application to join with the
banking data streams giving more context
for analysis
you
here we now start a collection of
simulation streams related to general
customer interaction checking account
data and bank credit card data usage
once running we then define the streams
for analysis using the Oracle stream
analytics user experience
notice as you create the stream
definition the system dynamically infers
the data shape of the event message data
type as the payload arrives on the calf
Qatar Peaks
you
now that all of these base artifacts
have been created connection streams of
references we can create the pipeline
application to blend and analyze all of
this data so for example a bank teller
can instantly retrieve the current
customers 360 perspective and provide a
unique and customized conversation this
personalized approach makes the customer
service interaction more appealing and
facilitates the referencing and up
cross-selling of additional useful
banking services
okay so let's create the solution
application pipeline and let's call it
customer 360 and initially select one of
our streams which in this case is the
primary customer interaction stream
all of the longtime elements artifacts
libraries etc are dynamically
constructed bounded together and the
foundational pipeline application
deployed to the spark infrastructure
with the streaming results returned to
your user experience tooling with zero
coding
now we can instantly observe the
customers interactions with the bank
such as they're related account numbers
the source channel related subject and
the date and time
in the next processing query stage we
will enrich this streaming data with the
details of each customer from persistent
database tables
selecting the available account owner
table we correlate based on the common
data account number property you can see
the live output stream now includes the
additional two columns from the specific
database table row
you
you are not limited on the number of
persisted tables to join so we can
increase the data context with more
informational sources in this case using
the owner details correlating using the
first and last name of the customer
you
now the live output stream includes a
wealth of information for each banking
customer
you
the goal at this point for our 360
customers perspective is to clearly
understand as the customer interaction
now with the bank what is happening
relation to his checking account saving
accounts his credit card usage is this
person even using the provided bank
credit card if not then perhaps we can
entice more usage with a charging
percent discount etc to gain this
collective knowledge we will use a left
outer join pattern available from the
patterns library which allows us to
provide an enriching stream called the
checking account stream within correlate
using the account number provided from
the previous stage streaming data and
they define the relevant time window for
both of these unbounded data streams in
this case we can use one hour
you
now the live apple stream view shows
which customers are having activity on
their checking accounts such as deposits
or withdrawals to and from different
sources and also those customers with no
activity
you
to extend our analytics we now also want
to enrich our streaming data with the
customers credit card activity using the
same approach with their left outer join
pattern as before we correlate using the
account number but this time using the
Associated credit card number and define
once again the temporal boundaries on
the streams over a continuous flowing
one-hour period
you
now we have a single perspective of each
customer's current real-time interaction
activities with the bank including from
their checking and credit card usage
some are having activity across all
accounts while others only on their
credit cards etc
we can manipulate the tableviews as
needed to quickly observe the required
data stream information
so we have now a complete full 360 view
of the customers interaction a global
view of the customer which can be
leveraged in many ways to improve the
customer service provided to each
customer
to trigger the relevant downstream
applications and/or business processes
with this data we define a target
definition
at this point in the application
pipeline the various streaming data file
properties can be optimized for example
by deleting duplicate information
once done the target is saved and the
pipeline application is now ready to
send the defined a new collective data
shape over to a Kafka or rest endpoint
for immediate processing and action
so there we have it we have now created
the blended 360 customer perspective
analyzed data from all of the relevant
banking systems to provide a valuable
improved customer services and banking
product up and cross-sell experience not
in days or months body minutes
