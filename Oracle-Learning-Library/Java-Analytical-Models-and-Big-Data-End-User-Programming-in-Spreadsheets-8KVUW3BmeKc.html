for coming to the session titled Java
analytical models and big data and user
programming in a spreadsheet environment
there's a lot that we are going to be
trying to cover today and we have a few
slides but mostly will be showing you
some live examples from practical
examples and and code examples but first
a short introduction of the two of us my
name is krystal opponent and this is
awkward alien soon we are the
co-founders of a company called quant
cell research my background is in
product management and software product
management and marketing and I used to
be the Sun Microsystems for almost eight
years and I think what 10 12 years ago I
was a product manager for java and
August he received his PhD in
mathematics from UC Berkeley he was a
professor at UC Berkeley for a number of
years and elsewhere and he also has
background in in biotech and in
financial services where he was heading
quantitative research teams and risk
management teams so our host is the is
the inventor and the creator of the
environment that we will be using to run
our demo today also joining us here is
as one of our team members yet yongsan
so after this session you can you know
approach any of us if you have any
specific questions so what we're going
to be covering here today as the title
suggests is end user programming in in a
spreadsheet environment and user
programming in Java in a stretch
environment and in particular how such
an environment can be used to build
java-based analytical models and big
data analysis so you might ask why what
does java have to do with the spread
seeds so spreadsheets if you think about
a spreadsheet it is probably the most
popular end user programming tool and
modeling tool around
but the most spreads is that we know I
have have some limitations and and only
allow you to work with two object types
namely numbers and text but what if you
could actually bring in all the
capability of Java into the spreadsheet
environment and and benefit from the
from the from the spreadsheet meaning
that this spreads its basically shorten
turnaround times offer dynamic execution
allow the user to build the model one
expression at a time and have integrated
testing and debugging so if you bring
Java into that environment and allow the
user essentially to initiate any Java
object or or Java API in a spreadsheet
cell you have a very powerful
environment for building analytical
models so that's kind of what we were
going to be covering today we will start
with a simple example 222 gonna
introduce the concept and and then move
on to some more advanced analysis we
have some practical examples where we
are using libraries such as open gamma
for financial mathematics and bio java
for for biotech analysis and we have
some data visualization also and then we
also have an example where or Big Data
example where actually we are running
using MapReduce and doing a big data
analysis using MapReduce and then
connecting to the Amazon Cloud as a
back-end for the spreadsheets as a
computational engine for a spreadsheet
we also cover things that have to do
with with JVM performance how the
end-user are the spreadsheet user can
take advantage of the JVM and also take
advantage of Java optimization
concurrency and carpets collection and
so that's kind of the summary what we're
going to be talking about and before I
hand it over to outpost I just want to
make a little observation that that we
have seen in the in the java community
we have you know we're in the analytics
we are looking at analytics libraries
all day we are you support the number of
these analytic libraries java-based
analytic libraries and there's an
explosive growth in the java community
around libraries for all kinds of
analytics how to of course with big data
is getting a lot of buzz but there are a
number of other initiatives domain
specific projects such as bio java open
gamma vector for artificial intelligence
chemistry development kit and number of
others and there are more projects like
that being initiated and the growth that
we're seeing in these projects is just
really really great so the analytical
tool kit if you will in the Java
ecosystem that's available is very
comprehensive and it's it's supported by
over by a very active active community
so that's it I hand it over to to August
yea high so you can hear me clearly
right okay so so the agenta now well
select chris said we're going to be
talking about java we're going to be
talking about javafx we're going to be
talking about and use programming and
we're going to be talking about or
introducing our our big data spreadsheet
now our goal here is to is to explain
carefully how non developers and users
can benefit from from java technologies
that are normally only reserved for
developers and so why spreadsheets why
is why is that populous is the session
well so like Chris said traditionally
end user programming has always been
achieved in a spreadsheet environment
and the reasons why aunt users prefer to
use the spreadsheet is well let's let's
name a few well the first one probably
is that in the spreadsheet there's no
user interface design now but since
we're here at our one it's sort of
interesting to take notice that there
are maybe ten or at least ten sessions
on
on user interface design and that tells
us immediately that user interface
design can't be that simple it has to be
something complicated there and and and
the dent users don't don't really touch
that field at all so that's one reason
another reason is that another reason
why the spreadsheet is preferred by end
users is that in the in this pretzel
environment then writing programs
debugging programs and executing
programs as well as as refactoring
programs all happens in one environment
in one interface it's all combined into
one now another reason and users prefer
to use a spreadsheet of course is its
expression based and it allows for
allows for experimentation try endeavor
and and stuff like that now what what
all this means to the end user is that
turnaround times get shortened and
that's what the end user is seeking
shorter turnaround times so as a
consequence of all of this we have
approximately 50 million power users of
spreadsheets already today but then the
question becomes why Java well so if so
let's think of an analyst or a domain
expert or quant in a financial
institution or in some other in some
other enterprise and and and you realize
immediately that the domain expert
benefits from or could benefit from Java
performance having access to high
performance computing and and and hang
access to big data analytics and and
being able to create solutions which are
deployment ready a lot of sulu solutions
created in end user programming
environments today are not deployment
ready you have to basically do a rewrite
in order to put the whatever the end
user is doing in the production now but
today in the world we're living right
now it's it's it benefits the you and
you sir even more than what we
just mentioned to have access to to Java
API is direct access to Java API is
something that really only available if
you are a developer using an IDE right
so of course we we realized that it's
not enough just to combine Java and
spreadsheet in order to achieve and user
programming we we need to address other
issues for example we need to provide
the user with intuitive access to to
private and public data sources we need
to assist the user with accessing and
using algorithms we need to create the
Wizards for to help the user write code
and so on and so on lots of different UI
controls and things that need to be
created in order to make the user
independent in this environment so so
let's look an example so what I'm going
to I'm going to show you first is it's
an example where we where we connect to
a public data source or private data
sources and to do some simple analysis
using the data in in the in the
spreadsheet environment so let's let's
turn on the the application that we
wanted to introduce here it is so yeah
so already opened up a couple of
applications just to save time here now
this is say this is a simple example the
first thing you see is that it's a
spreadsheet it looks like a spreadsheet
and it has text numbers in it the way
for a developer to think of this is it
is you think of this as a spreadsheet or
a Java IDE with the spreadsheet
interface now you can go into any of
those cells and you can write Java code
with and della code which returns an
object and that object will be will be
named the variable name will be the cell
name we become cell name and you'll be
able to use the variable just like you
would with any other variable in any
other idea
except of course it has been
instantiated and calculated for you so
so like I said we got text numbers like
and formulas like any other spreadsheet
but let's look at this cell here for
example in in c5 so c5 is actually a
data source this can't this cell I hope
you can see this it's kind of small but
the week we can we can if you can't see
it we could probably put in a text text
editor and look at it a little bit more
carefully that way but but anyway what
it does it connects to a data source and
it and there are some taker symbols and
so on which specify the data that has to
be brought into the system or are you
connecting to so so the user has to have
some way of creating those expressions
this is just a regular Java expression
you see that the new comment there and
so on but just like you would do in a
regular spreadsheet except the left side
it's a little bit odd it helps just what
the data type is and the end the
dependencies in this case there are no
dependencies on ourselves so so so it's
left like that now once the user has
created this expression you get some
value called the indication value and
the indication value is the value that
you see in the cell and and and the
indication value basically tells the
user what the content of the cell is in
a short format something that fits into
the cell if you double click on a cell
on the other hand you get what's called
the full value and the full value is the
gives you more information about the
content and and in this case this is a
graph of some kind or this is some data
and it tries to explain in details what
what what is the content of the cell now
but if we go back to the cell before we
do any analysis with the data we can do
a little bit of regression analysis
there but before we do that we should
notice that this expression is not easy
to write this is you have to know the
takers in bruges for that the data
service one
so so it's so what I'm going to do I'm
going to show you how the user would
would actually do that so here I
essentially just removed my expression
there but by replacing it with null then
some of the other cells up it cannot
become great because you know they
depend on this cell and and they can't
be calculated anymore but what I'm going
to do I'm going to actually create
recreate this this statement using one
of our wizards so here's a wizard which
allows me to to search through data and
and locate data that I'm that I'm that
I'm looking for in this case it was
information about rare earth metal
materials and minerals sorry and I just
pick the data that I want to select the
properties or whatever is the
appropriate dimension that I need to
need select from and then I can look at
the data in in the viewer and then I can
import it into a spreadsheet this is a
this is a code wizard it's all that this
code Bishop does is to create this
expression all it does is just to create
this text expression and and then I can
execute them in the system to to help
tailor brought into the system and and
so on so we've combined all those things
we talked about earlier we combined
writing programs debugging programs and
executing programs and these are these
are these are they are programs in the
spreadsheet environment now so what is
this analysis that's continuing here
where we in this cell here c6 we're
actually accessing the data and caring
to erase from the data source namely the
time column and the world production for
for this rarer for rare earth materials
and then we do in regression analysis
over here where we have actually brought
in the Apache Commons math library to to
approximate the incoming data with a
polynomial of some degree
and carry a polynomial fit for the
incoming data from the data service and
and then we then we actually use the
polynomial and the incoming data to
create a chart using javafx the client
is based on javafx the interface and the
and and and charting is done using
javafx or you can actually bring in your
own your own charting library like I
three or something to charting if you
want to so so here we have the the
second column in the top lorae in cell
c6 and here we have the data from the
from the polynomial regression function
now and if i double click on this it
should show me some information about
the cell and of course one of this
information is going to be the actual
chart where we have fitted the data
where we created a polynomial to fit the
to approximate or theta and then we use
the polynomial to predict world
production for for some future years now
and again all of this is dynamic if I
wanted to change the degree of the
polynomial from five point three to five
and I just did that and we can continue
to you know look at the new research so
on using the the FX chatting that's in
here now here's another example this is
this is a an example where we are very
brought in bio Java so peyote Allah is
say it's a nice powerful library created
by by universities both here in
California and and and overseas it's a
it's used for bioinformatics and one of
the things they have the hip is say is
an object like this one called file
reader which allows you to connect to a
central source of protein information or
molecules and you basically submit a
string to the service and it'll fats a
protein description file from the
service
into whatever system you're working with
so and just like in any other IDE all
you have to do in order to take
advantage of pile java in this
particular system is you have to
download it from the from the from
consortium and you have to place it in
your classpath and then it's ready to
use in in the in the system so bio Java
has certainly become has become like
your function library in this system
once you do that now if we double-click
on a source we see that there's the data
source we see there's a method they're
called get get structure biit is here
somewhere did I
yeah get structured and gets throat of
IIT right so so let's actually just
enter that expression in here let's say
let's say we were yeah so the cell is c4
get the structure by ID and then it is
correctly spelled stroke so like the
keyboard is all old skewed by ID well if
it's not right with my genaro message
which is fine as well and then let's
input the string which is instance ec5
let's execute this let's see what did I
do wrong oh there's a tea that right
alright so now we got it correct now we
got the and one thing you know in our
system we use code completion and all
these technologies that developers have
access to this version doesn't show you
that but that's that it's there so these
kind of mistakes we're into spelling
errors and so on you know of course you
know just like you're used to in your ID
this is not an actual problem so now we
have the head of the molecule or protein
in our cell if we double click on it we
get a 3d viewer actually in this case
where we can actually do analysis right
there in the user interface with with
without any any more work and and we can
do some measurements we can of course
you know play with it a little bit and
do some analysis using the the tools
that come with this viewer now it turns
out that this is actually a lot of this
is a lot of power to the end user for
just writing that one formula remember
all that the anticipate was to write
this expression get structure by ID so
so now I wanted to show you also how we
would how we use to our syntax here to
to write functions and create functions
in the environment or methods would be
the correct term
for Java but we think of these as
functions because we're in the
spreadsheet environment now here we have
a function which we call center it
returns a an RA and a double array and
what it does it takes the the weighted
average it takes the weighted average of
of all the atoms in the molecule and
returns that as a position vector so
this would be the center of gravity for
the for the molecule and let's actually
that's actually let's actually apply
that function to the variable oh they're
so the function is in c6 and and it's
called center and the the molecule is in
c8 so so here we should be here is it
Heather set-ups actually put it here but
not to worry we'll just move it around
anyway so here we have the hair the
center of gravity for the polar molecule
if you double-click on it this we see
the position vector and and return done
a little bit of analysis and and access
some data and so on from from various
sources all right let's move on with the
slides now like Chris mentioned quickly
as well in its introduction one of the
things we've seen is we know we see that
there is explosive growth in in
purposely available libraries that can
be accessed from the spreadsheet and
just to name a few we got open camera
for financial analysis because vaca for
data mining we got biochar that we just
looked at we got big data frameworks of
course how tube and so on and mahout for
AI as well now what we've seen is that
these libraries are growing there's a
lot of interest in them and becoming
more and more capable and the number of
project is always increasing so so this
is this is a trend which is which is
nice to observe and and this important
for this environment
now if we look at the number of G our
lines in each of those libraries just to
name a few of course we see that the
libraries are becoming quite big and and
that means that the well we yeah that
should mean at least and it does mean in
these cases that the libraries are
coming more and more capable and
becoming more and more important for the
end user to have access to those
libraries directly same thing with big
data frame works a lot of interest
explosive clothes and the value of those
lab prize is becoming incredible so
let's let's jump back to our our our
application here the big taylor
spreadsheet and and let's look at one of
those libraries we just mentioned namely
open gamma and and again we are in an
inner spreadsheet-based ide so in order
to take advantage of open of the open
camera library all you have to do is you
download it from the from the oven
camera web page or website and you have
to include it in your classpath or in
your libraries and and from that point
on you can you can take advantage of the
library right here and you would use
this library for for you know pricing
derivatives and complicated financial
products you would use this for risk
analysis you would use this for
portfolio management and you would
actually use it also for reporting and
and by bringing it into this environment
it becomes what it becomes your function
collection of your function library in
the spreadsheet and then did you play
play around with it just like we did
with the other libraries to get
different results and build models now
once you have built something in the
system you need to deploy it you need to
deploy it into production somewhere and
this is this is something we work with a
hard on we allow you to deploy into
specific production systems but then on
the other hand anything you filled in
our system is H our API so technically
it can be can be deployed into any any
production any tail jela production
system even though there's
bit more to that story a lot of the time
all right yeah here we have so so just
because of how we build our application
or the or the environment the the and
this is something that that's often
overlooked when it comes to a news
programming if you think about some of
those environments then in today's world
there interpreted and they're basically
slow now we on the other hand know that
the developer is all the end user is
going to benefit from the performance of
Java and an inner system if you write an
expression then that expression gets
compiled to bytecode of course by the
Java compiler and then and optimized at
the same time and then we have runtime
optimization such as just-in-time
compilation which translates the end
user expression to native code on the
end users and in the end users
environment and i want to show you an
example of the difference that this
makes and and how optimization in java
and optimization with the just-in-time
compiler what's the benefit to the to
the end user of of having read here so
let's say let's look at this example so
here we have a the same code we saw on
the slide it's a it's very short I hope
you can read this now all that this code
does is that it iterates about 2 billion
times over and that's one to a variable
they're called at but it is it's
supposed to iterate 2 billion times and
all it does is to measure how long
that's going to take so so if I you know
run this over and over again you can see
how fast these two billion iterations
take in seconds well if you look at this
number you see that this makes no sense
it's not possible for the my hardware to
to iterate 2 billion times over anything
in much less than 1 million milliseconds
so what's happening well what's
happening is that the Java compiler
actually looked at this code and said
this loop here is useless I'm going to
just ignore it and and if you think
about the number of tricks optimization
tricks already in the tower compiler
then you can see well this has to
benefit the user I mean now the user is
getting killing Adam at the advantage of
all all those all those optimization
tricks now so let's change this little
bit so that instead of instead of the
compiler being able to ignore this loop
it has to actually take actually has to
figure out what's the other variable is
there so let's actually just add and
subtract it again technically it could
ignore it but it's not going to do that
at this point so if I execute this now
it takes a little longer well but still
it's it's about two seconds instead of
almost nothing less than one millisecond
so if it we can execute that again it
takes about two seconds or something
like that so now it takes about two
seconds and that's pretty fast as well
that that's about as fast as if you had
written this code using any other
language literacy or whatever so so
we're still seeing the benefit of
just-in-time compilation here now let's
actually turn on a different environment
over here where where I turned off where
I turned off I thought I'd twenties see
here it is where I've turned off
just-in-time compilation and let's open
this model again
where is it it's here well actually it
it actually it remembers the value
values from my previous session so it
pretends that this is about one
millisecond as well but if I execute
this you see it's going to take a lot
longer and it's actually can take more
like 28 seconds something like that 25
to 28 seconds executing the same
algorithm in the environment if we don't
allow the just-in-time compiler to to do
it think so so that Woods the time we
would get if this was actually turns out
to be about 25 seconds this is the time
we would get if as if our system is
interpreted like for example most
spreadsheets are today so you go from 25
seconds to 1.8 second and then with
optimization in this sort of odd case
almost zero so that's definitely
something that's beneficial and it is
important especially with when you're
doing hard analytics that your system
performs adequately all right so let's
move on with the examples he actually
there any questions just feel free to
ask any questions at this point all
right so deployment now another
bottleneck in anti prom is that the
solutions you create using many other
systems you you have to essentially
rewrite them if you want to deploy them
into your production system now in our
system since the solutions is this is a
Java IDE what you get is a jst our code
and you can deploy it in various
environments but but i'm going to show
you an example of where we actually do
some big data and analysis and deploy
that analysis to the to Amazon Elastic
MapReduce or to Amazon Web Services so
let's go back to the up to the
application here and look at a big data
example
so so what do we have here we have here
on the left side we have some analysis
we have we have some observations from
different observatories measuring the
strength of some signal coming from some
stars and these measurements have been
placed in a big data file which is
located somewhere in this case it's
located in on s3 only somewhere on the
East Coast Virginia ischium and and what
we want to do with this big data file we
want to go through it we want to adjust
the signal strength and calculate the a
and calculate the the signal strength of
a source so if figuring out what's the
brightest star or whatever it is that
we're measuring and there's some
analysis need to do and the point here
is that we're doing the analysis in the
spreadsheet here we have we need some
variables here we have a list of stars
here we have a the distances of those
stars from Earth in light years and then
we have a little bit of a lookup
function and and yeah and the formula we
are going to use to adjust the signal
strength now since this is Mark reduce
and we're not using any any other
they're only using raw MapReduce and
this is always going to be a little bit
technical you have to write a a mapper
you have to write a function which takes
every line in your in your big data file
and purchase it and and calculates the
calculate some sort of output for each
line and here we do that we take each
line we just use the split variable in
Java and we extract some numbers from
from from each line in the in the text
file and then we then we then we perform
those calculations and write it to the
context variable over here this is a
typical map job in in big data it's its
technical but that's that's just the way
it is a question
yeah so if I get a runtime exception
exception it just what's going to happen
is the cell is going to become it's
going to tell me so and we can let's
just write something here this should be
a runtime exception and see what happens
it just it well oh no this is not a
runtime exception this is just it can't
create the object but let's what would
be well so this happens all the time and
and what what happens is that the
runtime exception is caught of course
and and we display the cell a threat we
we make sure that all the dependencies
are invalid and then we just show you
the show the use of the error so the
errors are just protected to the user to
work with them does that answer your
question yeah all right
yeah I mean we every expression new
Putin here is encapsulated in a try cuts
statement and we all be cats every
exception and we bring it to the tension
of the user and and then we like I said
we are we make sure that the three of
the pendants ease gets our invalid and
validated it yeah that's the way it is
at least four expressions a little bit
different if you're writing methods and
functions you can actually explicitly
put the try cuts in there as well which
is what you have to do so yeah you mean
because right here we had yeah here we
had the this is how you handle it in
with the functions but this is a
function so it doesn't return any value
it just returns a function so that so
that's a little different now so you
write it to the context and then you
want to take the max of those values we
do that in a reduced cell over here this
is the marks this is the max function it
is a typical max function using
MapReduce and we could simplify that and
we actually do that we allow you to use
pick and and and all the frameworks
where instead of creating markers and
reduces in this way you actually just
write a sequel like code to express your
your big data analytics or your big data
problems then here on the on the right
side we have our connection to Amazon
and this could be connection to elicit
is connection to Amazon but this works
for cloudera and other other systems as
well and essentially what you need to do
you need to configure and and and we
don't really ask they usually do that we
use wizard to generate this or templates
you need to pace you need to tell your
object where are my credentials meaning
where is my passport and my username
where's my marker let's in cell C 15
where's my reducer that's in cell c 16
we just looked at that and then where's
my big data file and where's my
directory on the Amazon Cloud and then
then you have configured you can
action to the 22 amazon and then you can
start you know any any analysis you get
here will be submitted to to the to the
Amazon Web Services now once you're the
ones you're finished with the output you
actually execute this using cell g15 it
is you just say run but but when you
finish you can get the if the output is
it's not the big data at the output this
is something you want to retrieve into a
spreadsheet you can you can do that if
you just enter the first part here
you'll get a reference to the output if
you if you write this whole thing you
actually get the system to bring in the
result of the analysis into into a house
map into your into your environment so
if a double click on this I see the
results from amazon over here of the
MapReduce task and then I can use
effects or javafx charting to do you
view the output if I wanted to or I can
use like with like we said earlier any
other charting library that's available
to me so it's a couple of more things
here now the deployment to Amazon is
completely independent of the
spreadsheet you just get you you can
look into it into the use of packets and
you'll see the appropriate java code to
which you can use either in the
spreadsheet like we're doing here or you
can bring that into any other system
that you like and the other thing is if
i change any of those numbers it's I can
decide I'm it's going to submit the job
again to Amazon or it's gonna or I'm
going to wait and change the numbers to
some more debugging before i submit it
but let's just let's just do that so now
what is what the system is doing its
retrieving a new session ID and
and talking to Amazon setting up those
fire machines that the default value of
number of machines we have in this
setting and it's going to work on this
problem for as long as it takes and it's
going to return the results back here
now if I save this let's actually do
that or we can actually have have the
system automatically save those values
then and I can e-mail this model to
someone else and or again you know I can
turn off my computer and when I open it
up again in connect to the Amazon server
and and figure out what's the status of
the job if it's completed or not and an
end and so on so so this is a nice way
and the simpler way to work with the
domicile web services then definitely
having to pack it everything into a jar
and submit it to Amazon and get the
results back in some some complicated
way so while this is crunching it's
going to take about 10 minutes or so or
five or ten minutes but let's go back to
the let's go back to the slides here
right so so one thing we notice there's
a lot of talk about well not I mean this
is everywhere there's a lot of talk
there's a lot of talk about the talent
gap in big data analytics and this
talent car meaning that essentially we
need more people who are data scientists
and they are able to work with big data
analytics this talent gap has resulted
well this talk about the talent gap has
resulted in couple of applications which
address big data analytics using
spreadsheets so this is one of the
driving force behind creating an
application like this one or creating an
ID like this one any questions on it on
a big data problem but people will
continue all right so so because of how
we because of how we use Java and the
JVM and and ever and are using a
spreadsheet based ide then the
applications created by the end user in
this system are
the threaded by default and the user can
also use the our concurrency and and all
technologies to distribute the work on
the on the on the available hardware
that the user has access to and I want
to show your examples first I want to
show you an example what we mean by
multi-threaded by default and then I
want to show you a fork enjoy an
algorithm for implemented in this system
so right so let's let's go back to a
system and this is still running and
that look at another example so this
example here is just a simple game what
it has is there's a function here which
wait for some number of seconds and and
the top row represents number of seconds
and the and the leftmost column
represents number of seconds of as well
of course and then everything is
intertwined in different ways so that if
you start some sort of calculation here
then that calculation is going to wear
to wait for all the calculations to
finish and so on and however and and the
but the important thing is that nothing
freezer and the calculations wait for
each other in a correct way so here we
have just changed one of those numbers
and which are almost read always red
color representing cells that are being
executed now let's change something else
and we get red and blue red meaning war
meaning that the there's calculation
happening and blue meaning that they're
waiting so it like like hot to cold and
and and so on so the so we can change
things in any number of ways and the
system is going to respond correctly and
and you can even change the code and so
on while the wireless system system is
running and you get without
messing up your your your application
now what we call this we call this
support for longer running operations
and and and the reason we need support
for long running operations is because
we allowing the user to connect to
databases to pick theta clouds and to
other systems and and we want the user
to to be able to work in the spreadsheet
even while some other analysis is going
on right so here's another example where
we talked about concurrency this is a a
pork and join algorithm and which we
have written in the spreadsheet so this
is a little bit advanced I would assume
that most users would not want to do
this what we have are we done here we
release is actually a basic example
though but anyway we created a recursive
function called recursive this function
it has takes the input of an RA and a a
starting number and an end number and
then it has to calculate the calculate
the and then there it has this method
compute which calculates the sum of the
RA from staff to or from in this case
low-to-high it uses a threshold variable
which determines if the if the number of
values is is is is small I'm going to
just do the calculation myself always
I'm going to fork the job and and and
divided into different parts using the
reporting join algorithm the nice thing
about the fork and join algorithm is
that using this algorithm you you're
able to or using pork and join you're
able to distribute computation among a
pool of threats and without without
creating too much over it essentially
you're able to reuse the threats that
are not working or not
at any given time and and and this
becomes extremely efficient and takes
care of or takes advantage of all the
resources on your hardware so here we
have the four conjoin algorithm and here
here are some function which defines the
pork joint pool and and this is the it's
just the and calls the recursive
function from 0 to 2 its length but the
input here is is it's just the GRA now
so I'm going to experiment with this
little bit and so in order to do that I
had to create an array and we just you
say you use Java anthem the random
generator in Java to create an array of
whatever size that I want it and and
let's see how this works so so here we
have well here we have 10,000 an array
of size ten thousand and this happens
pretty fast we don't really see it here
we hear an array of size 100 thousand
this happens pretty fast as well here we
hear an array of size 1 million this is
pretty fast as well here we have an
array of size 10 million takes a little
bit of time to act so what it's doing
it's actually executing its summing up
all the values using for conjoin
distributing all the load and all the
all the course in my computer's in my
computer and then and taking advantage
of the of the library here as and let's
actually try this with 100 million takes
a little bit of time but it should be
fine and it's fine now if I but but this
syrup this highlights an hour issue
namely garbage collection now using the
system if you're creating big structures
in memory like this then you have to be
able to garbage collect them you have to
be able to get rid of them and remove
them from memory and here we take in
abling the end user to take direct to
directly benefit from garbage collection
in the in the in the spreadsheet
environment all right I want to talk a
little
what about garbage collection and we'll
do a little bit later and and but first
let's go back to this to the to the
slides over here so so what have we
learned about learned from all of this
we learned that that it well one thing
we've learned is that there's a lot of
uses that already know how to work in
our system what you've seen is that in
order to user system you have to write
code snippets short code snippets and it
turns out that these code snippets they
may look the same in in most languages
they look the same in C C++ Python and
Java of course more or less and you know
our guess is that there are at least 50
million users who know how to write
those code snippets already today and
another thing that we learned is that
well if your code library looks more
like a function library that's going to
na that's going to simplify its use it's
for the end user so so for example
project lambda is something that is
going to make libraries look more like
function libraries and that's something
that's going to make these libraries
easier to use for the end user in the
spreadsheet environment we also know
that we have to we have to allow users
to work with different languages such as
Carla and Scott euskara expressions
directly in a spreadsheet and sequel
expressions and we we know that be a
we're going to have to build wizard to
help the user create all those more
complicated complicated things now I
wanted to go back and show you another
example with let's actually check on the
so here we are with here's the big tight
example the job is finished we got the
new results into the spreadsheet just to
go back to that and we can look at the
new results or interactively and and and
if you want to some more changes we can
do that and so on now
yeah it was one more example which I
wanted to show namely I wanted to show
Sarah the benefits of of garbage
collection and and here's that example
so in this example we're building the
surprising example from finance and
we're building lattices to price some
financial options now these lattices
actually are two-dimensional and you
there's a variable in here called
binomial time steps and this variable
essentially represents the number of
columns and the number of rows in in the
lattice so when you increase it you you
increase the you increase the memory
needed to store the lattice
exponentially so let's so let's increase
this variable and see what happens right
the calculation take a little bit time
and let's say I go from 80 steps to 800
and now to eight thousand things begin
to take take too much time so what I do
well I just changed the variable back to
whatever number I want and the old
calculations are going to are gonna go
away and my new calculations are going
to of course it could be much more
faster but the same time I'm benefiting
from garbage collection because all
those other structures that that were
taking all this time where where take
we're moved to memory in order to fit
the new calculations into into execution
here and we can play with this we can
actually have the system run out of
memory but and and see what it's going
to do but it just give you an odd memory
error and you can recover from that even
in inner system so we have about five
more minutes and we wanted to do reserve
that for questions or Chris you're not
and also if you have any questions
afterwards or thought you know feel free
to shoot us an email
so at this point is there do you have
any questions or anything you want to
explore further yeah yeah so yeah
absolutely good so if you go to our web
page there's a link there and and we
will get you a better version of the
system so you can play with it it we're
currently in limited beta right and
we're working on some of the and
advancing some of the features that we
want to you know we think are critical
for the beta but so we're hoping we get
about this winter but you can you can
send me an email and your audio sounds
email will send an email if you want to
get into the limited beta you know can
it can it depends what you
to Microsoft
to python yeah pivot table right so yeah
so so there are a couple of big data
spreadsheets out there most of those
spreadsheets what they do is they take
the big data file and they map it into
columns in your spreadsheet and that's
that's nice but it's not really a
spreadsheet it's a it's a it's a query
to I mean you're you're essentially
querying the big data the big data file
and understanding the structure of the
big data hide and all that is important
but that's it's a little bit different
from just creating general-purpose
models like what we're doing or longer
uses do or hearing aah spreadsheet-based
ide that answer the question
Yeah right so so what we're trying to do
here is we're trying to take the
spreadsheet and whether corporations you
mean why wouldn't be just to the same
thing with Java in here right right no
yeah it's this is a big deal though with
with Java there's an explosive growth in
those open libraries and and and the
value comes from these open source
libraries and publicly available
libraries and you don't have that with C
sharp you don't have you know there's no
open gamma for C sharp there's no quant
lip or four for sushi chef is no and
celerity no but there are millions and
millions of code produces Java yeah I
mean MapReduce comes from Java or lose
all those very very holidays immunity so
so we picked the right language we pick
pick the right language Java but we were
also lucky because when we started this
we didn't necessarily know that it's
just in the meantime those libraries
have grown and for some reason there's
an explosion in their capabilities and
that that's important the other reason
is that you mentioned the idea but in
axial and and with C sharp it's a hybrid
approach I mean you can you can call c
sharp libraries from excel of course but
what we're doing here we really just
creating a functional language with rich
type structure with all the types of
java in the spreadsheet interface and
and that's a that's a completely
different approach them and what the
what the actual community is doing and
and this is this is more like this is
actually more like functional
programming and and that's not what
they're doing all right said
yeah that's right that's right the the
arm yeah i mean that's that's right
that's absolutely correct there's a it's
a popular spreadsheet and a lot of
people use it and but the benefits here
come from using java come from all the
open source libraries and all these
technologies that and being able to take
advantage of those technologies is
extremely valuable so but you're right
actually of course is used everywhere
yeah so i didn't i didn't hear it click
on hive yes yeah you can use yeah you
can use hive and pig frameworks as well
in the system you can literally initiate
any java api in this environment right
and well this is actually as javafx
client we actually the the protein
viewer that we used it's a swing we were
so we can benefit from all the data
visualization to they're available in
jail from the inception of java that can
be initiated and brought into this
environment all right any other
questions so okay so thanks a lot for
