infrastructure Network
hi I understand that to launch a compute
instance I need to set up a VC n can you
tell me more about it
yes that's right you need to set up at
least one virtual cloud Network vcn with
at least one subnet before you can
launch an Oracle cloud infrastructure
compute instance
when you launch an instance you are
required to provide the vcn and subnet
details in principle the vcn is your
virtual data center in the cloud it is a
private network that you set up in the
Oracle data centers with firewall rules
routing policies and specific types of
communication gateways a vcn covers a
single contiguous ipv4 Sider block of
your choice
so what are the components of the vcn
typical vcn components are subnets
internet gateway dynamic routing gateway
DRG route tables security lists DHCP
options when you create a vcn most of
these components are created by default
you cannot delete them but you can
change their contents or create more of
each kind of component
remember after you've created a vcn or
subnet you can't change its size be sure
to think about the address ranges and
size of vcn and subnets you need before
creating them
that is an important consideration are
there any other limits to size and
address ranges for a VC n you can use
any ipv4 address range of size / 16 to /
30 within a subnets address range the
service reserves the first two IP
addresses and the last one how exactly
is the vcn connected to my on-premises
network
there are two ways to connect your
on-premises network to your vcn IPSec
VPN offers redundant IPSec tunnels
between your networks edge router and
the drg that you create and attach to
your vcn Oracle cloud infrastructure
fast connect offers a private connection
between your networks edge router and
your drg traffic does not traverse the
Internet
how has an IP address assigned to my
compute instance
question let us first understand the two
IP address types public IP address and
private IP address a public IP address
is an Internet routable IP address an
instance in your vcn communicates with
hosts on the internet via a public IP
address a private IP address is not
intranet routable instances inside the
vcn communicate with each other using
private IP addresses ensuring strong
isolation private IP address every
compute instance is assigned a private
IP address from The Cider block of the
subnet the instance is launched in
optionally you can specify a particular
private IP address of your choice from
the subnets available pool
public IP address if your compute
instance is created in a public subnet
it will be assigned a public internet
routable IP address by default you can
override that behavior during instance
launch and request to have no public IP
address assigned
can you tell me about the vcn setup and
functionality
there are three ways that the vcn can be
set up bcn with public subnets BCM with
private subnets with connectivity to
on-premises network and vcn with a
combination of public and private
subnets with connectivity to on-premises
network let us look at an example of the
third scenario where the vcn is set up
with both public and private subnets to
use this scenario you must have a
network administrator configure the
router at your end of the IPSec VPN in
this scenario you set up a vcn with one
both a public subnet and a private
subnet in a single availability domain
to similar subnets in a second
availability domain for redundancy three
an Internet gateway so the instances in
the public subnets can communicate with
the internet using their public IP
addresses for an IPSec VPN so the
instances in the private subnets can
communicate securely with your
on-premises network using their private
IP addresses five to route tables to
direct traffic out of the vcn one for
traffic to the internet and one for
traffic to your on-premises network 6 a
modified default security list where you
change all the existing stateful ingress
rules to allow traffic only from your
on-premises networks cider block 7 a
separate security list just for the
public subnets with these rules stateful
ingress rule for traffic from anywhere
on TCP ports 8 0 HTTP and 443 HTTPS
stateful egress rule for any traffic to
the private subnets on TCP port 1 5 2 1
for Oracle databases 8 a separate
security list just for the private
subnets with these rules stateful
ingress rule for any traffic from the
public subnets on TCP port 1 5 2 1 for
Oracle databases stateful ingress rule
for any traffic from the private subnet
on TCP port 1 5 2
for Oracle databases stateful egress
rule for any traffic in the private
subnets
on TCP port one five to one for Oracle
databases nine the default set of DHCP
options notice that the public subnet
would use both the default security list
and the public subnet security list
likewise the private subnet would use
both the default security list and the
private subnet security list the default
security list contains a core set of
stateful rules that all subnets in the
scenario need to use and by the way each
subnet can be assigned up to five
security lists
how do I secure my compute instance
running inside my vcn
you can secure your compute instance by
using security lists each of which
contains a set of ingress and egress
security rules a security rule is
similar to a firewall rule where you can
specify the source or destination
address range protocol and port all
traffic to and from an instance is
rejected by default unless it matches
the attributes of one of security rules
in the subnet security lists note that
each subnet can be assigned up to five
security lists
that was a very exhaustive overview can
we now try setting up a vcn
sure using the vcn setup wizard we can
do it in minutes
login to the Oracle cloud infrastructure
portal in the console click networking
choose virtual cloud network under
networking
note that you can create a vcn only
within a predefined compartment you will
need to create a new compartment or
choose from compartments that you have
created earlier
by default the vcn setup is routed to
the compartment that I had created
earlier
name your vcn in the setup wizard it is
optional though
you can choose to either create the VC n
components manually or go with the
default components let's choose the
default components and click create VC n
plus related resources
the dialogue expands to list the items
that will be created with your cloud
network
except other defaults and click create
virtual cloud Network
a confirmation page displays the details
of the cloud network that was just
created
the cloud network has the following
resources and characteristics cider
block range of 10.0.0.0 / 24 an Internet
gateway a route table with a default
route rule to enable traffic to and from
the Internet gateway a default security
list a public subnet in each
availability domain the vcn will
automatically use the internet and vcn
resolver for DNS
that was quick and easy what else can I
do with my vcn as we discussed earlier a
vcn is your virtual data center in the
cloud you can implement custom Network
topologies to replicate your on-premises
environment using advanced primitives
like virtual network interfaces IP
addresses routing controls and gateways
you can find more information about
these features and the topologies you
can achieve in our documentation
