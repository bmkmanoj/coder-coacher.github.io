know my topic today is about Java
engineering service and how partnering
with us can actually help customers and
partners build superior products so what
we have for first off here is the safe
harbor statement moving on so I'm going
to talk about in Java engineering
services i'm going to talk about who you
are what we do or capabilities going to
talk about some of our case studies that
we've done and how we can actually help
you in your business grow the power java
and you're in your products i'm also
going to talk about partnering benefits
at the end and then after that we're
going to have a guest speaker talk to us
about how engineering services helped
him power his business and then we're
going to have a demo and then we're
going to have Q&amp;amp;A at the end all right
right so job answering service is so
we're global Java engineering group and
our focus is really to help customers
succeed in Java right we put Java
technology in your products your
services and we really will talk about
the partnering benefits at the end but
in rural saving costs faster
time-to-market we have over 70 engineers
spread across the world right so Japan
China Taiwan Korea India Israel and USA
and we really work with customers
worldwide and you don't have Europe on
here but you know you'll see in my
slides to come that we actually help
customers in Europe as well and we've
been doing this for over 10 years right
back when the future phones were putting
Java on there we that's when we started
and we moved from the cell phone
business and right now we're actually
powering we're doing some Enterprise
related stuff as well alright so moving
on so let's talk about capabilities and
I'm actually going to go one by one here
we have many of these custom binaries we
actually take the Java Virtual Machine
and we actually poured it and we
customize it we enhance it optimize it
test it certify it and support it on all
sorts of devices and customers out there
actually have different sorts of
platforms and hardware different os's
different CPUs different graphics
libraries and there would be different
combinations of that and what we do is
we would actually take the Java Virtual
Machine and customize it for your needs
sometimes customers have special
requirements and we would address that
as well and I'll show a few examples of
what these custom banners on how we
actually 68 succeeded in some of the
product eyes ations proof of concepts so
this one also deep dive a little later
but we're not just about providing a
Java Virtual Machine to everyone we're
also about building solutions building
proof of concept right now the Java is
actually sometimes been criticized has
just been a runtime but what we actually
want everyone to know is that there is a
group and Oracle Java engineering
services who would actually build
proof-of-concept to actually help
address some of the technology gaps and
we're going to talk about that in depth
a little bit deep in slides to come all
right help influence and design
standards so I mean we're not actually
creating standards but what we like to
do is to actually drive Java adoption we
actually can work with the standards
competing standards group to actually
help adopt job on them I may I put an
example here of Jenga Ginga is the
digital TV standard for Brazil and Latin
America and what we did is you know they
they were actually the Ginga group and
bunch of partners around that wanted to
actually use our help to figure out how
we actually can help them build a
compelling
back and we got involved the very
beginning and we actually helped push
Jeb on there and so as you know today
the Ginga J TVs and Brazil's are all
powered by Java demos all right so it's
not about just creating demos to just
show Java but what it is is we also
create demos for customers to actually
help integrate with their solutions so
that they can actually push Java and
their value and software to their
customers and I have actually example
demo that actually will show later and
the S speaker will have a demo as well
all right now contribute to product
roadmap we don't define the roadmap
however we do a lot of stuff with our
customers like creating custom solutions
that really help the product team
figural requirements for the next
release of Java for example for some of
you who attended the Java keynote on
Sunday you might have seen Nandini on
stage with a very small Centurion device
it's a small wireless module that has a
3g GPA gsm and it's got communication
capabilities all that well that's
actually a lot of the requirements that
actually defined that product arose from
a project that engineering services did
was Centurion and so we worked with
Centurion to actually provide a
customized version of that Java ME small
embedded product and from working with
them they actually came up with some
extra requirements like device access
and in some extra API is that we were
able to actually feed back to the
product team and they incorporated that
and this is just one example so I mean
engineering service that then also helps
the product team drive products
consulting now I put Java card here
which is still not actually something we
do but it's actually on the plan but
sometimes we find that customers
actually like to build it on their own I
mean we have customers that in different
countries like they just actually want
to own it I mean that's fine however
there is customers out there that they
still need some help even though we're
not providing the binary so we do offer
a service that we can consult with them
we can actually help them optimize their
java for their value add software for
their requirements and research so like
i said we have about 70 engineers and
recently about a few months ago i
inherited the spot team from oracle labs
so engineering services is the
development center for the asset
tracking solution that you actually saw
in Jetsons keynote today the container
management the solution is actually
developed by engineering services team
and product development is needed so as
I mentioned in a Centurion project we
were a major contributor in the Java
miss Mullen better product release we
are also the product owner for CDC and
the or fishel oracle name for that
product is Oracle Java embedded client
next
now this one Thomas will talk into a
little bit more in detail in his slides
but we actually do a lot of work with
integration with third-party software so
I mean there would be customers out
there that actually have their own
software it's written in Java but
sometimes Java doesn't connect so easily
with the virtual machine sometimes we
actually have to develop hooks in the
Java Virtual Machine to actually provide
tighter integration with their software
so we'll go um one example of that is
processed and Thomas will talk to that
as well all right we also enhance the
standard products okay so there are java
SE and java emmy and there's also java
SE and Java ME and what we do is we work
closely with customers right like I
mentioned we've been working with
customers for 10 years now and we know
what the customers pain points are
around gel right and just just releasing
standard binaries on the website does
not address the whole customers out
there we work we are almost like the
bridge between the customers and the
product team to drive the develop to
drive the engineering of that so we are
actually providing a lot of help to the
product team to enhance their products
strategic ports there are a lot of
companies out there that have very
proprietary hardware some some hardware
which the standard binary that you
download from the website does not
address and I just made it a few
examples that so we've worked with a lot
of major bluray companies actually most
of them are on the world so if you go
out at rujuta was to bestbuy or any
electronic store in your country and you
actually went by a blu-ray player
chances are engineering services built
the binary for it all right and there
are companies that actually have their
own proprietary CPU I'm not at liberty
to name all the manufacturing names but
we actually ported in customized the
virtual machine the hotspot compiler all
that for their CPU all right and we
actually help them take that and go two
more
get with it and another example that I
made is java SE for mips so if you go on
the website you know java SE you can
only download for certain platforms like
arm and x86 and and you know customers
out there want more flexibility they may
use different CPUs right maybe still
mips are still a big player out there so
what engineering services did is we
actually built java SC for the mips
platform now we've been told that if we
get enough adoption of that that would
actually become a standard java SE
product that people can download off the
website so in a way we're kind of like a
stepping stone to that next one now this
one you know I couldn't come up with a
better name but sometimes we have
customers that are just you know goes
our sales have just helped us you know
we don't have we don't have time to
engage with engineering service to
actually help us to build a custom
binary for them but they're like you
know just can you come on site and help
us out I mean it's kind of related to
consulting but it's more like
last-minute thing so I mean just you
know and we're all about driving the
revenue right and helping customers Park
ties so if just customers out there I
was like you know you guys got to help
us out help us fix some issues this is
some of the service we provide as well
so moving forward to put this a little
more in perspective and the technology
we specialize right I mean this is
actually a really a copying pace of the
product roadmap that you but the
priority made but starting with a most
tiny footprint device that you can get
out there java card right this is
something that or engineering services
going forward will provide services for
right we could provide consulting we can
provide writing applications we can
provide service related to helping chip
makers put Java on it right java card is
a huge market opportunity and I'm not
going to spend the whole time talking
about it but I mean you see passports I
financing business car sorry banking
cards cellphones all that is can be
powered by Java card and there's a lot
of customers out there this don't know
how to actually go and Mark it with that
and it is one of the most secure
platforms out there so this is something
that engineering service will provide
service to actually help customers put
that bring that technology to market
small this is for small devices we have
Java ME embedded and the Oracle Java
better client so you see here a pen I
mean this is actually a pen that's
actually you can buy that house Java on
it you know you can write and it
actually sends it to the cloud and all
that stuff so this is something that
Java runs on these pens that runs on
these wireless modules it runs on mobile
devices it could actually run on many
more it's a small footprint vm we
support that medium devices i talked
about blu rays I talked to being orders
tab Lister's concentrators home gateways
we support that as well right and the
big one the large one java SE is right
you see medical equipment you see a
point of sales terminals ATMs you see
embedded servers I mean were there as
well we're supporting many customers
worldwide that actually have product
Isis as well
and you know this is just a slide to
just give people a heads up but we are
the development center for the sensor
platform that's actually based on Java
that was demoed at the keynote this
morning so not going to go too much into
details right but the value here is that
Java is at the center of the whole
end-to-end sensor and add sensor
management for asset tracking vehicle
tracking container management tracking
we're on the device side we actually
customize for the device and these
sensor ap is are all available in Java
and we provide all the Java API for
communication modules to the GPRS to the
GPS go straight into the back end which
is powered by oracle application that's
written in Java the whole and as well as
a whole back-end stack which is powered
by exalogic X oolitic sand databases
just powered by Oracle so it's really a
true end-to-end solution that we're
trying to promote here and engineering
service is really at the is a
development center is at the core of
that this is not yet something that
we're really ready to go out and help
people out in it because it's still in
prototype stage but you know come soon
whether it's and I'm not allowed to
promise any road maps here but very
shortly you know this is something that
will be available to customers and our
group will be actually supporting
customers and partners
alright so to kind of put in perspective
and show a little visualization on what
are some of the custom bynars we've done
for customers and what are those
products I put a few down so I mean
personal devices I mean I guess everyone
knows what the Amazon Kindle is right i
mean this is something that we've worked
with amazon for a couple years now
several years and still working with
them and this is actually Java powered
by the engineering services group right
medium to large embedded devices so
multifunction printers some of you may
know or not it's all powered by java
right and not just a printer itself but
there are actually printers or even
computers or devices that actually
manage multiple multifunction printers
to see if the toner levels high or low
maintenance required or not even that
gateway device is powered by Joe right
point-of-sales terminals ATMs also
powered by java and these are everything
that java engineering services actually
did for the customer right voice voice
over IP communications all these IP
phones or anything this is something
that the engineering services group to
help Cisco with their phone this is like
the most popular business phone out
there and this is injuring services
achievement turning
industrial controls right so factory
automation or that that that's actually
something that we've actually helped
with customers as well I'm putting Java
and they're helping them with their use
case a lot of case it's not just
standard Java sometimes it's a
customized version of that we provide
the solution for that feature phones
right we've been doing this for a really
long time but you know we we work with
manufacturers Williams all around the
world China Korea Japan USA and we're
helping actually them customize Java for
their future phones management
monitoring operations so building
management right I mean we're actually
working on you saw on stage sites
interior I'm sorry no tritium got the
Java innovation award well not sure if
I'm allowed sada but that's actually a
partnership that we have with tritium
that actually help them receive that
award connected vehicles telematics we
have devices in cars that are actually
collecting tons of data from different
devices right and this device actually
when it goes into service is it put
spits all that log into actually some
server and then you know the maintenance
people know exactly what went wrong or
how the guy was driving the car well
this device and gateway that actually is
connecting the computer that that sorry
the cars to the maintenance computer is
basically powered by engineering
services solution for them so home
gateway devices right so this one as
well right connecting all your devices
everything in your house and into a
gateway home gateway device this is all
java and the thing with this one is that
there's a lot of customization that
needs to happen it's not like a customer
can just take a Java Virtual Machine and
just plug it in and works into the home
gateway use case something that you know
Oracle engineer servers worked really
hard and work closely with customers to
actually bring that to market multimedia
so I talked about how we actually helped
ginga be powered by Java under
specification Java is at the heart of
the bluray specification and same with
all these other digital TV specs like oh
cap and MHP
el jem based it's all part by Java we
worked with major all the major
electronics makers in the world to
actually help put Java and customized
gel for their multimedia devices data
concentrator right so there's actually
suspect and I think friends or something
your DF that actually mandate Java to
actually be on there there's they're
smart grid concentrator well we worked
with one of the biggest european smart
the data concentrator and we've actually
customized Java for them and excellent
use case some easy so as you can see
here we've put Java a lot of different
devices whether it's small medium or
large and I just want everyone to get a
picture of that and also talking about
small right sensors microcontrollers I
mean you see Centurion with their
wireless module this is actually what we
did so a little small deep dive about
well how do we actually help market
developments and some of the projects
i'm going to talk about very on an
abstract high level how and then we're
going to go into lobo some case studies
so demos right so customers everything
they instead of showing slides and
everything they actually need something
they can see in Tut's right and
oftentimes they don't actually have the
expertise and all the resources to do it
so we would work with customers to
actually help them build demos to
highlight java in their use cases right
custom binaries right binaries for
different uski cells or whether it's
home gateway TV kindle point-of-sale
terminals custom binaries those actually
help mark and develop projects proof of
concepts i'm going to talk about one
related to health care in a few slides
but the standard java binary that you
can download from the website does not
address everything I mean it doesn't
have health care profile ap is doesn't
have zigbee
it doesn't have all the stuff this is
something that we don't define the
product but we actually build proof of
concept to actually help drive the
adoption of these java api s and if
there's enough adoption the product team
at oracle the core engineer would adopt
it in their official product releases
it's all these things demos custom
binaries and proof of concept what do
they do is we actually feel technology
gap right you know SC runtime the MU on
time there's a lot of gaps in their ass
and that's not it yet Taylor to all the
markets well engineering civil services
fill that gap and what do we do with
that well we feed back to the core
engineering group right you know as you
can tell the the product releases are
are not so frequent at Oracle right or
even sun right I mean it's like you have
one java su released per year javaone
Java ME release per year I mean that's
standard right but the thing is they
need feedback right and we work closely
with the market in the market leaders
and customers out there to figure out
what is it that they actually need we
build proof of concept and solutions in
the meantime to address that right and
then in the meantime also to feedback to
the core engineering group and next time
they release the official product it'll
it'll you may have all those api's and
so I'm just going to explain a few case
study demos here so this is called a
smart grid demo and it's it's really a
demo to highlight how Java can play in
in the in in a gateway device and for
the smart grid use case so we have a
demand response server that would send
like that was connected to to a gateway
device and perhaps your home or
something and it would send that it
would send like a signal or a message
saying you know hiking electricity
prices and I
and this this gateway device powered by
Java right and has javed zigbee API is
would take that and it could potentially
send a signal to a plug device that you
see at the very top there to say okay
well you know maybe i need to actually
save on electricity and it would
actually turn off to turn off the lights
or i would actually come up with it's a
use case to basically help save costs
for for home people in homes to actually
save electricity right what we did here
is we provided Java support for zigbee
which does not exist in standard general
products right and there are the sales
team actually use this demo in different
tech days or Java one in different
countries to actually demonstrate the
Java use case in the smart grid use case
scenario so the Bluetooth healthcare
device right so we support Bluetooth
rights jsr but the thing is we don't
support all the brand new profiles out
there like health care so we've we've
heard a lot of voices from different
customers and even si is out there that
actually will what is the Oracle do to
actually support this and so engineering
service came in you know we what we did
is we we found out that we need to
actually create a Java wrapper to the
blue skirt bluetooth healthcare device
profile and sis can actually go out now
and actually build some java application
on top of that and powered by the Oracle
Java right and go and talk to their
customers and help adoption of Java in
the health care industry
so so I just have a few more slides and
I she in the end I want to talk about
how partnering us can benefit customers
help you guys right so first of all you
saw that big slide with all those
capabilities as you have whether it's
customer emergency rescue your custom
binaries or proof of concept or demos or
research or consulting well you know
we'd like you to think about how you can
leverage our capabilities right and I'm
sure a lot of customers out there have
business problems business issues right
you know how do we solve this business
requirement well we can actually help
you address that through our
capabilities and then when you deep a
little bit deep dive into that we can
actually help you solve the technical
issues right we can actually create a
custom solutions for you guys right and
in the end what that can result to you
is we could actually penetrate new
markets together right it's hard for
engineering service or it's hard for
Oracle in some ways to do it on it on
their own we need actually work with
partners and customers to do this in the
part 2 y partner with the Oracle engine
service well you saw a lot of our custom
binaries out there right we have custom
we have a custom binary for virtually
most of the CPUs and OS and in libraries
out there right so if you leverage us
you would save costs right we have
something that's off the shelf you know
faster time-to-market because if you
leverage something that we already have
you guys don't actually have to go and
customize and build it right you can
also save costs because we have
engineering worldwide you can actually
leverage some of our engineers I've been
doing this for over 10 years reliable we
actually work with customers worldwide
right we have customers that have used
the same Java in different use cases
whether it's TV or healthcare device or
even personal devices right but the
thing is those are really sharing the
same codebase you know at all the bugs
that we for the issues that we actually
get from one customer well we're
actually we're actually leveraging that
for other customers so as we get more
and more customer
it's getting more and more mature so
working with us you actually get a
really reliable solution and it's
optimized right we worked with different
customers out there right a lot of
customers in Japan are very very picky
right well we've actually gone through
all the exercise to actually optimizing
for different customers out there so
we're actually going to leveraging all
these no house and all these techniques
and all these solutions and we can be
providing it for new customers you guys
don't actually have to think about
performances everything but because our
pitch is that hey it's already highly
performant right so with that I just
want to end it with my last slide which
is well you know think about please
think about leveraging our es
capabilities and you guys are the
customers out there right if we work
together right we can definitely build
superior custom products right so so
with that I'm going to switch over to
Thomas year and Thomas hot is the
processed chief executive officer of
process and he's actually going to talk
about how engineering services help and
benefit them and you also will talk
about your company as well and you'll
have a demo to actually showcase how we
actually help them
I can continue with us right now man
we'll just do
great thanks so much ok hello everybody
my name is Thomas odd and I'm running
this company process since november two
thousand and let me just introduce me a
little bit and why my company is doing
the company is doing purely java since
1997 and in 1999 we really focused
completely on one embedded java we
became a member of various bodies that
sort of define reference architecture
for fall for for m2m in general we right
now we got a little bit more than 120
people most of them actually technicians
i'm one of the I think three or four
people who don't have a technical
background so I'm very happy to talk on
a more commercial oriented gathering
here and what we really do is we we try
to find I think that first of all we do
all sorts of m2m Java we have customers
across all those various verticals and I
mean here we see sort of the smart home
business that we have people who
manufacture and devices like Mila for
example they are doing white goods some
of them may know them we have people
like bush hager they belong to a BB they
do home automation but we have also
companies who just do chips or produce
gateways and they find out that their
gateways with our service platform on it
become intellect intelligent service
gateways so we have we really create a
kind of an ecosystem we have people
doing home applications and they are
stopped using proprietary technology for
their their their central unit and they
go to use our standard oriented Java we
do the same on the telematics I'd we
have a lot of customers there and right
now we're in very interesting kind of
field management trials we're really
more than 100 cars are put on the street
there's a great trial right now
going on in frankford 120 cars on the
street they are all wirelessly connected
i'll use our software they're more than
400 roadside units that control the
traffic lights and every single or
controlled by us our software inside
embedded software and our back-end
system that basically rented managers
all this remotely then we on the mobile
space we are just more customized driver
solutions we all know that Apple and
Google have a have the majority there it
is on the smartphone side and then we
have various other m2m markets like
printers a health ins and so on what we
tried to focus on though is I mean they
obviously thousands I don't know how
many a Java embedded solutions in the
market most of them are just there for
for one specific reason you know for you
know managing containers or smartphones
or whatever what we really tries a
little bit kind of finding the Holy
Grail making trying to contribute to a
reference info a reference architecture
and that can only be done if we have
free as brutally as possible focus on
the standards that are in the market I
mean the osgi Alliance might might be
known so too many of you has been around
since 99 focuses on m2m reference
architecture in general very important
here especially for the smart home field
is he home gateway initiative they
actually driving the O's I stand out
quite remarkably I think for telcos it
has been a fairly bad experience what
happens in the smartphone field that
basically people like Apple and who will
go around them directly to the end user
and they just are the bit pipe and now
they are really trying to make sure that
same it's not happening in the
end-to-end space in general especially
in the smart home but also in order and
automotive and so on and I must really
say I'm right impressed because there
are lot of these standard bodies but but
this one is very very active and they
are pushing the reference architectural
for the for the
at home then a lot of other things like
the broadband forum and so on I don't
want a boy over the details but I think
what we really need and what that'll
also said this morning is we need to
build an ecosystem and the necklace
system can only be built if there is a
reference architecture so that people
have really come by buy into that and I
think we are really making good progress
of disrespect and the main idea actually
is just stolen out from the smartphone
world I mean people have understood what
apps are and we just reckon that all
these use cases in m2m are nothing but
apps hardware is not that important
anymore it's all about software and we
push Java now for many years and I think
and we were excited that this is all
really happening now we have always had
a decent living on our more proprietary
java project but now and this new
ecosystem is really it's real yeah we
have right now in the smart home space
and evolving other m2m markets as well
kind of a apps that need a platform and
that need some some back-end yeah and
there we actually fit very well with
Oracle I mean Oracle has all the
embedded software and then all the data
and products that make it really
scalable and we are kind of a little bit
like the missing link we run on the
virtual machine we have and that's very
important I think the best SDK in the
market for this thing it's just a bunch
of plugins where people can very easily
work with and we have a back-end system
that's able to do the user management to
install and uninstall the software to
build it and that's basically a
middleware that's an end-to-end middle
rail which is very much empowered by
Oracle which allow us then sort of an
ecosystem evolve where you have service
providers or service aggregators that
provide the infrastructure similar to
Apple if you want yeah there's an app
store give out SDKs and people develop
stuff and bring it to the market for a
lot of vs vs for the developing
integrators and then all the chipset
manufacture
sort of our really viewing this osgi
based architecture as as the future and
David foodie from Utah she was
mentioning a couple of telcos that are
already working on it I'm proud to say
that the majority of this telcos was
powered by processed and the aggie
texture and I focus will be on the smart
home now because to get a little bit
more real about this the architecture
that we've got in place now for this
connected home is looks like as follows
you basically have a gateway in the home
and you can see which that's hosting all
these apps and in in all the cases we
work with with VM vendors and we all
know that there are others around but
we've chosen Oracle for two reasons
because it's just the best product it's
sort of the latest version I mean Oracle
is driving it and last not least because
we got great support from Mike and his
team and that's come back to what what
that brings are you really a little bit
later so this gateway is here and the
Gateway obviously has to connect first
of all to all sorts of user devices that
people from their mobile phone also can
do all these home control and home
management stuff or tablets or pcs
whatever and then what's what's also
very important and if I hear other
people talking about home automation
most of the people talk about this one
they all complain that there are too
many protocols and that there is no
standard and you have more protocols
coming to the market right now it's in
ocean I don't know who knows about it
it's just if you never will have a
standard on that side and what's
obviously behind here this is a
connectivity or to all the devices the
connectivity to the webcams to the
switches to the sensors to the
thermostats or whatever to the washing
machine what you have in the home and
what we've developed also together with
these standard bodies like HCI and also
that was G is kind of an abstraction
layer that allows you that's always gee
I am mostly java-based that allows you
to fairly easily connect to devices
whether they have standardized protocols
like zigbee on that wave or whether they
have proprietary protocols and still a
lot of propriety
because around so connectivity to the
devices just not an issue anymore the
software works a little bit as a
translation software as well and then we
obviously it has to be connected to the
back end and on a backhand side we have
all the usual things you need I mean
what what we have is a we built from
scratch developed a remote management
system that it was the first enterprise
system that's entirely osgi panda
java-based and this one then is very
easily connects to existing
infrastructure and works with the Oracle
products that that allows us to really
scale our product to to millions of the
alarm to manage to the management of
millions of devices so that's a little
bit what's happening again we basically
have this Aussie I gateway we have the
right SDK to it and the backend system
we already have a lot of customers that
really we can handle on our own but when
it starts to be become really
commercially sort of via scalable then
we were very happy to have the support
from Oracle and I'd like to summarize a
little bit why we work with Oracle first
of all it's clear I mean we are a pure
Java company we love Trevor be pushed
java wherever we can we really are very
happy to see that Java plays a more
important role and it's really changing
the minds of people that i mean when i
started in two thousand the automotive
guys who just didn't want to talk about
java yeah and i know i know i mean i had
a meeting with volkswagen 2001 and i
went there on fairly senior level took
my back best technicians and we were
mall is kicked out so we didn't know
what I was talking about they didn't
know what what we were doing and then I
said Java never worked and so it was
great I was just mentioning this is this
big few trial in Germany it's called Zim
tedious i can give you the the website
it's really tremendous success when it
started in 2008 they decided to to use
osgi or Java byte and for me it was
great when all these guys came from full
expired I'm not BMW they came to our
officers in Cologne
and we gave them some sort of teaching
and handed over how is DK and they work
now on that for two or three years they
did applications on java-based and they
threw it all over the fence and we
integrated it and now they saw now
seeing you know on the street it's
working let's there's a whole set of
mine chain and we're very happy now to
work with Oracle because they are the
leading job and they're really pushing
it and they basically have the same
interest in sorry I have to speed up
okay just you shouldn't talk me when I'm
just talking about the benefits but
maybe you can cut the other stuff it's
later but anyway so the yeah obviously
at my class already said that I mean we
they've helped us a lot I mean this was
a telco we just have things like
resource management which is very
important to let the resource on on the
Gateway I really optimally used your and
so Mike's team is helping us to get the
optimal stake in this respect are they
are security things where they help us
and they have a lot of stuff which is
off the shelf which were you happy to
use and they have the most efficient and
and future-proof vm amino I mean there
are other people who provide VMs and one
big blue as we know and there is not so
much let's restaurant future future
proof let's let's face it the other
thing is that one our back-end side were
very happy to have oracle as a partner
because as I said we developed our
back-end system from scratch and now
very big organization are using it for
their osgi projects yeah I may mention
one representatives here don't you
telecom for example they have a project
like this and they are using our
embedded stuff they're using the SDKs
actually be white labeled the SDK for
them and they using our back-end and
that's all great but how can you do this
as a small company how do you get
credible you get obviously you know how
can people believe that you can manage
millions of devices and that's what what
we do is Oracle with their help you know
we right now do a benchmarking for our
remote management system and they are
Scottish labs and we going to show we're
going to have a press release that we're
going to we have already proven that we
can manage 20 million devices
so that's a lot of credibility to have a
partner like Oracle in the back and
again I speed up I go to the demo how
much time to have to like you okay now i
can have a look at your website there's
all our products are produced i
described then i go to the demo okay now
but I somehow have some connection there
but can you help me out and we get the
internet connection down here okay I can
just go to the heart we are apart first
and show you what I'm trying to talk to
achieve I have let us such a measure
this is my home yeah and and here is
enough I'm sort of sitting in the office
and i just bought from some kind of
service provider let's say it's helpful
i bought sort of a basic kit and I now
had to show you what this is consisting
off and how I really get this on my home
automation scenario working the idea is
really that's a future and people like
Deutsche Telekom I have already started
this I mean this project from Deutsche
Telekom called ki dukaan can look it up
in the internet and this is kind of a
new way this all will happen it's really
a little bit like in the smartphone
world so the company the telco sets up
an app store and the customer can just
go into the app store and see what kind
of applications are available the telco
is not really providing own applications
or maybe some basic applications but in
general the idea is like bikers Apple
people partner was at a local telco they
get an SDK they don't have to worry
about you know what kind of hardware do
I need what kind of operating system
what kind of Java or whatever you know
embedded foundation they don't have to
worry about all the backend stuff the
billing and so on these partners they
speak to the apartment they can just
focus on what they're good at there
might be good at some emails
education they might be good at security
alarm stuff they might whatever and the
doctor tell at home and others are doing
it exactly that way try to my one issue
that's great I can't can't tell why ok
Blunden I tried you know and would be
very flexible my head ok his own to mine
I sit down the other was you know this
miscreant United suspected but it's not
really what I expected but ok oh so yeah
let's let's go to the time twist i think
i have 10 minutes at work in a half time
minutes into a patrol so I I one
customer I signed in with his telephone
and indeed he has kind of to service
applications they gave me two things
they gave me one sort of control and one
kind of heating at basic app so DHL or
whatever effect Phoenix comes in brings
me a few things one is a gateway which I
already to save some plugged in this
cage ready this time comes from I onyx
but the world of these gateways around
with these boys just offer may be saved
from process on it I have in here they
live in prototype 2 USB sticks and they
have this one is simply one in that way
and a half then two switches here's two
sockets these are z-wave based and then
I also have here 12 thermostat that can
show me the temperature 21 degrees
Celsius and this is actually a z-wave
device from danfoss you could buy them
in market more quarter now what I do now
is again I get this give this thing by
mail and stick in the gateway does
normal rocket the gateway is connected
just here x equal tell me la land trust
cable and then i had blackened all my
mind switches here and this one is a
battery device so next thing is i go to
the bed and I link myself into the the
web I hope not page it's a pretty much
difficulty anyway my kitty step thank
you know much so this mica not the
connected home much to pick now but
should be on one page but anyway
basically what would I have 40 I get
from the provider so I've already locked
in to save some time I have I can have a
look at the application says that I'll
market right now so their various
applications and so
can I get the idea how gets quality now
because you know yeah so I can't I can't
explore anything okay but do you want to
just describe it because we can say I
describe it to you and because that
makes some sense ok let's go out of here
which is this actually look at the Duchy
telecom this is the page where they
making sure that what they do have a
look at it's quite good ok let's forget
about this one now if I i would i would
basically get into that and you see the
app store thing I mean which looks a
little bit like this so I can have a
look at all the applications and I
choose the applications that are free
now the one's a little bit up for free
is something that I get a voucher code
know if they the voucher program enter
the water code I basically can tear the
devices with the gateway that means
can't do that not all that but basically
the Gateway would connect to the
thermostat and would connect to seduce
switches and then if I have paired it
you know then you can basically already
here switch the light of a non now this
is a sick people caring I do the same
which is done for seven studs and
impaired it they have a voucher code and
then I basically this page and
connection in take the temperature up
and down and okay next thing is I go to
my room configurator let's actually very
neat and i would like to show this that
and then basically i can go into the
rooms i can take a photo of i will put
it in there so that basically this would
mean by bedroom and I could get these
icons basically move one baby to the
ceiling
one down there so I know always wear my
device I'm actually located make sure
and then I can basically turn them off
by my phone or whatever and it's really
amazing if the devil your works because
you justice it's here then import all
back to host Europe and in here and this
is just what we would be then when the
next just the next then that would be
one power off so I can basically also
prepare it the best deal then make sure
if I go on then all the power is turned
off then I have kind of the next step
this again could be from some are you
stressed creative and so there's a
schedule and so I can really sets the
temperature during the day for different
time zones and will determine from
anywhere my homes so that's basically a
nutshell I said a lot of time now cuz
okay I think I got a few so just to
close this
did you put it back to the podium
so I mean I think we just a few minutes
left and I only have one slide and
basically that slide is just a call to
action if you guys have any questions
please contact your local sales are up
but if you don't know who your sales rep
is or if you want to ask me any specific
questions my last slide is going to have
my email address on it so just until
that comes up you guys have any
questions just feel free to ask
so this is my email address if you guys
have any questions if you don't have an
ounce please shoot it by email I can
