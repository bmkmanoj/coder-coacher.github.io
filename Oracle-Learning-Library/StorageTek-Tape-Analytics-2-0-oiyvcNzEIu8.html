size are experiencing an explosion of
data Oracle is innovating new solutions
to proactively manage and monitor these
digital storage environments as data
flows into clouds digital archives and
data protection environments system
administrators need more efficient tools
to help monitor all of these digital
assets enter in Oracle's newest storage
monitoring software storagetek tape
analytics 20 in this video we will take
a live look at a digital tape library
environment monitored by storagetek tape
analytics 20 the demo system is
monitoring multiple geographically
dispersed tape libraries all of the
health performance and monitoring data
is flowing into one central storage tech
tape analytic system providing the
storage administrator with the
information they need in one place
during the demo we will deep dive on the
new features available within storagetek
tape analytics 20 these features include
a customized dashboard which enables
users to create a unique view into the
tape environment an executive report
allowing users to automatically generate
email reports on a daily weekly monthly
quarterly or annual basis expanded
Hardware monitoring with the second
release of tape analytics users can look
beyond just drive and media health and
now you can look at performance data on
robots pass through ports cartridge
access ports and elevators logical
grouping a feature to help users
separate their assets into groups that
align with the tape environment capacity
and performance planning new features
throughout the storage tech tape
analytics system will help
administrators and executives better
understand how the tape system is being
utilized and help them maximize the
robotic performance email notifications
are completely refreshed and now
customizable so that storage
administrators get the information they
want when they need it
mobile support provides proactive tape
monitoring anywhere you go and finally
last but not least library media
validation the most advanced way to scan
the media and the data stored within the
tape library to ensure you will have
access to your digital assets when you
need to recall them in the future now
let's go ahead and connect to a live
storagetek tape analytics to doto system
logging in is easy and you can access
the browser-based user interface from
anywhere on your network once logged in
your dashboard will be the first thing
you see the dashboard is customized to
you in your view of the digital archive
and or data protection environment the
dashboard screen consists of a series of
portlets each portlet contains a unique
graph table or report pertaining to the
health performance or capacity of your
system the dashboard is fully
customizable with over 50 different
portlets available each one highlighting
a unique view into the data collected by
storagetek tape analytics the dashboard
is extremely flexible giving you control
of the type of data displayed you may
dynamically add and remove portlets with
ease to add a new portlet simply select
the type of Portland you wish wish to
display from the drop-down menu and the
portlet will be added to your dashboard
some portlets contain information about
the amount of data the system is stored
while others focus on throughput the
health of the tape library subsystems
and much much more you may add portlets
until you have created the customized
view you prefer once you have the
dashboard to your liking you can save
your dashboard with a custom name and
specify whether or not you want to share
this dashboard with other tape analytics
users within your organization each user
may create and share multiple dashboard
templates for example you may want to
create a dashboard to monitor the health
of all of your library's tape drives
media and library sub systems such as
robots pass through ports cartridge
access ports and elevate
this creates a central location to
monitor the health of all your tape
subsystems additionally you may want to
create a dashboard view to help optimize
tape operations this view may include
system capacity data growth performance
and throughput numbers valuable
information to help you get the most out
of your storage tech assets the
flexibility of the system does not stop
at multi dashboard support tape
analytics allows you to customize each
of the individual portlets as an example
you may want one portlet to provide a
summary of the health of all of your
media across the tape environment but
you may also want to see the health of
the media in a single tape library or
the health of a specific media
generation well this powerful filtering
feature within storagetek tape analytics
enables you to drill down to the
specific information you need to
proactively manage your environment
using the filtering feature you will be
able to create views unique to specific
time frames asset locations technology
generations and so much more now that
you have the tools to deep dive into the
workings of your environment you will
find opportunities to improve your
systems and taking note of these
opportunities is important with judo you
can now make annotations so that you can
capture relevant data and investigate
performance or health issues
additionally many of the portlets
provide links to detailed information
screens on libraries drives and media
enabling you to quickly deep dive into
relevant information and take action on
the performance and health issues
discovered once you have configured your
dashboards to your liking you will be
able to save and access these views
every time you log in to tape analytics
or alternatively the dashboard views are
supported on mobile devices so you can
remotely monitor the storage environment
from a mobile browser anytime anywhere
in addition to the flexible options to
access the system there are also new
features in 20 that enable the system to
notify you the two types of notification
available our executive reports and
email alerts executive reports are
completely customizable and are created
by leveraging the dashboard views you
have already developed to create an
automated report simply navigate to the
set up an administration tab then click
on the new report icon create a report
name select the source dashboard select
the start date and the frequency reports
may be run automatically generating
daily weekly monthly quarterly or
annually finally select the desired
email recipients if you select save and
run a report will be generated
immediately the report will include
graphs tables and charts as well as
detailed information on what is being
displayed and if any annotations were
made they will be visible here as well a
history of all of the executive reports
will automatically be saved in the tape
analytic system for your future
reference the second avenue to receive
notifications from the system is email
alerts tape analytics leverages and
advanced rules engine enabling you to
create alerts for very specific
scenarios or events for the purposes of
this demonstration let's say you want to
be alerted every time a drives health
indicator moves into the action state to
get started there are five easy steps to
set up an alert first create a name and
a description second select the device
you want to be alerted on in this case
we will select drives in a severity
level of critical the third step is to
create the rule that will activate the
alert in this case you would select the
drive health indicator in a state of
action multiple filters could be applied
here allowing you to drill down further
into the specific tape drive generation
or drive locations of your
organization's data centers the last
step is to select an email alert
recipient or multiple recipients once
the alert criteria are met and emailed
to the appropriate recipients will be
sent so far in this demo we have looked
at the flexibility of the dashboard and
the portlets as well as the proactive
nature of the exec
reports in alerts however there is still
an extremely valuable feature yet to
cover the integration of storagetek tape
analytics with storage tech library
media validation together these features
provide the most advanced solution in
the industry to scan and validate the
integrity of your data so that you may
be confident you can retrieve your
assets from your clouds digital archives
and data protection environments in the
future let's start by looking at how
library media validation works when
automated by tape analytics then we'll
jump back into the live demo system to
see how its configured monitored and
managed to get started you will select a
tape drive to perform the media
validation scans selecting which drive
to leverage may be done with the
assistance of tape analytics the drive
you selected will be dedicated to
validations and not available to other
applications the second step is to
select the media you wish to verify you
may either manually kick off the
verification by selecting the media you
wish to scan or you may create a policy
to automatically queue up media for
validation the third and final step is
to select the type of verification you
wish to perform the verification options
differ by the amount of media scanned
and the level of file verification once
you have completed these three steps you
will be ready to put library media
validation into action tape analytics
will kick off the first verification and
display the results in the system the
software will then continue to manage
the queue of media and kick off the
additional verifications the results
will continue to flow into your
interface there is also a recommended
option to periodically verify the
integrity of the drive performing these
scans and that is the final media
movement you see here now that you have
taken the time to understand how
storagetek tape analytics and library
media validation work together to
improve the integrity of your storage
environment let's jump back into the
live demo system to see how to configure
and manage these operations you can
start by navigating to the media
validation tab in the setup and
administration menu
here is where you will enable media
validation as well as see the number of
drives available to perform validations
select the create new validation icon
and enter a policy name in description
next select the format of the media you
wish to validate in a library no you
also have the option here to scan the
media and illogical group logical
grouping is a new feature that allows
you to group assets based on the users
and/or organizations that your storage
environment supports for example you may
create a logical group for legal assets
versus engineering assets or maybe a
group for weather data versus seismic
data the way you group your assets will
be unique to you your industry and your
organization for the purposes of this
example we will just select a media type
the final step is to select the policy
in the type of validation the policy
options range from random to health
related to the age of the data and the
last time it was accessed under the
verification test types you will see all
of the verification options discussed
earlier from basic verify to complete
verify plus once you have created a
policy you can easily update or delete
the policy in the future from the screen
to see the status and results of all the
validations in the queue navigate to the
system activity screen the media
validation overview screen provides a
table of all the media validations
performed this table is completely
customizable and the attributes seen
here are just a fraction of the values
monitor here you can see the media type
volume serial number time the scan took
type of verification used the result and
the recommendation the majority of the
media is determined to be okay for
continued use however the scans did
identify some mirrors or memory
information regions that needed to be
rebuilt tape analytics can do this
automatically in the background the view
here does not show any recent failed
notifications requiring data to be
migrated to a new tape but in the event
that the system did encounter an error
the health state would change
action and the result would be updated
here all of the dashboard executive
report and email alert features have
special attributes for media validation
so you can closely monitor the scans of
your clouds digital archives and data
protection environments with Oracle's
storagetek tape analytics to auto
software storage administrators and
executives alike now have access to the
tools needed to monitor and manage the
data growth of today and tomorrow to
