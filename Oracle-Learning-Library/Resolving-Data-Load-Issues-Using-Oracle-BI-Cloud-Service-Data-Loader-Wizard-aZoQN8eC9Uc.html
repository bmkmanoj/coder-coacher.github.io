bi cloud service data loader wizard I am
a business analyst I uploaded a data
file to the database which created a new
table named may revenue I want to review
the history to ensure that i did not
have any errors once I verify the file
contents I can then model the data
successfully to accurately reflect how I
and others ask our business questions in
the home page I click the load data link
the data loader history page is
displayed the data loader history page
displays a table that contains details
about data loading including low date
the user who ran the upload the number
of records inserted the number of
records not loaded and so on I only want
to see the load operation for the table
that I added I can search for my table
by name I click in the search list and
then I enter may I click go only my
table is displayed in the data loader
table I review the table entry and
immediately see that all but two records
were loaded I want to see what caused
the problem I click the records link in
the not loaded records column the load
details page is displayed I review my
errors immediately see in the error
column that I have a data type mismatch
error invalid number I know that this is
a common error when loading data into a
database table structure I also know
that I can use the format as number data
transformation to correct these errors I
see that the offending column in the
first error row is the revenue column I
note that the error further stands out
because it is shaded in yellow in the
table the second error record displays
an issue in the unit's column I click
reload records the select destination
page is displayed in the select
destination page of the data loader
wizard I noticed that format as a number
has automatically been selected in the
data transformation list in the table
for both call
I review and accept the balance of the
information in the table and then click
Next the review page is displayed I see
that the error rows are displayed in the
rows to be inserted table I click Next
the summary page is displayed I review
the actions performed and note that my
records were successfully processed i
click ok now that I've corrected the
data in the May revenue table in the
database I can create a meaningful model
of the data to accurately reflect how I
and others ask our business questions
