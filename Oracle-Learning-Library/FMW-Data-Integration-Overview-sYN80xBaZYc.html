welcome my name is Steve Friedberg I am
a course developer in the data
integration curriculum first we will
discuss data integration terms and
concepts then there are two main
products in the data integration family
Oracle data integrator ODI and
GoldenGate
both of them have dedicated validation
software let's start by talking about
the terms and concepts suppose you run a
trucking company and you have a fleet of
vehicles even though they are different
kinds of vehicles they all have some
number of wheels some number of Pistons
some payload capacity some number of
miles on them and so on you store that
information in the read table in a
database tables look like a spreadsheet
with rows and columns suppose you also
have employees some of them are drivers
some are secretaries some are managers
but they all have names addresses phone
numbers dates of hire and so on you
store that information in the blue table
in a database your company just acquired
another company the purple company they
also have employees the purple people
and they also have names addresses and
phone numbers for political reasons you
cannot close down the purple computer
Center just yet but you need to have a
central database of all the employees
both blue and purple so all three tables
the two source and the one target will
all be the same kind of tables but will
have different data if you combine the
blue employees table with the purple
employees table you can create a data
warehouse of the total employees what
data integration can do is take the two
source tables and create one big
combined one now that we've covered some
basic terms and concepts let's look at
some Oracle products that do data
integration for you first we will talk
about Oracle data integrator ODI you may
find this Product installed in a data
warehouse that is a location of several
databases so we wanted to combine the
blue and purple source tables into one
big target table
how often does this merge copy
synchronization take place when a new
purple person shows up on the left when
does a copy of them show up on the right
it could be almost instantly second or
subsequent or maybe it refreshes every
hour or maybe only at midnight or over
the weekends there is a trade-off of lag
the delay between source and target
synchronization and cost where costs
could be either disk space or processing
power less lag is more cost longer lag
is cheaper Oracle data integrator ODI
facilitates copying and merging data
from many vendors database tables and
flat files generally ODI runs on a
scheduled basis rather than on an
instantaneous basis often it is helpful
to take the information that may be
slightly different and make the format
the same for example the blue people
table has separate columns for first
name and last name shown in yellow but
you want the two name columns appended
together into a full name single column
for the combines table similarly the
purple people table has names in mixed
case shown in green but the post office
wants the names all in uppercase data
integration can do that kind of data
transformation while it is updating the
data warehouse back to the main purpose
of your company you have vehicles stored
in the red table what you want to do is
to associate each possible driver with
their vehicles but the driver to vehicle
relationship is not one-to-one
rather it is many-to-many that is each
driver has driven a few vehicles a few
drivers have driven all the vehicles and
all the vehicles have been driven by at
least one person so the goal is to join
the two dissimilar source tables with
the driver vehicle relationship in a new
big target table this may seem to be
inefficient since the driver information
is stored multiple times but it may be
cheaper
that is faster to pay for data storage
than to pay for data processing time
keep your eye on this one driver number
10
the fancy name for this kind of table
design is denormalized note that a given
single driver for example employee
number 10 shown in purple may be
repeated for vehicle 1 2 3 5 and so on
this is very common in data warehouses
now that we've covered Oracle data
integrator let's look at the other main
product Oracle GoldenGate using software
such as Oracle GoldenGate you can
maintain 2 copies of the same table both
east and west are being kept in sync
with each other a worker is inserted
into the West copy the guy in the hard
hat with the tool box and almost
immediately a copy is replicated to the
east table a lab tech is deleted from
the East copy the guy in the white lab
coat and almost immediately a copy is
deleted from the West table a middle
manager is updated in the West copy the
blue suit with the briefcase and almost
immediately the copy is updated in the
east table what gets interesting is when
the synchronization gets interrupted
suppose the communication lines go down
and the two copies temporarily cannot
remain in sync now suppose the middle
manager does something horrible and the
west president demotes him back to his
blue suit itself the east president
hears about it and thinks that this was
to light a punishment and fires the guy
now when the communication lines are
restored the commands to update the
status to demote the middle manager goes
from west to east but there's no manager
left to update this is called conflict
detection the resolution depends on the
business rules does the East president
always Trump the West president or does
whoever made the last decision win you
can configure the behavior in this
situation now that we've covered the two
main products each one of them has its
own software to do validation what is
validation for data integration
validation is comparing two tables if
you are trying to maintain copies of
data
ables it's important to know that the
copies are identical the top blue table
is the source the bottom red table is
your attempt at a copy what could
possibly go wrong
keep your eye on the last row that is
where the bad things will happen for
instance you could get a duplicate row
Abe Lincoln ended up being copied twice
you could get an inserted row in the
target not sure where Ben Franklin might
have come from you could be missing a
row from the target what happened to
poor Betsy a row could be shifted this
often happens with importing from a
column delimited file and the start-stop
columns are off by one or two you could
get one or more corrupted fields you can
validate the level of synchronization
between any pair of tables using one of
two tools Oracle data integrator ODI
uses oracle enterprise data quality
running on top of WebLogic server or
Oracle GoldenGate uses Oracle GoldenGate
very data which does not require any
additional software we have discussed
data integration terms and concepts we
saw the two main products in the data
integration family ODI and Golden Gate
both of them have dedicated validation
software thank you for your time you can
