determine and predict the future usage
demands on the power network has become
a major requirement this ensures that
the power generation companies can
increase energy production before any
surging increases to avoid potential
outages in this use case scenario the
assumption is that in every apartment
and house there are smart plugs which
monitor and send the current wattage
usage as streaming data to the Oracle
stream analytics platform
the shape of the streaming data is shown
here in this case beneficial properties
relate to the usage values and as we are
only interested in the load measurements
we will filter out the work related
values during processing the remaining
shape properties relate to the unique
identifiers of the plant and the house
so in summary the goal of this
demonstration used an available sample
simulation data is to make a load
forecast based on the current load
measurement and a model that was learned
over time and then predict the load for
each house based on the real-time moving
average load and a load prediction model
built from historical load consumption
data
as timestamp of data is provided the
Oracle stream analytics pipeline
application will post this information
over six hour segments and then provide
a prediction for the future plus two
segments
here we have the Oracle stream analytics
catalog with some predefined connection
artifacts for the Kafka messaging layer
and for the Oracle database so let's
start the simulation data which relates
to a period around August of 2013
we can now define the SmartPlug stream
with its message payload being inferred
from the streaming data
and next we create the database
reference for the historical prediction
model
okay artifacts created and finished
let's create the pipeline application
we provide the name of the load
prediction pipeline and associate the
required stream
output stream arrives on the canvas from
the various small plugs
a next query stage will cleanse the
streaming data
using the analytical power of stream
analytics we can easily filter out
unwanted measurement information and use
only load related data we can refine the
stream column names and add new columns
to reflect on the time slice ID analysis
using a new expression builder formula
our next query stage will compute the
moving average load for each house by
time slice
using the summaries features we
calculate the continuous moving average
load grouping by the slice and house IDs
next we use another query stage for the
load prediction for each house
here we can join with our prediction
database reference using the slice and
house IDs which provides the historical
median for each of these time slices and
houses
now using the expression builder a new
column can be created where we can build
the new prediction algorithm using the
moving average load and the historical
median
we also add a new column for the time
slice plus two value which is the time
that this prediction is applicable
now let's clean up the output stream
finally let us create an interesting
visualization over this optimized
streaming data remembering to save the
visualization slice for later usage
bar chart will represent the house
average versus the predicted load
now that the pipeline application has
been created we can create a new
operational dashboard artifact to view
the created information
before we finish our dashboard the
pipeline application needs to be
published to send the data continuously
to the required visualization target
you
now we can add the defined visualization
slice to the dashboard for easy viewing
you
more pipeline applications can be
subsequently created using this
utilities data with new enhanced
dashboard charts so there we have it a
new created powerful utilities load
prediction perspective solution from
streaming analyzed data related to
relevant house smart plugs which
provides a valuable load monitoring and
action management experience not in days
or months but in minutes
