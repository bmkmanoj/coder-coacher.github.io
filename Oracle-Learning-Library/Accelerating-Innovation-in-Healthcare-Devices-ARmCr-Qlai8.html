health care today and the different
pieces of the puzzle as far as how
things can connect together for
machine-to-machine connectivity in
health care using embedded systems and
what's referred to as Internet of Things
to my name's Steve Popovich I've been in
the connectivity business for over 30
years originally that I think the first
harrell healthcare project that I worked
on was back when IBM mainframes were
typically in hospitals we were using by
sick and sna networks to be able to
interconnect with the different medical
devices to automatically upload data to
two systems that dates back quite of
ways and quite a time ago as far as a
summary for today I was going to discuss
so this is kind of a high-level business
discussion not so much the technical
side but if we have time since we have a
small group we can we can dive into some
Q&amp;amp;A after the presentation is over
what's driving the business need as far
as automating accelerated the innovation
of healthcare the business questions the
key business questions as far as being
able to build these kinds of solutions
some of the building blocks as far as
the hardware the software the service
side to be able to to build a product
leveraging the internet of things in
healthcare and my favorite part is
changing people's lives because this is
a part of the market of the connectivity
world that literally is a game changer
as far as the healthcare system health
care system especially here in the US is
very backwards as far as connectivity
technology implementations and some of
that is is really the government
regulation things that will talk about
the minute but tremendous opportunities
for business to really make a difference
in people's lives so what's driving the
business need why is this important to
everybody one basic metric here is that
we can't afford to have health care
continue to accelerate as far as a
percentage of percentage of gbg p for
the United States of America so right
now we're a bad roughly roughly eighteen
percent as of 2010
and according to the GAO the the the
government they think that might might
peek out the twenty percent type of
paper aims so one yeah he's shaking your
head you get this is this is I like to
use a slide because we can't can't
afford not to fix this it's one of these
things that will healthcare will
literally kill it kill our economy if we
don't if we don't take some action here
so some of the factors that are driving
up health care costs of the population
demographics very simple simple math the
population is getting older and as the
population gets older there's more and
more long-term chronic illness care
according the CDC one of their research
reports that they had last couple of
years they were estimating and this is
debatable but if you think about a
little bit it could be true depend upon
how they collected their information
that seventy five percent of their costs
healthcare across the United States were
related to a chronic illness care so
with the again with the compounding
problem of the age which drives the
chronic illness side of it you know
that's it that's that's the big the
biggest problem as far as the pie goes
the other side side side effect of
technology implementation is a lot of
different specialties especially in
health care with medical devices and
procedures is that we have more and more
advanced treatments which also a lot of
cases drives up costs to be able to pay
for those investments in those those
treatments of course dramatically can
change improve the quality of life if
you look at hip replacements and knee
replacement this is a really common
place these days but they are very
expensive especially on the the post
operation support for more for those
patients we have been longer term longer
term care so regulatory factors our
federal government is you know when they
say they're here to help you know the
challenge so you have you have FDA
guidelines of course which are still
struggling with a number of the
different
to expanding markets as far as health
care goes you've got a home healthcare
applications that are growing every
direction FDA is trying to figure out
how to regulate those those kinds of
ecosystems the medical device markets to
be able to take a product that might
have been traditionally used in a
hospital being able to migrate that into
a home environment or maybe a lower cost
long-term care facility which is another
part part of the CMS the CMS is
direction to be able to keep people out
of traditional hospitals that's that the
FDA slowing down those processes to
performance metrics whether or not
Obamacare goes and goes in the plan part
of that Obamacare is to be able to
basically penalize care facilities that
are not doing a good job a quality job
which I think it's actually one of my
favorite parts of of the broader program
because health care doesn't work like
any other industry I can think of if you
you know if you don't build a good
product people will continue to buy your
product you usually go out of business
whether it's quickly or takes a longer
period of time if it upon out now pour
the products happen to be in health care
it's not like that so in the way that a
hospital finances work they're very low
margin type business high high dollar
low margin businesses so being able to
penalize some of the lower performing
facilities or sections in those
facilities for procedures is a great way
to either kind of fix up their act or
they they do they do go to business so I
think the Mardi average profit for a
hospital United States is roughly about
four percent or so pre-tax profit so to
be able to also provide information
useful feedback information about effect
of this not just for the regulation side
the metric side for regulation but also
for care providers to be able to reward
and and to innovate some of the
procedures and get feedback more
real-time feedback
these are going to require very large
databases to be able to kind of the
ultimate Big Data challenge that is an
opportunity for Oracle for oracle 11
oracle to 112 type type of technology so
the because you have to think about in
the future the near future there will be
millions of devices that are going to be
in healthcare in a space all of them
generating information and sometimes
sometimes in a tremendous amounts of
feedback and short periods of time so as
far as another angle as far as the
healthcare ecosystem especially for
Hospital type type of in customers
reducing the cost of ownership is a big
issue so you have more and more complex
technologies products like let's say an
infusion pump for example you walk in an
infusion into a hospital they'll only
buy one type of infusion pump because
the training costs and their liability
issues for those infusion pumps are so
high that they they have to keep
everybody focused on program the program
and programming techniques from one
device to keep it keep it minimize the
complexity so patient safety is a big
issue real-time alarms to be able to
have information that me how many times
you've been in the hospital where alarms
are going off all over the place we
unfortunately a lot of case of the alarm
systems for patients because there's so
many of them they're not connected up
and there's no contextual data that's
being fed back to the nursing stations
it's it sounds like a panic palace and
some of these hospital ward air is
secure remote connectivity is a big
issue especially for off-site type type
connectivity hospitals we talked to
hospital network security people they
have their networks very well lockdown
but the next stage of healthcare is to
be able to keep people out of hospitals
but the hospital's want to be able to to
have those patients as customers so it's
one of these things whether they're
reach their extension of
of their influence needs to go even down
to the home type of type level for a lot
of different kinds of services and some
of this has been happening for for a few
years now you take a look at I talked to
a person a couple of days ago that has a
child that has an insulin pump and
insulin pumps right now one of the one
of the projects were working i was
actually I'm cellular connectivity to
insulin pumps to be able to collect
information back because you want to be
able to track that information for
example from a care provider but also
you want to be able to to provide local
feedback maybe for the actual patient
the son or daughter as well as the maybe
the the father or mother of the that
patient they may not be in the same
place all time realistically so to be
able to have secure connectivity for
these kinds of systems from a lot of
different angles is really going to is
really key so security is a big issue
proactive service again I'm going to
take a look at an insulin pump or
feeding pump if the thing jams you can't
get fed or an insulin pump fails the
typical scenario right now is that the
tech support person gets called from the
manufacturer and they try to walk you
through a number of different questions
over the phone and then you swap it out
so then you have a you know a day or so
for example where we don't have a batul
anymore so being able to have pro active
service in a lot of cases with the these
machine-to-machine connectivity
solutions that I work on before that we
know that there's a problem with a
product before the patient knows there's
a product with an issue and some of them
are scenarios that can be rectified
remotely in cooperation with the patient
of course but you don't have to do the
swap it eliminates the swap and a lot of
the text of the tech support call it
basically be you know is usually a call
to talk to the patient and tell them
that they are working on trying to
resolve a problem with your device
and that you know that they'll
communicate back whatever their whatever
the resolution happens to be to replace
in order it's it's been goosed the
problems been corrected supply chain
monitoring as big as a big other issue
as far as a lot of these different
especially home type devices talk about
a little bit later about the business
models for the some of these devices
some of these devices a lot of them are
razor razor blade type type
opportunities where they make more money
on supply chain than they do on the
actual device software updates one of my
customers and I'm working with they have
an installed base of about it's prob
about 80,000 devices they sell these
devices for institutions as well as a
few for the home market it's a growing
biggest growing part of their business
but software updates right now or return
to their distributor and ultimately the
factory for it for updates today the
future devices that we're working with
them on next generation devices all will
all be managed remotely so all updates
are basically be done at the convenience
of the manufacturer and the users
coordinated that coordinated together
intuitive user interfaces reduces
training a lot for almost every device
you have a device that may have been
built for institutional type application
years ago be able to take that into a
whole market as an extreme example the
interfaces need to be with have on their
interfaces need to be as simple to use
as possible to have touchscreens and
it's very similar as far as your your
your smartphone type of a type of an
application the you know another angle
as far as it as far as reducing costs to
ownership is the the care provider
efficiency so one of the other side
benefits that we get as far as feedback
from our customers is that they can
focus on patients that really need the
focus the attention from the health care
providers and the ratios of these
patients and health care providers is
always being stretched so to be able to
provide more useful information
from the machine to machine connectivity
type type architecture allows allows
patients to be baseline for example so
you know that for example one of our
customers they do fall prevention
technologies so we'll have like a XXX
accelerometer device that watches the
patient but each buddy everybody has a
different walk get walking gait so the
medication changes and they become
dehydrated they're they're walking gait
will change and they can take a tech
give attention to that particular
patient in their facility to get them
rehydrated or whatever the other
corrective action happens to be smart
applications one of the other great side
benefits of this is to be able to bring
multiple device manufacturers together
so they provide a much stronger
application opportunity it's you know
simple things simple examples of this
would be being able to take really basic
devices like a digital scale or a blood
pressure monitor or a glucose meter for
example our pulse oximeter and you'd be
surprised how many different
applications you have for for chronic
illnesses now becomes a common
denominator for a lot of different
applications but to be able to have
patient contacts with that in baselining
brings just another level of care an
opportunity for care that doesn't exist
today ok something stopped working I'm
stuck
just read this okay so the key business
questions for these kinds of products
these kinds of solutions the first
question of the business sighs what's
the revenue model because this is a
question that that is changing in the
past it would be a simple one time sale
with very little extra revenue
opportunity it was servicing the product
was was not a big part of these the
typical medical device business that's
changed a lot because the life
expectancy for these devices is usually
in the five to 10-year tenure type range
more more common in today's market would
be the sale with ongoing service support
but a lot of these products now are
almost not given away but they're the
real opportunity for revenue and
profitability is the more the razor
razor blade type type of a situation
which that that kind of a revenue model
is really a great fit for a machine to
machine type of application because we
could monitor for example when the
machine needs to be fixed or what it
needs that the tubing needs to be
changed for the patient switch or is a
device available and things of that
nature so follow opportunities that
medical device manufacturers are just
starting to penetrate our application
software to be able to provide more
stickiness for their customers and their
customers are typically the hospital
networks in the future the insurance
companies are also very big influences
in this so some of the machine to
machine benefits for connectivity I
listed two here and these apply did not
just medical devices we really a
a number of different devices in some
cases it could be as simple as a
streetlight down the street but the
device and these devices can be very
small this when I put in the pictures
that quite quite big so it would be
typically found in a hospital it's kind
of a device but does it is it is a
device healthy for example it sounds
kind of ironic but it's a medical device
really working properly is help required
as far as a part replacement or supply
chain fix or it could be just clean the
device for the next patient where is a
device location tracking you talk to
CFOs and hospitals one of the big issues
they have is they don't know for example
how many infusion pumps they really need
so in most cases what happens is they
tend to over by on different different
products or they're not cycling the
products and with like an infusion pump
is an example and add the tubing has to
be swapped out for each pace and change
so maybe the device they know where it
is but it's not available for use for
for a new patient that might have just
come out of the ER something it all
comes down to you know are we making
money how do we turn those devices to
maximize their their ROI for those for
those kinds of devices so who are the
data stakeholders that want to be able
to get some of this machine to machine
data so you have a local care provider
which is an obvious obvious choice but
you also have a lot of more complex type
of scenarios and hospitals in sometimes
to be able to collaborate with smaller
hospitals or clinics to be able to do
collaborations so you may have a local
physician to remote physician for
different specialist in different
specialists that are that are in
collaboration to be able to bring all
that to medical device data in pretty
close to real time to
the multiple recipients is a big
opportunity and in the one of the other
demographic ships ships is happening
with the doctors themselves in
healthcare as a shortage of doctors you
know and a lot of these specialists what
they're with what this technology is
enabling to do is actually work as they
want where they want so one of the I was
up in Missouri and lake table rock lake
area early in the summer I was talking
with one physician that retired and so
with with telepresence and with
machine-to-machine connectivity
solutions he expects to be able to
continue to work as he wants won't you
know a few days a week typically for
many years to come even though it's
beyond retirement age right now supplies
management is really a big deal as far
as the ROI side again there's a lot of
razor razor blade opportunities in
healthcare you know plastic tubing
doesn't look real expensive but it's
expensive and you know things like
thermometers covers for thermometer
probes it may be a couple cents here a
couple cents there but when you add up
millions of units per year just for the
United States it's it's a significant
business so to be able to understand the
use of those devices and to predict
supply chain management early a key
element patient family members and we
were talking about a minute ago insulin
pumps and to be able to have the shared
of information for family members and
know that my son has been fed for
example with his portable feeding pump
at his high school is a big deal it's a
really really big deal so being able to
have within these mm structures some
simple messaging systems to be able to
send information to multiple recipients
the secured fashion is it's a
game-changer they there's never been a
way that they could do that before
insurance carriers are getting more and
more involved with home health care type
applications to be able to reduce costs
especially for long term care patients
that again you know between the CMS and
the private insurers they want to be
able to
mine's their hospital stay times call
centers are popping up kind of out of
the woodwork on you know for this part
of the ecosystems health care ecosystem
because what they're doing now with a co
accredited care organizations across the
u.s. is you have lower costs call
centers that are being able to take
volumes of calls and everything from a
pers device / suffice as a personal
emergency response type of a button that
people have for example my mom's got one
she lives up the mountains and the idea
there is that you push the button when
you need help and that somebody responds
in a lot of cases what happens is the
response you know especially for
previous generation solutions that we
tend to tend to get opportunities to
replace our 911 calls our response so
it's the most expensive way to be able
to rectify an issue because you're
always sending out the paramedics or
whatever to see if grandma fell or if
she's really you know she needs to be
taken to the doctor because of liability
issues of course the big issue is in
most cases they take them to the
hospital so the costs spiral out of
control so with call centers that we're
working with what happens is that these
call centers have interfaces with a co
organizations hospitals that have the
healthcare records and they're basically
quickly determining what their what the
appropriate response is rather than do a
911 call and repo as far as this market
size for remote patient monitoring this
is a Jupiter research is one of the
research organizations that kind of gave
a splattering of information from one of
their research reports I didn't purchase
a report but gives you an idea of kind
of you know the general size into this
kind of a market segment so remote
patient monitoring in 2009 and 300 plus
million dollars growing globally and
this is of course that one's one's a US
number on the other ones a global number
to 1.9 billion in 2014 you know roughly
in the US market for a lot of different
markets you can you know swag it as you
know half the markets here in the US and
the rest of the rest of the world's the
other half of the
market even with that kind of a swag
that you can see some of the growth
opportunities here they predicted that
over 3 million patients will be using
remote patient monitoring by 2016 that's
not I don't look at that as a big
stretch you've got I was meeting with
some people at the VA last summer a few
months ago now and they think they have
over 500 people 500,000 people there to
diabetic and you've got PTSD patients
and it adds up really quickly so the
lead lead applications for remote
monitoring or cardiac care and which is
long term diabetic care and COPD type
care those are the three Biggie's
according to the CDC security issues if
we talked about briefly before is HIPAA
that came up in 1996 this is basically
to make sure the patient data doesn't
with with medical data doesn't fall into
the wrong hands a lot of the
applications that we work on we're
simply pushing data from the machines
and the patient data is married up at
the at the end point for the
applications so from a HIPAA perspective
that it's a it's a it's a cleaner
cleaner approach PCI compliance in the
retail industry is actually going down
the same path where instead of having
the point of sale system connected up to
your credit card reader that that data
from the credit card reader goes
directly into a cloud network and then
gets married up with the point of sale
data and then the transaction is
completed basic on the backend of these
systems so we're kind of following that
same kind of a track network security of
course having these having connectivity
the challenges to be able to make sure
that your network uptime is maximized
and that the threats outside threats are
prevented the device security there's
been a lot of horror stories and
articles come up from time to time about
some medical device a critical care
medical device that's been broken into
like your cell phone or whatever this is
going to be an ongoing battle just like
it is for the computer business and you
know becoming more and more of an issue
for the cell phone providers so it's
another opportunity as far as using more
robust operating systems in the middle
east part
bucks for these products scalability is
another big business question that has
to be asked a lot of medical
applications I get involved with they're
not always huge volumes because there's
a lot of specialty applications that are
built lots of different startups and
smaller companies that eventually you
get but by bigger health care
multi-billion dollar healthcare
companies it's kind of the seams a way
that that that part of the ecosystem
kind of folds into place the challenges
are really when you are not necessarily
the prototyping stage we may only have
50 devices out out in the field but if
your plan is to build let's say a device
that like like an insulin pump for
example it's a very large market
opportunity and even way beyond the
10,000 10,000 unit data point on there
the pain is excessive as far as bringing
all that data together and then you to
be able to to parse that data out to
multiple multiple stakeholders is a very
complex complex challenge as far as
scalability and connectivity platform
people talk about you know servers and
the clouds you know all the time there's
different kinds of data characteristics
for different kinds of medical devices
so generally most of the medical devices
are very low amounts of data you get
into imaging very different kind of a
model because on the other extreme so
one of the projects I'm working on is
actually imaging so it's basically if
you think of like a camera type
technology each message for that
application is very very big but most of
the applications you take information
from a from a glucose meter for example
which is a common common common device
is only a few bytes long so with when
you build an architect that back-end
solution for your connectivity platform
or cloud connectivity clouds sometimes
it's called you want to be able to to
literally have millions of devices out
it can support that that environment so
my company kind of learned this with the
energy market about six seven years ago
now because a lot of a lot of power
meters out there they're network-enabled
today so we we actually have customers
that have tens of thousands of gateways
that service each each gateway in theory
can service hundreds of homes individual
homes to be able to do thermostat
control isn't as an example but we tune
this kind of an architecture to be able
to handle that kind of scalability for
that and a lot of other different
vertical segments for our machine to
machine connectivity business one of the
challenges I run into as far as with on
the business side with with these kinds
of devices is a number of companies they
believe they have to kind of basically
reinvent the wheel so it's okay it's
kind of a big frustration but to be able
to accelerate these the time to market
for these devices to be able to minimize
risk issues and risk issues coming from
a business side as far as as far as when
am I going to have it available for
revenue type type of questions is why
not use a lot of off-the-shelf
components or services so for example we
got involved with building a
connectivity platform we call IDG many
years ago one of the challenges our
customers had was that their time to
market because they wanted to build
themselves in some cases because it
wasn't commonly available six seven
years ago they found out that to be in
order to be able to build a rock solid
solution it was it was but you know it
was very expensive tens of millions of
dollars to be able to get to where we
are today so rather than reinvent the
wheel the the opportunity kind of came
upon itself to to be able to amortize
the investment from from our business to
be able to provide a rock-solid scalable
solution so you want to be able to share
those kinds of things rather than
reinvent them
the pros and cons of using open
standards the medical industry came with
basically came for the proprietary world
they're now getting involved with some
sua standards and there's there are a
few I Tripoli standards out there but
it's still the Wild West as far as
what's happening here but fewer and
fewer of the projects that I get
involved with are what i would call
proprietary going forward more and more
open because of the cost to support
these solutions and the scalability of
these solutions as well as well also as
far as risk factors on getting the
market with it with a solid product so
the real big benefits here or to be able
to get to market quickly can you be cost
competitive and retain its ally der ship
position then the answer short answer is
yes the cost of a lot of these
off-the-shelf solutions are very
competitive he advertises the cost of
reinventing the wheel and foremost these
kinds of scenarios you just can't
justify it then the time to market kills
you so what happens with a number of our
more innovative customers is that it's a
matter if I'm going to take those
resources minimize my in-house expertise
except for what I need is my core
competency so it's really going back to
that that that kind of thinking so as
far as the common building blocks for
these next generation medical devices we
use Legos you're actually internally
within our engineering group we we
always called Legos because the idea
here is to elegantly fit together
different pieces of the puzzle so the
first piece is the medical of the
medical device of the processor type
module so there's a number of companies
including ours and build processor
modules that are essentially very
high-performance type platforms that
have built in an integrated different
kinds of i/o
connectivity solutions and then dry and
then being able to I've already poured
it over different operating systems like
Java to provide security and portability
in long-term support enhancements for
the for these kinds of solutions so we
do customized solutions we also have a
full line of solutions that are
basically plug-and-play type scenarios
and they support a number of different
kinds of applications they're all long
long life availability type type of
options as well which is a big issue
with the with the health care medical
device market segments I have customers
that that one of one of which I spent a
week with earlier this year the first
time they bought digi product was about
nineteen ninety seven and they'll
continue to build that solution with the
same product for another three more
years at least I mean that's when we've
given up as far as as far as a cut off
right now so that's a comment that's
that's one of the one of the ways where
digi's become a great value proposition
for medical device manufacturers that
long life the connectivity options on
these kinds of solutions lots of
different types of options available
usually there's wired and wireless
interfaces and these kinds of products
the so one of the one of the challenges
is that especially for larger medical
device manufacturers that are typically
byproducts of a lot of acquisitions is
getting these connectivity options
really narrowed down so the common ones
these days are USB connectivity for
local connectivity and then for
determining if your use cases are local
connectivity or wide area type
connectivity cellular is becoming a
bigger and bigger part of the pie
because the cost of the cellular radios
and the modularity of the radios because
you don't really have to be as much of
an RF expert in the business if you buy
a module drop it into an existing plath
a new platform design is the design risk
or minimizing the cost to market are
pretty low then how much data you need
how much bandwidth you need like was
mentioned the imaging applications you
know and the one I'm thinking of
basically is a Meg / / connection for
message whereas a lot of the other
devices that we deal with it's very very
low amount of data do you need device
about device connectivity what does that
mean so we have what's referred to as
mesh networking technologies were
instead of having to have a gateway or
aggregator take the messages we can
actually have a safety device for a
let's say a pump like an insulin pump or
some other device that can hurt a
patient as well as help a patient if
something goes wrong to be able to act
us fail-safes to to minimize patient
risks and then one is my use case look
like because that's one of the other
things that sometimes sometimes is is
there's multiple use cases for these
medical devices like the home or
traditional care hospitals or a
long-term nursing facility as far as
making the pieces of the puzzle fit
together generally we've got is you've
got a medical device there's always a
processor module sometimes there's a
separate processor module for the
communication port part of the device
because of design risk issues the cost
of processor models are pretty pretty
pretty low these days connectivity and
adapters and these are typically more
and more radio type type products
Wireless type products and then an
aggregation or gateway type device and
sometimes these gateway type devices can
also have intelligence built into them
so in a lot of a lot of environments
like a take an example of assisted care
living type environment in addition to
having sophisticated medical devices you
may also have very simple devices you
may have monitoring for example one
application of involved with
if we put a temperature humidity sensor
into the bathroom have determined for
example if the the elderly person is is
taking a bath or a shower and what what
and what what type of intervals turning
lights on and off checking temperature
humidity inside the inside the the
environment where they're living because
if you have somebody living at home for
example which is the general idea for
lies assisted living home health care
applications to be able to keep people
at home longer goes lower costs and is a
better quality of life typically for for
the individuals is to be able to take
all that data and to be able to put it
in context because you may have a
situation where you have a body monitor
and the body temperature is increasing
but the problem is is somebody turned
off the air conditioner or they turned
up the heat really high or whatever so
you can actually see those kinds of
things with these kinds of connectivity
solutions out there and you and you can
have it also set up so the Python
engines can can take action locally if
the remote connection connect connection
happens to fail for whatever reason or
you can design it so that that's the way
that the architecture works then then
you have a classically a connectivity
platform that brings together literally
millions of devices back to an
application server or a cloud with a
number of application servers and these
applications can actually be multiple
applications running a different types
of environment so you may have again you
may have a cloud environment that's for
the the accredited care organization the
hospital you may have it also for the
call center part of that data for the
call center to be able to collect
collect patient data and pretty much in
real time this is an example we have on
demonstration in the Oracle booth here
at the at the Java one conference what
this is is essentially it's like a Swiss
Army knife or gateways so it has all
these really cool wireless technologies
in here so you have Ziggy technology to
do the mesh networking the solution I
was referring to there and that that
kind of technology is really a great
technology for sensor networks as well
so it's low cost radio low power
consumption and the bandwidth is
relatively low it's looking us about
90,000 bytes for a smaller smaller type
network environment and then you've got
Bluetooth connectivity which is very
popular for a lot of low cost especially
home health consumer health type of
devices preventative devices pulse
oximeters for example would be a good
example Wi-Fi connectivity you know
again that's it's been popular in the
past there's lower and lower power
requirements for Wi-Fi type chipsets
these days now we have a lot of
applications that are typically Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth so you have a big mesh
network with lots of sensors and you can
use Wi-Fi to back all the data if you
don't have a broadband connection the
near field communications for patient
identification is it is a great use case
for that kind of a solution and then the
other one is not on here is would be the
a lot of cellular connectivity because
the cost points for the cellular service
of reoccurring costs are very low these
days it's probably half would have would
have been a 18 months ago for the
projects that we work on so the carriers
are all very aggressively pursuing the
the healthcare sector and they look at
home health care as I've been an
opportunity huge opportunity for them so
this is demone in the the oracle boo
think it's 5605 as far as leveraging the
internet of things changing people's
lives what's happening here with these
kinds of devices that we're broadening
the applications things were including
multiple medical devices from not just
one manufacturer which has been the
challenge in the past for being able to
spark this innovative in an innovative
cycle for healthcare devices and we're
increasing the patient's quality of life
in lots of different ways so
with these we have all kinds of
differently cool patient stories but
some of the simpler ones are things 11 i
want one customer that we've got that
actually going back to the fall
prevention technology because falls are
a big challenge for long-term elderly
care because the quality of life goes
way down in the medical costs go way up
if you have for example if you have a
broken hip in the life expectancy in
some research systems search pieces i've
seen as little as six months after after
that kind of an incident if it's not
it's not repairable so to be able to
take somebody that had a hip replacement
and allow them to go home earlier is
better quality of life but it's also
much lower cost for the whoever the
insurance company has to be you know
what it's medicare paid or its private
pay so in those cases the doctors get
more feedback as far as what's happening
with the rehabilitation cycle of the
patient which also minimizes some of the
risk liability for from you know from
the care providers from especially the
ACOs with the new models going for
business models going forward so it also
allows the care professional be more
responsive the deviations of baseline is
now we can build baselines we have all
those data so you know I walk this way I
get up for example one of the other use
cases is to be able to characterize you
know what time do I get up in the morn
we're all kind of creatures of habit and
the more you know we collect data for a
few weeks and all of a sudden the care
provider says oh well Steve you know why
are you getting up you know an hour
later or yesterday and today so they can
they can be more responsive to those
kinds of things or you know how many
times is use the restroom last night
what did you have to get up six times
there's probably some issue there maybe
we should check you out and see if
you've got a you know you have a flu
issue or whatever the case may be and
the way this works now without
technology is it really because the
ratios are high in the in these
organizations for care providers to the
patients or residences is that you wait
for somebody ask for help and
they ask for help when things are really
bad it's kind of like the issue with
people to go into the ER versus just
going to a doc in the box or something
for for a minor problem that becomes a
major problem so there's a lot of
winners in this kind of it's kind of a
paradigm shift the sensor networks that
i'm referring to or lower and lower
costs here so is more and more of them
in typical applications you know a lot
of these things are very simple but you
think about you know somebody gets up
late at night they don't turn a light on
they fall you know where you can turn on
a light automatically as simple as that
and in him to be able to provide
information back if there's if there's
an issue if there is a fall like the the
the walking the fall prevention
technology those referring to also will
of course report back immediately if
there is a fall so they can characterize
impacts and things of that nature to be
able to to prioritize a response the
patient context contextual data again
this is a really new thing I got
involved with the first one about 10
years ago now but that was really really
on the cutting edge it was with preemie
babies university of florida gainesville
where they wanted to essentially
increase the survival rate of preemie
babies so what they were doing by
collecting data from many different
medical devices in the in that area of
the facility they were able to make
people that were new doctors very smart
and essentially make smart doctors even
smarter after they characterized these
patients so it's a another big site side
benefit for all almost all the
applications that we get involved with
health care devices benefit from from
that from that information and some of
it's also beneficial to the medical
device manufacturer themselves as far as
how to improve
the prot next generation products so as
far as the other the other benefits
being able to melt together different
kinds of medical devices and third
parties because the way I my crystal
ball looks on the on this part of the
ecosystem in health care is in the
future longer term future we will
probably have opportunities to be able
to have different kinds of care packages
so you may have somebody at the Mayo
Clinic that might be a specialist in hip
replacements or you may have somebody in
in another big high-profile facility
that is it has a specialty in another
area of caring for chronic illness and
you'll be able to actually be able to
select from from those kinds of things
with applications that are built by
these third parties sometimes in
partnership with the medical device
companies sometimes not all this data
really creates kind of what I what I
think of is the ultimate real big data
challenge an opportunity because in
addition to collecting the data and then
using the data for patient care there's
also a long-term business analytics
opportunity so that premium baby care
facility there are a lot of early
analytic type type applications that
were run on those different scenarios
have been make a smart doctor smarter
but you think about who who values that
information and you know you it's really
a long list of businesses as well as
other people that are indirectly or
directly part of the care network for
those patients so you take let's say a
drug company and they want to be able to
understand how a certain drug is
affecting you know a certain age group
as an example and you know one of the
typical challenges I mentioned earlier
is like how do you keep people hydrated
properly simple things are not that
complicated and you can characterize
those data sets to be able to show them
effectiveness of drugs maybe you cut the
dosages and a half and you find out
that's the same same kind of
Bennett benefit for the patients but the
cost now is lower things of that nature
so these datasets I don't see an end in
sight for the value for these things so
one of the big challenges is going on in
the healthcare world especially for
mobile health is going to be who owns
the data when the big challenges here so
and it's become quite a quite a kind of
web of challenges most of the projects I
work on it's it's simple the patient
really is owns the data or the care
provider and it's not a it's not it's
not currently being leased out to the
outside world but I see that changing
the next few years as these as the
available data increases dramatically
and it really it's happening every day
so as far as well what my company does
we build stuff like the processor
modules ago inside of health care
devices customized devices this is the
this is the this is the add part so
sorry about this but we do a lot of
connectivity aren't in business for 25
plus years we have a lot of expertise
that we've built organically and through
acquisitions for wireless connectivity
and we do terminus my service type
applications for custom designs and
complete integration for healthcare type
type applications that includes
management services connectivity
platforms to be able to scale out to
billions of devices it's quite a
sighting time in history for the
healthcare world I think we've got lots
of time so any questions we have a small
group yes sir so
quite a bit how many of these what
percentage of the systems you build
asian
it's the more majority of them there's a
lot of anything that has to do with with
a traditional medical device goes
through FDA type of approvals the FDA
salts are trying to get a handle on
gateway type devices and connectivity
platforms but they don't even know what
the dental plan yet so but I would you
know as far as a swag number it's
probably seventy percent or so it's my
guess that requires some FDA approval
now the other thing that you can do with
a 510 K files is you can you can
actually file addendums for some of
these things so it's not a complete new
filing for a medical device I read for
more sophisticated medical devices the
FDA approval cycle you know from
beginning till andas can be as much as
70 million dollars so it's one of those
things that you know it takes many years
for something a brand new type of a
device but a lot of these are derivative
devices and they still have local
control so it's not like everything's
remotely controlled all of a sudden this
is really it's the remote connectivity
becomes the big differentiator from the
previous generation product and it
enables a lot of these applications we
talked about today question
yeah that's a good question because one
of the recipients a lot of cases is the
patient themselves and especially with
the younger crowd is much more proactive
as far as a health world goes the older
the older geriatric care stuff that we
get involved with there's usually family
members that want to take that tape that
kind of position it's just nice to know
that you know grandma is doing okay
everything's fine and I'm going to see
her every Wednesday or whatever I don't
have to make us maybe a special trip
over to the to the facility but you know
the exception side to be able to take
that information and say you know
there's something wrong here and I'm
going to go and kind of get to the
bottom of it so many years ago my
grandmother was in a facility in
Southern California the challenge I had
as I had to have a really good rep
rapport with the guy that managed the
property they had about a hundred people
at the property it was really a nice
kind of an apartment converted apartment
type complex secure but they didn't have
any automation as far as knowing even
did she eat today you know and she lived
to be a little over 100 the guys in my
mind my family they go first the women
they're tough and so she lived to be a
little over a hundred and you know so
the challenge was is that you know after
after the late 90s as the memory goes
bad so you call her on the phone and I
live in Texas that live in Texas and my
brother lives nearby where she was which
was nice and if there's an issue you
know we just got a phone with the
manager and say well how's it you know
did you see her in the you know in the
in the dining room area today kind of
thing let me talk to so and so and sure
enough yeah she she was fed or you know
the procedure with most these facilities
and if they're not they don't check in
they get a meal brats there the rooms
and did she eat it well we're not sure
kind of things so for a lot of the
really more progressive applications
we're looking at stuff that's proactive
so everything from medication you know
compliance for medications a big issue
for especially chronic illness type
stuff people feel better they stop
taking the medication you want to know
that that happens or do they take it at
all or
my grandmother's case the challenge was
her memory was toward the end was really
bad so I'm sure she wasn't taking it
regularly and you know there's all kinds
of poor side effects if they don't take
it or they take too much so yeah this
feedback loops are really cool for this
for this part you know this business
other questions see one okay go ahead
you know I don't really know the answer
to that like you know I don't i think
it's a it's a great opportunity for java
going forward because of some of the
attributes of java you've got great
scalability in one of the challenges and
medical devices is that in the past the
way these devices are in part of us
because of the fda complications but you
get down to some some devices that
really don't fall into some of those
really more challenging regulations is
you can migrate this stuff across
different platforms and with the
semiconductor industry basically
building stuff cheaper faster and lower
power consumption the lower power
consumption is important because you get
more more mobility applications is that
it will be more and more in the end the
other challenge of course is that these
are all long-term devices so once you
get your certification you before you
know for a more sophisticated device is
it you know you can you know you because
of the portability it makes the the
lifecycle management I think much more
well it makes it more cost effective to
because like that application was
talking about were the first products
that we sold that company was back in
nineteen ninety seven of their they're
still have three more years left on that
on that design it's a blood analyzer
device so that device actually
determines for example when you use you
know high volumes of blood like for
blood banks to make sure that it's
there's no HIV issues there with the
blood for blood banks so for them to be
able to you know my great with those
kinds of architectures with proprietary
type of program
operating systems they couldn't do that
that's why they're kind of stuck so the
net cost for them and we had probably 30
30 to 40 people locked down for four
solid days to look at what the options
were because the the supply chain for
you saw blood analyzer it's that razor
razor blade business they have what they
call reagents so really the deal is that
they can't build you more products the
reagent pipeline starts to dry out
pretty quickly and that's a it's a very
large lucrative business for these blood
analyzer companies yes sir I did use
basically the the connectivity platform
that we have to bring together millions
of devices through the internet of
things so what it does as far as a value
proposition for a for a medical device
application let's say you take the
application for that demo that we're
doing let's say you've got four devices
attached there we actually manage all
this device make sure things working so
in a lot of cases with healthcare
there's there's there there are
regulations one called there's a ul
regular regulation that basically
dictates that you have to for a wireless
anything is Wireless you've got to be
able to make sure it's working every 15
seconds so with with our platform you
can do it a lot more frequently than
that but you can you know to say this
say something you have a battery device
or sensor you might want to minimize the
battery or maximize the battery life by
saying I'm going to stick to six you
know 60 60 1 or whatever the compliance
thing is for for that kind of a
regulation a lot of stuff is state
regulated believe it or not so you go to
the assisted living facility in North
Carolina and one in Texas they may they
may say well that we're not we're not
using that that's that that that
standard for you know for patient safety
but what the platform does is allows you
to do that allows you to do actually
software migration as well so if you had
a device it was an endpoint device that
was made by a medical manufacturer we
can actually push through updates for
the network
as well as for those end devices so from
a long term reducing a lot long-term
costs that's really another key element
there because you get to be thinking
about not just thousands of these things
got to be thinking about tens of
thousands or in some cases hundreds of
thousands of patients that are remotely
located yes sir I'm sorry I can barely
hear you our final customers they're
actually all over the map so we actually
have customers that are hospitals we
have probably products in roughly half
the hospital's United States was about
1500 official hospitals from the you
know that American Hospital Association
and when I spend a deep dive in this
three years ago I had somebody do some
research our customer database through
our OEMs private label customers and our
in our direct contacts and we have that
kind of touch with hospitals for one or
multiple products the we do a lot of OEM
stuff so customization so we have about
80 engineers that all they do is
customize type solutions a lot of us in
the healthcare space we're talking about
infusion pumps a little bit earlier to
be able to take some technology like a
working on one of the cellular
technology to be able to go directly to
the to the insulin pump I mean those
devices are you know about as small as a
smartphone as far as cubic inch yeah we
also have a lot of integrators
especially for the home health care
market what they're doing is they're
they're providing middleware software as
their value add or call centers are both
so we're doing is we're providing the
pieces of the puzzle and in some cases
the integration services to be able to
bring everything together because most
of these guys like one company i'm
thinking a really bright bunch of
doctors but their doctors that came out
of a very large healthcare organization
to because they saw i saw an opportunity
to be able to
make a difference for a long-term care
so they're basically you know dozens of
doctors positions that are covering
thousands of patients with this kind of
technology
a certification for the end products
it's usually with our customers yeah
what we do is we typically build
solutions that are compliant with the
regulations or the different
certifications that we can help our
customers get through some of those
things but in most cases that one of the
things that they want to own as a as a
intellectual property as a
certifications because if you do that
that's kind of a golden goose for them
so which one oh the n1 okay
Oh
we
yep it it's it's a it's a huge
investment as far as the manageability
services and the the interface the api's
are all HTML so you're going to build a
web page you can actually build an
application the management side I've
been mentioned earlier about just
knowing the network's work and the
devices are working you know that's
another key element but you know they
give you an example of the impact as far
as how you can accelerate different
types of projects I've got one customer
that's there there a top 10 medical
device manufacturer of the world and
they were able to prototype with our our
architecture basically what they're
using as our radios our gateways and our
connectivity platform our IDG stuff and
they were able to build a application in
a badness about eight days I think they
worked over the weekend on this thing to
be able to do an executive presentation
for their one of their one of their VPS
and but but the cool thing about it is
that it is it is a it's a real elegant
puzzle it's not just a tool so you could
do that we've done it with well as a
device out there from a and D a digital
scale out in the hallway for example so
we have customers that are using those
scales with art with our same solutions
but they only took days to develop at
least a prototype yes sir
okay all right all right we'll see me a
thank thank you thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
