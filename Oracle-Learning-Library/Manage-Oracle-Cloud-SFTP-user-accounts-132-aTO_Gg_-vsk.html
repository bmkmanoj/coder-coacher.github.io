SFTP user accounts you will learn how to
determine the host address port number
and username for the SFTP user accounts
and then we'll show you how to configure
the passwords for the SFTP user accounts
after you sign in to the my services
application the dashboard opens this
page lists all your active Oracle cloud
services in the current domain you must
be an identity domain administrator to
manage SFTP user accounts for this demo
let's look at the SFTP account
information for this Oracle cloud
database service click the service name
to open the details page for the service
scrolled page to view the additional
information section the domain SFTP host
and port and the domain SFTP user name
provide information about the identity
domain SFTP user account we only use
this account to archive your data when
you terminate a subscription disservice
SFTP host import and the service SFTP
user name provide information about the
SFTP user account for the selected
service for this example we selected the
database trial 7 502 database service we
use the service SFTP account to upload
and download files related to your
Oracle cloud services note that the user
name for the service SFTP account is Taz
underscore 2222 we need the username to
configure the password to configure the
password for an SFTP account click
security to open the security page and
then select the SFTP users tab this tab
lists the system defined SFTP user
accounts Oracle cloud automatically
creates one SFTP account for the
identity domain and one SFTP account for
each of your services in that domain
when Oracle cloud creates a SFTP
accounts it automatically assigns a
first name last name email and username
you cannot change these values you must
configure the password before you can
use an SFTP account to upload and
download files related to your Oracle
cloud service let's set the password for
the SFTP account associated with our
database service
remember when we viewed the information
on the service details page we noted
that the user name for the service SFTP
account was Taz underscore two two two
two you can scan the page or use search
to find SFTP account to search enter the
user name or some portion of that
username in the search box and click the
search icon click the menu icon and then
select reset password in the reset
password dialog box enter the new
password and then enter it again to
confirm when you are finished click Save
when the system prompts for confirmation
click Save again this message lets you
know the password was updated
while you are here on the SFTP users tab
you can reset the password for any SFTP
user account now that you configured the
password let's return to the details
page for our Oracle database cloud
service and review the SFTP information
scroll to the additional information
section these fields provide the SFTP
host address port number and username
you enter this information along with
the password you just configured
whenever you use an SFTP connection for
this service note that you can hover the
cursor over the field to view the entire
host address and port number you can
also select the information and then
right click to copy be sure to provide
the correct host address port number
username and password to any user who
needs to perform SFTP operations for the
service in summary to locate the SFTP
host address port number and username
for a service or an identity domain
