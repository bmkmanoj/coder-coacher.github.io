myself Gary Sharma we are we are going
to talk about some of the best practices
in enterprise Java monitoring I'm a
manager in capgemini based out of
Atlanta office and I actually lead a
sustainment team that looks after the
production and some other critical
environments my focus is a building a
monitoring framework that could ensure a
much higher up time for the business and
ensure a much stable system mogesh is
going to start and then then I'm going
to join him or yeah hi my name is
mangeshkar till if those on the back can
hear me just let me know I'll try to
pull you closer who I'm a senior manager
from capgemini I am part of the
enterprise architecture stream of North
America and worked with various clients
with some focus on enterprise monitoring
application development custom
development all the weeks and packaged
solutions you know in a delivery
capacity and also in a more consulting
capacity so I think what we're going to
generally talk about what what our
experiences in terms of what we have
seen its various clients in terms of
enterprise monitoring and 4 30 minute
session it's a very broad topic so we'll
probably get focused I mean I'm not
going to stand here and pretend to know
everything about monitoring so I'm going
to mostly focus on what we have observed
in the consulting capacity and then we
probably try to have an open dialogue as
to what your experiences in we can share
some of those i live in raleigh north
carolina anyone else from raleigh north
carolina well excellent
so um am also a dog apt 9 certified
practitioner for enterprise architecture
and we have our own tailor enterprise
architecture framework in camp Jim and I
it's called integrated architectural
framework it's a blend of togaf 9 and
Zak Monday certain extent a more
practical approach that so I think if
some of you familiar with zachman I
think you will see claims of that engage
Enda we can approach this problem the
flow of the discussion we'll talk about
why monitoring is important at an
enterprise level then we'll slowly move
on to what is it that we need to monitor
we'll also talk about how do we monitor
in terms of some other patterns where we
can make it really we can really make it
operational there is one topic that
usually naturally flows next to that is
with what and these are where the tunes
come into picture unfortunately in this
forum I'm gonna not try to refer to any
specific tools because I I'm not in a
position where I can endorse a
particular field in this forum or you
want to be criticized something so I
would mostly be staying abstract I'll
still cover the content but but without
reference into and even even if I prefer
to some of the specific tools it would
be more from an example point of view
and I've seen there are some
mind-blowing demonstrations have been to
about the exhibition and there's some
really good tools out there which you
look in so um why monitoring and I think
before i get started i think i just want
to get a pulse of the crowd so how many
of you are from engineering more
hardcore design and development
background okay and how many it more
into management leadership and sales
functions got the right audience okay so
i'll probably get then a little bit
deeper into the technical side of it and
feel free to get engaged in the dialogue
so in the beginning when i thought about
oky monitoring i feel like you know it
will be preaching to the choir
especially with these audience who's
been through it but then
I'm going to go ahead and make a
contradictory statement that we we still
are not as much focused on monitoring as
we should be in today's world in general
if you look at the the IT spending and
budget for the IT support operations
there is not much that is given for
building a monitoring solution versus
how much we spend on in a reactive mode
when the problems happen we have army of
team supporting it and doing the
incident management so the better we get
at monitoring we should be able to cut
down on the staff that we need to be in
a reactive mode and be able to a lot of
things in building intelligent solutions
that can proactively deal with those
things now here I'm just going to make a
statement that if i look at the spectrum
of the monitoring systems that are out
there today information systems a water
heater is much more sophisticated than
what we have out there and just 24 with
the example so a water heater is a it's
a simple thermodynamic system now you
you you get hot water cold water put it
together in the simplest form all you
would do it you put your toe in the
water and you see how you know whether
look form is it and is that what you
want you get one in the process and I
think our monitoring systems are right
there at the state we we have a process
where we have all kind of fancy
dashboards and workflows and all those
things that are put up by the tools and
then there is a human intervention
required that you read those things you
analyze and then you come back and like
you would adjust the tap water you come
back and you you adjust your your tune
your systems and you react to the
problem water heater is much more
sophisticated because it has a negative
feedback loop it has a thermostat may be
some kind of transducer that feeds back
into the potentiometer that controls the
flow so it's automated the way it reacts
to the problem is automated I can't
think of many systems that are out there
that can react to the problems like that
on top of that it's even more
sophisticated in terms of it has a
solution to monitor the monitor which is
the fuse
so in a in a thermostat you basically
have a fuse and if things go out of
control whatever you feedback loop is
thus we just which is off and it takes
down the part of the system that just
goes down by itself and doesn't burn
down the house if you if you relate that
to an information system you really need
a solution like that that can isolate
the component that is likely to fail and
just bring it down give time to recover
but then try to keep your business up
and running with minimal costs of
downtime now well i think i'm going to
slow it get into more technical problem
then why monitoring rather than
explaining those things or then the
first example I'm just going to take
some sample problems that we have faced
that could have been avoided if we had a
bit monitoring solution in place so
those who are familiar with looking at
Java systems and looking at how to
interpret data can someone tell me what
does this look like a memory leak so
this is the time when somebody shouts
out who the developer because our is not
supposed to have memory leaks but with
what it happens now in this case what's
interesting is it's not the developers
fault because you can still have memory
leaks if the developer does is best
there are some things even at the API
level java programming language or
something nasty called as soft
references for those are not familiar
with the terms i think we have hard weak
and soft references particularly the
soft reference of the ones where the JVM
doesn't react until it is about to throw
out of memory exception so if there is
going to be a point in time and this is
kind of exaggerated just to kind of
figure on the real estate i have on one
page but usually you have these things
accumulated over a day of something
where you JVM starts operating in a very
very narrow band of heat
so now it's all legit the code is
legitimate but it comes to a point where
there is going to be a period of about
an hour or even more than that while you
have that narrow band and before the jvm
does the major garbage collection
collecting the soft references you're
going to see us some slowdown which is
going to reflect on the user experience
if you have a system which like the
feedback look I talked about it can
actually check the JVM health natively
and react to the problem it could just
recycle the JVM if you have a redundant
JVM built in and there are some good
solutions out there I think one of the
ones like i would like to mention is a i
recently had opportunity to work with
ibm's virtualized enterprise it's it's
an extension of websphere ND where they
have a smart on-demand router in place
which can actually detect a JVM which is
going into bad health and just shut it
down recycle it give time to recover but
that's that's a smart way of reacting
the problem but if you don't have
anything in place you're going to have
some user experience that's but that's
not going to be light so the first one
that we saw this is more to do with the
performance problems how you can get
into performance problems if you have if
you don't have a place to know what's
going on in the system so this one I
think take a few minutes to kind of go
through this this is a this is according
so this is a place that you should
really shoot the developer that it's
simplistic you have a simple system for
the application on the database we have
a field defined in the database of
primary column which is which is a five
digit number and then you have a
disconnected corresponding Java field
which is a long which can hold much more
and then you have an independent
identity generation mechanism which can
fit into those identities which
eventually get persisted these three
things are disconnected from each other
and usually a lot of times I've seen the
identity generator is pulled into memory
so that you can be fast in getting those
IDs we don't have to go back and forth
between the databases to tell you what
is the next value a good solution but if
you don't do that you deleted in this
you're going to be in a situation where
you are going to overrun your max
value and I think about it that if you
have a retailer system and if this is
your order table you're going to have an
outage in the system period now well we
developers are you know the community
we're smart I think we do bugs we don't
keep it so simple for people to figure
out easily so if you make it even more
complicated what we do is we have some
sort of rolling mechanism when you reach
the highest value we introduce some kind
of purchase process so that all those
old numbers that are out there you try
to get rid of those and then you start
fresh but then somewhere down the line
you're going to have a foreign key
constraint violation and you're going to
still hit the road block now if these
things are not monitored at the design
level it might look very well on the
whiteboard it will still work but in
reality in murphys world you will have
problems with this so this is if you
have a situation like this and maybe
this is not the best solution I mean you
might argue that why would you design or
what would you do it like this in the
first place the various reasons
sometimes it's out of your control
sometimes we live in the world of
perpetual beta where you want a business
want you to put something we can already
out there doesn't matter as long as you
know if they can run they can get
revenues that they want so you you will
have situations like this and you will
have to be able to react to those well
here is an example of what could happen
with respect to security if you don't
monitor it so here is a typical system
where are you using a one-way hashing
function and it's very popular mechanism
when you when you deal with password
validation so the use case is simply
you're storing a password you do a
one-way hash function you store the
hashed value in the database when you
come back to validate you you take the
new value Union rate the hash value and
there's a one-to-one mapping with that
and you validate it ideally it works
fine with passwords that the problem
here is very this is a case where you
should shoot the designer to design this
not the one we hash function but the by
the way of doing the security with the
four digit pin number where this doesn't
make sense so the problem with this is
this is open to a brute force attack you
can do dictionary attack where you have
a four-digit pan there are
fine light number of combinations so all
your data all the ports unlock the
storage is locked the derive secure in
storage the data is secure in transit
from a security compliance perspective
you're good but then somebody sitting
outside note that this is a four digit
password and from that to that is only
about 9,000 combinations so you can just
run a loop and hack it so this is
something enough sometimes you will have
a situation like this you'll have a
solution like this in place and you will
realize once you put it in production
you don't have much time to build
another one so you need to have a good
monitoring practice to monitor the ports
and see if there is somebody who's
trying to do this um so I think rather
than trying to explain it you know I
just want to take some examples just
kind of just so like we realize that
people have avoided its problems and
sometimes you will be you will be you'll
be facing these problems you like it or
not we'll move on to the second topic
that is what to monitor and I think like
I said before
the threats are specific to your system
everything does not apply to everyone so
I've just categorized some of these
general risks that are out there not
necessarily they apply to all the
systems the first one out there are
related to the system availability
something that has software or hardware
components going down also performing
badly and I think Greece will come back
to those later when we talk about the
metrics about what what needs to be
monitoring those what I've listed as a
time bomb and is the maximum value
counters the one that I showed earlier
with the identity is a time bomb sitting
in the system it's going to explore some
day you have memory leaks scalability
issues in terms of if you don't know
your load projections very well you're
going to run over the capacity so you
need to know that ahead of time and then
there are other capacity matrix which
will cover later security threats now
this is a much broader topic and I think
I'm not an expert on security so I've
just listed what I'm familiar with
usually there are looked at two ways of
looking at the security one is the
external attack what you're exposed to
the outside world and one is the man in
the house that can do some of the damage
in terms of hacking into your
authorization authentication process
putting sniffers where they have access
to the outside attacks there are a lot
of techniques and i think one page is
not enough to list all of those but
cross scripting or impersonation and
trojans these are some of the common
ones and I think a lot of good
monitoring tools especially with
security already have figured those out
and they have a solution in place at
work with those in recent times there is
another one that I've seen a trending is
reputation threats so so the system
availability threats are replicable to
the systems who are more traffic driven
where you you are you were expected to
lose a lot of revenue if even if you
your system goes down for a little bit
security threats apply more to
businesses with compliance and sensitive
data we have we have enterprises and
organizations that are very some of them
are very brand value conscious
and for them the reputation threads are
important so especially the social media
there is a lot that is out there that
can work against you if you don't know
what's going on and what's the
perception of your business outside and
I think there are some good tools that
are out there that can actually index
and rank a social opinion about what
your business is like and i think that's
that's one of the good things that you
should monitor as to know what's the
perception for your business outside now
when I'm covering what to monitor all
slowly go into some of the best
practices and some of the pitfalls also
that we have seen in the past and we'll
talk at more details on each of those so
what makes a good monitoring solution so
I just we just looked at the whole the
works about monitoring there are so many
things that could be monitored a lot of
times what I've seen people doing is
they just go out there they buy a tool
sometimes the tool comes in a big bundle
package with promises from the sales
people that they'll do the job they'll
do whatever you need and you buy the
tool it's a pretty big investment and
then you realize that you are forced to
tone your monitoring needs based on what
the tool has to offer so in reality what
happens is you start monitoring what the
tool has to offer not what is it that
you should have really monitored so we
just looked at the examples before that
some systems are more focused on the
outage in the downtime some systems are
more focused on security and maybe you
may not find one tool that works for all
sometimes it's the ecosystem that you
have to build and you have to put an
integrated solution around it so what
what we usually advise our clients is
don't look at the tools first look at
your threats now look at what risks you
are saying so what are the risks or the
example that I showed you you know that
you have a bad solution of that in
production running that's a risk and
that's something that you need to
monitor because you know there is a
loophole sometimes you have a very
robust solution you have a lot of
redundancy built into systems that even
if you monitor and something fails there
is nothing much to lose so if you
prioritize
and you should focus identify what your
needs are itemized them and they then go
shopping for the tools the the second
part it's about the view that the
monitoring tools have to provide most of
the tools that I have seen and there are
some really fancy tools out there I
think I looked at one over on a Moscone
at the Oracle where you can literally
see the flow of information and
connections like you could see like a
hydraulic system you know it kind of
shows you that view that you can start
visualizing but the problem with most of
the tools that I've seen is that they're
very system centric they show you the
views of jvms they show you connections
they show you nodes they show you
virtual machines they show you load
balancers what they don't show you is a
business centric view of what you're
monitoring and that's really what is
important because from the time
something fails till the time you report
to the stakeholders if you go back and
tell your business partner that I have a
JVM down and they are like okay so what
does it mean what they really need to
know is I have a JVM down and I'm not
going to be able to take orders in this
specific product for next five hours so
that's what you need to have that you
need to have a tools or a set of two
horizontal solution it doesn't have to
be a set of tools it needs to be it
could be a blend of a custom and some
sort of of the shell products where
you're going to be able to create a
business centric view of what you need
to monitor so if you are a
customer-focused application then you
should be able to group attributes and
metrics what you monitor by customers or
if you are very if you are marketing
agency and if different market segments
is what you need to know about then you
should be able to group your system
components at that level so what you
really come out of the solution is a
business level view of 40 monitoring
so in terms of and I we talked about
this proactive and reactive before
usually we have seen this situation
where the monitoring tools have they're
more focused on the proactive mode so
they'll send you alerts so what happens
usually is we will have some kind of
out-of-the-box probes which will just
showed alerts and emails to people that
are on the support and they'll forward
it to somebody else and it goes to the
whole nine yards of the support system
and then when those people get engaged
they start over all over by looking at
the logs looking at all the information
squaring the databases and that's that's
that's what actually this monitoring
tool should have done once you know what
the problem is once you have assembled
once you have enough information the
monitoring solution should launch into a
more reactive mode so that whoever comes
in to fix the problem knows where to
start this shouldn't have to start over
so there should be capability in your
solution so that you can identify an
incident and you should be able to group
the data that can launch into the
investigation
so so the next one next attribute of a
of a good monitoring solution is
establishing fault chains this is one
area where the tools cannot help you
it's it's your enterprise that needs to
work on this so fault chains are
basically something that relates that
relate to your system components to the
business functions this is mostly a set
of documentation or set of dashboards
that can tell you when you look at a
business function this is how it flows
down the line and enough one of the
components is down this is what is going
to get impacted you don't want you don't
want to figure those things out at real
time you should have done the analysis
you should have the documentation or
something that that takes you from a
system failure into the business failure
now that's the run time but even have
the design time when you're building
your monitoring strategy when you
identifying your threads the fault
chains they help you identifying what is
redundant and what are your single
points of failures sometimes I've seen
that really live looking components like
if you think of a let's say a load
balancer that you wouldn't you wouldn't
sometimes even have in your testing
environment maybe you might be just
running on a single JVM single node you
will take care of your functionality it
will work when you go to production you
scale up you have all these other
components that get placed in and they
are the ones that fail because they
don't get tested in the testing men
times if you have the fault change in
place about that show the landscape of
your production systems you would have
realized those up front and and you
would have been able to put a solution
around them now we just talked about the
the single point of failures
particularly this is this is very
important I think in today's world we
don't have many I think the technology
is advanced enough that you have have
redundancy in almost everything you have
Emily especially if you look at oracle
RAC for example there is a redundancy in
database nodes JVMs you have
horizontally scaling clusters
one jvm going down is not a big deal
anymore so but sometimes by design
you're forced to have single points of
failure and one of them have seen very
often is in the messaging frameworks
messaging framework the order of events
or order a message is important and to
be able to maintain an order sometimes
you can't really have the redundancy
that you need because you don't want so
let's say if you have them if you have
an order that you create an order and if
you cancel an order you don't want
cancel to go before they create so by
design there are single point of entry
failures that get introduced in your
system those are the ones that should
pop out of your fault chains and those
are the ones that you should focus on
monitoring now the next topic i'm going
to talk about and i think i have a few
more slides on this that's that's more
so in the modern service oriented
systems the correlation so what we've
seen over the last couple of years is
used to have these monolithic systems in
the past they were simple I mean they
were complicated to maintain and modify
and enhance but they were simple to
monitor because everything that you need
presentation layer business logic data
access was all in one place you could
put it all together and make sense out
of it when we go into the service
oriented architecture things get much
more distributed and much more
disconnected so that's that's where you
need to establish something and I have
some diagrams i'll show you later on i
think we can we can jump right into this
so this is a typical view of what a
modern enterprise system looks like
which is which is going service-oriented
you have a number of presentation layer
components or systems number of
applications supporting them you may
have a sophisticated ESP in the middle
you can have some domain services
talking to the data stores you can have
some cep components you can have some
batch processes and demons that run in
the background without human
intervention
you can also have some sort of package
solutions that you interact with there's
a lot of diversity now I'm just taking
an example here that a user or users
interaction a single quantum of
interaction a button click that usually
splits into 50 or 20 different
synchronous asynchronous calls that flow
back and forth between services and
components they usually disconnected
there if you look at your log if you
look at your monitoring solutions
individually there is no you can figure
out what the hell is in terms of what
the business is what the user is trying
to do and then now that's just single
user click that we talked about that
flows across services goes into external
systems I has some extra Maclean's
involved now you talk about a workflow
so when you're looking at an order
processing I'm just taking that as an
example there is a unit of work that the
end user is trying to do and you need to
put some sort of semantics and at their
different ways it depends on what your
enterprise is about and what your
business is about but there needs to be
a semantic that you need to define at
the enterprise level as to how these all
the messages they get correlated what is
it that they get grouped by in the
simple case um it's a button click and
I'm saying okay it's a clicker d you
generate a GUI d assign it let it flow
wherever the message flows so when all
those things get logged or when they get
monitored you know that they are all
related you can correlate aggregate days
and make make a business level sends out
of them um workflow ID or use case ID
and a single button click is very atomic
but usually you talk in terms of what is
it that the end user is trying to do are
they trying to purchase something are
these you're searching are they pay are
they doing a payment so these are these
are the semantics that you can build
which is applicable to your business and
I think this is these are some of the
techniques of how do you do the
transportation and a mouse is those so
this is a horizontal view of how the how
the messages or how the calls flow from
end users all the way to the database
you would see that they go from a client
application and you will have a lot of
HTTP mediation other transportation
mediation they will sit in the middle
they will have their own proprietary
ways of logging monitoring you will flow
into JVM or some kind of business logic
application logic it might not be one it
might be a multitude of those might flow
into one or more databases so so how do
you transport how do you propagate that
context information that you just
generated so they are various ways and i
think i'm imagining over a period things
will be more flattened out either using
HTTP we also have JMS in some cases
there are i mean i haven't seen very
many standardized api's as to how you
propagate the context but that's
something probably you might need to
move forward as an industry level if
you're transporting HTTP and in a
typical way of doing that is you might
be doing restful service calls or so
based service calls simply it's really
simple enough to stick something in the
HTTP headers most of the HTTP mediation
components have capabilities to log them
and monitor them and use those for so
based you can put it in the soap errors
I personally feel HTTP headers are more
important because a lot of these middle
components don't have visibility into
your body as which is where the soap
header is so I think I favor HTTP
headers personally if you still
old-school you still use or be rmi type
of methods you might have to go out of
the way you might just have to overload
your methods with some of these as at a
predefined position or you can define
your transfer object structures that
they can inherit these properties from
somewhere when it goes into in memory
now what happens is one of the web
container is going to pick up whatever
the call that was received he's going to
make calls into other multiple
components if it is in the same jvm it
can do some parallel processing it can
spawn of other child threads but a
thread ID is something that is unique
when your message flows between
components inside your application so
either you can use the third local or
you can build your own single terms
where you can associate these context
IDs when they enter in store them with
your thread ID and when they exit you
get
back from the singletons and then you
propagate wherever they go next ideally
if you build this using some sort of aop
or cross-cutting technologies aspect
then it should be very transparent to
your business logic and this is
something that should be done as soon as
you receive the message before you hand
it over to your business functionality
databases and this part is very tricky I
think I haven't seen very standardized
solutions if this but let me go back to
this one second and I think here is an
example I wanted to show that there is a
let's say one day one of the nodes of
your databases just start showing a lot
of discount utilization and goes down
now you can have monitoring around the
database you can say okay this is the
note that that's going down but you
really don't know what is it that caused
it because if that takes a lot of
analysis if you have this correlation in
place you can actually trace it back
within fraction of second what is the
user event that caused it to be able to
do that you should be able to take the
information that is available in your
database sessions or connections try to
map it back to the application map it
map it back to the end user activity so
there are one or two techniques that
unfamiliar with one is a thing I think
on the oracle type for drivers you are
able to set connection information so
that the connection knows who's making
the call and you can set some context
information on those the other simple
method is when you file your sequels you
can add a simple predicate where you say
your context ID equal to context ID
which is harmless enough that gets that
bypasses most of your query processing
so doesn't add any latency into your
queries but still when you look at the
query in the database you look your
context ID right there in the query so
if your dbas come back and report that
this is the query that actually took the
database down you can immediately report
it back to the business function that
caused it
and I think so these are some of the
practices and I think I know this
doesn't cover a whole lot about
everything about monitoring these are
some of the common problems a common
patterns that I've seen that we have
seen as in our consulting work and I
think that's something we talked about a
garish we'll talk more about not exactly
the tools but what are the what are the
things to look at from the tools
perspective when you were shopping for
those tools thank you in case yeah so we
talked about why monitor what to monitor
and then the next question is monitor
with what what kind of tools to select
so what we are going to talk about is
basically what to look for in tools when
we are actually you know selecting you
know the right tool there are different
factors you know that we actually want
to monitor and that all depends on your
system if your system requires some kind
of you know if there are some
availability threats like the
availability of the system is critical
for you like the hardware of the
software's or the time bombs in terms of
you know running out of the counters or
anything that that is something that
basically you need to focus on capacity
issue essentially you know your cpu's
too much of load bandwidth issue in
terms of you know networks or pool
connections or all those are the heap
are the memory overruns you know GC is
doing your jvm doing too many garbage
collections on all those things so
important factor when selecting the tool
is basically identifying your threats
and risks once you have identified your
problem saying what you need then you
can go back in the market and say okay
what are the tools that helps address
these these issues so now that you have
identified your risks and the threats
you know what additional things to look
for in that tool very important rich you
I because the developers are going to be
looking at it you know at a time when
the time is of a sense there is immense
pressure something that has a rich UI is
helpful that should make you know the
debugging or the investigation very very
simple you are kind of you know working
with it visually there are tools that
are available which actually runs in the
JVM that collects a lot of data and then
gives you all that information but then
that tool itself could cause your
application to die it could potentially
kill it so look for something that is
not intrusive there are there are tools
available which actually have a
lightweight agent running in your jvm
that sends the data across to a
enterprise server kind of thing and then
that enterprise server collects all the
data and then analyzes that and then
gives you another view so that you could
create dashboards and things like that
that is preferred or the other one but
then again that itself could have
potential of you know bringing down your
jvm is based on how much data you are
collecting from from each transactions
something so there are there are
products available which which are like
a huge bundle you buy that one big
product it offers you know a to c 76
different things you know most of those
you do not really need something to look
for is basically an a la carte option
you could buy the base product and then
add to it what specific you need things
like you know specific interest in
monitoring whether it has to be a
security threat or the availability part
of it or what look for something that
has open API is how it integrates into
different applications what are the
alerting mechanisms whether it has
ability to hook up into your SMTP or
send text or you know create a ticket
that actually goes to the developer or a
support engineer or whatever so look for
open API is because once you login into
a product then anything that you want to
interface with kind of comes at an
additional cost so once you have the
data collected and your enterprise
server who has actually you know
consolidated all that data
in terms of application monitoring see
how that same data could cater to
different audience you could have an
audience that is right from your
developer to your system administrators
to your you know very high-level
business people so the same data should
be able to you know make sense for
everybody it should be able to provide
you different views that you get cater
to all different audiences and again
there are different levels of tools that
that actually you know intercepts each
and every transaction there are
different tools which actually only log
or monitor a minimal level of
transactions once it goes beyond a
threshold and then there are certain
tools who do a sampling based thing so
something that does a sampling based you
know does not put a lot of load on your
existing application but at the same
time it does not guarantee that every
single transaction or one of the
transactions that has taken your system
down has been you know captured by by
that tool so identify what what is more
important for you if if it is that your
system can take that additional load of
monitoring every every single
transaction that comes in or you know
you could do a sampling based or
something that basically creates or logs
a minimal amount of compact data where
to put the monitors now there are there
are several places where you could
actually plant all your sensors and
cameras and saying okay this is where I
want to monitor one of the classic
examples as mogesh mentioned is like
inbound outbound service interfaces you
could create a Interceptor that
basically once you get the request you
know you monitor that the request goes
out you monitor that there could be you
know outside watchdogs like the ESB is
on all those that that you could monitor
the logging monitors lot of these
applications are worse actually create
an immense amount of system and error
logs which has very valuable information
c4 tools that could help you hook up
into that information
and you know search for something that
is very specific something that might
give you you know errors or the cause of
Doras errors or you know systems going
down something like those and the
regular health monitors and the pattern
analyzers so those are the other two
additional items that you could Walter
what are the general critical items to
monitor you have everybody has web
services these days and some of the very
basic and standard things to monitor in
a web service is things like average
response time you're through put your
concurrency you know things that are
like hung threads Starlin's actions
inners if you if you see those patterns
saying you are you know in a in a
healthy learning system you get about
you know one to two business kind of
errors but suddenly you start seeing you
know tens and you know hundreds of
errors within a short time that is
something that should basically alert
you you have you know a synchronous
systems in place and you know you talk
to a socket client or you talk to a
messaging application again when you
talk to a socket client see how many
socket connections are open how many
socket connections are closed the other
system might not be responding and
anything that you basically monitor on
the sockets should be able to alert you
of any of those external system down
times and then there are additional you
know miscellaneous items that you could
monitor right from your disk space usage
things where usually your jvm would
create some kind of dumps or when it
crashes it kind of creates some thread
dumps heap dumps and it puts those there
look for thresholds basically once it
goes beyond a certain point then that
that is something that should alert you
saying your system has crashed and
record by itself things like websphere
ve it has ability to start a new JVM
once one of those JVMs actually crashes
and take that out in a maintenance mode
and things like that so there
is some level of automation feedback
monitoring it built in some of those
systems but then you're monitoring
should be able to take advantage of
those and go back in time and say okay
one of my je viens actually crashed and
restarted let me go back and look into
those heap dumps so the alerts would
actually tell that sums one of those
incidents has actually happened your
discount utilization or your simple JVM
he bore the GC patterns as we saw in the
first example the GC pattern should be
able to tell you if there is any memory
leak in your application or something
like that if you look at the overall
budget spending in terms of an IT
support organization a very heavy focus
is actually giving you know given to a
reactive firefighting you know effort
there are there are huge teams looks
like there is some were delayed from the
next slide but you that we are just
looking at the pie chart the the one
that in white could be ignored so there
is a huge focus on fire fighting every
module every team has you know tens of
developer supporting the application and
you know looking at the logs and all
those there is some amount of focus on
any announcements that keep coming from
the business saying you know that that's
a continuous ongoing thing and there is
a very little focus on proactive
monitoring the moment we start you know
diverting our focus to proactive
monitoring we would definitely see a
huge shift in terms of how much time and
money and effort we spend on reactive
firefighting monitoring as part of the
ID application supports so in a given
life cycle of you know software
development lifecycle all the way from
design development to go live production
release support and all those there are
several things that have matured over
or you know last several years or maybe
decade monitoring is additional concept
that has you know come in the last few
years and the the software development
life cycle has not yet completely
embraced it even until after we go live
and have several mission-critical
applications in production we still do
not have a robust to monitoring
infrastructure in place so that is one
thing that the management that that is
something that that the stakeholders has
to identify as a critical part of our
development lifecycle and identify all
those monitoring things right at the
beginning when we are building the
system so that we put the right probes
in place so that we put the right
sensors and cameras in place so that
when the application actually goes into
production we are able to support and
sustain it better I think that would be
all any questions
Oh
I think this deck and the recording
would be available on the Oracle website
as part of the Java one yes please
does
we are absolutely okay absolutely so we
have an expertise in understanding your
requirements and kind of recommending
you that I tool or the right set of
tools and help you build a solution and
a monitoring infrastructure that would
help you basically select the right
tools and then put that in place
integrate that with your application and
then you know help your organization
support that some company names of all
so I think that's one area I wouldn't
necessarily get in we can probably have
an offline one-on-one session and we can
talk about but yeah that's one thing
we've run this will be one but there are
several you know big clients who
actually we are working with where we
have implemented these kind of
monitoring frameworks and systems sure
alright thank you gentlemen of course
