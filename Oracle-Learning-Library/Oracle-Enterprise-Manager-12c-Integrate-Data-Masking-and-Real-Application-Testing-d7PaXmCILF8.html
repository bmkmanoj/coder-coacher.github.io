masking including real application
testing integration at this stage you
would have completed the application
data model creation including the
discovery of sensitive columns we will
now proceed into the real application
testing and data masking integration
so we'll navigate to and a prize manager
quality management and data masking
definition create give it a name
associate our data masking definition to
the application data model that was
created earlier check on ensure workload
mask and compatibility as there are some
restrictions add columns by specifying
TP CH here and searching select all add
we will now define the data masking
format for each of the columns selected
account now random numbers have a look
at the samples click OK similarly for
bank name but instead we will use the
table column a contain samples dummy
test banks have a look at a sample I
click OK we'll skip over phone will jump
to routing num for now and come back to
the phone we'll choose fixed number here
click OK click OK now let's go to the
phone and we will now use the new format
type encrypt encrypt allows us to
specify a regular expression to format
the data while maintaining the
characteristics of the data itself here
you can see the phone number even though
it has been masked it is also preserving
the characteristics of it by preserving
the format of its encrypt format entry
is reversible provided you have regular
expression and the seed that we will
provide when we are running the data
masking definition which you will see
shortly click OK this completes the
creation of the data masking definition
let's go ahead and generate the script
complete let's click on return and we're
ready to run the masking definition to
mask our entire artifacts of our
environment such as the application data
and the real application testing
artifacts database replay capture files
and sequel tuning set so before running
the data masking definition let's go
ahead and quickly see the data values in
the phone column before we run the
masking here you can see 2 3 1 0 1 has
this phone number let's now go ahead
have a look at what's inside C equal to
new set there you can see the before
picture of the data masking inside the
application data tables and also in the
sequel tuning set as a capture was
carried out during the workload of this
application now that we have this let's
go ahead and schedule the job we use a
default value since we use the Inc
type would require a seed for our
encryption two three four five we'll use
the default will mass the sequel tuning
set will also specify the database
replay capture file location just
capture in this case we can detect any
sequel plan changes due to masking by
performing a sequel performance analyzer
integrated within the masking up just
need to provide plan check and give it a
sequel tuning set run the impact
analysis on provide named credentials
for host and database here we are done
click on submit and run the masking job
from this we can see that the masking of
real application testing is natively
integrated into the data masking
capability look at the progress of of
our did a masking job Erica C is
currently running we can see that the
data masking job has succeeded
successfully let's have a look at the
data that that we had inside the C phone
column before we had run the masking
using the encrypt for my tight and then
after masking we see that the phone has
been masked however the format has been
preserved this is one of the key
characteristics of the encrypt whereby
it allows you to preserve the format of
the data that is being masked yet
maintaining security of production data
by masking the values let's go ahead and
look at the data inside the sequel
tuning set we see that inside a sequel
tuning said we have consistently masked
with the application data the bind
values in the vine variables of a sequel
tuning sets and consequently in the
database replay capture file we have
mass consistently throughout our entire
database artifacts now let's have a look
at the impact that data masking may have
caused with the characteristics of the
data since we had selected to perform an
impact analysis using sequel performance
analyzer of real application testing as
part of the masking process here we see
a sequel performance analyzer task
already completed notice that there has
been no regression that was caused by
the masking process we have validated
that the masking has no adverse effect
on the performance of our sequel this
completes the integration of real
application testing and data masking
thank you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
