infrastructure DNS edge computing is a
method of optimizing cloud computing
systems by performing data processing at
the edge of the network near the source
of the data
the edge can impact as much as 50% of
cloud performance were constant
disruptions demands superior edge
services starting with DNS
here the authoritative DNS name servers
are responsible for providing answers to
recursive DNS name servers with the IP
mapping of the intended website
therefore a high-performance
authoritative DNS with global response
consistency is indeed critical
hi can you tell me more about how the
DNS works
domain name system or DNS is a
hierarchical decentralized naming system
for computers services or other
resources connected to the Internet or a
private network
when an end-user types ww example.com
into their web browser and hits return
client computer smartphone etc checks
its local DNS cache does it know the
answer - WWWE example.com already if so
use this cached answer if the cache
doesn't know the answer next step client
queries they're assigned recursive DNS
server likely their ISP for
www.example.com recursive checks its
cache to see if it knows the answer if
so returns it to client if the cache
doesn't know the answer next step
recursive them perform several queries
each one can be skipped if already
cached queries root nameservers
to find out if they know the answer -
WWWE example.com root nameservers return
the name servers for the top-level
domain
TLD TLD name servers return the answer
for example.com name servers Oracle
cloud Net Oracle cloud net name servers
return the answer for WWWE example.com
recursive then returns the final WWWE
sample com answer to client client
connects to the IP address contained
within the DNS answer
oh I see while it seems like a detailed
process it happens in milliseconds
what is Oracle cloud infrastructure DMS
oh cloud infrastructure DNS is a highly
scalable global anycast domain name
System DNS network that assures high
site availability and low latency
resulting in a superior end-user
experience connecting to Oracle cloud
infrastructure third party and private
assets
what is any caste and how is it
beneficial
and anycast Network utilizes the same IP
address for all the anti cast pops in
the network this means that in any cast
pop in South America has the same IP
address as an any cast pop in Asia this
is based on the fastest response time so
will typically be the closest but may
not be due to current internet
conditions
when a DNS query is sent even though all
the DNS servers have the same IP address
the request is sent to a specific DNS
server based on routing protocol network
health proximity to the servers
locations etc
the anycast Network provides lower
latency a basic level of load balancing
and resiliency to be able to handle
outages or heavy traffic with minimal
impact to the customer
the Oracle cloud infrastructure DNS
Network supports anycast point of
presence pops distributed around North
America South America Europe in Asia
Pacific
by configuring Oracle cloud
infrastructure DNS enterprise and
business customers can support DNS
resolution for various kinds of assets
such as Oracle cloud infrastructure
compute and Oracle cloud infrastructure
storage as well as third party in
private assets
customers can also manage DNS records
which are domain names map to IP
addresses domain names can be cloud or
non cloud resources
TTL time to live is a setting for each
DNS record that specifies how long a
resolver is supposed to cache or
remember the DNS query before the query
expires and a new one needs to be done
can you tell me about the list of DNS
records that are supported by Oracle
cloud infrastructure sure here is a
subset of the common record types that
Oracle cloud infrastructure DNS supports
a or address record quad-a or ipv6
address record
see name or canonical name record
MX or mail exchange record
txt or text record
PTR or point a record
SOA or start of authority record
SRV or service locator
an S or name server record
in addition the Oracle cloud
infrastructure DNS supports an alias
record type which is specific to Oracle
cloud infrastructure DNS it can be used
to map to various Oracle cloud
infrastructure resources like compute
network database or storage third party
or private assets the alias record acts
similar to a cname record with the
difference being that it can be at the
apex record of a zone and is not visible
to external resolvers alias record types
support only a and quad-a queries
any DNS query is resolved to the mapped
asset for example if example.com is
queried the alias record would resolve
to the mapped asset for example Oracle
cloud infrastructure compute service
asset alias records also helped by not
having to map a record to a specific IP
address as IP addresses associated with
certain assets could dynamically change
due to various conditions
by default the Oracle cloud
infrastructure DNS service supports up
to 25,000 resource records per zone
what other functions does the Oracle
cloud infrastructure DNS solution offer
the Oracle cloud infrastructure DNS
solution offers a complete set of
functions for zone management within the
user interface
the following functions are available
create and manage zones create and
manage records import or upload zone
files save and publish changes view sort
and filter views of zones and records
reporting total queries by zone total
queries by tenant to supplement your
existing primary DNS infrastructure to
increase the availability of name
resolution there is secondary DNS that
operates in an always-on manner when an
end-users recursive server initiates a
DNS request both the existing DNS
service and the secondary DNS will
respond as soon as they receive the
request
whichever response reaches the recursive
server first will be passed back to the
end-user completing their request
all domain information will continue to
be managed within the primary DNS
service in the same manner in which this
information is configured today
this information will then be
synchronized with the secondary service
using standard protocols to ensure both
solutions are returning the same
information to end-users
can Oracle cloud infrastructure DNS be
added as a secondary provider to my
existing DNS service
yes in most cases secondary DNS means
that it can be deployed with a
customer's own or other vendors DNS
service for improved availability
the Oracle cloud infrastructure DNS can
be deployed as either the primary or
secondary DNS server
restrictions are related to which
third-party DNS vendor is acting as
primary some of the larger cloud
providers offering DNS service do not
support this capability
how do I get started with Oracle cloud
infrastructure DNS
from the Oracle cloud infrastructure
console select networking from the top
navigation bar select DNS under
networking this brings you to the manage
DNS zones page
from the manage DNS zones page click Add
zone
select method type manual import enter a
zone name select zone type primary
secondary click Add zone zone is created
and can be verified
from the manage DNS zones page
the Oracle cloud infrastructure DNS
service supports up to 1,000 zones per
tenant
from the manage DNS zones page select a
zone to view record details for that
zone
zone details will show the list of
records for that zone select add record
to add new record click publish changes
to update zone with new record details
default NS and SOA records are
automatically generated when a zone is
created domains will need to be
delegated to Oracle cloud infrastructure
DNS as delegating your zones or domains
enables queries to be properly informed
of the authoritative nameservers
location
how do i delegate my domain to Oracle
cloud infrastructure DMS
domains can be delegated to Oracle cloud
infrastructure DNS from the domain
registrar's self-service portal
click overview
click customer account info to access
the information
copy the four nameservers note it is
very important to add NS records for all
four name servers at your domains
registrar
login to your domain registrar's
self-service portal and append an NS
record for each name server in your
domain
wait 72 hours before changing or
deleting your previous DNS service
during this time queries may be answered
by either service any discrepancies
between the two zones could cause
unexpected results for your end-users
you can check the DNS resolution for
your domain by entering your domain name
in the name field and pressing enter
thanks for the overview Oracle cloud
infrastructure DMS really makes it easy
to manage my DMS and other Oracle cloud
infrastructure services through a common
console with a single set of credentials
very well said Oracle cloud
infrastructure DNS plays an important
role when domains and zones are needed
to be exposed to be a internet for DNS
resolution with fast response to DNS
changes

infrastructure portal to learn more be
sure to sign up for the free trial and
get started right away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
