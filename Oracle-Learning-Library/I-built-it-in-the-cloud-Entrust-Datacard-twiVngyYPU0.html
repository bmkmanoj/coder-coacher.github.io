and I have here with me Jim from and
Trust data card hi Jim Achanta thank you
for having me so Jim can you tell us
about intrastate a card please
interest data card is a leading provider
of trusted identity and secure
transaction technologies for financial
government and consumer markets I see
that we have the architecture diagram of
your e-business suite dr integration
with oracle cloud infrastructure can you
walk us through this architecture please
and tell us about what you had prior to
OCR right sure
prior to OSI I we had an off-site data
center that we use for disaster recovery
the hardware there was quite old and
quite slow and was no longer a viable
solution for us when it came time to
have a new solution Oracle cloud
infrastructure was an easy choice for us
because it allowed us to continue to use
the components we were already familiar
with our implementation is a small one
it's just a simple database server and
an application server for our ebusiness
suite we connected the two sites
together using a VPN tunnel it was very
easy to configure and very low
maintenance our database server is
connected to the primary database using
data guard so that gets logs and stays
in sync and our application server is
kept in sync using simple arcing scripts
that's great can you now talk about the
access to Internet as I understand your
previous dr facility didn't allow the
customers to access the location right
our old facility did not have internet
access so in the event of a true
disaster our users wouldn't be able to
connect through the internet they would
either have to connect through the
corporate network if it was still there
or they could go to a facility that had
Internet connectivity created there with
the new OCI implementation we were very
easily able to create a public subnet
and open that up for users to connect
through the internet to our ebusiness
suite thank you Jim so now in terms of
the future application can you tell us a
little bit about how you're going to
enhance
architecture sure as I said our our
implementation was quite small
one of the things we may do in the
future is add another application server
to create some load balancing to make
the solution even more robust than it
already is
thank you for sharing your story today
with us Jim thank you for having me
Shanta</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
