of the course on Oracle jet at the start
of this the third week you should have
an understanding of the kinds of
enterprise problems that jet helps solve
you should also have a basic
understanding of the library's
underpinning jet such as require and
knockout you should have done quite a
bit of coding in NetBeans IDE or in
another tool while getting comfortable
with the creation of jet applications
you've learnt about jet modules and
you've worked with the jet code book
using a variety of jet components with
that background you are ready to
continue with the third week of the
course on oracle jet the theme of this
the third week of the course on jet is
to learn how to connect with the world
around jet jet explicitly and
intentionally is an open client
architecture meaning that you should be
able to incorporate other libraries and
technologies into your jet applications
without too much work in particular
during this week's lesson you'll be
introduced to code reuse and component
based development via oracle jets
composite component architecture while
you'll also see how jet connects to
Oracle cloud services you'll learn about
the full development cycle around jet
that is you'll learn about technologies
for building testing and deployment of
jet applications you'll wrap up the week
by dealing with the remaining enterprise
level challenges that you're likely to
face and how jet handles them such as
the challenges of internationalization
accessibility and security at the end of
this lesson you will have explored the
jet ecosystem and have a good
understanding of the related
technologies many frameworks libraries
and toolkits have as an aim to enable
you to do component based development
but what do we mean by the component
generically a component is a piece of
code with a well-defined set of
properties methods and events and the
benefit of component based development
is to enable you to encapsulate
complexity isolate functionality
simplify concern
of code and reuse and the
standardization of component based
development enables you to promote the
concept of an ecosystem by a sharing of
code between different applications
between different teams between
different organizations and so on how
does the concept of a component map to
the terminology that you have learned so
far
throughout this course you have learned
about Oracle Jade modules and Oracle jet
components in this part you're going to
introduce a new term and that is
composite components composite
components map to the idea of a
component in component based development
composite components in jet enabled
component based development via the
creation of reusable components that you
put together by means of JavaScript HTML
and CSS the related standard in the
JavaScript ecosystem is that of the w3c
web component standard the composite
component architecture that you are
going to be introduced to in this part
is Arcos implementation of the web
component standard in the context of
erica jet jet introduces composite
components as reusable pieces of UI that
can be embedded as custom HTML elements
and can be composed of other composites
jet components HTML Javascript and or
CSS take a look at the oracle jet
cookbook where there is a dedicated
section for a composite components in
the frameworks part of the cookbook to
learn more about composite components in
detail notice that each oracle jet
composite component has a loader GIS
file which combines the various files
together that compose the component and
defines a custom element but can then be
embedded inside one of your oracle jet
modules this is how custom elements are
defined in oracle jet applications the
Oracle JDeveloper guide has an entire
chapter dedicated to understanding and
curating and using composite
components the chapter takes you through
the entire process of how commerce that
components are constructed provides a
complete code example that you can
follow step by step throughout the
developer guide chapter shows you how to
once you have created the composite
component embedded inside of a page and
also gives you tips and tricks for
testing your composite components in
short the composite component
architecture enables you to create web
component based CCA components CCI
components enable you to share
functionality between different jet
applications it also enables Oracle
cloud products to be extended you will
see one example of this in the next part
of the course where the visual builder
cloud service will be extended by means
of a CCI component created in jet CCI
components are fundamental to the jet
architecture and if we were to react
attack this course from scratch we would
place a far larger focus on this
specific topic in this part of the
course you have been introduced to the
themes and the requirements for the
third lesson the final lesson of the
course in particular we have focused on
CGI components and your homework task is
to take a look at a developer guide and
at the cookbook to implement your first
CCI component and to share it with all
of your colleagues with that we thank
you as always for taking part in the
course and see you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
