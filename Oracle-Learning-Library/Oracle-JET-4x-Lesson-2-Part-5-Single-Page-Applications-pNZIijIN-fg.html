second of the three weekly lessons about
Oracle Church in this part you're going
to learn how jet supports the single
page application architecture which is
also known as spa you use the spa
architecture to simulate the look and
feel of a standalone desktop application
instead of using multiple web pages with
navigation links between them a spark
consists of a single web page that is
loaded once only when the page changes
because of user interaction only
specific sections of the page are
redrawn the modularity provided by the
usage of requirejs and oracle jet
applications supported by the OG module
binding which you learnt about in the
first week of this course supports the
spa architecture by letting is split the
single application into sections jet
modules let you store your HTML content
for a page section in an HTML template
file and the JavaScript functions that
contain your view model in a Java Script
file a related feature is provided by
the jet router component for navigating
the sections in the application note
that a router is something that you will
use when you want to provide bookmarks
of specific pages or states in a single
page application note that the Oracle
jet cookbook has a section dedicated to
jets a generator component which
provides all of this functionality out
of the box and can be customised when
the OTA module binding and the LJ router
are used together you can set up a
routing mechanism whereby when the
router changes its state the urge a
module binding will automatically load
and render the content of the related
jet module as we have seen throughout
this course the Oracle Jet navigation
list is a component that lets the user
interact with the underlying routing
infrastructure take a look at some
similar jet components that work equally
well with jet routers in this part you
have been introduced to techniques and
components that are useful when you are
setting up the infrastructure of support
architectures with jet
for your homework for this part add new
modules to your application and hook
them into your navigation components as
well as into your routing structures
with that we wrap up part five of the
course on Oracle jet and we thank you
for participating and look forward to
seeing you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
