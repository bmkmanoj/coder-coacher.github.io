analysis has run the histogram displays
analysis results for the project
finished date the response context field
indicates that the analysis includes
only free response data let's look at
the statistics table the deterministic
or calculated finish date is September
27th and the probability of completing
the project by that date is only 3% the
optimistic finish date with a
probability of 10% is a few days later
the pessimistic finish date with a
probability of 90% is 68 days after the
deterministic finish date let's look at
the other tabs the cost tab displays the
minimum and maximum remaining costs for
the project the costs are based on risk
impacts only and do not include other
project costs such as resources or
material the duration tab displays the
deterministic or calculated duration of
the project in this example it is 43
days but the probability of attaining
that is only 3% the pessimistic duration
is over twice as long 111 days the
probability of attaining that duration
is 90% the start date tab displays the
project's deterministic start date which
has a probability of 100% that the
project started on its planned start
date is unremarkable but note that the
view can be filtered to display start
date data for WBS nodes and individual
activities information that can be very
helpful for managing risk impacts
the statistics table indicates that the
activity is likely to start months later
than its deterministic start date use
the other tabs to view duration and
finish state data or wvs elements and
activities the histogram also displays
post response analysis results with the
risk response actions factored in the
pre and post response context view
displays two cumulative curves which
enable you to view the effectiveness of
your risk response actions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
