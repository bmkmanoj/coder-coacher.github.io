time of management feature enables
employees managers and HR to easily
request approve track and report on time
off activities through a centralized
system without the need for manual entry
in this video I will be giving you an
overview of the overall setup required
for the time off management feature and
then I'll go on detail about the second
setup step in the process which is
creating time off plans each of the
other required setup steps are detailed
in their own separate videos I highly
recommend watching them in sequence
starting with the creating time off
types video before we get started you
should be aware of the following
prerequisites for using time off
management you will need to have Suite
people available on your account as well
as have the time off management feature
enabled you'll also need to have the
time off tracking suite app installed
which enables employees to submit time
off requests from the employee center
and provides an approval workflow that
rubs request to employees managers for
approval you'll also want to make sure
your administrator has given you a role
in that suite that has access to the
time off management feature and lastly
employee records must be created in
NetSuite
before you begin setting up time off
management for your company you should
review your company's time off policies
for example you should think about the
differences between employees with
regards to the amount of time off they
are entitled to take how unused time off
is dealt with at the end of the year and
how time off is accrued let's now take a
look at each of the steps involved in
setting up time off management the first
step is to create time off types for the
different categories of time off
employees can take for example you would
create a time off type for vacation and
another for sick leave the second step
is to create the time off plans I'll be
going over this part of the process in
detail later on in this video the third
step is to add time off rules to the
time off plan time off rules reflect
your company's time off policies they
define how to handle time off
eligibility entitlements accruals and
carryover during an employee's tenure
with the company then time off rules
need to be associated with a time off
type next the time off plan needs to be
assigned to employees on their employee
record as well as a work calendar work
calendars determine which days are
working days for the employee this is
used to calculate the number of hours to
deduct from an employee's balance when a
time off request is submitted
and lastly a supervisor should be
specified on the employee record this
person will automatically receive any
time off request submitted by the
employee
I'll now go into detail on the second
step of the time off management process
creating time off plans a time off plan
contains the time off types and time off
rules that dictate how each time off
type is applied rules define how
eligibility accruals entitlements and
carryover work for employees in the plan
and how they evolve over each employee's
tenure with the company before you
create a time off plan you should create
the time off types for the different
categories of time off your employees
can take for more information watch the
companion video creating time off types
I'm at the home page of my NetSuite
account from here navigate to setup HR
information system time off plan new
this takes us to the time off plan
record the mandatory feels on the record
include name and reset annual
entitlement at the start of all other
fields are optional when entering a name
for the time off plan name it so that
you or anyone else in the HR department
can easily pick the right plan to assign
to each employee in this example we will
name the plan full-time salary vacation
the month selected from the reset annual
entitlement at the start of lists
specifies when employees assigned to
this plan are entitled to their vacation
for example if employees are entitled to
10 days and January is selected the
entitlement period starts on January 1st
check the days available includes future
cruise for the year if you want the
number of days available to employees
when they make time off requests to
include forecasted accruals through to
the end of the year if you wish you can
also associate this plan with a class
department location and if using
NetSuite OneWorld a subsidiary
to finish click Save and that's it we've
completed all the steps required for
creating a time off plan the next step
in the time off management process is to
add time off rules to the time off plan
for more information please watch the
creating time lock rules video I hope
this videos helped give you a better
understanding of how to create time off
plans I recommend watching the companion
videos creating time off types and
creating time off rules to learn more
about these steps in the process thanks
for watching and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
