welcome to the Oracle retail cloud
documentation video series on customer
segmentation
customer segmentation is an enterprise
specific solution that uses data mining
to group customers based on customer
attributes and customer transactions you
can use this information to describe and
predict customer behavior it provides
you a vehicle to target customers with
offers pricing assortment and experience
in this session I'll be showing you how
to generate a customer segment
after logging in I'll select the
customer segmentation overviewed tab a
customer segmentation overview tab
displays a list of the most recently
defined segment criteria and provides
the status segmentation applicable
merchandise
location and calendar nodes to create a
customer segment I'll select the tasks
icon
and then I'll select customer
segmentation and then generate customer
segments the generate customer segments
window is used to create segments and
then model the segments with various
scenarios in order to determine the best
set of segments it consists of three
stages segment criteria segment results
and segment insights to create a segment
I'll select the create segment icon in
this pop-up you define the initial
segmenting parameters for the segment
criteria of a new segment you'll need to
select a predefined version to use for
the creating segment criteria when the
version is selected there merchandised
and location are selected as well based
on the version and then I'll create a
unique name to identify the segment
the segment by drop-down is a predefined
group of attributes that include
customer demographics RFM and customer
behavior category purchase behavior and
customer demographics and behavior these
criteria types are sets of attributes
for example customer demographics are
the properties of a customer these
properties can include ethnicity income
and age
to define the effective period you
select either planning period fiscal
period or select the date the source
time period fields are also selected
based on the version selected for the
segment criteria when you are creating
new segment criteria you can see the
details about the following parameters
that can help you understand the
segments you're creating you can see the
segment by primary scenario when you
select segment by in the criteria panel
when you are setting the segments
criteria parameters the system displays
the primary scenario is pre-configured
properties and the significant
attributes identified during the
attribute importance process for each
segment by now click Submit
the all segments criteria scenario page
displays the scenarios for the selected
segment criteria it includes the name
assigned to each scenario that has been
created for the segment and the status
such as created ready for preview ready
for approval completed with errors
approved or rejected it includes the
number of attributes and the user
provided value for the minimum and
maximum segment centers that the
segmenting process should consider in
addition you can use the toolbar buttons
to edit copy and delete segments
criteria you can execute segment
criteria and all non executed scenarios
for the selected criteria I'll go ahead
and select the execute icon notice of
the status changes to assessment in
progress I'll click the refresh button
until it changes to ready for approval
now let's take a look at the explore
data option you can use the explore data
pop-up to examine data for the segment
criteria you defined you can view the
customer and attribute summary that
provides input into the segmentation
process this screen provides you with
insights about the attribute mining
process which lists the attribute
significance and their correlations the
attributes required for the customer
segmentation process come from different
dimensions such as customers their
households demographics and purchasing
behavior this process helps to eliminate
redundant attributes and to identify the
attributes that may have the most
influence on generating customer
segments
the attribute summary displays
information about data availability and
data quality by providing the attributes
distinct values percentage of nulls
and statistic summaries such as mean
median and standard deviation
along with attribute summaries the
system generates an attribute importance
index that sums up data quality data
distribution and its representation of
each attribute in the data in the
attribute correlation tab the
correlation matrix displays attributes
attribute values and correlations
between customer and products each cell
in the matrix provides a visual
indication of how attributes are
correlated along with the correlation
value the attribute mining process
generates a correlation between customer
attributes and products this information
can help you understand which
combination of customer attributes may
drive product purchase behavior various
colors indicate the strength of
correlation among attributes with
negative one and one indicating strong
Association
you can use the segment setup stage
perform what-if analysis by defining one
or more scenarios that are based on a
specified number of segments and
attributes you can select one or more
attributes based on the attribute
importance index the attribute
importance index guides you when you are
defining the scenario setup using these
scenarios you can experiment with
different numbers of segments and
participating attributes you can either
define the maximum number or the minimum
number of segments or alternatively
define a specific number of segments
that you want to be generated once the
scenarios are generated different
scenarios can be compared you can also
use other features in this stage to copy
or delete scenarios the scenario list
summarizes the characteristics for each
scenario you can copy delete execute and
save a scenario you can also refresh the
scenario list in order to view the
updated scenario status after you select
a scenario and execute it you can see
the results in the segment result stage
the scenario results has two tabs
segments and segments composition the
application uses the data and the
parameters you defined in order to group
customers together that are most similar
according to the characteristics you
selected and to separate customers that
are most dissimilar the graph view shows
the percentage for each attribute in the
segment the segment composition sub tab
breaks down the segment into its
component parts and shows the
percentages for each attribute
the table view shows attributes their
confidence and summary statistics within
each segment the graph view shows the
segment composition by attribute the
scenario list section contains one table
with details about each segment here you
can evaluate KPIs and approve or reject
a segment you can also view the
optimality of the segment's recommended
by the application to determine if
increasing the number of segments beyond
the optimal number is significant I'll
click Next to bring us to the segment
insight stage you can use this segment
insight stage to analyze a scenario its
segments and its hierarchy based on
performance and attribute contributions
prior to the approval of the scenario
this stage includes customer segments
analysis category analysis and
opportunity analysis the customer
segment analysis tab lists all scenarios
the customer segments for each scenario
and the related KPIs aggregates of the
attributes are displayed for each
segment the attributes by default are
included in the grids customer purchase
behavior and customer demographics the
category analysis tab lists the top
categories versus the customer segments
matrix you can analyze the segment
performance in each category using
different sets of attributes such as
sales share or number of trips the
system highlights the top three
performing segments for each category
and you can compare category performance
across segments
the opportunity analysis tab provides a
comparison of the retailer to market
data analysis for the category and
provides an analysis about where there
is an opportunity for the retailer to
grow for each segment you can compare
where the retailer is performing better
by comparing the average sales retail
spend per a configurable time period and
finally to approve the segment we'll
click approve under the action drop-down
as part of this session I showed you how
to create the customer segment and how
you can use this information to describe
and predict customer behavior
