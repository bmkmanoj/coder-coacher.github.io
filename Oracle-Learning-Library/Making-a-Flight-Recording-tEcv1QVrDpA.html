demo of how to make a flight recording
using Java flight recorder and Mission
Control so to start I'm going to just
start a demo application this is a
simple graphics demo that you can get
when you download the JDK there's the
samples and and demos package that you
can get with the JDK for free and this
is this comes with that so if you want
to use this you can get it there so I'm
starting that demo it's going to be
running that's what we're going to be
monitoring and recording and then i'm
going to start your java Mission Control
and we'll do the recordings from there
you can also of course do the recordings
from the command line in various ways
but for this purposes of this screencast
will just use the mission control
interface so first I'm going to right
click this and start the console and
we'll just have that running in the
background as we do our recordings so
that's showing me the live data from the
JVM so to do a recording I'm going to
right-click but instead of choosing
console I'm going to choose start flight
recording like so and you can see here
here's the basic dialogue I can either
do a taught a fixed time recording or a
continuous recording so let's say I can
go for I could do like five minutes so
what that would do is it would record
this JVM for five minutes and then quit
or I can do a continuous recording which
records a certain amount of data so you
could say I want to record the last 50
megabytes of data on this JDM or you
could say I want to record the last five
minutes you type in something like that
and then it'll save the last five
minutes of data from that
jvm and just continue to record all the
time but to start with I think we're
going to do a fixed time recording will
start that and then here we have a
template manager and this is what allows
us to set up what we record so the
default is to show whatever I did last
time but for most situations you
probably would just want to use
continuous and that is the most low
overhead option available and typically
only takes about one percent overhead to
monitor so that's probably your best
option in a production environment for
this example though i think i'm going to
use profiling which has a little bit
higher it's a little more intrusive but
i'm going to turn on everything so you
can see all the features in our
recording so i'm going to go with that
one so i click next and then i get
additional dialogue where i can choose
you know how if i want more information
to be included in this case I'm going to
get try to get quite a bit of stuff so
I'm going to turn on the class loading
and the heap statistics there I'm going
to leave the time set where they are for
exceptions I actually want to get all
exceptions in error so I'm going to
choose that and then the last thing I
want to change is for garbage collection
I want all the data not just normal so
we're gonna do that so this is typically
you typically wouldn't want to really do
this in production this is more if
you're you know trying to troubleshoot a
specific problem or something and this
I'm doing this to just to show you all
the possible data when we get to the
various information from a recording so
I'm going to go ahead and click next and
then I can get even more detailed if you
all these attributes are in here and you
can go in and you have total control
over this you get as detailed as you
want about what information record is
recorded and what isn't you can turn
stuff on and off here and it's totally
up to you so that's the last step I'm
going to go ahead and click finish and
then now our recording should be going
so if I right click and actually not
right click but I'm going
click on that little slider there and
then here we have our flight recording
flight recorder information you can see
I've got one recording going and it's
counting down so you can actually record
more than one at a time so I'm going to
go back here right click i'm going to
start another one this time i'm going to
do a continuous 45 minutes this time
let's just do use continuous that the
the least intrusive 1 i'm going to click
Next I'll take all the defaults for that
I'm going to click finish and so now
I've got two recordings going as you can
see there so I've got this one that's
going for five minutes and then this one
that's going continuously and it's going
to save the last five minutes of data
now if I want to this one won't actually
dump anything out unless I tell it to
like on the command line or if I go in
right here and choose dump and then here
I can choose how much of the recording I
want to dump and so that's how I get
information from a continuous recording
and then I can go in here and edit my
options or stop it or close it and so
basically after to get this recording I
just got to wait till it finishes or to
get this recording of course I would
dump it so that's basically how you do a
recording using Mission Control
