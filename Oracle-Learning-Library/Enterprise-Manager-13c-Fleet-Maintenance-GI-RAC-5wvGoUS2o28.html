demo series today I am going to show you
how to use fleet maintenance to patch a
Grid infrastructure environment and a
rack environment to a new patch level as
you probably know these can be patched
independently as well
but today's demo shows you how to do
them together let's look at the
environment first my current environment
is a grid infrastructure running on top
of Cullen or two that has no PSUs
installed I have a rack database running
on low in 204 that has no pieces
installed my target today is to take the
grid infrastructure environment to
Telenor to running on psu one and rack
to load 204 running on PSU four to help
creating my gold images I've created a
reference environment for both grid
intra as well as ranked so in step one I
use EMC a command DB software
maintenance create software image with
an input file that actually specifies
the name of the image and so on and so
forth right so let's look at how to do
that before I submit it I just want to
show you the content of the input file
the input file specifies the image name
image description reference target name
and the software library location where
this old image will be created it also
specifies the credentials as well as
some you know software library related
parameters finally it provides a version
name for the same gold image since you
can have multiple versions for the same
gold image if this is an important one
to remember now this is how you actually
go ahead and create a gold image I would
do the same for creating lown 204 rack
PhD for as well so I would just go and
submit this exactly as these now as you
can see I have got again another input
file that clearly shows you how to
specify parameters for that
now the part of creation of this cold
image is to see how those images are
created and on how many versions are
there for each of these so let's look at
the image information so get images will
get us all the existing images that got
created out there so we are interested
in and greedy infrastructure home Tolono
- and we're interested in dracula - for
old image as well so given these - you
know we should be able to actually look
at the versions for these images and
then make those versions current alright
so let's look at the Russians were each
of these images since this is a demo
I've created only one version of it so
you will find a single version out here
now this one idea is important when we
want to try to make this particular
version of gold image current so EMC li
TV software maintenance update version
status with the version ID and status
equals current so this would make this
version current meaning if you have
multiple versions you can pick one of
them to make them current now a step two
we take a image and then subscribe our
targets that we have today to that image
so let's take our gradient Pro target
and subscribe it to the image that we
created just now so this is a command
that we would run TV software
maintenance subscribe target and name of
the target and target type its cluster
and image ID
this is of you give it now once this is
done you can actually verify how you
know the subscription looks like let's
run this command to get the image
subscription for this image ID as you
can see there are already listed so this
is a particular you know subscription
that we're interested in this is a name
of our target as we want to patch today
and this is a type cluster and you know
and this is a date on which it is
subscribed
right now once a subscription is done
the next step is for us to create a
shadow for this particular image on the
target that were interested in so deploy
is a first step so how do we do the
deploy DB software maintenance perform
operation you give any name to this
operation and the purpose is to deploy
this a software target list is the one
that we're interested in this target a
target type is cluster provides some
credentials an input file is where this
particular shadow or comb gets created
so let's look at you know how this looks
like says you can see it's the shadow
Oracle home will get created in scratch
click on oj / trouble no double no /
great underscore psg-1 so that's a
location in which this particular you
know this deploy will submit will create
the shadow image so that's how you go
ahead and submit the CM so I so once
this is done the next step is for us to
actually update meaning switch the CI
that is running in the previous
environment to this shadow environment
so the command that we would run is the
MC la DB software maintenance perform
operation provide a name for this and
purpose is to provide purposes update
understood GI target list
Escada + 2 naman a target tape is a
target type is cluster for credentials
has provided a v8 in the deploy as well
so we go ahead and submit this so this
will submit the M cell a command and
automatically the homes will be switched
from the current one to the shadow the
we will do the same operation for the
crack to begin with we'll do the deploy
first which is perform operation we give
a name purposes deploy Iraq software
target list is table own toe for exactly
as what we have their target type is
ranked at a base
Winchell's and privileged credentials
and will provide at the location of the
shadow local home so let's look at this
location so as you can see this is going
to don't owe for endoscopy rc4 that's
the shadow Oracle home location so once
you submit this deploy then the shadow
image gets created and then subsequently
once the shadow home is available we
will run the switch command which is
basically update the database back
database loan to for running to switch
to this llorando for PHP for Oracle home
right so how do we do that let's go
ahead and submit this so this is done so
this is how we actually you know update
a gradient restriction environment and I
reckon moment together to move to a new
patch level that concludes today's demo
