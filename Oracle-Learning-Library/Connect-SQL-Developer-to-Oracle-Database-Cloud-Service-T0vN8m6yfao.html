developer to a database in the Oracle
database cloud service using an SSH
connection first login to the Oracle
database cloud service console to find
the connection details for your cloud
database
click the name of the database to which
you want to connect
to define a sequel developer SSH
connection we need two things from this
overview page write down the service
name of your cloud database you can find
the service name by rolling over the
connect string in the pop-up copy the
portion after the slash also write down
the public IP address
Open sequel developer and from the view
menu select SSH
right click ssh hosts and select new ssh
host
defying the ssh host create a name
provide the cloud databases public IP
address that you wrote down earlier for
username use the oracle linux user
select use key file and browse your
local computer to find the private ssh
key file that you stored that matches
the public key that was generated when
the cloud database deployment was
defined select add a local port forward
leave the name field as default leave
the host field as localhost set the port
field to the listener report number that
you specified when you created the
database deployment keep the default of
automatically assigned local port
note your new SSH host click connections
and select new connection
create a name for the sequel developer
connection in this example we'll connect
with a system user using the
administrative password that was
specified when the cloud database
deployment was defined set the
connection type to SSH the port forward
field lets you choose among SSH hosts
that you defined for service name
provide the service name that you wrote
down earlier
test the connection when the status
shows success save the connection
open this sequel developer connection to
your cloud database
sequel developer is connected to the
database in the Oracle database cloud
service you can see a list of database
objects
now that you were logged into the cloud
database as the system user issue a
simple sequel command to check that you
can access data in the database
and that's all it takes to establish
eights equal developer connection to a
database in the Oracle database cloud
service
