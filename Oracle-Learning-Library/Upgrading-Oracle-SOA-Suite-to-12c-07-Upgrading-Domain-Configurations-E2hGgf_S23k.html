upgrading domain configurations the
seventh in our series of eight videos
about upgrading to Oracle so a suite 12c
as the title suggests in this video
we'll take a look at upgrading domain
configurations with the upgrade
assistant we're about to complete the
last of our core upgrade tasks which is
to upgrade the domain configurations
more precisely
we'll use the upgrade assistant to
upgrade several components including
Oracle Java required files or jrf system
components infrastructure Oracle web
services manager and Oracle user
messaging service
we'll run the upgrade assistant on the
host with the admin server as we did
before then later in the process we'll
pack the changed files up copy them to
the other hosts and unpack them to
ensure that the domain is upgraded
identically on both hosts will invoke
the upgrade assistant the same way we
did to upgrade the database schemas on
the hosts with the admin server will
navigate to Oracle home Oracle common
upgrade bin and run the UA from there
let's invoke the upgrade assistant
the welcome screen appears first no
action items for us here so we proceed
when we use the upgrade assistant to
upgrade our schemas we accepted the
default schemas option this time we want
to upgrade our WebLogic component
configurations so we select that option
when we do were prompted for the
WebLogic domain directory a little bit
tricky here it's offering us a 12c
domain directory path but that's not
what we want let's browse to the 11g
domain that we want to upgrade
double check we've got our 11g domain
directory and click Next this screen
provides a list of components that will
be included in the domain component
configuration upgrade they include Java
required files or jrf system components
infrastructure Oracle web service
manager and user messaging service
there's no actual inputs on this screen
so we proceed we're at the prerequisites
screen and as we saw before it's going
to require us to acknowledge that all
prerequisites have been met before we
continue with the upgrade we need to
check each one of these boxes before we
can continue yes we've done our backup
yes our database version is supported
and yes certification and system
requirements for this upgrade have been
met the upgrade assistant prompts us for
the Linux user and password named for
the host with the remote managed server
we provide that information the examine
screen displays the status of the
upgrade assistant as it examines each
component verifying that the component
is ready for upgrade each of the choices
we've made is listed we have a series of
green check marks it indicates the
examination was successful we also see
the two of the components won't need
upgraded so we click Next the upgrade
summary lets us review a summary of the
options we've selected and to start the
upgrade process so let's go ahead and
click upgrade the upgrade is underway
the upgrade progress screen will show us
the status we reached a hundred percent
so we click Next
the upgrade Success window lists the
newly upgraded WebLogic components if
for any reason your upgrade isn't
successful you can click the view log
button at the bottom of the screen or
note the log file location before
closing the window we've got a series of
green check marks so we're happy let's
go ahead and click close
we've updated the host with the admin
server now we'll use the PAC script to
pack the changed files to be copied to
the other host the PAC command creates a
template archive or jar file that
contains a snapshot of either an entire
domain or a subset of a domain in our
example we'll use a template that
contains a subset of a domain to create
a managed server domain directory
hierarchy on a remote machine will
execute the PAC script from the new 12c
Oracle home we'll pass parameters to the
PAC script indicating the domain we wish
to pack the name of the template and
template file we'll also use the managed
parameter which specifies that the
template is to be used to create managed
servers on remote machines okay let's go
ahead and pack up our changes and the
PAC Command reports success now we'll
copy the newly created template file to
the remote host there's a variety of
ways to do this in our example we're
gonna use the UNIX SCP or secure copy
command to do this we invoke the command
with the name of the file to be copied
followed by user at host name
destination path okay let's copy the
template file to the other host provide
our password and the files copied when
you use the unpack command with a
managed server template it creates a
managed server domain directory which
includes just the files necessary for a
managed server domain executing the
command on-screen we'll unpack the
template file named so a domain upgrade
template jar to the specified domain
directory we're also using the overwrite
domain parameter which instructs unpack
to overwrite the domain directory if it
already exists okay we're on the remote
server let's go ahead and unpack our
managed server domain directory
our domain is successfully unpacked time
to move on to our post upgrade tasks at
this point we've completed the core
upgrade tasks but there's still a few
things to do before we start our new 12c
environment to ensure that our
components continue to function as
expected for more information about
those tasks be sure to watch the next
video in this series performing post
upgrade tasks and verifying success
until then I'm Ron pinkerton thank you
for your time and attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
