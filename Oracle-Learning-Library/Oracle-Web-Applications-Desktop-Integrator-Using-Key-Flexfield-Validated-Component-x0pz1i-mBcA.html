manager from Arkell I'm responsible for
integration related products from Oracle
e-business suite and web applications
Desktop integrator is one of them here I
have a tutorial on how to use key flex
field component from custom integrator
this tutorial is in for system
integrators implementers and developers
who are working on developing custom
maybe the integrators to extend a
business faith application
I have reproduce its you should be
familiar with a business sweet concepts
and the relevant ebusiness suite
application and you should know about
web applications desktop integrator how
it behaves and you should be aware of
key flex phase concepts as well the
objective of this tutorial is to learn
how to associate key flex feel validated
UI component in custom integrator and to
see how it works let us consider a
sample use case we'll make use of
location key flex field from Oracle
assets we will create a dummy table to
hold on the asset description and few
segment columns for the key flex field
we will register the table in and then
we will create a custom abdi in to
create error making use of desktop
integration framework UI we will
associate a key flex field component to
one of the interface attributes then we
will define and layout preview the
integrator and as part of that step we
will upload data from the spreadsheet
and finally we will verify the entries
from back in so here is a table to hold
on the asset description and the segment
values I'll run the sequel statements
table is created I
just at the table using 80 packages I
just fired a select query now let's look
at the definition of location key flex
fail I login as Operations user now we
give to application developer
responsibilities expand flex fail and
expand key menu click on segments now
query for location flex field
location flex field has one structure
and it has allowed for dynamic insults
that means that if my custom web area
integrator makes use of the location
flex field then I should be able to
upload a new combination of the values
from the spreadsheet and that should get
added to the combinations table of the
location flex field now let's view the
segments defined for this flex field it
has four segments country state city and
building and all four of them are
displayed and enabled now let us see the
definition of the segment's country
segment is associated with a value set
which is an independent list of values
state segment is also associated with a
value set and it also has a list of
values and again it is independent so
it's not a dependent list of value you
can similarly view the definition of the
remaining segments and I'll skip them
just for now if he locations is the
combinations table associated with
location key flex field now we will see
the values associated with the segment
one Australia it has one valid
combination associated with country as
Australia so let's get started we will
create a custom web EDI integrator using
the desktop integration framework
navigate to desktop integration manager
responsibility
click create integrator provide
integrator name
owning application
click on display in create document page
define security rules by adding
functions click next provide interface
name and we'll make use of the custom
table as the interface table this is the
table that we created selected and apply
interface is created for the integrated
selected to view the interface
attributes interface attributes are
created by default for each of the
columns in the custom table now key
flicks field is a group validation that
means that the values in segments one
two three four will be validated
together as a group so for keyfitz field
type of validation we need to create a
custom interface attribute and that will
act as a parent for this segments one
two three and four and we will associate
the validation rules to that custom
interface attribute that acts as a
parent click add attribute to define the
custom interface attribute name it and
select a proper data type ensure that
this KF of parent attribute is enabled
and displayed
I will leave the default prompts and
define the user hint text that will be
shown in the spreadsheet click apply now
we see the custom interface attribute DF
of parent added to the list of interface
attributes now uncheck the display
checkbox for each of the segment columns
these segment columns will not be shown
in the spreadsheet now we will define
the group validation click view group
click define group give group name and
the parent attribute select KF of parent
select the validation type for the
parent attribute select key flux fail
group validation details region is
refreshed with the fields required for
key flex field enter and select location
flex field use default validation entity
and select new for concat segment values
now enter and select a component name as
reflex component that is the default
component provided by web EDI for key
flex fields now select a interface
attribute segment 1 to 4 as group
members click apply view group details
return to the interfaces page move to
the next step of the integrator wizard
we will skip content and move next
create uploader from the template
a polluter created from the template has
by default four parameters I'm going to
delete the import parameter because I
don't plan to make use of the importer
as part of this demo I'm done with my
integrated definition I click on submit
now I will create a layout for the
integrator select integrator and click
define layout create layout give a name
and move next if you notice we have a
set add a description and attribute
seven attributes seven is the key F of
parent I will select all these columns
and click apply now let's just the
integrator select the integrator and
click preview I will use the default
viewer and click Next click create
document the video document is being
created so here we are we have asset ID
description and location key flex field
if you notice we have the titles coming
from the key flex field definition for
the location segments ALPHAN Cilla query
to ensure that there are no values in
the interface table before I upload the
data now
I volunteered my Valley for the asset ID
and description double-click the column
corresponding to the key flex field key
flex field UI is rendered I will skip
the search alias part so here I have the
location flex field and I have an option
to select the value from LOV for each of
the segments I will select Australia as
the country as chip the existing
combinations for Australia as country we
have one combination for Australia I
will selected click select it validates
the combination now I will make an entry
for the new combination for Australia
double click the column four key flex
field select Australia's country
existing combination is for Sydney I
will create a new combination for both
state is not applicable select city s
both and select administration as the
building click combinations there are no
existing combination with these values
click continue click select
now let's upload these values navigate
to our common in the spreadsheet click
upload
select flag drawers and click upload
both rows are uploaded let's verify the
entries in interface table you see the
values are uploaded properly for the
segments now let's check the combination
stable for location key flex field which
is the fa location stable I'll run in
select query for segment 1 as Australia
now you see we have a new combination
added for port which we have added from
the spreadsheet so this concludes the
demo and I hope it was helpful here are
few references for web EDI and the stop
integration framework and I have my
email it was provided here feel free to
reach me for any queries and you can
reach me with your suggestions and
feedback as well thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
