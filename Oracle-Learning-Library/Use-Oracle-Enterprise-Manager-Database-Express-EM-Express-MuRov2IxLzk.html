eeehm Express video my name is Maria
Billings I work for Oracle server
technologies curriculum in this demo
I'll show you where to find information
about a.m. Express how to start it and
give you an overview over the database
homepage Oracle Enterprise Manager
database Express 12c or M Express for
short is a tool built inside the
database of that tool that supports
basic database administration tasks as
well as performance management tasks
because M Express has no meteor or
middleware components the overhead on
the database server is really minor if
you wish to read more about the tool
before starting it you can consult the
Oracle database today DBA documentation
it tells you that you can start a M
Express by providing the hostname : 5 5
0 0 port /e M by default what do you
need to do when you're not sure if
you're working with a default
configuration or not you can use the
DBMS X DB config package as shown on the
slide to find out of which port numbers
were used if the verm is placed or if
they were not written down during
installation if you found out that you
do need to configure HTTP you can also
do that with this package to summarize
the non default setup erine requirements
include an entry in the local listener
and the TNS names file
eeehm Express is a servlet built on top
of Oracle XML DB the Oracle axonal DB
default wallet is a self signed
certificate and some browsers consider
self signed certificate as untrusted
because they are not signed by a trusted
certificate authority so the self signed
certificate is still secure as it
ensures
that the traffic is encrypted between
the Oracle XML DD server and the client
the browser in this case so what that
means is the first time you log in you
need to accept the security exception
for the e MX Plus URL in your web
browser then you enter a valid DBA
username and password the various
sections on the database homepage
provide information about the
environment and the status of the
database for example you see that this
database has been up for a certain
amount of time that it does not have any
backup and recovery running the
archivist stop you see there were no
incidents in the last 24 hours you can
see running jobs then to the right with
all these graphs if you move your cursor
over the graph you see on the right how
the legend is highlighted and you see
detailed information similar here in the
data storage section you see that the
user data take up more space than system
answers aux you can look at pool
information memory the user or if there
are any Veda activities and so on
at the bottom of the page you see
long-running sequel statements that may
affect the performance of your database
if you discover any potential problem
you can click on that particular area or
you can use these menu items to
specifically drill down for example into
the current database properties memory
usage we have storage here security and
performance about each of these menu
items we will have a separate
demonstration you have immediate access
here to the help system the Oracle
online documentation to forums as well
as the technology Network you see the
user is which you are locked in of
course you should really not be working
a system unless it is demo or you can
log out from the system and one item
that I would like to highlight is the
Refresh icon here if you wish the page
to refresh do use this icon do not use
the browser reload which has a different
functionality Oracle Enterprise Manager
database Express has more functionality
than I could show in such a short
overview video for example it's
compatible with multi-tenant container
databases it can be used with a single
rack database and we have already
created several additional videos more
may be coming so please keep checking on
ll thanks for watching this
