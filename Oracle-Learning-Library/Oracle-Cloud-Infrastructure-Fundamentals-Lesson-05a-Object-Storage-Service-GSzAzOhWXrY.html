are going to go over the Oracle cloud
infrastructure object storage service as
part of this lesson we will go over
major concepts related to the object
storage service what are the basic tiers
available to the end-users and also
learn how to manage buckets and objects
in an object storage at the end we will
also talk about object storage
multi-part upload feature and the AWS s3
compatibility API alright so let's move
forward the Oracle cloud infrastructure
object storage service is an internet
scale high-performance durable storage
platform that offers reliable and
cost-effective data durability the
object storage service can store an
unlimited amount of unstructured data of
any content type including analytic data
and rich content like images and videos
data is managed as objects and not as
files or blocks it is not managed by any
storage protocol but rather uses the
standard HTTP methods such as HTTP GET
HTTP put these these these are the
examples of those moreover with object
storage you can safely and securely
store or retrieve data directly from the
Internet or you can do it from within
the cloud platform using multiple
management interfaces that let you
easily manage storage at scale one last
one last thing to mention about object
storage is that object storage is
completely independent of the compute
server and is a regional service so as
long as you have the object storage
endpoints and relative at authorization
you can access the data basically from
anywhere over the Internet
so once
now that we have just gotten a bit of
overview of the object storage let's
talk about some of the common use cases
of the objects related self object
storage service offers a scalable
storage platform which enables you to
not only store data sets but also
operate seamlessly making it an ideal
storage solution for big data
applications we also have a Hadoop
distributed file system connector which
lets your Apache Hadoop Legation read
and write data directly to and from the
object storage service another common
use case is backup or archive where data
is typically written once and read many
times or the data is to be archived for
longer periods of time the durability
and the low cost characteristics of
objects to his tears make it a perfect
platform to store long living data and
we will talk about those different tiers
in coming slides objects stories can
also use can also be used as a content
repository for storing different kinds
of data and then you can basically scale
it seamlessly as the data grows and some
of the additional use cases or include
log data analysis and storing large data
sets for instance in IOT data so within
the object storage there are some very
there are some like key resources which
you need to understand when you're
operating the object storage as we
discussed earlier all individual data
elements are stored as an object
regardless of the content type each
object is stored in a bucket and is a
combination of object itself and its
metadata the metadata is a list of key
value pairs of data for example name of
that object that you have says saved
size a content type the last modified
date etc so basically the object itself
has two basic things the object and the
metadata which is associated with your
checked next is the bucket so bucket is
a logical container created by the user
and can contain unlimited number of
objects a bucket is associated with a
single compartment which in turn defines
policies that indicate what actions a
user can perform on a bucket her names
places a logical entity that let gets
created with a tenant and spans all
compartment in that tenant so basically
when you create a tenant for the first
time a namespace by default gets created
with the same tenant name and that spans
all compartments in your tenant within a
single namespace the bucket names are
unique and buckets and objects in a
namespace are in flat hierarchy but you
can create directory structures for your
own ease within that flat hierarchy that
they are in and for compartments
basically compartments is an identity
and access management concept and we
have already touched base on the
compartment in the very first lesson of
this foundational series so moving
forward some of the object storage
service features so first of all it is
strongly consistent so object storage is
a strong consistency mode which means
that there is a read at a request made
you are guaranteed a consistent most
recent copy of the data that has been
completely did in the system we have a
high performance Network where lookups
for data are fast and consistent
secondly to provide durability the
object storage service of copies object
data throughout the region across
multiple availability domains data
integrity is maintained with active
scrubbing functions typically there are
three to six copies of a given object in
the service the data on the object
stored is always encrypted each object
has its own key and then object keys are
encrypted with a master key which is
frequently rotated
the encryption scheme is robust now we
only talked about that there are
multiple storage tiers that Oracle cloud
infrastructure supports let's have a
quick look what are the different tiers
which are available so whenever you are
creating a bucket currently the object
storage services provides two different
type of storage tiers the standard
storage tier is for the frequently
accessed data any ATAR stored in this
tier is retrieved immediately and
instantly data accessibility and
performance justifies a higher price
point to store data in this standard
here once a standard storage bucket is
created it cannot be downgraded to end
to an archive storage tier the other
option is for the archive storage tier
this is for data that is not frequently
accessed but must be preserved for
longer periods of thought 4/4 time while
storing data in archive storage a
minimum 90-day retention period is
required removal of the data before that
results in a penalty fee once the data
is uploaded in archive storage it first
needs to be restored to before it can be
accessed and the time to first byte
is for arts so whenever you are
downloading the trt DFP time the time to
first fight is for arts but the total
time for full restauration depends on
the size of the data that you have
stored so moving forward let's talk
about how to manage buckets and objects
creating a bucket is very
straightforward you log in into 110 and
choose a region where you want to create
a bucket navigate to the storage service
and choose an object storage within the
object storage service click on create
pocket when the create bucket window
pops up provide a name and remember
bucket names are unique within a
namespace or tenant and choose a storage
tier
a standard storage tier or on our tape
storage tier once you have chosen that
click on create bucket to create a
bucket in that region for uploading an
object click the bucket you just created
and it shows you the list of all the
objects in that bucket
it also shows additional info of the
bucket like if the if it's a public
bucket or a private one what's the name
space of the bucket excetera
now click on the upload object and
browse to the file you want to upload
here you can also change the name of the
object click upload object and the
object is uploaded it is also possible
to delete or download objects so there
are initial some concepts related to
managing a bucket the first is the pre
authenticated requests so pre
authenticated requests allows users to
access the buckets or its objects why a
unique time-bound URL for example if you
want to create a pre authenticated
request for the file that we just
uploaded in the last step you will be
provided with a unique URL and you will
choose the time till it can remain
active you can create delete or list pre
authenticated requests using the console
using the CLS DK to access the API
another important khamseh concept is the
concept of public pockets whenever you
create a bucket it is by default private
however we do support anonymous
unauthenticated occur access to a bucket
by a public buckets you can make a
bucket public by enabling read access to
the bucket users would then be able to
list the contents of a public pocket to
download bucket objects since a bucket
can have
unlimited number of objects one common
ask is - how to upload such huge chunks
of files for that object storage
services offers a multi-part upload
feature to efficiently upload large
files you can segment your file into
smaller parts and then upload these
parts in parallel objects toilettes
supports up to 10,000 parts per file and
a part can be as small as 10 MB using
multi-part upload not only significantly
reduces the upload time but also
minimizes the impact of network failures
if a part fails for instance to upload
for any reason you can retry to upload
the parts instead of having to upload
the entire file this is currently
offered by our API and SDK particle
recommends that for any data that is
larger than 100 MB we should use
multi-part the maximum size for an
uploaded object is 10 terabytes and the
object parts must be no large larger
than 50 gigs so this is one of the new
features of the object storage service
customers can now use the Amazon s3
compatibility API in addition to the OCI
native API to manage OCI object storage
so any tools and applications that
integrate with Amazon s3 api can be
migrated to the oracle cloud
infrastructure without having to rip and
replace the aps this also helps promote
an open cloud platform where the
customers data will never be logged in
there are some differences which are
highlighted here and should be
considered during design you will get
more information in on the documentation
itself on the differences as well
alright so that actually sums up our
object storage lesson here is a quick
summary of what we learned in this
lesson thank you for joining us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
