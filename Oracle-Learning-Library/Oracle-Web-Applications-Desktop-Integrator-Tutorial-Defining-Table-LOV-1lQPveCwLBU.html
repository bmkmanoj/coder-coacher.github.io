hi I am ray coyote lead product manager
for integration related products from
application technology group of Oracle
e-business wait I have been receiving
few queries on how to define table
validated eloise such as how to define a
table Aloha we component and then have
to use that from an custom integrator
that is defined from the stop
integration framework so I thought of
coming up with a tutorial and here it is
this tutorial is for integration
developers who are planning to define
custom web EDI integrators using desktop
integration framework you are expected
to be familiar with the concepts of our
web applications desktop integrator or
web EDI and the relevant ebusiness suite
application such as the chairman's or
SEM for which you are planning to design
the web EDI integrator now we know that
web Edie I suppose different types of UI
widgets such as lists of values or
eloise and then that there are different
types of eloise such as stable validated
lob the objective of this tutorial is to
learn to define table validated lob that
displays a meaningful information to the
end user in the lob as well as in the
spreadsheet but when the user uploads a
data to e-business suite we internally
store the corresponding ID or the code
instead of the meaningful value we will
use a sample use case to upload supplies
information to custom table so the first
step would be to prepare the database
objects such as defining the custom
table to store the supplier information
and the shipment we our information then
in the second step will create custom
integrator and we are going to use a
table based interface and the table be
in the supplier table then we will
define the interface attribute
properties such as the Proms or that
column headers in the spreadsheet and
then some of the property suggests
normal and required columns etc and then
we will create uploader from the
template so please note one of the
columns that will be shown in the
spreadsheet is the shipment via or the
ship via column and we are going to use
the table LOV against that column so we
define the table LOV component for that
interface attribute and then associate
the table lob component to the ship via
interface attribute within the
integrated definition and then we define
the layout for integrator preview or
test the integrator into sample data and
verify the uploaded data in the backend
here is the definition of the custom
table that will store the supplies
information create the table by
selecting the definition and clicking on
the execute button the table is created
now we register this table using the ad
script
custom supplies table and its columns
are registered now now I'm using a
custom lookups table to store the
shipment buyer information this is just
an example to use a custom lookup table
you can always use a friendly lookup
table to store the shipment for your
information
now register the custom lookup table
along with its columns using the ad
script
insert some sample data to custom lookup
table
initially custom supplies table is empty
that is there are no records in it
there are five records in the custom
lookup table that will be used for the
ship via lookup now let us look at the
steps to create integrator login as
operations user or as an user who has
access to desktop integration manager
responsibility
our applications homepage is displayed
navigate to desktop integration manager
responsibility
click create integrative function if I
step wizard to create the integrator
definition is displayed enter integrated
name and an internal name and then the
application
for the sake of simplicity I am
selecting web applications desktop
integrator as the owner application
define security rules by adding one or
more functions and the users having
rights to this functions will be able to
use the integrator
again for the sake of simplicity I am
selecting desktop integration create
document function
click Next enter interface name
interface type is stable so we are not
going to change that and we'll be using
the custom supply stable
select the custom suppliers table and
click apply table type of interface is
created now select the interface to view
the list of interface attributes now if
you see these are the list of columns
that we have defined for the custom
table and the same are appearing as the
interface attributes for this interface
and now if you'll notice some of the
values which is the prompt left and the
default type for the creation date are
pre selected we will click on update
interface attribute icon to give
meaningful name to the prompts select
Naughton l4 supplier ID interface
attribute but please note we haven't
defined this constraint while defining
the table but here we are defining it as
not null for the interface attribute
the Proms are pre-populated with the
table column name we can change it to
give a meaningful name to be displayed
in the spreadsheet
similarly I've changed the prompt for an
active date
for supplier name I'll make it as the
required field and change the prompt as
well
required ensures that this column is
included for all the layouts that is
defined for the integrator whereas not
nell ensures that a value is mandatory
provided for this interface attribute
save the changes similarly change the
prompt for VAT registration number
prompt above is the text that is used as
column header when this interface
attribute is selected to be displayed at
the line
item if this interface attribute is
displayed as the header or context
related information in the spreadsheet
then we use the prompt left
similarly change prompt Russia Priya
now that we have defined the interface
attribute properties we will navigate to
the next step our risk is does not
include downloading content so we'll
skip the step this is uploaded step you
can create uploaded from existing
definitions or from template select from
template click create a plural is
created from the template and by default
there are three upload parameters one
for Rose validation and import I'll
chase the title delete the upload
parameter for import because our use
case does not include the importer step
click Submit our custom integrator is
successfully created now we will create
table aloha component for ship via
interface attribute
now we get to desktop integration
manager responsibilities
click manage components function this is
the components list page click on create
component enter display name internal
name on the owner application
the owner application should be the same
as the owner application of integrator
so I'm selecting web applications
desktop integrator
select lob table as the component type
click apply the component is created and
the saw the list of parameters that are
by default generated for this component
table select column and table column
alias these two component parameters
should hold the interface attribute name
of column that will be populated by the
lob in the spreadsheet
hence enter ship via lookup code for
table column alias as well as table
select column table columns is the comma
separated column names of the lookup
table that will be shown in the lob
component in term inning comma
description ask the table columns
Tibble hair does hold display name for
table columns
you can configure the lob window that
will be displayed in the spreadsheet you
can provide the caption the height and
the width
click apply to save the component
parameters value
now associate this table Aloha component
to the ship via interface attribute in
the integrator definition now we get to
manage integrate dysfunction within this
top integration manager search for the
integrator that we just created source
custom our Oracle helps you in filtering
the data select custom click update icon
navigate to interface this step select
interface to view the list of interface
attributes click update interface
attribute icon for ship where lookup
code
select validation type we need the
values entered in Shiva a look up code
to be validated against the custom
lookup table that we created so select
the validation type as stable this
section is refreshed with the values or
fields required for table validation ID
column is a mandatory field it should
hold the lookup table column name whose
value will be populated in the suppliers
table so we want to populate the lookup
code in the suppliers table meaning
column it is the lookup table column
name whose value will be populated in
the spreadsheet validation entity it is
the table column name of the lookup
table where Clause is used to filter the
data that will be shown in the lob
search for the component that we created
select lob type pop list displays a
static list of values whereas the
standard post data or the runtime and
shows in the LOI we will use standard
lob type provide user hint text for the
lob
and save submit the changes
now let us define layout for the
integrator select integrator and click
define layout
click create layout inter layout name
as we had defined earlier supplying
nning is a required field for all
layouts select placement align select
supplier ID part registration number and
ship where lookup code these three
columns will be shown in addition to the
supplier name in the spreadsheet
click Next change wait for the supply
name save changes by clicking apply
now preview or test the integrator
definition select integrator and click
on preview
you
bibbidi a document is created click
close
into the supply ID supply name and park
registration number
double-click corresponding ship real
cell this is the LOV that is displayed
based upon the component that we had
defined notice the meaning and
description columns displayed here
select one of the values notice that
ship we are cell is populated with the
meaning value similarly enter more
records
notice here that FedEx is the meaning
value whereas Federal Express is the
description value when you select that
row FedEx the meaning value is populated
in the ship way of column enter another
row and this time instead of using the
lov we will enter a value directly in
the cell for ship via
navigate to a dense access or Camino to
navigate to upload function
applaud page is displayed based upon the
uploaded definition that we had defined
earlier in the integrator accept the
default values and click on upload all
the three rules have been successfully
uploaded
now let us verify the data that is
stored in supplies table again here are
the values that are stored in the custom
lookup table we have lookup code meaning
and description please note the lookup
code against the DHL air and the FedEx
as well as the airborne Express now let
us look at the values that are stored in
the custom suppliers table please note
the ship fare lookup code column is
populated with the lookup code instead
of the meaning that we had seen in the
spreadsheet
