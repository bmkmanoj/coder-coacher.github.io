Enterprise Manager plow control 12c demo
series the presentation today is on best
practices for Fusion Applications
management target organization
navigation and metrics Oracle Enterprise
Manager 12c cloud control in conjunction
with the Fusion Applications plugin also
known as the application management pack
for Fusion Applications forms the
cornerstone of Oracle's best practices
for managing Fusion Applications
Enterprise Manager along with the plugin
provides essential and unique
capabilities for managing Fusion
Applications in this presentation will
have the opportunity to cover just a
small portion of all the capabilities of
enterprise manager in the plugin will be
covering fusion apps target organization
and navigation as well as the associated
metrics for fusion applications this is
the home page for Fusion Applications
the discovery process in the fusion apps
plug-in provides out-of-the-box
recognition for all fusion application
targets this particular home page shows
a single fusion apps instance with the
underlying product families such as CRM
HCM and financials in a customer
environment with multiple instances
obviously all those instances would
appear on this page Fusion apps are
organized hierarchically an enterprise
manager in the following order by
instance whether that's test Qi or
production by product family which is
crm 8 cm or financials by the individual
products within that product family such
as general ledger payables receivables
by the clusters that support that
product and then finally with the
individual applications that comprise
that product as well this organization
facilitates and expedites the process of
troubleshooting and root cause analysis
there are a multitude of ways to access
actionable information on fusion
applications for one of the most
intuitive ways is by simply clicking on
either the product family or individual
product in this example let's assume
that we've received an alert on the
availability or performance of our
general ledger product
simply by clicking on the GL we're able
to quickly and easily access all the
pertinent firm ation that will help us
identify and diagnose our issue we find
ourselves now in the product homepage
for general ledger there are a few key
aspects to point out here first
out-of-the-box organization of the page
provides users with the most commonly
used regions including drill down
capabilities into the cluster servers
and j2ee apps that support the product
the topology of the product incident
manager dashboards and key performance
indicators second the homepage is
comprised of regions that can be
customized and rearranged to suit
different users third users can leverage
the tree navigation on the left to
access additional information on
so-and-so infrastructure weblogic
domains and servers and other fusion
application products lastly and perhaps
most importantly drop-down menus provide
access to key information such as
monitoring with access to fusion apps
and tech stack metrics and metric
settings ESS summaries and also incident
manager users can also access topologies
configuration and compliance in a number
of other key monitoring and management
functions for this particular product
let's now turn to Fusion Applications
metrics metrics with associated
thresholds and alerts are the
cornerstone of proactive management
there are more than 100 different
metrics currently available for fusion
applications in many more metrics
available for the underlying technology
stack in fact one of the unique aspects
of enterprise manager is the ability to
correlate fusion apps activity with the
underlying text activity on both an ad
hoc and historical basis let's review
the metrics associated with the
receivables product which I've recently
set up in my favorites if I switch my
view I can see all metrics and I can
quickly see that there are about 10
different metrics for receivables by
opening one of those up we can get a
better understanding on the different
capabilities of metrics so there's a lot
going on in this page starting at the
top with corrective action corrective
actions are designed to automate
to an event there are a number of ways
to create or configure corrective action
including scripting from an OS command
or using a procedure that has been
stored in the enterprise manager
software library the classic example is
if a workflow service goes down and
therefore generates a critical alert the
corrective action would attempt to
restart that particular service next on
this page are thresholds as you might
imagine we can attach warning and
critical threshold limits that will
generate notifications we can place a 5
as a warning threshold and at 10 as a
critical threshold in this particular
scenario if we have higher than a ten
percent failure rate on auto invoice we
would be notified as a critical
threshold the real gem on this page is
that the system can assist you in
defining these particular thresholds the
threshold suggestion feature will help
you arrive at ideal limits based on
actual historical data users need to
specify threshold values and pick a time
period as reference the chart will then
display how often that limit would have
been breached as well as provide
specific values such as high low or
average values users can then adjust
their limits accordingly unfortunately
in this particular case there's no data
in the system and therefore no
recommendations are actually generated
once metrics have been set
administrators can begin monitoring
their environments proactively the last
feature that I'd like to show is how
a.m. correlates both fusion apps metrics
with the underlying tech stack metrics
this is accomplished via key performance
indicators users can mix and match
different metrics and monitor how they
interact as you can see I'm able to
correlate fusion apps metrics with
underlying technology metrics such as
CPU utilization and memory utilization
once I select these metrics in my
palette they appear alongside the fusion
apps metrics and I can begin to monitor
and analyze their joint behavior in real
time or over a user-defined period of
time
this concludes the presentation on best
practices for Fusion Applications
