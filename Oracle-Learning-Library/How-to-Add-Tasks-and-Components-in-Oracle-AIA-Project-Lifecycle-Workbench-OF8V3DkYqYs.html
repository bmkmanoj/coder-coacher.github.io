principal curriculum developer here at
Oracle in this demo I'll show you how to
create a business task and a service
solution component in oracle AI a
project lifecycle workbench here an AAA
project lifecycle workbench we have one
project already defined which is the aia
demo project let's edit this project and
it takes you to the description page
where you can see a description of the
projects business process let's look at
the business tasks and here you see all
the business tasks that comprise the aia
demo project a business task is a series
of activities that is completed in a
specific order to achieve a desired
output adding business tasks is part of
the functional decomposition of the
business process and is typically
performed by the solution architect so
let's add a new business task that will
name credit card validation note that
for this demonstration the credit card
validation business task that exists in
the original aia demo application has
been removed so we're recreating it now
let's expand the task and here you can
enter a description for the business
task I'm going to paste one here and now
we'll save and return and now we can see
the credit card validation business task
listed in the aia demo projects business
task if we hover the mouse over it we
can see the description that we just
entered
now we'll add a service solution
component of the business task we're
actually decomposing the business task
here we're describing at a high level
one of the system components required to
complete the task of validating the
credit card this component will
eventually be realized by using an
already existing service or implementing
a brand new service in this case we're
adding a service solution component for
a provider application business
connector service or a bcs this is
required to connect to the external
credit card validation service and the
product code is AAA demo application the
values in this drop-down lists match the
applications in the application object
library folder in the source control and
for the name will enter process credit
charge authorization ccv provider a bcs
this is a descriptive name and not an
actual service implementation name to
complete the definition will add a
description here we document the purpose
of the provider a bcs and i'll paste in
the description here and save and return
and now when we look at the credit card
validation business task we can see the
server solution requests that we just
entered so now in developers use the AAA
service constructor and jdeveloper they
will be able to select the server
solution request and use it to actually
implement the a bcs that's it for the
demo on how to create business tasks and
server solution components in AAA
project lifecycle workbench
