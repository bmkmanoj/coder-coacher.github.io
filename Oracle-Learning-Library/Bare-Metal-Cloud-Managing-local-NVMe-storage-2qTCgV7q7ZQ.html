solutions architecture at Oracle cloud
Oracle cloud bare-metal instances
include high performance low latency and
via me SSD devices the high i/o instance
type has for 3.2 terabyte drives for a
total of twelve point eight terabytes of
space the dense ILO instance shape
includes nine 3.2 terabyte drives for a
total of 28 point 8 terabytes of space
it's important for customers to
understand that these locally attached
SSDs are not protected or redundant in
any way the Oracle cloud provides no
raid no snapshots and no native backup
ability for these volumes customers are
responsible for the durability of data
on these local nvme SSD devices the
risks customers need to protect against
include the failure of a single and vme
device the loss of an instance or an
entire availability domain an
application or user error the best way
to protect against an individual device
failure is a raid array the Linux tool
MD admin builds and monitors software
raid arrays
customers are free to configure their
local rate arrays in any way that's
appropriate for their use case we're
going to cover some example and best
practices configurations
the raid options differ based on the
instance type for high IO instances most
customers are going to use a raid 10
across all four SSDs this results in a
fast array with 6.4 terabytes of usable
space that can survive the failure of
any single device and may survive the
failure of two devices another option on
the high io instances are to raid one
arrays with two raid 1 arrays you get
isolated IO for example one one for your
data and another for your log files 6.4
terabytes of usable storage they can
survive the failure of any single device
and may survive the failure of - another
option is raid 6 across all four SSDs
rate six uses dual parity which means
you still have six point four terabytes
of usable space but you can survive the
failure of any two devices raid 6 is
excellent if you need additional
durability but it is slightly slower
than the previous two examples customers
using dense IO instances have more raid
options because there's more drives in
the instance one option is raid 6 across
all 9 SSDs this results in a single one
with about 24 terabytes of space that
will survive the failure of any two
devices for database customers a 4
device raid 10 and 5 device raid 6 array
is an excellent option this results in
two arrays with isolated IO for data and
log files with 6.4 terabytes and 9.6
terabytes of usable space respectively a
very high speed option is a raid 10
array across 8 devices a raid 10 array
always has to have an even number of
devices so we use the last and ninth
device as a hot spare another high
performance option is to raid 10 arrays
of 4 devices each to Lunz with isolated
IO each with 6.4
bytes of space and a global hot spare
customers also need to protect against
the failure of an instance or an
availability domain the best way to do
this is replicate the data set to a
second availability domain there's
multiple options for cross ad
replication
there's our sync there's dr BD Oracle
database customer should use data guard
the availability domains were designed
specifically to be close enough together
to support synchronous replication the
final failure scenario that customers
need to protect against is an
application or user error here we use
traditional backup solutions Oracle
database customers can use arm and
backups to a traditional target or to
the Oracle cloud object store
you
is a raid away as a way away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
