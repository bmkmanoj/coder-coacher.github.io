application of the oracle application
container cloud here's how this is a
list of the types of applications you
can deploy i'm going to deploy a java SE
application i start by entering some
basic information for the application
I'm deploying an embedded Tomcat
application in this example the
application is a simple employee
directory for the name I'm going to call
this employee web app next I'm going to
search and select the application
archive now I need to get the archive
from either my local system or the
Oracle cloud storage path or i can pick
one of the sample applications provided
i've browsed the file system and
selected my application archive the
application archive name appears here
the service is verifying that the
archive is formatted correctly and that
it can read the manifest file I verified
the archive the information that i
already added is still there i can set
the number of instances and the size of
the container that since the size of the
container not the heap for java the
version of java i'm using is also
displayed if i want to have more
instances running to start i can
configure that right here and the same
with memory size for the container if
you think you need more memory that can
all be customized right here now I
create the application a confirmation
message is displayed the name I gave the
application employee web app shows up at
the top the important thing here is that
under resources I see the number of
instances and the memory size that I
selected or there it can take several
minutes for the application to actually
be deployed on the service once the
application is fully deployed the
informational message disappears that's
how to deploy an application the
application can also be deployed from
the command line using the REST API
