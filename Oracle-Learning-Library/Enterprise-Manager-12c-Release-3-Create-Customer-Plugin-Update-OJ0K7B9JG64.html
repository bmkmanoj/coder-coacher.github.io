in this demonstration I will show you
how to push plug in patches while doing
agent upgrade or deployment to push any
plug-in patches we need to create a
custom plug-in update through EMC li
step one to create a custom plug-in
update you will need a test agent with
the required plugins deployed and
patches applied step 2 now you can
create custom plugin update of the
plugin on this asian custom plugin
update creates a zip of the plugin home
located on the agent after custom plugin
update is created any plugin deployment
operation for the plugin on any agent
while doing agent deployment or upgrade
will pick the custom plugin update along
with the patches in this demo I have a
test agent where I have 1200 for DB
plugin and I have applied few dummy
patches on DB plugin go to setup managed
cloud control agents on the agent
homepage scroll down and click Oracle
home and patch details
the table on the right hand side shows
different patches of line I have created
quantum a patch that ends with 800 74 d
be plugging and another dummy patch 8031
for fusion middleware plugin note these
are the dummy patches created for this
demo go to the OMS home bin AMC lie and
login into mcl I run Bob insulin list
plug-in on server to view the list of
plugins deployed on the server and to
get information on plug-in IV and
version
to create custom plug-in update for the
DB on the test agent run this command
plugin ID can be obtained from the list
plug-in on server now we have created a
custom plug-in update for DB plugin the
custom plugin update is created for each
plug-in version provision run list
custom plug-in update command to view
the list of all custom plug-in updates
created on this OMS the output of this
custom plug-in hybrid shows we have
created a custom plug-in update for DV
plugin 12 10 4 version to view the list
of patches listed in a particular
plug-in update run this command
the output of the command shows us that
we have one patch of light on the DB
plugin which ends with 8007 let's create
another custom plugin update for the
fusion middleware plugin run the command
teams you like create custom plugin
update
let's run list custom plug-in updates to
view the total number of plug-in updates
on the so ms the output of the command
shows now we have to custom plugin
updates one is on fusion middleware and
another one is on database now to see
the patches that are included in this
fusion middleware custom plug-in update
we can again run they come so there is
one patch included in Fusion Middleware
custom plug-in update which ends with
8031 note these are dummy patches for
this demo also note that custom plug-in
update is not platform dependent they
are gendrich let's go to the plugin
manager console in UI and check if the
custom plugin updates are visible or not
extensibility plugins click on oracle
database plug-in at the bottom of the
screen you will see this i can create it
the icon symbolizes that there is a
custom plug-in update for DB plugin for
version 12 104 click on this icon the
output of the shows as various details
it shows us the creation date for this
custom plug-in update it shows us the
source agent and it also shows us what
are the patches included in this custom
plug-in update it shows that 8007 patch
is included in this custom plug-in
update for DB plugin also note that this
patch 8007 is a dummy patch and created
only for this table now let's try to do
a fresh agent deployment on a new target
and after we have done the H in diplomat
we will verify whether the custom
plug-in update for the DB plug-in was
picked up or not and whether the DB
plugin on the target has this patch or
not we'll go to set up a target at
target manually add host click Add
provide a fully qualified hostname and
select the platform click Next provide
the details click Next after providing
the details click Next click deploy
agent
now the agent deployment has started
we'll wait for few minutes till it
finishes easy to plan it is done now
let's click on that agent scroll down
and click on Oracle home and patch
details note that this is the agent that
was deployed after we created the DB
custom plug-in update and the table on
the right hand side shows us that the
patch have been applied to the DB plugin
home on this agent note these patches
under my patches created for this demo
note that if you want to create another
custom plug-in update for DB plugin
after applying few more patches then you
need to use parameter hyphen override to
make sure that the OMS have the latest
custom plug-in update for the database
thank you this is the end of the demo
