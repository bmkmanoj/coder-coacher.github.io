platform manager at bit ly I've been at
the company for about two and a half
years now I've been there through a lot
of really exciting stuff and my goal for
today I've spanned both the enterprise
and the consumer side of the bitly
product team and what I'm seeing more
and more of is the kind of social data
that we once thought of as existing
solely in the realm of consumer products
and consumer social networks becoming
more and more relevant in an enterprise
context so I'm going to walk you through
today some of the reasons why that's
happening some of the things that are
really exciting about that I think
there's a lot of really exciting stuff
happening and some of what bit ly does
with that data and finally some of what
you can do with that data and why i
think that the things that are done with
social data both in the enterprise and
on the consumer side are going to create
an even better new future than the
futures we already wish for and imagine
sorry couldn't resist so this is sort of
the standard issue slide you're going to
see in almost any talk about social
media and social data that the social
media universe can now be counted in the
billions of users so it doesn't seem
that long ago when social media when
Twitter and Facebook or something that
the CEO of a company would have their
nephew do on the weekend because he knew
a thing about it it was something for
kids it didn't really matter but now and
I'm sure everybody else who's speaking
on this topic will say the same thing it
really really does matter this is a
graphic from two years ago so the
numbers are even more dramatic now but
we found that with a lot of sites we
were working with social media was
driving substantially more traffic and
search so social media is so important
and so huge that it almost kind of sucks
for everyone now because the problem
with having everyone in the whole world
on social media is that it becomes as
hard to find someone on social media as
it is to find someone anywhere actually
finding an audience and delivering
targeted relevant good information is
getting even harder as the kind of
self-selection of tech savvy users dis
and everybody and their mother and their
nephew and their cousin and their dog is
on social media it's actually I would
say even harder now to reach people
because users are getting better trained
every minute to seek out only the
information they want everything is
available at the click of a mouse people
are trained more and more to seek out
the information they want and to ignore
anything they don't want that's part of
why I'm sure many of you have seen the
ROI on banner ads becoming more and more
dismal over time and why something like
a Promoted Tweet can incur as much anger
as it does actual results people expect
things to be targeted to them in a way
that they will find useful and this is
true in business as well as in consumer
land I'm sure everyone here knows
exactly which emails they are ignoring
which emails they are paying attention
to what information on Yammer on chatter
on any enterprise level communication
platform they are paying attention to
and what information they're not paying
attention to we all have an ingrained
filter to ignore and to pay attention as
a result of this conventional means of
buying attention don't work we are in an
attention based economy where attention
is more valuable than money if you try
to buy attention if you're just buying
space it's a really poor investment and
this is true again whether you're
dealing with consumers or whether you're
dealing with enterprise to give you a
sense of this our CEO who sends his
regards he had a meeting with a large
enterprise software company whose name
shall not be spoken at an Oracle event
and they were saying that they're
actually looking to Twitter to get a
better sense of how to build factory
automation because the social data
they're pulling from Twitter is helping
them understand cognitive systems and
how people think and what people pay
attention to in a way that no other
system of information camp
social data is permeating every aspect
of software and every aspect of our
lives the problem is in an attention
based economy you need to find a way to
quantify these things you need to find a
way to measure and this is obviously
really tricky when you're dealing with
something as enormous and as
multifaceted as social media how many
people here have used bit ly or are at
least somewhat familiar with what Billy
does okay most of you likely know bit ly
as a link shortener that is nominally
what we do that's how we started but
what's interesting about being a link
shortener is that because this layer of
bit ly sits between content and every
different network we're really well
equipped to track where content goes so
the way I like to think of bit ly is as
a neat little capsule what you stuff
your content into you send it around to
the social web you send it around to
mobile you can use it on interoffice and
intranet applications and it tells you
where it's been it's like a little
intelligent space capsule for your
content so with Billy you can do
something like this you can take a link
you can send it out into the wild and
you can see where it's getting click
traffic so in this particular example
this is a link that we share to Twitter
then somebody on Twitter took that link
and shared it to Facebook where it
actually wound up getting most of its
click traffic so building these kinds of
patterns and beginning to really
understand the life of content is part
of what bit ly allows for you to do and
we track this based around clicks for a
very specific reason social data is
smart data as i said in the attention
economy just buying eyeballs is not
enough because people are very good at
training their eyeballs not to see what
they don't want which means that your
job in any situation where you want
people to pay attention attention to
your message which is again relevant
both on consumer and on enterprise sides
you need to know what
people are interested in and you need to
know what kind of messaging and what
channels of messaging are actually going
to get people's attention click data is
really really really interesting because
a bit ly when we look at the difference
between what people are sharing and what
people are clicking we see that there's
actually a huge gulf there so for
example we did analysis one day about a
year ago to see what the most shared
links on a given day were and it was a
lot of links about social media being
shared on social media so a lot of
articles about why you'll never delete
your Facebook account a lot of sort of
tech inside baseball stuff about the
kindle fire and how it's going to
compete with the ipad but those were not
the links that people were actually
clicking what people were clicking was
for example bless you a blog of people
who have tattoos of guns Kim Kardashian
getting tons of quick traffic Kim
Kardashian always gets the most click
traffic always so social data becomes
really smart data when you can
understand this difference between how
people want to be perceived and what
actually interests them and this is my
very favorite picture in the whole world
because i think this perfectly
illustrates the difference between the
image you're trying to put forth which
is the chicken costume and what you
actually click which is the cat so the
value of smart social data is that no
matter how many chicken costumes people
put on social data helps you find the
cat it helps you find who people really
are and what really interests them which
helps you do a good job of getting your
information out to people who want it
and will actually pay attention to it so
one way Billy does that is with our
consumer product which makes it easy to
shorten and share links to bookmark
things that interest you and also to get
analytics around those clicks so you can
see for example which of your own links
are getting the most traffic which I
promise you is a really interesting
thing to do
and a great way to start using bit ly to
track clicks because every time you
shorten a link with bit ly you can get
analytics around how it's being clicked
how many people are clicking it where
those clicks are coming from and you can
get that intelligence in real time so
we've used this evenin internal company
chat rooms just to see what kind of
message is actually get traction what
kind of messages people are actually
incentivized to pay attention to because
if you don't know that than any amount
of time and effort and money you put
into getting people's attention is dumb
time and effort and money it is not
smart it is not social but where this
gets really really really really really
interesting is when you start looking at
this data at scale so looking at how one
link performs or how one person's links
perform is really interesting and really
valuable but when you begin to scale
this up when you begin to look at the
entire universe of content the entire
universe of how that content is shared
then insights emerged that you could
never get from one piece of content or
from tracking one link this is part of
where we really believe that social data
is both good business and good for
everybody so in the conventional model
of data being exchanged for value you
would ask somebody for their email
address or for information about them
and in exchange you would give them
something like a coupon or access to
content I think increasingly that model
is not sufficient when people give data
over social media when people give any
kind of data they expect that data
itself to be made more valuable to them
for example when you buy a purchase when
you produce something on amazon the
recommendations you get only work
because a lot of people are purchasing
things on amazon if ice if i buy shoes
and amazon says you bought shoes do you
want to buy other shoes i already knew i
bought shoes that doesn't help me but if
in looking at that data at scale amazon
can say people who buy shoes also buy
garden gnomes then that's telling me
something that i might not have known
about my own purchasing habits
that in turn makes my data more valuable
to me it makes my data more valuable to
the company and it makes my data more
valuable to me and I think that that's
where the universe of social data is
going that enterprises have a
responsibility in business to consumer
and in business-to-business exchanges to
make valuable more data for them more
valuable for them and to make data more
valuable to the people or businesses who
actually entered that data so a bit ly
we track over 8 billion klicks a month
this is a huge amount of data and as I
said before when you have data at a
certain scale than just getting good
intelligence out of it becomes really
hard we work with a company called data
set to do a really great job of making
it possible to seek out specific
insights from data our data is available
from them as is Twitter data facebook
data a lot large social data and I
strongly encourage you to check that out
but at bit ly we have an amazing data
science team and part of what they're
able to do is to look at these 8 billion
klicks and to begin to uncover some
really valuable and really interesting
insights which I think will be relevant
to a lot of people in the room so what I
want to do is kind of walk you through
some of the things that you can do with
big social data some of the things that
we're doing some of the ways we're
making this valuable to enterprises to
governments and to consumers and then
I'm going to walk you a little bit
through the way we've made this data
available to developers so that if you
see this and you think there's something
I can do here which will really help and
I guarantee there's almost always
something that you can do with this data
to at least get some additional insight
I hope that by the end of this talk you
will be inspired to build something and
you'll know where to begin pursuing that
data so one of the first things we did
but this data set will be built an
enterprise product we have an enterprise
dashboard which is able to compare
side-by-side the clicks that an
enterprise client is getting on their
own links and the clicks that are
circulating naturally among the entire
universe of social media usage so in
other words
if somebody happens upon an article from
the onion let's say and they begin
sharing it and it goes viral if the
onion themselves didn't share that piece
of content we provide them with
real-time analytics so they can see when
that piece of content is going viral as
it happens we also do some really
in-depth searching on the actual pieces
of content being shared so that for
example we could help a major bank
identify an article that was going viral
about them not handling particularly
well the mortgage of a veteran who was
returning from war because information
like this often circulates via blogs
before it gets picked up by major news
outlets discovering it early and
discovering when it's still in that
grassroots viral stage can be crucial
for a lot of companies who are trying to
manage information about them and
because all of this is sorted by clicks
we rank it based on how much attention
it's getting again we do this
intelligently we don't just give you a
dump of everything that's being said
about your company or keyword you're
monitoring we search for things that are
succeeding in the attention economy that
are actually getting people's interest
right now another thing we've just
rolled out which was pioneered by our
data science team and his super super
duper cool is rtly this is a product
called bit ly real-time and what this
does is it looks through the entire
universe of content being shared through
bit ly and it finds stuff that's
trending more than it usually does so
for example a phrase or a keyword like
Kim Kardashian is always super super
trending on the social web but looking
at social data at scale we can see when
something is trending more than usual
when a particular concept or a
particular topic is getting a
disproportionate amount of click traffic
that substantially varies or diverges
from what that phrase usually gets this
is part of the value
looking at this data at scale and we
actually have some API methods available
which I'll talk to you about shortly
which let you actually pull this data in
directly via a JSON feed and do as you
will with it which i think is super
exciting and super cool the other thing
we can do that's really neat and this
speaks to some of the real-time stuff
and this is actually powering some of
the real-time stuff is we can kind of
see into the future predicting the
future really just means having an
understanding of what usually happens
and what's happening now so for example
we can look at the usual rate of decay
for traffic and there's a pretty
standard rate of decay if you look at
the click rate for a given piece of
content it almost always piques quickly
and then actually gets most of its
traffic in the tail so what this allows
us to do is build predictive models
around what content we think is about to
go viral because we see so many of these
pieces of content because we've tracked
this so many times because we have
really smart data scientists and
mathematicians you can build models we
can actually kind of see into the future
pretty reliably but that's just what
we're doing we are really big believers
in open data and open api's because as I
said we are really big believers that
what businesses do with this data can
make it more valuable for consumers and
can make it more valuable for other
businesses we've seen this time and
again my favorite personal example of
this was a promotion that amex did with
Foursquare called small business
saturday we're checking into a small
business on a Saturday automatically
give you a fifty-dollar statement credit
if you spent over a certain amount to me
this was totally brilliant because it
took four square data it encouraged me
to share that with a company it created
valuable data for a business it created
a good relationship between Foursquare
anammox on a platform level it added
value to the businesses who participated
because my ten dollar purchase turned
into one hundred and fifty dollar
purchase so I can get that statement
credit
there are ways in which using this data
using social data can make
business-to-business and
business-to-consumer transactions and
projects much smarter so what we have
right here is a little snippet from a
raw bit ly data feed this specific raw
bit ly data feed and everything is
anonymized there's no IP address
information there's nothing that's
personally identifiable these are all
scrubbed we take privacy very seriously
this is the data feed for clicks on
government content one of my favorite
projects we've worked on is with a
consulting firm called measured voice at
San Diego to track clicks on government
content so on gov addresses dot mil
addresses we've made the data feed of
this click stream public and we had a
hack day with the with the US government
organization and with measured voice to
see what people could do to make this
data interesting and relevant and
valuable and what came out of it was
this really awesome project called gov
clicks us what gov clicks taught us does
is it takes that raw data feed and it
just sort of checks off every time a
piece of content gets clicked and then
it organizes which pieces of content
were most clicked on a given day what
you begin to see is really really
interesting patterns emerge first of all
NASA beats everything NASA content
always outperforms everything else but
you also begin to see things that really
accurately reflect what's going on in
the world at a given moment for example
there was an issue about a year ago
where the FAA didn't have enough money
to pay some of their employees and there
were furloughs going on and there was a
form to get more information about that
that was the second most popular link
that day after something from NASA so
you begin to gauge not only interest in
terms of people love spaceships which we
all know but you begin to see real funk
items pieces of content that are really
specifically relevant to people's lives
and to what people are working on and
what people are concerned about that
gets surfaced through this kind of
operation devdutt lecom is our lovely
bit ly dev site we've spent a good deal
of time on this it's fairly new so any
feedback that any of you may have about
it I would absolutely love to hear
because we're still iterating on it
relatively fast but almost every bit ly
product is powered by a public API we
are firm believers in dogfooding as it's
known when our own products are built on
public AP is the few times we have
diverged from that strategy it has not
worked well for us we found that the
faster and more vociferously we
encourage developers to work with our
data the more interesting things happen
so a lot of the stuff that I've shown
you today especially around data is now
available via our API and we're
SuperDuper psyched about this so if
you're using bit ly enterprise you not
only get a raw data feed of all the
clicks on your own content but using
some of these other methods you can
begin to pull in representative data
about what's popular across the entire
social media universe you can get that
index of what is holding people's
attention at this very moment we believe
as I said in open data and hope and ap
is I myself I'm a product manager I'm i
write some Python but I'm really bad at
it I'm getting better because we
actually document all our API endpoints
in the Python code itself we're firm
believers in keeping the documentation
up-to-date in making sure that
everything that's available to our
developers was vetted by all the
developers who are working on it that
everything gets updated quickly that not
ever stops working unexpectedly and that
social data makes the world better this
is really the point I want to drive home
most of all that social data in whatever
context you're developing is just data
now the paradigms of social interaction
are how everybody interacts and as I
said you're seeing more of that with
product like Yammer and chatter that are
bringing these paradigms of following
and conversation directly to the
enterprise bit ly also works with those
if you want to track quick switch we
actually use in our internal Yammer
conversation sometimes what's great
about this is that even in the
enterprise social data can get rid of
noise users no longer accept noise I
suspect everyone in this room no longer
accepts noise we have data scientists
who have written filters to specifically
get rid of certain kinds of emails on
certain kinds of tweets tweets about
sports emails about things that are not
interesting there are ways to automate
and programa ties all of this there are
ways that the data around what we do and
do not pay attention to can make every
product better and with data sources
like bit ly data it's no longer a
mystery these things are measurable they
are quantifiable and they are concrete
which is why social data is not only
good for the world it's also good
business that's my spiel about bit ly
and social data in the enterprise I
would love to answer any questions you
have and to open this up sure to a
conversation if you have any questions
for me I could be reached directly at em
at Bentley com if you want to talk about
anything related to this information
beyond the confines of this particular
room great thanks thank you Matt any
questions from the audience
you must have answered every question
they have about social data so thanks
very much and thank you daddy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
