principal curriculum developer here at
Oracle in this demonstration I'll give
you an overview of so a configuration
management using Enterprise Manager grid
control you can perform solar
configuration management in the
Enterprise Manager grid control when you
purchase the solar management pack
enterprise edition key' configuration
metrics for the people p.m. server the
Oracle Service bus or osb instance
people processes the OSB proxy and
business services are collected and
stored in the Enterprise Manager
repository administrators can view the
historic configuration changes across
the people and osb environment they can
also create a baseline working
configuration by saving it in the
repository abbeville p.m. server and
domains configuration parameters can be
compared with other servers and domains
finally people process versions can also
be compared to observe the changes
across success of deployments so
configuration management allows
administrators to see what's changed
save configurations and compare
configurations here we are on the
enterprise manager grid control homepage
for solar configuration management will
go to targets then middleware this page
is our navigational entry point across
the enterprise he will scroll down and
we'll look at the Seoul infra on this
domain operations relating to the solar
infrastructure are performed here as a
navigational starting point let's go to
the solar infrastructure menu and select
configuration last kill
this page lists the current
configuration of the solar
infrastructure separating out the
configuration settings by engine and
category we can use these links at the
top of the page to jump to a specific
section of the page for example to look
at the mediator configuration details so
let's go back up and these buttons allow
you to access additional configuration
capability let's go to history this page
shows the list of historical changes on
the target group by category the history
records column shows how many changes
were made on that particular category on
that particular collection here we can
see that one change was made for each
category to see exactly what was changed
we can click these links or we can go to
view history and select show all let's
scroll down and here we see that a large
document threshold was changed from a
hundred thousand to one hundred and
fifty thousand bytes and the workflow
service session timeout was changed from
60 to 70 minutes let's go back to the
last collected configuration page that
we were on earlier the Save button
allows you to store the current
configuration with a name that you can
use for comparison later let's call it
configuration during test will click ok
now you see the new save configuration
let's go back to the last collected
configuration page again and now let's
look at
hearing configurations here we can
compare configurations between different
servers and against specific save
configurations perhaps one that we
consider to be the gold master
configuration in this case we have only
one solar server so we'll do the
comparison against the save
configuration so let's click the Save
configurations link and let's compare
the latest configuration with this
oldest saved configuration now let's
click compare configuration and
Enterprise Manager grid control is
tailored to each type of monitored
target so rather than just getting a
simple line number based if we get a
summarized comparison with details at
the top you see the two configurations
that are being compared under the
summary header the different categories
are marked with icons indicating whether
there was a difference in that area here
you see they're the same and here you
see that different we can see that there
was a difference detected in workflow
configuration details and in bville
configuration details this go to the
people configuration details and here we
can see what the specific changes were
we can see that the large document
threshold was changed and under the
workflow configuration details we can
see that the workflow service session
timeout was changed so that's it for
this demonstration on how to use solar
configuration management using the
Enterprise Manager grid control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
