apps to your Exadata Express cloud
service if so go to the service console
click develop and select nodejs to see
step-by-step instructions scroll to step
1 in this example we use a Windows
machine to run the nodejs app click on
the instant client version for your
operating system
accept the software license agreement
find the basic instant client version
you want and click the link to download
it to your local machine unzip it to a
subfolder under C demo this command
prompt window shows the location of the
instant client installation set the
system environment variable path to
include the instant client location next
navigate back to the instant client
installation instructions and click the
link to install the required Microsoft
Visual Studio redistributable now that
you've completed step 1 installing
instant client go back to the using
on-premise scripting languages OTN page
scroll to step 2 and follow instructions
to enable client access and download the
wallet first from the service console go
to develop and make sure the client
access is enabled then click client
credentials define a password used to
protect the file enter a password of
your choice and enter it again to
confirm it click download to store the
credentials to a secure location
download credentials to a subdirectory
called admin under network and in the
same location instant client was
installed now go back to using
on-premise scripting languages OTN page
you've just completed step to
downloading client credentials scroll to
step 3 to install database drivers
select the link for instructions to
install drivers for node.js navigate to
the QuickStart instruction
to start the installation process go to
node.js org select the long-term support
version noted by LTS and install to a
node.js subdirectory in this example we
installed two nodejs
sub directory under Program Files next
go to quick start to install node Oracle
DB in your command prompt window go to
the demo directory before running in pm
you may need to set HTTP underscore
proxy inter NPM install oracle DB the
oracle DB package is installed to the
node module subfolder under demo now
install the required version of Visual
Studio redistributable next go to step
four on the OTN page where you prepare
your app to connect to the cloud service
create a database schema to connect your
app to from the service console click
manage then database schema enter a name
for the schema enter a password then
enter it again to confirm it make note
of these settings the name and password
will be used in a future step click
create database schema to download and
install database objects used in this
example go to DB sample schemas on
github to find the select 1j s app used
in this example go to node underscore
Oracle DB on github and click examples
find select 1j s
and download to see demo modify the
select 1j s
app to connect to the cloud service
database set the user to the schema name
set the password to the schemas password
and set the connect string to DB Access
DB access is defined in TNS named Sora
which you downloaded earlier as part of
the client credentials in the command
prompt window go to demo and run the app
with node
there you go you've successfully set up
a node J S environment to connect to
