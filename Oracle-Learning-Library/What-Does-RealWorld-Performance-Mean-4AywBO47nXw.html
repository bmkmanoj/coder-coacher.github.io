president of real-world performance we
think about database performance
literally all the time we think about
the mistakes people make the challenges
people have to solve and we try and
teach people to not make them we get our
ideas not only from work but outside
work
in many cases we can draw similarities
with other phases of life to achieve
best performance let's take a moment to
think
the clues the good database performance
are not hidden in some dark space we can
use real-world performance techniques to
identify and illuminate the source of a
performance problem
unfortunately many of our customers are
using dated analytical techniques that
are unsuitable for modern Oracle
database releases and modern high
performance harder
over time good real-world performance
engineers learn to identify and then use
the appropriate tool appropriate to the
performance challenge they're working on
unfortunately today's systems in many
cases perform sub-optimally because of
short-term design decisions poor tuning
poor patching and poor setup as a result
whilst it appears to functionally work
it is working in a highly inefficient
manner the role of the real-world
performance engineer is to identify
those inefficiencies and get the
database working in a manner that it was
designed to work in many cases
real-world performance techniques get
applied after the so-called quick fixes
have been applied and failed to work
real-world performance techniques and
the solutions usually involve focused
hard work and may involve getting your
fingers dirty to clean out each
component to make sure it's running at
its maximum efficiency in this way we
can get database and hardware or running
at the efficiency levels the designers
anticipated
we're able to plan for the future and
recognize how we can exploit new and
innovative hardware in the future what
we're showing is how to get exceptional
performance in the real world
thank you for joining me if you want to
learn more about the real world
performance team and our activities come
to a real-world performance event meet
us at the Oracle OpenWorld or learn with
us online
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
