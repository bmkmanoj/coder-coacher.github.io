as a service we're now looking a little
bit closer at the administrator tasks
once the administrator logs into
enterprise manager he can go to the
setup section and start defining how
tasks should behave and what the users
should have access to in the testing
clouds of service setup we can define
what application types the user have
access to or the test drivers and so on
the application type is basically as
metadata that helps you to separate
different applications so that you can
have your test assets tagged with these
application types in the test driver
section you can define your test drivers
and those can be various versions of the
testing tools we ship testing as a
service with test drivers for Oracle's
application testing suite like Oracle
functional testing in Oracle load
testing but you can of course also use
your own custom test drivers this allows
you to use third-party testing tools and
all you have to do is create an assembly
and then with this test tool and then
define start/stop scripts scripts to
collect your results and so on in the
publishing section you can define what
your users should have access to and
this is both from a test driver point of
view as well as test assets and
environments in the quota section you
can define which the resources the user
should have access to so how many VMS
they can spin up how many CPUs or how
much disk space they should have as well
as how many virtual users can they use
for load tests the result file system is
the storage for screenshots when you are
doing functional testing from task
for the chargeback you can define what
the users should be charged back when
they're consuming resources within tasks
and this is using the standard
Enterprise Manager chargeback solution
this concludes the demo of the admin
