in this demo we'll take a quick look at
some of the features in Oracle business
transaction management 12c which is a
component of Oracle Enterprise Manager
management packs we'll start with the
operational health summary page from the
navigator this page gives us a rollup of
key metrics for our system and
transactions the indicators will quickly
tell us if something is wrong and the
Associated numbers will tell us the
actual number of issues as we can see
that out of 34 services one is currently
down we can also click on any of these
services and drill down for a deeper
look now let's take a look at top 10
services dashboard this dashboard has
four tables with top 10 services in
terms of load response times Falls and
uptime issues this is a good starting
point for further analysis since it
gives a good view over the worst
performers let's open the Purchasing
client application by double clicking on
it
as that seems to be the worst performer
at this point of time this opens up a
tabs area at the bottom of the frame
that helps me take a closer look at the
summary of the service analysis of the
service alerts if there are generated
any message long if I have enabled the
logging SLA compliance profile the
entire dependency tree that actually
shows how the service is connected to
rest of the services policies
transactions that shows me which whole
transaction this service is participated
in and properties if I have set any
property on the service now let's take a
look at top 10 transactions dashboard
once we define a transactions we can
take a closer look at the summary of top
10 transactions that are more stressed
on primarily four characteristics most
tarded most completed slowest average
response time and the ones with most
condition alerts for the sake of this
demo I have defined only one transaction
and we'll go ahead and take a deeper
look at it let's take a look at the
summary tab this shows us the graphical
topological view of the entire
transaction will its key metrics by
bringing your cursor on top of any
participating service you can take a
quick look at its throughput Falls
average and maximum response times
aggregated over the time period which
can be controlled from here I can pick a
different time period and the key
metrics will change their values
accordingly let's click on instances tab
this tab provides an access to
individual instances of any specific
transaction assembling of correlating
services into an instance level is not
done by default however if I won't take
a deeper look into any specific instance
then I can manually assemble it and look
at deeper details such as message
payload values over its property set in
the transaction instance etc now let's
go through a quick process of how to
create a transaction in Oracle BTM I can
go to the create menu and select
transaction from this window I will
select the operation that I want to be
the starting operation of my transaction
for example if I want to create a
transaction on the operation say create
new order I'll go ahead and hit OK this
will pull in the entire dependency tree
of that operation I can take a look at
the entire definition of my transaction
and if I'm not interested in certain
operation to be a part of this
transaction I can go ahead and easily
remove that operation once I'm satisfied
with my transaction definition I can go
ahead and enable logging as I need I can
neighbor logging at the instance level
or at the operation level for the sake
of this demo I'll enable logging at all
levels and go ahead and save the
transaction with a demo transaction name
and hit OK once I save my transaction it
should appear under the listing of
transactions under Explorer let's switch
gears here and take a look at the maps
map is a good way to represent
relationships maps provide a visual
representation of how services endpoints
and operations related to each other
there are two views of maps service map
and container map the entire service map
is automatically
word for you once the observers are
deployed on the target containers and
once you pass traffic through those
containers it is important to note that
only those services endpoints or
operations will get discovered
automatically that receives some traffic
container map on the other side is
similar to service map in terms of
internal dynamics however it shows the
container level demarcation of various
services endpoints and operations this
concludes the demo for oracle business
transaction management 12c thanks for
