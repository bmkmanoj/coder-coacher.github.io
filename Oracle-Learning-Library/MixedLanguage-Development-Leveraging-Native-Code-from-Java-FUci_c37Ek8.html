development this morning so roughly the
outline for the talk is i'll talk about
jni and then i'll talk about debugging
and then i'll talk about performance
tuning you may notice they've been
fussing around the laptops my plan was
to do my demo of my laptop but i'm
having trouble driving this string that
doesn't seem to be any resolution that
my laptops happy with and the screen is
happy with so i'll try and swap over
towards the end of the talk so I've got
some you know live demo stuff I'll do at
the end that I would have done mixed in
with the talks you have to bear with
some of the technically technical
hiccups there so see okay i'm part of
the salar studio team that's the native
language development tools C C++ and
Fortran and there's a whole bunch of
other talks during the week that we're
doing and this is the outline of them we
have another talk a Java wanting more
depth on performance analysis using
studio and so with that I'll head into
the talk so what's a level here how many
folks here use J&amp;amp;I relative you know
frequently okay Wow most you okay so
this is probably bread-and-butter to you
but let's go over the introduction stuff
so it's Java native interface so we're
going to be two ways of doing this is
you know calling native code from Java
or the other way around calling java
from native code i'm going to just do
calling native from java and the
questions really are why do we want to
do this because it's just a bit of a
headache is now um so this often comes
in from reusing legacy code like you've
already got a library and application
that does what you want and you don't
want to change the code because you know
that it works has been validated or you
don't have the resources to change the
code even though you're liked it
there's also leveraging hardware
features so as chips develop they put
new instructions in new features into
the hardware and often the only way of
doing of getting access to those
features is through some sort of native
codes up something disassembly for
example if you're handling the crypto
instructions directly rather than going
through openssl awesome about that then
there's often a reason for doing this
now performance I put lots of question
marks after that I don't think
performance is a really strong concern
but sometimes it is possible to write
some hand-tuned disassembly some tune C
code that does do a bit better than Java
but in general I think you're better off
not doing that reason so the the basic
thing here is we're going to have a
short of native code that we're calling
from Java and this is the outline of the
other example code so the important
thing here is that the method we're
going to call is declared as being a
native method so just the native keyword
and then we're going to load the library
and the important thing here is that it
uses the default search path and it has
automatic suffix and prefix meaning that
why it's important is that on Windows
it's going to be called something
different from if it's on solaris or
linux or whatever and so you don't want
to really put that sort of noise into
your application you just want it to
work obviously native code does mean
that you are platform aware so it's kind
of a not that critical because other
points you are going to be dealing with
the native environment rather than just
sticking in the Java environment and
then finally you create a new object and
you call the method that you want to
call it the native one so that's pretty
straightforward then on the other side
you've got to write your library code
that handles this method and uses it so
first thing to do to compile your java
application as you get your dog class
file and the second thing you're going
to do is to generate header files from
that and you can do this manually but
there's an automated process for doing
it so I'd use that and it's just your
age and the class file and that will
produce a day gee I'll corresponding to
the the methods you've got that needs to
be written now you'll see if you look at
the age file it includes a lot of stuff
but fundamentally you're going to come
down to let's go to this it includes a
gen i dot H file this pulls in all the
Java specific defines and so on and then
you've got your native method that
you're going to be calling so you notice
it's got lots of decoration there and
we'll talk about some of that so the
first thing to note as a yeah if you're
looking this from the native code
perspective the function name is Java
your class your object and then your
method all concatenated together so this
is Java holo-message and that's the way
that they are class of the methods are
named it sassy calling convention so
it's not got name mangling and stuff
like that which allows you to do see
calling and C++ call then you've got
your platform specific declarations so
scoped is external J&amp;amp;I export so in
Windows this will convert to deckle spec
export in other environments you may
actually not need an export because by
default they get exported and then again
there's a calling convention some
platforms will require
specific sort of calling convention and
others just do the default so again
these kind of get to find on what
depending what the environment you're in
is and then there's a couple of
parameters the Java environment and the
object being pastel so this allows you
to access both the environment and the
object from within your method so then
the bit you've got to do is write your
methods teaser initially start off with
the whatever was defined in the header
file and then you put your code in right
then you want to compile the native code
side so this kind of looks ugly which is
fair enough so you've got a quite a
spectacular long compile line there so
lower case G for debug you know I'm
always you know in the studio
environment debug information doesn't
have an impact on performance in most
cases so it's just worth doing over
optimized code again Dasho on most
compilers represents a pretty good
trade-off between compile time but you
know performance and so on so it's
always good to throw in dash over
anything you're building and then we're
building a library so in the UNIX world
that's you for a library and then dash K
pick for position independent code so
both of those are kind of required you
can do position independent libraries a
position dependent libraries but
generally in the UNIX you're not
recommended and then you need to find
the header files that's the gen Ida H
file so that's going to be located in
your include directory and then I'm
building on solaris in this particular
instance so I also need to include the
solara subdirectory
go which contains the platform-specific
defines so once I've done all that it
should build and run okay so now I've
got my yeah if I had this laptop
currently plugged in i'll demonstrate
all this so we're just going to go on
and go through some of this later okay
so running it at this point we've got a
class file and a lib hello door SI that
we want to use so we run hello and it
failed and this is something interesting
going on here you can see from the stack
it's complaining about system dot load
library and you know hello Java line 12
and that's the line in my code where I
said load the library up and so I've
obviously got to think about where this
library is so it's not necessarily going
to be on the path so one way of doing it
is to specify LD library path to be the
current directory and then run it and
hate it works brilliant there's only two
things wrong with that the first is I've
specified the current directory and so
if i run this from somewhere else is no
longer be going to be found in the
current directory and that could be bad
and the second is that i've used the
environment variable LD library path
which is really not what you want to do
on production code you want something a
bit more robust so yeah on the this is
the link aside the native language side
we don't like LD library path it's a bit
of a hack it should be used for testing
and debug but not necessarily on
production so what else can we do well
one way of doing it is another way of
doing it is to define the Java library
path on command line and this is
probably the best way of doing it really
because it's a
relatively straightforward to do and it
doesn't involve any particular platform
specific nastiness again I've used the
current directory by views dot that's
probably not what I would recommend i
would recommend hard coding or a
stripped which figures out so anyway
this works there is another way of doing
it which is that i'm going to change the
code and so I can get the user directory
which is basically the directory that
you're working from which again is a bit
dubious because you may not be working
from the right directory and then I can
append the file name and I can
explicitly load the library and that's a
bit horrible but it does work so there's
multiple ways of locating the librarian
but the message there is by default you
may not find it so what we've got now is
we've got we can run the program and
we've got a library that contains all
the all the code we want now that's a
good start but it's not actually doing
anything useful because at the end of
the day we aren't actually passing any
parameters in we are passing any
information and we it's the processing
in the library that we're really
interested in so parameter passing so
the first thing to do is to define what
parameters you're going to pass over and
then you're going to pass the bin you
can load the library and do some work in
the library so let's go back here we've
got the the Java code you can see that
top it here I can yeah shot not really
is the declaration of function here's
where I'm using it and here's where I'm
loading the library when I use Java H I
will get a header file and then I can
use that to build the C file and the sea
father is going to look kind of like
this so I've got my environment I've got
my object I've got an a Java double
array and I got a length and int so
getting passed in everything I need but
they're not necessarily in the right
format so I'm going to have to do some
processing to convert from the Java
format into the native format and all
all that I can use these from my native
code so I'm going to use the Java
environment going to ask that to do the
processing on my behalf so I'm going to
first of all get the array of elam of
double elements double precision values
converted from Java format into native
format and then the integer Java ruined
that's fine that comes across as an
integer so that's good and then at the
end I'm going to release the native
version of the Java array so this is
good you got a pair of function calls
give you give yourself a native array
and then use it and then release it so
in the code in the middle here I'm going
to do some processing on the native
array and then I can return a floating
point which and the environment
correctly handles that and convert it
into native into java at the end so okay
so that's pretty straightforward the the
important thing to notice there really
is that there's some processing that
goes on when you pass parameters in so
if you're doing this in a way that you
meant to be mindful of performance then
you've got to be aware there it's a
performance hit going from Java into
native if you've got a lot of parameters
you're passing over and so we'll talk
about that a bit later when I actually
switch over to using the laptop and do
some demo stuff okay so I'm trying to
work out whether i want to switch over
to the laptop at this moment or not
see how it goes so obviously if you're
going to debug things I will talk about
debug for a bit you're going to use des
G so that means generate debug
information use it in both Java and in
the native language stuff and yeah i
think i'm going to switch over at this
point I think there's been more fun to
do live well eventually so you have to
kind of bear with me a bit whilst I
switch this over okay
see how this works ah do you like green
so some of the back you can do colors
that's pretty horrendous right I'm gonna
assume is like soft color in the morning
so it'll be good on your eyes so my
standing up typing is pretty abysmal
okay so it's my fault sorry should use
the bigger hammer zip ok I think we're
wiring right but it's a switch which
probably brings these things out anyway
it's looking good now as but that I
don't is coming so weird to be stick ok
I'll try not to move this thing too much
ok so I've got a couple of libraries and
going to compile here we've talked all
about this you know CeCe debug
information horrendous include paths and
so on and then I've got a bad java
program and so I'm going to use dbx
which is part of studio to run
oh sorry
I'm doing wrong here Joyner
o course thank you
oh when I run through this late last
night it was all working really
tickety-boo but I'm obviously okay I had
to put class I remember last night i was
working on this and I thought I didn't
have to put class so anyway this is dbx
so what is doing is it's reading the
Java code and now ok so now I've told it
to stop as soon as it executes the main
routine and I can run and here we go
you're going to see a listing of the
program's it flushes past so and then
I'm going to step into this so here's me
allocating an array and then I'm going
to go past it right this is running
under the debugger so it's running
painfully slowly because the debuggers
doing all sorts of nastiness to the Java
environment and so it will take a bit of
time for it to iterate only 2048
elements which is kind of a bit
surprising and there we go and so now
Americans step here and now I'm into my
native code this is quite nice it's the
first thing to do is to get the Murthy
array across
okay and now i'm into my loop right so
this is called bad average because it
doesn't work which I should have
demonstrated but the reason it doesn't
work as I've got an error in my code
which is I'm passing the wrong value for
length in i'm passing zero in rather
than natural length of the array and so
I'm not actually calculated a total so
when I step out of this and I'm back
into the Java you can see up here they
printed not a number because it
converted 0/0 and that really doesn't
make a lot of sense so this point I know
you know something went wrong I can do
seamless debugging between my java code
and my native code which is you know
quite nice right so that's using dbx and
next thing I want to talk about as a
performance stuff which is an area I'm
much happier so I've got here a version
of my average Cove same same thing here
going on and
I've got my other Java code which does a
bit more work here is calling my native
code lots and lots of times and the
reason I'm doing that is because this is
a demo and I want to actually make it do
some work it's not typical to do that
anyway so I'm going to use the
performance analyzer which is again part
of the studio to look at the profile
that this generates see what I need okay
this is why I got confused I didn't need
to put class this time whereas in the
other way I need to put class and so
it's running my little daft test program
and it's producing some sort of result
and that took a few seconds we won't
have a lot of runtime a lot of profile
data but we'll have a bit and so the
tool to look at the profile is analyzer
so I'm going to launch that and see what
it's got so
okay so this is the list of the
functions in my application and what you
can see here is there's a whole bunch of
java stuff down at the bottom and at the
top there's a whole bunch of native
stuff so you should be able to recognize
these two function calls the release our
double array elements and the get double
array elements function called and those
the ones we called in order to make
their gather native versions of the java
objects whole bunch of new tech stuff
and here's my java function and we can
look at that so what i want to point out
here is we've got this is obviously
where the time is being spent i don't
i'm sorry if you can't quite read the
numbers that coming up small here you
can see the first column is what we call
exclusive time that's time spent doing
the code and then the second column is
what we call inclusive time and that's
time spent calling functions from the
code so you can see that here there's
about 11 seconds of time spent calling
functions and that's time spent in the
function AV in the natives on the native
side and you see this is where we
actually call that so this is the Java
code now what I can actually do is nip
to the disassembly tab and you can see
the java bytecode and again here we're
calling the function and that's where
all the time goes and so you can get
down to buy code now if i switch to
machine mode we're lucky we should be
able to switch to the native disassembly
for this function so this is what the
java bytecode gets translated to an x86
so you can go through the entire stack
so i'm going to just go back to here
so that was what the Java side looks
like so I'm now going to look at the
native side so this is my seed function
and you can see here that quite a lot of
time is spent on the computation of
double array which isn't that surprising
there's a little bit of time spent on
the get and release which is again
interesting and you can see that what's
particularly interesting about that is
that there's zero time spent in the code
but there's one and a half seconds and
spend in the processing in the get
double array elements we're going to
talk about that in a moment and but the
bulk of the time is spent computing the
total so let's have a look at the
disassembly for that and it so here is
where all the time is being spent which
is interesting I don't know how good
your x86 disassembly is at this time in
the morning but you later on I'm sure
you recognize this as being x87 code so
mistake I've made is I compiled this is
an X 87 library rather than using sse2
so if I'd use sse2 I'm sure this would
have gone a lot faster anyway you can
see that we've looked at java bytecode
java source java bytecode java bytecode
disassembly we looked at native see
source and native seed disassembly so
we're seeing the entire stack but the
other question so I know we're about
eight seconds of my time is spent
there's 11 seconds of time being spent
here so what's going on well the other
thing that crops up is mem copy so mem
copy is copying one chunk of memory to
another so why does that crop up well I
can look at the call tree here
and you can see that mem copy is called
by the get double array elements and by
the release double array elements so
let's see what else is cooled by that so
I'm looking at this in the center here
and you see that that's my native code
at the top calling it this is the ghetto
array elements function i'm calling and
it does two things it calls mem copy and
it calls OS malik so it's obviously
allocating a chunk of memory for the
native double precision values then it's
copying from the Java structure into the
native and if we look at what else goes
on here we can see that when we release
it it's got a mem copy and it's got free
so this kind of explains why we've got
the two function calls there we've got
the get and we've got the release
function calls so what we've got is an
alec call or Malik call and then free
corresponding free so that's why we need
to make sure we pair them if we don't
pair them will get a memory leak because
the memory leaks by malloc and free and
that also suggests why it takes a bit of
time is because we're now allocating a
structure with copy into that structure
and then with really when we when we're
done with that structure we're copying
back out of it and freeing it so that's
where some of the overhead comes in so
you don't want to do too much allocation
and de-allocation of these structures
because they do induce an overhead now
something else that goes on here I've
shown proof stick here to j OS free foot
let's look at OS free OS free calls free
which is located in lipsy as you would
expect so if you have a multi-threaded
java application you're going to be
calling malloc and free whenever you go
into the native code so you will get
some malik activity and now there's a
potential source of civilization because
we're not making library calls and I
on solaris the default Malcolm free is
serializing so you don't want to do that
you don't call two methods calling
malecon free without replacing the
default with something actually scales
so you got to be careful here about
points of contention um again
multi-threaded codes so hopefully that
if you want to see why his malik and it
calls a whole bunch of mutex locks that
basically ensure that you don't get data
corruption when your multiple threads
are hitting it but these are the problem
and by default we have a live c1 which
is not empty hot there are plenty of
replacements on solaris for any OS might
hit the same issue ok the other thing
that's interesting to look at in this
tool is the Timeline view which shows
basically what's going on here and we
can see that in the detailed view
there's a whole bunch of threads these
are these are juicy threads down here
waiting for something to happen and then
up here we have the application threads
doing stuff so is the mem copy call
where we get the array is the bit of
processing and somewhere along here is
probably a free ok so we can actually
see over time how the application is
working and that's quite useful view to
have if you have things that are even
multi-threaded you know trying to figure
out why they don't scale or if just
doing excessive GC you will be able to
see at what points in the time view GC
occurs now and try
and just finish up from so if I hadn't
done the demo this is the quality of
screenshot I managed to grab which is
unfortunately incomprehensible okay so
basically I'm stopping at this point
because I figure there will be questions
and I figure it's okay to not try and
talk for the entire hour so basically
this is covering maita calling native
code from Java if you do get the
opportunity to look at studio tools we
have the debugger which does mix
language debugging and we have the
performance profiler which does as a
demonstrated profiling of mixed language
code hopefully those tools will be of
use to you so thank you very much for
attending what questions do you have for
me yeah that's correct yeah it's um it's
obviously it slice it it's a free
download but isn't that doesn't quite
answer your licensing question i think i
might have been your intention it's
available on solaris for both x86 and
spark systems and it also works on
various varieties of linux you know
could to be oracle linux but also I
believe several other variants like red
hat I don't know if the top of my head
exactly which ones for each release but
it might get and so I zip to the front
of my talk here so up the top here
that's the URL for solaris to do so it's
oracle
Khan go to Solara studio and you can
find that a whole bunch of stuff there
including where to download it okay
thanks yes sir okay I'm I'm not at the
moment no no I'm so my background is
more on the the native side so I'm not
so worried about how you call it I'm
more concerned about when you get to the
native side making sure you have the
appropriate support their to write it
good code yeah yes right I think it's
just the integer types which we were
efficient the job the the floating-point
types I believe there's subtle
differences in on that side so they have
to do some degree of conversion I would
just stick yeah you have to use the
variable types you have to use and when
it comes down to it it's it's a very
similar trade-off too many so you've
been in many instances which is
everything has a cost and you just have
to figure out how to minimize that cost
so if you are calling java calling
native code from java and you're seeing
a huge conversion cost then you have to
assess what options you got which are
basically can you hold the both the
values from last time you did this or do
you actually need to call native code at
all can't it just becomes more efficient
just do it in java rather than calling
the native code so i don't think it i
don't think there's an easy way of
picking types that that happen to not
cause you a lot of conversion costs
because if you're in if you're using
doubles that's what you've got to handle
the mechanism Jen I uses is to separate
them so I don't believe that you could
do maybe GNA does something better like
that but it's I think they've adopted
the model for Jen I that you know you
have your java stuff and you have your
native stuff and if you want to go
between them you have to explicitly go
between them I think that sharing a data
like that would be kind of Gnostic yes
possibly I and that's yeah I imagine
that will be possible i'm not sure that
if you're using the word unsafe that
that would be recommended butter
possibly yeah i think the reason is that
old is that nothing much has changed
there so it still works and yeah that's
a quite useful but but yeah Mairi
document it that's true yeah
right anyone want to take that I don't
do windows so right um so it would call
have a slight overhead but that is part
you're sticking in the Java environment
when you go outside to it there are
costs associated with going to a library
doing the processing that was required
it's like funking used to be when you
went from like 16 to 32 bit there's a
huge amount of horrendous stuff that not
yeah takes time um but what I would say
to your question is really that you need
to find a Windows profiler and take a
look and figure out exactly where that
costs is coming from this to me this is
the the the the less my blurb most of
all is that whenever I see a performance
problem I like okay or what is what's
causing it because the chances are there
is something you can do or at least if
you can't do anything you can lease
understand it and maybe work around it
but yeah go profiler I suspect the Intel
ones would be pretty pretty effective at
that I don't know what their situation
is with with java and native but
certainly on the native side which is
ultimately where you're going to be
running the code it might give you more
information okay
right right that's an interesting
question we do have a memory checking
tool but I didn't want to determine
whether how well it works with yarber i
know that in it looks to me like it
would work pretty well for this sort of
level of complexity but i suspect that I
would find interesting things out if I
tried on something really complex but
for the native code yeah we can do
memory checking we have very effective
in reach eka it should it won't see a
Java code so i wouldn't understand the
java calls and things i wouldn't be able
to tell you anything about your java
code on the native side we should be
able to do that I just haven't tried to
out myself so I don't really want to
talk about it today but yes I agree
those are significant problems and later
on today it's open world are we talking
about 10 45 about things like native
memory checker on yeah native code
memory checker so yes significant
problem I share your pain anyone else
yes yeah so solaris ships like I think
it's about five Malik's did four
different different purposes may be all
different sort of people's desires and
so it's just case of LD preloading that
and then all your mate or your malloc
and free codes will go through in fact
that's one of the recommendations i have
is yeah if you're doing native code
don't rely on the default solaris malik
just use like mt Malik or you review
them but yeah you can link explicitly
linked at compile time by saying yet
little case lower case l and you ma'am
or whatever or you can use LD preload to
run time so you know depends on how you
want to set up there's one other
question yeah right right yes I i
believe it is still true I haven't
looked into it when I was discussing
this with one my colleagues on Friday he
said you're going to get questions about
garbage collection and Jen I and yeah as
far as he knew that things haven't
evolved much in that space because it's
a complex problem I think was the the
overall feeling so yeah I don't know
that it has changed that much okay
anyone else have questions this morning
not to my knowledge no i don't think i
have an exhaustive knowledge of them by
am observed any about jni the ones that
i played with most of our garbage
collections get the verbose details of
that because that seems to be the big
area when you hit performance problem is
what does the GC look like okay well
thank you all very much for coming out
yeah early this morning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
