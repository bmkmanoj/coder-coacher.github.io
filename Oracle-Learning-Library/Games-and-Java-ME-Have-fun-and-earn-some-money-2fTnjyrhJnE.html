there to help you or to brazil i can
give some tips to our agenda we talk
about some java me a me me me so much
about some things that people talks
about java me that I don't agree Oh some
kind of a mobile developers don't agree
there how many mobile developers i have
here oh nice one ok or i call it getting
real because i think it's good we'd not
have mobile developers here because we
have to know exactly what is the truth
about mobile development exactly easy we
read we had a lot of things about mobile
from the reporter said on droid is the
best one I was the best one java me eggs
dad phone no keep calm let's talk about
it then we talk about fun or how to
implement again or how can i make a good
game in this
the day men the main thing is how can I
earn money money with it and finally we
will talk about some business models to
earn more money with mobile games oh the
first thing how do you see the Java me
is the Java me Dad yes be honest one how
many one two three okay why is Android
better thus please I am NOT our employee
and I not here to to talk to that Java
me that is the only thing you need to
worry about okay please the apple store
right because that's where the other
thing please I was saying that they are
right and I'm not saying they are wrong
either but you have to think something
if people can buy an iphone they must
have money to buy up and if you have so
many people my iphone you probably are
you have an easy way to tell up from the
apple store then to sell you know the
android store or even any other yeah
that's good point yeah you talk about
I really think are like the NW or Merced
is or something like that you like
knowing where the people are
money-wise yeah well what are they talk
here is you can do it java me you have
users we have mark yeah yeah I know it
yeah it's yeah in bed yes you're sure
you're right man but you have to do to
think that I start to Brazil to I will
talk it later but about money how many
people are buying it I'm not saying here
that the Java me platform is the
platform that we were earn more money
but you can forget it because there's a
lot of people using it just for we know
me me me me me me and there it's the
best Apple the best Oh Japanese that job
is next MO I I think about that for
years ago but now an early morning Java
mania I'm happy with it it's why I'm
here talking about it how what
yeah yes yes the think quiet but there
is more either you agree for me okay
yeah but there's some of things we have
to know about the javanese stuff oh
thank your presenter the market and this
merit smartphones let's think about the
market share is the front december two
thousand eleven whatever who was hearing
the less present day shown saw saw this
we have the symbian OS samsung iOS
android blackberry OS but the sony is
java me operation system no java me is a
platform running on some platforms like
see me like black blackberry OS bada
sony and nokia for this right for is
right Michael talk here about in-app
purchasing and Nokia is doing a good
good work especially in Brazil so what
you have to to see here that we have a
market we have people using these phones
we do not have to to forget it the
reality
no I searched for it but I didn't know i
did a file I didn't found find it bad
for any of of them the reality we know
android/ios is raising as I saying I'm
not here to talk java me is the best I
here to talk how can we earn money with
it ok java me is not operational system
is a platform supported by a lot of os
are not mature it's my phones are not
majority do you know about it yeah less
than then in in Brazil for example less
then forty percent in Brazil i think is
less for from less from thirty percent
or less from 20 person in emerging
countries is the reality is different do
the live you only for USA when you
talking about mobile development we are
talking about delivery mobile mobile
apps to globe to all the word i already
sell apps for saudi arabia japan and
leaving Brazil whoa its global it's not
only my country if my company country
have iOS ok I can sell to other
countries if I know Java RT make android
doesn't matter you know take a bricks
doing who here doing know what is bricks
Russia China so South Africa thank you
it's the biggest market of Java me nokia
for example are working in Brazil
because we you know how can we have the
market share from the feature phones
from knocking Brazil it's very
yeah but this is dustin Brazil market
share are fewer than twenty percent
people in Brazil between Russia
especially in India and China have
feature phones are simpler funds that
doesn't have android or iOS iOS forget
it okay but they are buying there are
emergent countries people are earning
more money there and you are forgetting
them okay and but Java me is just just
for feature phones that's all the thing
people talk about it just for the v3 do
you know via Twitter the very famous
phone or the old motor or no feature
phones is not this is not a code knock
your phone if the camera quiet connected
okay yes yeah we are changing the idea
of these these people in the feature
phones naka for example is delivering
app stores for the feature for not fit
exactly feature phones but near funds
that have Java me and we don't need to
sell at your earn money only by the app
stores we have more ways to earn money I
will talk it later gently doesn't think
about downloading looking for or
purchasing amps where as a person who
has a smartphone that's part of their
consciousness that's part of something
that they
think up so I would expect then even
though apps for future phones exist and
the future codes exist people aren't as
prone to think about buying apps for
them yeah I think I think yeah because
backwards we didn't have the the app
stores now the feature phones I come if
the app stores so have to change they
the people already know that we they
came by App Store apps from the App
source there ok there does a just a
change changing now especially in
emerging countries where the people are
buying and up crazy but Javanese is just
for feature phones just for the old
phones for the my mom's funds for my
grandpa's phones no no let's get off the
box I'm not not yet employee ok I front
three angle my company get off the box
see Nokia c3 is in Portuguese sorry
Marcus III comes a sports java me comes
with Wi-Fi Bluetooth qwerty keyboard 2
megapixel camera SD card emails social
networks Facebook Twitter whoa javamail
is just for is just is java me just for
feature phones oh ok
get off of the box + + knockout x-302
physical keyboard Wi-Fi meet be two dot
one app store app store ok not just
feature phones we have to think when you
think about Java me there is near
earphones touchscreen five megapixels
camera we have the oh it was the
knocking with the 14 megapixels camera
41-megapixel better than eco camera
email up in resume get off of the box
Jeremiah is not today okay it's not just
for a feature phones there is new phones
running java me I not again I not say
that is the Silver Bullet of the mobile
market but that is a thing that we you
have to think about it okay again nokia
asha 303 one gigabytes processor comes
with Angry Birds Angry Birds in feature
phones does it work yes it works and
other things we can we can use here
social networks very my mom have it
yeah it's not a feature phone anymore
it's a smartphone is this microphone
running java me okay jeremy is not for
just for feature phones yes it is it is
it for a feature phones yes but there is
also new and emerging countries using
please basically the video that you had
as much fun but there is some kind of
locations of Ages in tribulation
something like that and basically they
kind of device that has a lot of
features that jbug processor just in
Brazil more than 70 million eps sold in
2011 okay s40 was fifty two percent
that's good for a tea person java up eps
nice it's good some red ones that use
java me okay we finish the job i'm a
mini-me park getting real let's talk
about fun or hard to implement it let's
be let's go to the the market games
market i will explain games market with
only one figure 1 just one picture what
is what is it a name what's the name
Angry Birds Angry Birds does Angry Birds
did angry better earn some money I think
so yeah so they dissolves
books caderno no detailed notes books of
paper notebooks in Brazil we anger bus
here to write shirts yeah I bought five
of them yesterday so just again so I
will not explain anything about how how
can you earn is this picture explain but
first of all your idea your idea is more
important that the plataform because
what's your again once they are idea
behind the game what's your story what
story you want to tell do you have a
character the or the characters that you
use you have to do it how and the next
one the last one very starting how many
designers I have here Wow one designer
you can help all of them how many
developers i have here or managers you
don't know anything about time just him
you need a designer only all you need a
design skills to do it ok design some
game think like a drug dealer or drug
dealer oh why because you have to
deliver something that people you like
and you want to use again and again and
again the story must be interesting and
sometimes you have to to make the use
the user lose the game to start again
start again to buy some extra thing ok
you have to to think about the eastern
history of the game the first part the
most most important thing
thinking our idea then you have to think
in the implementation the sum here at
the mobile developers already developing
some games this summer here did someone
here sign some games you develop a game
I know yeah you and you yeah wewe you
can show it later but how it was about
was about fighting it Wow
space yes pictures tab yeah then you
create the queue there are all kinds of
menu options make it a toy to as long as
education this is why you need a
designer yeah it works so let me explain
to you how can you do it if java me okay
oh thank you for your example Oh game
canvas the summer in here knows what is
game canvas game cameras up the class
where you draw your game the old style
way to do your game you there the screen
is that you code as a container drawing
absolute positions use a scale to get
bigger or smaller objects you have to
move an object move it to the position
05 25 30 okay game come with this very
low low profile to do it and you have to
take the keyboard event handling in your
hands the old style to make but you have
more control of the things if you think
Oh game come visit just for nubes the
furtive people are just starting know if
you had a simple idea why i don't use
game canvas or I want to learn about
game development start with game covers
you will learn
lot of things about mobile development
with Java me sprites the summer here no
why these sprites the summer here plays
Street Fighter the old Street Fighter
had two can yeah is this the old sweet
fighter too what is oh you beaut using
sprites hadouken z3 pictures ha-doo-ken
ok this is the sprite a coding is like
these you have characters and the same
elements can collide you have the image
and the movement is changing image
changing the image and they change their
positions ok some problems here you have
to do detect collisions the title is
this is not easy as you think you have
some rectangular the monkey in the the
3d false' he does not have to fall in
the fall to the ground okay catch the
tech collision they take a scenario to
know how can you put the monkey into the
three and five punch him a false ok
image manipulation time by time walking
is the three movements you can make
method walking the that receives an
avett like a keyboard even and then
cause the walk method up chain call the
jab method 03 image ok animations do you
remember the gifts and made it gifts the
old fashioned to make the videos in the
internet 90s as it's it's like the gifts
it's different we are
gamer were using sprites right you you
code again using sprites the running
game yeah and he did the game that yeah
running for olympic games using sprites
and then some money if it in we talked
to our brazilian guys in event we have
there is a cult TDC okay about sprites
the next layers until Thailand layers
st. Martin all this scenario is from at
angular have some some squares and you
have to to do the map creation each
space if the rectangular if user goes
forward the map goes backwards okay is
the use the tiller layers different
pieces compose the map so if user is
jumping you have to update each
rectangle here okay and animated
scenarios it's very cool way to do a
game let's see some higher ways to do it
game loop using the logic you've event
the tag chain decisions you can you can
google event loop to to know some more
Fink's user you can grab the user events
character events movements and
animations object updates and removal
something's in game look are ready you
just need to use but some things you had
to code okay it's a different way but do
you know about ancient engines engines I
don't know engines are in Giants please
engines please sorry about my Brazilian
English the package of recorded features
the main goal of the engines engines or
to make the development easier more
productivity may appliance
x is hard to think that if I froebel
have to fall down and then and the
ground have to jump it again it's not
that you have the right the physics 3d
animations or isometric cytokines Oh
Matthews it's like of this to flow my
presenter here okay it's easier matrix
in jeans do it for you great it's very
hard to should do it some engines for
Jeremy box2d box reorg isometric angel
ESO j2me okay additional api's facebook
oh there's Facebook and feature phones
or news Marshall yes you can use the
Facebook app API Twitter API that is
there some order from Nokia no I also
don't know I market I never use it I
never use it use it the twitter api
already use it at facebook your API it
works but Twitter API I know that it
exists like don't know if it works okay
and Google Maps it works here is the you
can go to the nokia developer and watch
their what can you you put google maps
in your app ho ho sakde apple you have
maps good maps here so our agenda we
talk about how to implement the apps
let's get the finnish money let's make
money with it business models is that
what you have to worry about a lot of
ways to make some money yes as a
developer as i do paid as i do too
mobile advertising i do it you premium
apps in approaches or
12 goodies first of all just a developer
is the easier way to earn money with
Java ME a games so absolutely market
marketing is they need people to code
apps or code games for advertising for
marketing it's hard to find people that
do it if it's hard it's thank you
expensive thank you all the people Fargo
only for the Android I can earn more
money so absolutely market guys good
price per hour as I said one of the best
form two programs area code reuse make
makes more money i use the develop apps
for the marketing guys and we reuse the
code so behind more money next paid paid
applications very simple model sync
simple and old-fashioned way the user
you have to pay for it now we need our
apple app store sorry app store are some
kind of way to sell my app in Brazil we
have the text mesh text message way of
buying wraps the user text message there
he will be built for the our cell phone
cell phone bill okay and the app will be
downloaded for his cell phone great in
general fuel price thinking quality have
more users mark money I can I don't need
to sell my app for 1,000 bucks 1 dot 99
maybe be sufficient don't just roll the
dice it's a good book if you want to
know
about pricing and mobile pricing read
this book very good Montaigne good web
and app store page why it's your
marketing page if you are selling App
Store that your app store page must be
good the user must to pay for it it's
the way of the him to to see what what
is the app how can I do if it ok knee I
I can i play it lets the game for
accumulate the social market you can
exchange some goodies in your app for
the social marketing like oh like us on
facebook and earn a or a big pistol that
you can keep everyone not like this but
you it's an example how can you do if
the your user next one mobile
advertising very hard way to to any more
money but it is easily to spread your
app for free and earn if advertising so
add banners mark licks my money it's
possible to track the ads clicking when
the user click 'add either the user
click 'add and when it is very good and
what screen it's very good way to to
track the user's interaction with your
app pay attention where the app you will
be show and who you use it you can learn
more money with more expensive ads you
can say ads that give us my money that's
different type of ads learn about eCPM a
CPM is the cost per per views per click
right it's a strange formula that
explains how how or
how about we what amount we earn if your
app is very important know about eCPM
it's not just the user see your
advertising it's see and click it it's
very important there there is a simple
ads like the the smaller ones and the
big ed's the big ed's you earn more
money than the smaller ads but the user
won't like it the bigger ones it's up
you have to balance okay more views and
clicks better advertisers it's very
important you have more views you can go
to the advertising if we say oh I have
my pics and then sometimes it will
automatic you have more views better
advertise any app can have ads examples
of companies you help you have Java me
advert advertisement we serve at phonic
and interactive your attic interactive
is very good I try it is since he show
me the interactive I try it's very very
good for all of the world not just
Brazil not just india not king you can
call the app for Europe or United States
which interactive it's very good for all
platforms yeah and you can call a app
for Android iOS and Java me if I think
that the 00 wants and earn if the amount
the sum of all of them it's very good in
the free meal and in-app purchasing the
freemium it's a new way to deliver apps
in general it's like the old trial is
the other aim or some kind there's some
difference in general they are free the
female
but the user can buy v12 goodies do you
know if the Facebook farm was the farm
view you can have your farm but you can
have a bigger farm if you pay them real
money for ducks Vito ducks why will the
user pay for it yeah don't don't ask him
he will only pay for it it's normal in
it's nice because the user you download
that 12 it's free letzte loaded then
hear you play it's your work to make him
by the goodies ok bye app store or other
ways users wielded by credit card or
cell phone bill earning varies by app
store or building type in app store in
general is 70 person for any any by ok
anyway scientific is yours yeah I keep
70 and the app store 30 ok example is
the the party is the Ducks like white
Doug red dark flamingo it's money people
it's not it's funny but a lot of money
here you have to to think about it
finally we are finishing I finish my
agenda here just for from final words in
Brazil we have a phrase it's a i will
say in Portuguese what's this type of
occupation amo in English the
translation do you know Portuguese
hahaha are you brazilian
okay nice in English it will be like a
URF DeKnight and cheese in your hand but
very strange in English I googled this
this phrase in Google semi you have the
I / hand you have the upper hand here
you have a market is the by the market I
don't know but you have a good market so
people are forgetting it but some people
earn some money if it I love it I can
can leave if only if this Java me so you
have the operant you are a Java
developer or your general manager of the
some company you can earn money you have
the upper hand okay you use your skills
just to do cruds hey developers create
retriever pdata leach out sucks it's not
good it's boring Bob I outs very very
interesting because I came in the
morning called a photo app and f'nor no
Facebook integration I can go to
facebook without don't say anything to
other ones up or are you Facebook Noah
integration integrate with my app nice
so cruds I don't like it I prefer to
called Java ME your iOS or Android
application go to mobile is very good
before we finish if you are not
satisfied with the Java ME get engage
with the community I am j glitter I can
talk about it and stay together if a jug
go to the local events speak creating
speak how I hate Java me it would be
good yes you to be good because you are
giving feedback to JCP to update it or
you are creating a
new kind of formula the community to
start something about it okay clean the
social media if you don't like it yes I
don't like some things about giving me I
client claiming to Roger choose chiefin
to any folks article i love them i
climbed to I I know that Java me is not
perfect it's not the biggest good silver
bullet market but I know that I can earn
money with Java me and if you're a
really cool guy who here knows about
adopt Jace are Wow please google it GG
star is a program from the community so
the community helps gcp to create or
actually eat the GSR to make the to
mirror the community feelings if you are
not happy or if you have some skills
please help us to make the feature of
Java ok so thank you as my contact my
