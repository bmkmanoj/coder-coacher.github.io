how to use insight consoles and custom
dashboards sometimes though business
owners need more detailed control over
the design and content of their
dashboards to accurately track a
business in this video we'll create a
detailed dashboard directly using oracle
business activity monitoring or BAM and
included in insight as an external
dashboard insight includes and depends
on key technologies provided by bam for
example when you create a model and
insight a corresponding project is
automatically created within BAM
milestones and indicators created an
insight are provisioned as columns and
rows and bam data objects in this
project custom dashboards are also
automatically provisioned as dashboards
in bam you can use the bam composer to
create your own dashboards in this
project those dashboards can then be
embedded in insight as external
dashboards John the business owner has
decided that he wants to understand the
relationship between total resolution
cost product types and regions within
his company's helpdesk business process
he hasn't been able to create a custom
dashboard in the insight that visualizes
this information to his satisfaction so
he's asked Carl the integration
architect to create a dashboard in BAM
Karl begins by opening the BAM composer
he finds the BAM project associated with
the inside help desk model this project
was automatically provisioned when the
help desk model was activated in insight
Carl creates a business query that will
select the information needed to create
the dashboard he selects the data object
called Astro tech helpdesk metrics view
this data object was also provisioned
automatically when the insight model was
activated Carl selects the sum and
average of the total resolution cost
column for the y-axis he also selects
the count of the incident ID for the
x-axis Carl chooses the product
dimension it creates filters to limit
the instances included in the dashboard
to those that are associated with a
particular milestone and to eliminate
null values after Karl saves the
business query he can create the
business view that all visual
the query that he just created he
decides to use a bubble chart to
visualize the information Carl chooses
the query that he just created for this
business view and assigns the x-axis the
y-axis and the bubble size finally Carl
creates a BAM dashboard to contain the
business view John can use this new BAM
dashboard in his insight console he
opens his insight preferences and
enables the external dashboard option he
opens the console for the help desk
model and selects the external dashboard
tab John clicks add dashboard and
selects the BAM dashboard that Carl
created this detailed view of the
relationship between total resolution
cost product types and regions is now
available directly from the insight
console for more information on how to
use the powerful reporting capabilities
and insight check out the using reports
