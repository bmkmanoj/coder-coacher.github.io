of this presentation was not recorded we
are joining the program already in
progress so essentially for no
client-side development you can get the
approximate location of every device on
the verizon network send every device on
the sprint network every device on the
ATT network every device on tmobile
network bell canada telcel in Mexico
whoo so so 400 million devices in North
America Europeans have have similar
capabilities not quite as sake
ubiquitous as as they are united states
precision location precision location is
is very very different from from
operator operator and in part this is
because of a 911 and and how different
operators meti 911 mandate the cdma
operators generally use GPS this is GPS
the the gsm operators did network side
so very different but in general a
precise location will use something like
triangulation assisted gps standalone
gps and Wi-Fi to determine your location
in a manner similar to what a 911 would
ask you to do okay so if your outdoor
good line of sight with satellites
you're going to get a couple meter type
accuracy indoors no gps but you've got
to recognize SSID fingerprint maybe
you'll get 30 40 meters no no Wi-Fi
capabilities then you'll the
triangulation maybe it's you know half a
mile or so okay but essentially what
we're seeing down the best to breed is
that people are you doing client-side
development and and really taking
advantage of the capabilities that are
on the phone augmenting it with network
services as well okay any other kind of
general questions about location
locations a big part
of I think all the operators
capabilities for Network api's some of
these are exposed in soaps I'm exposed
to grasp generally speaking it's rest
with JSON response certainly where
everybody's headed to so let me do just
a another Karnak on this so I really
don't know what type of device this guy
has let's say I wanted to send him some
contact what's your name Julian well
kids I don't know what type of device
julian has but let's say that we would
want to know a couple more things about
Julian here
okay so now we know that Julian is a
verizon wireless subscriber now this is
interesting this is an API that's really
the doesn't limit itself to verizon
information we of course know a lot of
information about you as a verizon
subscriber we know lots of your account
profile your subscriber profile no type
of device you have with we know if
you're connected to 3g network 4g
network you know if you're roaming we
know physically where your device is we
know lots of stuff but we also can let
you know as a developer which operator a
phone has you'd be surprised how many
people don't know who their operator is
and furthermore it maybe you won't be
surprised how many people don't know
what type of device they have so some of
the things that operators can do is to
give you a P is to help you do this
somebody comes to your website and they
want to get a text text alert well it'd
be nice not to have to ask them who
their operator is but just do a carrier
properties look up say oh they're ATT or
and ER or sell your south or whoever and
then you'll know something to do so
carrier properties is another thing that
if you're doing in the mobile world
you're going to run into a lot ok and
then let's see okay and we already know
these things
his phone's turned on so in the future
you might think oh is that phone roaming
or not roaming no used if you get a get
a null response well let's look to see
if his phone's turn on I mean sometimes
phones turned off and I'll turn off off
or don't turn off too much anymore but
if you do this might be useful to know
okay and the last piece of karnak i
think i want to do here is let's see
what type of device Julian we think
julian has is that close to Bionic okay
so this is a device characteristics and
that's you as a developer might be
interested in this information to help
make the content appropriate for that
particular type of device you go out and
get the waffle files or you a profiles
and and then you'll make your content
appropriate for this ok so any questions
here about the Karnak part yeah uh-huh
yeah great question i mean and let me
extend that to two things there's an old
standard called parle x p AR la y came
out of Europe in the early part of the
decade it's called parlay and the parlay
axes web service implementation Sprint's
deployed that we've deployed that
probably has a couple hundred
deployments globally hey um and so what
that means is syntactically there's not
a lot of difference okay but it still
needs that you have to go to each
operator if you want to get a location
of all the United States so cross
carrier ap eyes are a problem hey
because not every operator allows you to
interact with them directly now
fortunately in the location space there
are location aggregators a couple of
them here locally locate is a big
location aggregator probably the largest
locations the service
technic calm down in San Diego and
location labs over in berkeley all are
connected to most the most operators
tier-one operators in the united states
so you can go directly to them pay off
small premium but then you can then
they'll get the location for you each of
us have our own security consent
onboarding they're all different and so
one of the things that the operator need
to do is to harmonize that because
you're not going to add carrier location
or carrier stuff to your application
unless it's cross carrier
that's exactly right so I think there
are some challenges on the operator side
to make it make it seamless across the
operators and as you all know operators
are nimble and agile you know and so I'm
sure we'll have it done in the next
century or so okay but this this should
give you a flavor of the sorts of things
that operators know the only bring imma
bring up a presentation that that we can
talk about a couple other things any any
questions about this and Julian this
will disappear in 25 hours I promise I'm
sorry we could we could delete them but
i'll let them like have a beer tonight
oh God Verizon's tracking me what the
hell's going on okay bottom line is are
the operators the top line is the
internet one of the things that dries
operator behavior is is our
determination to have a five nines
reliable Network so essentially every
dollar every penny we spend in our in
our companies is really focused on on
network reliability and and and once you
do that it's very hard to be nimble in
the internet sense and so one of the
things we can do is to create our our
platforms that sit in between the
richness and capabilities are in our
networks and in RIT functions and expose
it to the to the developers in the
internet and so that way we can
hopefully solve this impedance mismatch
that comes about now as developers we've
got a couple things that we that we
actually care about making money is big
one how many people heard of Sarnoff's
law okay a couple of y'all anyway and
then Metcalfe's law everybody's heard of
Metcalfe's law and then reads laws a
little bit different
so Sarnoff's law comes out of
telecommunications of theory and it says
the value of a telecommunications
network broadcast network is n so think
of a TV station just broadcasting one
way no two-way communication just one
way so essentially the value that
network is determined by the number of
people listening to the to the to the
signal so medcalf came on in the late
50s and said the value of the network is
N squared because you got everybody
communicating everybody else and then
read ten years ago whatever it was said
really you can make a whole bunch of sub
networks in a Metcalfe network and
that's what that's what Facebook is done
so Facebook has taken a billion people
then created two to the billion
different sub networks in in facebook so
essentially every person to Facebook can
belong to two to the N different sub
networks okay now it turns out everybody
don't belong to that many but you might
belong to a new house buying one your
your high school and your college and so
lots of different subnet worked now the
value the value curves or the lesser
ative of where we as developers want to
be so nobody wants to be in the
broadcast TV business if you're not
communicating with your users your
application has a value of n and you'll
never get funded and then if you've got
a sort of a social net or a social
network where you can't have sub sub
groups for a dynamic group forming you
got to metcalf n squared which is kind
of nice it's better but it's really the
ability to take all your users and have
them associate with with each other in
multiple ways and so that's that's where
all the social money gets gets funded
how the so what operators care go I
contend that there's a number of things
we have in our network that can
facilitate self forming networks or
dynamically forming networks so location
and presence those sort of things and if
we go back down and look at Sarnoff's
law will one way SMS we all remember
that well maybe some of y'all don't you
I'm too young and then to a SMS email is
messaging voice with sort of two way and
then the social aspects came in and on
top of that but tools so silt a group
formation those are the things that
operators can help you with those are
the things that are in our network the
context of the user because the phone is
a proxy for the user so those are the
things you should ask your networks
network operators in the country's you
live in to expose to you via rest api s
so that you can make more contextually
aware contextually sensitive
personalized services any questions
about this I actually think is kind of
cool so these are the ones that we
should talk about that we saw these I
blacked out the the phone numbers okay
some of the additional api's and
services that we're currently
investigating so we talked about some of
the other things that operators might
know about you okay and once again
remember this is all based on your
permission to give somebody else's
information may operators by law count
can't divulge this information without
your consent it's called cpni data the
federal government watches us very
closely but in general if this
information is something you think the
Santa three-legged OAuth sense that
would help you in your day-to-day life
you should be able to expose it to an
application so enhance location
historical location that's something
that we might be able to with your
permission keep and breadcrumb so what
we might use that for let's say you take
some pictures this got a time stamp on
your camera so then you can dip into say
hey Hugh where was I on you know July
thirty-first at four o'clock okay with
your permission we could have bread from
your historical location and given you
an approximate location at some point in
time in the history it
back in history so that something
operators can do which is we store
terabytes and terabytes and petabytes
and lots and lots and lots of data okay
so if you think that that's a value to
you you can sign up for service
breadcrumb me for three months and then
you can geotag your pictures for
instance okay enhanced terminal status
we showed that one and today it's kind
of kind of lame and it just tells what
follows on or off but if the phone's
roaming some people actually pay more
for roaming than they do for if they're
not roaming so you may not want to take
that video conference call if you're
roaming so the application might be able
to make some contextually interesting
decisions based on your network status
okay whether or not you're connected to
3g or 4g so those are some of the things
that the network knows developers might
might be able to to leverage subscribe a
profile we have a building relationship
with a hundred million people we know a
lot about hey in some respects you come
into a verizon store we run a credit
check on you you give us your driver's
license everybody know what NIST levels
are security levels this level one two
three and four so in this level one is
kind of like your facebook profile you
could be George Washington whoever you
want it to be this level for you know
you can buy a house for maybe get a top
secret clearance and so I think the
operators relationship with you is in
this level almost three okay and then we
know we know how long you've been in
verizon credit score all that sort of
stuff once again it's all very protected
but for your benefit maybe you would
like for us to tell somebody your credit
score or tell them your billing address
or validate a billing address so that's
at least something that we that we know
that's in the it's in the IT databases
some people have asked us for that there
is certainly value values there there's
a lot more risk risk to the operator
potentially than value to the operator
so that's why there's no commercial
plans on on some of those yet
you know it's did stuff that people
would like to see Cal profile took you
are you a prepaid user postpaid user
that certainly might impact how you want
to get content call control we're an
operator if we can't help you make phone
calls in a sip sense you know we should
be able to do that you know we should be
able to create click to call services
sip based call functions that you can
now call so take an IP PBX and take the
300 functions that are an IP PX
decompose them to web services stick
them out in the cloud you developers can
then have access to them leave it up to
the operators to connect this phone
number in this phone number ok maybe in
a least cost way and so if you're making
a phone call between two verizon phones
maybe doesn't cost you anything ok so
there's things like that ok so let
operators do what we're good at and
connecting phone calls is one of them
quality of service this is this is
pretty interesting particularly as we
move to an all IP based network hey I
think we all in in our internet lives
you know occasionally skype skype gender
works pretty well but a Cajun I think
we've all had a Skype calls it grr rawr
that doesn't work so well would it be
nice to say gosh give me some give me
some more bandwidth now we may not
decide to do this but we can do that
when the 4g networks there they're
deployed generally on some technology
called ims ims now makes the network's
very programmable there's a nice
Institute down at Stanford doing
software-defined Network so soft refined
networks where you can essentially
program programmatically call quality
service for maybe mobile gaming has a
different set of requirements than a
voice call or a video call or best
effort internet access maybe those
shouldn't be charged the same that maybe
you want sponsored billing so there's
lots of options in this in this new
world of 4G that's powered by ms to give
developers potentially
says programmatic access to the network
so this is something that I think a lot
of people in the network API space on
operators have been looking for for a
long long time and you know I said
whether or not we can do it or not
business-wise legally much other reasons
but technically I think we can
demonstrate it and show that you can as
a programmer say this connections not so
good give me more or I don't need all of
that bandwidth I've got an m2m device
give me a little bit and i'll pay less
I've got a mobile gaming application I
need low latency low jitter I don't need
a lot of data so those are the sort of
things that are possible yeah gosh I if
I if I allowed if I said that I knew
their roadmap yeah we can we can ask
them
therefore no offer versus I'm not going
to participate yeah that there that's a
I think that's good inside really this
was impossible until sprint and verizon
went went to LTE so now in a couple
years we'll all be LTE everybody will be
all voice over LTE and all be ip-based
we're all kind of running the same
things it's amazing how different our
networks are and you can actually make
phone calls between them but so it's a
couple years yet but eventually I think
we'll get to where you are is gsma will
publish a set of standard network api's
that many operators will implement so
did you program to open social why not
okay so I was until OpenSocial I find
that that an interesting sort of
comparison because OpenSocial a few
years ago that was everybody's going to
do OpenSocial essentially so all the
losers in the everybody but Google did
OpenSocial so you could tell who wasn't
going to be around because they were
migrating to that api specification so
so I think gsma will be the the
organization that drives this but yeah
completely completely fair believe her
yeah broadcast for example to locate the
location statistics that's a great
question so uh that's a great question
it turns out Verizon actually has that
service today that and it's but it's not
available as a low-cost API but but it
is it is available the demographics of
verizon users so you can you can through
business relationship you can ask us
what are the demographics of the verizon
users that are in this particular area
at three o'clock in the afternoon so i
would like to make an API version of
that because i like low-cost you know
standards-based implementations the biz
dev guys don't like that so there
there's always that stuff but i think i
think your point is well made is thirty
percent of the country's verizon users
and so that's a pretty good proxy for
the knob people that are in any one
place point in time so it looked at
enhanced location so there is the
inverse location so i can do just like
we did with Julian say where's Julian
but wouldn't it be nice to say how many
verizon users are in this area and then
then we would know who that all we could
give you the rough demographics of that
as well ok so not an API but very
valuable and services is available
through through a biz dev type
relationship in question
UK market with oh good let's do it guys
japanese i support that there wasn't
quite push to standardize
so there been a couple efforts the most
recent one called wack wholesale
application consortium whack went out of
business and the assets were half sold
to a company named Apogee and half sold
to gsma so gsma has assumed some
responsibility for the cross carrier
standardization normalization of api's
through good reasons probably why didn't
didn't didn't work out but technically
it accomplished quite a bit good smart
guys Wow can you share who the
technology enables are for that in our
view that I put into context in Canada
TNS I and Epona have been running the
Canadian effort and so there is a sort
of a hub model in Canada with all the
Canadian operators connected to it user
developer can say get Canadian location
send it to these guys and these guys say
which operator is and and all that sort
of stuff sir that's why we're here we're
uh no CSG as well as been up for two
years hasn't broken I know his friend
was an opponent of the Irish guys were
great company at the time but we're
using Oh CSG Paula spent a good portion
of his professional life programming
assistance programming all that along
with the guy who did our other other
thing up there we built a lot of stuff
on top of US history but in terms of a a
platform it's been a very flexible
customizable very robust likes has been
operational for probably two and a half
years I don't think it's gone to an once
yeah my application for this with the
car
god that's a that's a good fabulous
question so the whole call control thing
with web RTC i think is really in flux
so in germany they've Zahl deployed our
CSV okay as part of ims we'll see and
we'll probably see some RCS at verizon
and other 4g operators now I always ask
myself what would google do with Google
deploy our CS or would they use web RTC
leg is pretty clear the web RTC will be
in all of the browsers maybe bulbul
browsers you know within next not too
long so maybe RCS so I don't know the
answer what's going to be the dominant
programming model web RTC and web
sockets are or web services RCS I think
those are all to be determined yeah yeah
I don't know I don't know twilio has
done a nice job I think and go it done a
nice job with some voice voice api's so
that there might be a place to go look
at for kind of best practices for for
doing some some voice and calling api
stuff I think the operators are still
relatively new to the API part of that
business
the crack has a beautiful city by the
way if you haven't been to Cracow go
it's one of the beautiful cities you get
a sort of an 1890s of Vienna sort of
experience and coffee thing it's the the
castle the salt mines sorry travel log
so intercarrier intercarrier location
alright so that's a great okay so
technically it's actually at the web
service layer we could do something like
OOP this is telkomsel take that phone
number send it over to them they could
resolve and send us back so you know
that a web service kind of loosely
coupled way pretty pretty straight
forward to doing it becomes much more
difficult when you start think about the
legal impacts of that okay all right so
so that that's really the hard part but
to do it at the internet level becomes
it is pretty straightforward right all
right yeah so we would have to still
send that question back to to the home
operator who has visibility to wear
their user is so it's not like Wi-Fi
where you go to Japan login to Wi-Fi hey
wherever you go in the world as long as
you got a verizon phone you turn it on
and you're a Verizon subscriber we're
servicing you even to the extent all
your traffic is back hauled to us maybe
it's crazy but that's way worse
great question i think that's a maybe
that's the million-dollar question or
partial billion-dollar question yeah so
i think it's fair to say the no operator
in the world has made a lot of money off
network api's and there's lots of
reasons for that one and then been
ubiquitous operators aren't particularly
great at it developer outreach certainly
the sprint guys I think ones your
developer conference the developer
sprint developer conferences yeah coming
up go down San Jose sprint developers
conference they've been doing it
consistently for probably ten years now
and then the 18t developer conference
generally held at CES yeah I think it's
at CES so operators have some developer
conferences and if you want to see that
particular operator and these are big
channels you know they can be marketing
you know you can get marketing support
from these guys but nobody's making a
lot of money off of these things yet
okay for all the reasons I think we've
talked about but I think the value
proposition is there's stuff in here
that people should care about and if the
operators need to do a better job which
we do and exposing it to the Internet
developers then that's what we need to
do the popular ones location is one that
we always start with because that's
that's kind of interesting as phones get
better and better and better that
there's less value in that but some
countries like say Brazil there's still
ninety-five percent feature phones so
network location and even here we're
well still over well over fifty percent
feature phones so network location like
i said is a nice adjunct to two
smartphones yep
yeah like I said you know we could sit
here and from the from the test aren't
if we could get the location with
consent of all Hunter million devices on
the sprint network or Verizon network
excuse me the old times come back now
France has an interesting thing going on
alcatel-lucent I forgot the name of the
thing good alcatel-lucent said you know
these consumer-facing api's aren't
aren't where the game is its enterprise
so they got with the French operators
and they've created a hub the next I
forgot the name of the thing we're
they're sharing subscriber profile
information with enterprise customers so
that's an interesting experiment that
we're all watching to see to see how
that how that works so a subscriber
profile information there's a lot of
value there after we very careful with
it but a lot of value in knowing prepaid
postpaid billing address how long you're
going to arise and subscribe or type of
phone you have how many people in your
account was the last time you changed
phones you all that stuff is known to
the operator and they you know maybe
they shouldn't divulge it maybe even if
you wanted to but if you want to you
know maybe we should do a three-legged
OAuth model and get your permission to
expose that yes sir
success security question almond massive
in the eye you will have people trying
to finding ways to cheat
all right I think Google's help them do
that already yeah I mean so every every
smartphone in the world and with this
little billion of them a year is
exposing their location to you know
people download applications from the
google play store and it says we want
your location shape okay do I understand
but it's the same location hey so yep
this reason
yeah I think that's a it's a great point
so privacy's big deal we get letters
from our congressmen all the time saying
how you're dealing with privacy well
what are you doing with this location
information and so far so good but
remember what we're doing is if you want
to share your location with an
application we've got your permission to
do so we notify you occasionally that
it's being done the application that is
requested this goes through a
certification onboarding process so that
they've committed to do the right things
so that's what Verizon does opera other
operators do different things but very
sensitive stuff it can't be
underestimated
it is VIP you what you talk about
happens happens okay and one of the
reasons operators we drew this really
long line is that we have to deal with
all the edge cases all the corner cases
if you're doing a little internet
startup you're going to go create a
couple click-to-call apps and and be
done with it but in our case we've got
to say you know if you're calling here
to here and this is inter latta i was
going to pay for that it's not toll free
so we will charge a 900 number you know
they're going to call customer care
that's ten dollars they want to refund
all that stuff happens at big companies
try to figure this stuff out those are
great great points yeah so I think the
complexity of the general solution does
those present some problems
oh they another great question the voice
network has different rules than the
data network we have to deal both of
them so the voice network because the
rules in law go back a long a long time
is very restricted what people can do
with it the data network feels more like
the internet so services that run over
the data network are less restrictive
than those that are run other voice
network turns out SMS runs over your
voice network so it's actually has the
same rules as a voice phone call okay so
you've got telecommunication services
you got data services and they are
substantially different a good point oh
yeah okay carrier billing okay so one of
the one thing like we have a building
relationship on a million people so
would it be nice to do carrier billing
okay so I think we actually do offer
carrier billing for applications that
are in the verizon store so fairly small
group but but it's their different
operators I think 18t offers a carrier
billing I'm not sure if Sprint does okay
sprint does normally in the United
States it's restricted to digital goods
with a fairly small cap monthly basis
Vodafone I think you can maybe buy non
digital goods with with 25 dollar per
transaction as opposed to my five
dollars per month one of the problems is
as operators don't generally want to be
viewed as a bank so it's sensitive but
from country to country operator
operator I think a lot of people are
doing this so what do you think will
happen in Poland for carrier billing
it has a lot of potential a lot of
people yep yep yep yep china mobile i
think you can do I know eight dollars a
month or a couple hundred rmb or
something like that I think they
recently lowered that but but it's a do
you remember as an operator your first
first priority is to make a lot of
people make phone calls okay and if it
and every every call you drive to
customer care is eight dollars ten
dollars or something like that so you
you got to be careful about this how
much more time we just one more question
