see how to use Oracle Enterprise Manager
for monitoring and managing jboss
application server enterprise manager
collect several performance metrics
outer box through potent response time
will give you an overall idea of the
performance and health of the
application server as well as the load
on the applications CPU and memory will
tell you that you socialization at a
system level
throughput can be optimized using the
thread pool as well as JDBC connection
pool garbage collection performance is
one of the most common areas of java
application monitoring
apart from outer box matrix Oracle
Enterprise Manager also allows you to
define metric extension using jmx you
can also define email notifications for
category loads monitoring templates can
be used for setting up the collection
frequency in the threshold level for
large number of targets simultaneously
given Diagnostics is the perfect tool
for production Diagnostics gives you
real-time visibility and also the over
it is very very low you can analyze it
threads by the locking or waiting stream
you can also bridge the gap between Java
and database by clicking the look at top
SQL and not only you can do that but it
can also del down from Java database
using SQL as and handle configuration
management is another aspect of managing
the applications in production
environment it is also a mandatory
requirement for several compliant
standards configuration management
allows you to define custom
configurations for XML zand property
files you can keep track of the
computation changes and also find out
the competition drifts
monitoring and diagnostics
this is a performance summer review
which you can customize using the metric
palette you can create as many
performance use as your functional
requirement is for example in this case
the performance chart set actually shows
the load and response time metric in
context of the server as well as the
applications there are several other
metrics group that we have created here
CPU and memory data source matrix which
will help you identify the JDBC
connection pool usage as well as the
available connections in the pool said
pool matrix will really help you
identify if there are any slowdown
issues related to the configured read
full size and also the garbage
collection performance garbage
collection who knows one of the most
common areas that affect the application
performance for example long GC cycles
will significantly slow down the
application as well as the frequent
garbage collection of old generation
objects will also slow down the
application when it comes to setting the
thresholds on memory utilization
typically the memory usage after GC is
the real metric indicator of the memory
health of the application server
or Foreman some review also allows you
to correlate the metrics which are
relevant to each other you can correlate
the performance metrics by using the
olive analysis feature you can just
click on the metric and it will show you
this menu by clicking on the problem
analysis you will see the most relevant
metric that are affecting the response
time it could be affected by the garbage
collation or also it can be affected by
the additional overhead that desire is
experiencing also you need to figure out
which application has the highest
throughput that is leading to the high
response time
this is the jvm Diagnostics view it
helps you to identify the threads by
their weight state this really helps to
identify the performance bottleneck in
the application layer for example if
your application is slowing down because
of a lot of logging operations you can
see the threads which are waiting on Io
if your application is slowing down
because of the database calls that you
are making then you can see the threads
which are waiting on database giving
Diagnostics also shows you the top
methods and the SQL that your
applications are calling you can simply
write down into the database by clicking
on this SQL
even database administrators can find
out which applications are making these
SQL calls
jvm diagnostic automatically filters out
the method which are making this SQL
calm
by clicking on this method name you will
see the entire call stack this really
helps to identify where in the code the
application is calling this SQL
configuration management
this is a conservation management view
oracle enterprise manager allows user to
define custom configurations apart from
the outer box collected conviction
parameters one of the best practice when
it comes to troubleshooting the
application performance issues is to
find out if some configuration has
changed for example application will
significantly slow down if you reduce
the connection pool size here from 100
to 20 thank you for watching this demo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
