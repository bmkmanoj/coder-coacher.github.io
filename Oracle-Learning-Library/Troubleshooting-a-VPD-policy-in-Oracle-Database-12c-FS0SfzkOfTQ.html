for oracle server technologies this is
one of several virtual private database
video in the one implementing virtual
database we show the prerequisite for
the others so this one is called
troubleshooting of EBD policy where we
intentionally create errors for your
learning purposes and then show you
tools how to resolve them for
troubleshooting it's useful to
understand the fine-grained access
control or FG AC and the VPD or virtual
policy execution in our example we have
a user as king who accesses a table of
view without a way across the data
server calls a policy function called
fun the policy returns a predicate the D
predicate and the data server adds the
predicate to the statement as you see in
this example and then execute that a
statement logged in to secure plus is
security administrator create a function
that contains two errors intentional
errors for your learning purposes next
at a policy that uses this fashion
optionally you can list all policies and
view the predicate connect SDS king user
and execute theory and you see that you
get your arrow at runtime not at policy
creation time to allow the asking users
I'm diagnosis possibility he has the
alter session privilege and execute the
statement again so that the output is
captured in a trace file in another
terminal window you list all trace files
and then display the last one to the
screen so here you find the error that
there is a missing right parenthesis in
this way a clause is the Security
Administrator you fix the function and
add the missing right parenthesis and
then as King tests again when as king
execute the view
there is still an errand so the steps
have to be repeated the order session
and capturing the trace information
again you find the name of the last
trace file and displayed to the screen
and analyze the error which is that a
name is invalid identifier it should
have been really last name a Security
Administrator you recreate the function
again logged in is as king you can
execute the query and you see that this
time all the rows are being displayed so
in this troubleshooting video we had an
optional review of how a policy execute
we created an erroneous function and
then optionally listed policies and
predicates we diagnosed twice and
troubleshoot it and corrected errors and
then finally confirm that we correctly
executed a function thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
