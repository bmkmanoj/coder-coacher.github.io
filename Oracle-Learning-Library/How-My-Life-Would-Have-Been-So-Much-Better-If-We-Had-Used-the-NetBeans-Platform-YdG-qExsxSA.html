life would have been so much better if
you had used in that means platform a
title like that would not typically be a
title of her presentation by someone who
is from the organization that provides
the framework being described but the
history of this is is that the original
person who is going to do this
presentation and ultimately wasn't able
to do so because the application about
which this presentation is focused on
it's too close to the company from which
this particular person comes so they're
not allowed to talk about this
particular product but since i have no
relationship with that particular
organization i am able to do so we will
start by very briefly here's the agenda
we look at the application very briefly
in schematically at its architecture at
architecture it might be missing and
based on the title of the presentation
one can guess what that architecture is
and look at look at the main features of
that architecture and hopefully at some
some stage do a couple of demos as well
so you can see how this all applies in
this context so who i am i am here to
young villain i'm a product manager with
an oracle for the NetBeans team I've
been with netbeans for a long time
originally I came from sun microsystems
and I guess Oracle kind of inherited me
along with the takeover and yeah so this
is all about the nipples platform and
based on earlier sessions that have
happened during this conference it turns
out that there's quite a lot of people
using it but let's see how it is in this
room how many people here and have would
consider themselves users of the
NetBeans platform okay that's quite a
lot and how many of you actually have
NetBeans platform products in production
in production at a customer site okay
great cool so this is
session will be definitely interesting
if you are kind of new to the net miss
platform but you might learn things even
if you're not especially when it get
when it comes to the demos you see some
things that you might not have seen
before so here's the application it's
some kind of typical a back office
application that you can actually
download at least the jar not the motor
sources from this particular site it's
it's some kind of application that
connects to an external device in this
case some kind of video and imaging
related devices and the application is
used to control those external devices
and this is one of the typical use cases
of the Java desktop and these kinds of
applications are found all over the
place and they typically start by doing
Java hyphen jar on the on the command
line followed by the jar file and then a
small application starts up that makes
some kind of connection to some external
device whatever it is and you can then
control and monitor those those devices
and it's it's therefore it's it's a
relatively simple application it has
requirements like creating connections
storing information in some special
formats opening files that the benefit
of this being a java application is that
it is that it is possible to run this on
multiple different operating systems and
I actually have it running now here it
is so here it is running and you see
that there are different tabs
representing different files inter
making connections to external devices
you go to file new and create one of
these new file types in this application
you see that there are that there's a
control panel on the left hand side
which is the same for each of these
different types of documents that you
work with it's a very typical standard
application with a menu bar and a
toolbar of which there are probably
millions around in the world the
architecture if you are going to be
incredibly simple about it is like this
we have the java runtime and we have the
application on top of it however the
missing architecture in this context is
a layer in between so this is the
NetBeans platform and this is really
what the what the focus of the session
is about is what that layer between the
java runtime and the application offers
it's really more focused on in this
session on this particular architecture
then step by step instructions for how
to use it it's it's really you're going
to get a high-level global view of that
architecture so what is the NetBeans
platform you're going to see this in
some some more diagrams but it's the
framework beneath NetBeans IDE and many
other applications many of which we will
never know about because often this kind
of these kinds of applications are not
only and used in the back office or in
house or somewhere but often in and
domains where they don't talk about
their applications at all you don't see
many screenshots of air traffic control
and defense and banking applications
because typically these are insecure
environments behind the firewall and the
developers working on those projects
often consider that their work to be
pretty mundane and boring and they've
been doing it for many years already
they're not blogging excitedly about the
new features they're creating they're
just doing their 95 job that's typically
the the scenario where these kinds of
applications are developed so this
middle layer that you see here the
nettings platform so let's look more
closely at this what what that consists
of so this is that that middle layer
broken down a bit further so you see
three levels they're the lowest level
in the nettings platform terminology is
comparable in the in the Java
terminology to the JRE so this is this
is the the core runtime of the NetBeans
platform in the way that the JRE is the
absolute fundamental basis of of Java
applications and this is the only part
that that each application that makes
use of this net means platform layer
must have as a mandatory component and
this is an important point because
typically when you start using a new
framework you tend to think to yourself
well I'm just going to have to buy into
the whole framework and I know I won't
need all of it but some part of it i
will need but i would just accept the
fact that there were lots of stuff that
i'll just have to include many jars i'll
have to include just for the sake of
using a subset of them in the case of
this framework that's not the case
because it's modular and you can choose
which pieces you actually want to use
and this lowest layer is the only
mandatory part and it consists of six
jars as you will see the middle layer
here in the Nipponese platform consists
of primarily a GUI components and gooey
components which are relevant for the 44
typical java guest of scenarios a window
system a number of swing components for
displaying complex data a mechanism for
synchronizing those different views
basically the view layer solving many
problems that one typically has when
working in the view layer but this
entire layer is optional and I'll share
a couple of demos where you can see see
the impact of that the highest layer if
you see here consisting of here a number
of modules one should see as plugins so
these are modules plugged into that to
that architecture and these are the
external contributions made by you as a
developer so not only do you have the JR
in but you also now have the NetBeans
core runtime and probably a subset of
the NetBeans QE component layer and then
on top of that you you add the domain
specific parts of the app
education and by that time by the time
that you start contributing to the
application there is already so much
that is provided that you find that you
work on a very domain-specific in a very
domain-specific way because nothing that
is generic should be your concern
anymore if you're creating an oil flow
application you only be working directly
with your oil flow objects you'll not be
working with setting up a window
management system setting up a start
sequence and as you'll see a bit later
on so this is the generic generic
architecture of applications this is the
architecture of NetBeans IDE of Gaffey
visualization two of two three actually
Jukes Choice Award winners from this
year a gross sense open source file
management system and NATO's air defense
system and a refugee agency system used
to register and manage refugee data so
many applications and all sharing this
common architecture which of course has
the benefits that at some point this
becomes a kind of pseudo standard so
once you've corrected at once you've
been working with this in one context
switching to a different context in a
different organization becomes simpler
because the architecture is shared among
different organizations so here is the
core runtime so if I go back to where I
was before this is the lowest level in a
bit more detail so that this is the kind
of the JRE of the NetBeans platform is
here and consists of in this diagram as
you can see six different blocks and
each of these blocks are jars these are
just jar jar files in netbeans platform
terminology these are also modules so
there's some metadata added to this jar
files and there is a deployment format
which wraps these this metadata and
these jar files into into another into
another format which is comparable to a
zip format so you could unzip these
files and look at the content what is
inside here
so what are these in in some more detail
so what does this knit mean score runs
on provide a startup sequence first of
all so using and the next platform as a
starting point you will never find
yourself writing the start of sequence
of the application because it's already
contained in the core runtime so there's
a startup jar and a bootstrap jar that
provides the startup sequence however of
course you might be thinking okay but I
do need to initialize some things when
the application starts up so there is
our entry points into each of the
modules that you provide lifecycle entry
points so when the module is loaded into
the system when it's unloaded from the
system you can initialize and initialize
a parts of the application
so that's a first really big benefit you
have a startup sequence predefined
optionally you can even ever write that
startup sequence but that almost never
happens and normally a sign that you're
doing something wrong if you're thinking
about overriding the startup sequence
there is also a module system so exactly
what what jigsaw could be could be for
for Java developers so I'm not looking
at jigsaws role in breaking up the JDK
into smaller pieces but jigsaws role as
a as a module system is what the
NetBeans module system also is and
working in a very similar way to SGI and
in fact you could use osgi inside
NetBeans platform application so if you
have osgi bundles you can include those
inside your application on the nettings
platform however typically if you have
an osgi bundle you created that in the
context of eclipse RCP where swt is used
so you're not likely to be integrating
SWT components with swing components but
if you have some standard jar file with
some domain objects as osgi bundles you
can include these what the core runtime
also has which is very useful is a
virtual file system so every single Nick
new scheduling application has a file
system in the same way as a computer has
a file system and when you install
applications onto a computer folders and
files can be created in the same way
when you install modules into your net
news platform application virtual
folders and files are created and in
that way the NetBeans platform is
extensible because for example the menu
bar of the mappings platform is built by
a component within the nipping splat
from looking for a particular folder in
that file system so it finds a folder
called menu and all the actions
registered in that particular menu
folder are loaded into the menu bar the
toolbar has built in that way all the
different parts of the Nipponese
platform or the GUI components
or should be an extensible in that way
and your own components can also be
extensible so you could correct
dialogues in your application that
external contributors could extend by
adding new panels into it and if they
register those panels in a predefined
place that you have defined for them and
in your documentation your developer
documentation you say if you want to
have your panel appear in this
particular dialogue then you register it
in this particular folder and in the
file system so this is a very useful
feature as well and finally there is a
loosely coupled communication mechanism
so based on event listeners enabling
modules to communicate with each other
in a well architected manner so rather
than making direct links between the
different modules in the application
there is a fixed infrastructure by means
of which you can publish objects and
listen for them in other modules so this
is the netbeans core runtime the this is
again this lowest level concerned with
the things that any application needs
and solves these particular concerns in
a standard manner so here's a list of
advantages of the netbeans core runtime
so the fact that there's a module system
means that you can openers features in
the application in two different
containers well normally you would do
that in written jar files and within
these modules you have jar files but the
benefit of having an additional layer
above jar files is that you can organize
features into modules which is something
that you'd normally do with packages you
can't put a particular feature into a
package that's not normally what
packages are used for a module system
also enables you to easily assign tasks
to different people within the
organization so you have 10 developers
you can say you three work on this
particular set of features which are put
into different modules which is again
not something you can do with a jar
based system you can't say work on these
10 packages within the
the application but this is generically
true for any module system but this is
something that you have built in
natively into the nettings platform
because you have a module system you
also have the possibility of combining
different modules into different
distributions so in the case of NetBeans
IDE for example we have a PHP
distribution which includes only modules
relating to PHP functionality and a Java
distribution and we could make different
distributions and containing different
features for different end users this is
something that's not possible if you
have a monolithic piece of code also in
the NetBeans module system as an osgi
you can you conversion each of the
modules in your application so in
addition to having a version for the
whole application you would your mot
version each of the features which are
in different modules and the advantage
of that is that you can more easily
track the changes that are taking place
in your application so you would
typically for example have one module
with domain classes which would not
change very much you would have another
module providing a view onto this domain
classes and those that module with that
particular feature would go under go
move or change and especially for
example with JavaFX you would produce a
new module providing JavaFX components
you would increment that module and if
you then look at all the versions of all
your different modules you can see where
you are changing more quickly which is
also useful information in analyzing the
architecture what's also possible and a
big advantage with this system is the
possibility to create clean api's on
extension points so there is a class
learning mechanism built into the
NetBeans platform by means of which by
default anything found inside one module
cannot be reused in any other module so
that's a default state you have maybe 20
modules everything inside each of those
modules is completely I'm isolated from
all the other modules only once you make
the explicit decision to share code with
other
modules and can you as the author of a
module say okay these packages inside my
module are available to the rest of the
world to use and then other modules that
need to use code from that module need
to explicitly set a dependency on that
module and in that way you can't make
the accidental dependencies between
different subsets sub components in an
application which is the basis of
spaghetti code because people quickly
reuse a utility method from somewhere
else in the application without thinking
of the consequences without thinking of
what the dependencies of that utility
method are and the author of the youth
of the utility method changes it and
breaks code somewhere else in a modular
system with with this class learning
mechanism built in you can hide those
utility methods from the utility classes
from the rest of the application so that
people can't accidentally begin using
your your code and which is especially
valuable in large applications that have
existed for many years where spaghetti
code is more likely to exist and these
kinds of mechanisms are ready there to
keep an application sustainable over a
long time so that you don't have to
rewrite it and from scratch every few
years when it becomes too much of a
nightmare to maintain so there's also
the mechanism for listening to events
across modules and to listen for
listening to your objects being
published and so there is a also built
into this a context there's a context of
the application which is comparable to
the service loaded class in jdk six but
here the context is not only application
wide but also per window so each window
in the application has its own context
and even each item in a tree component
in a net news platform has its own
context so you can publish objects into
that put it into the context of the
application or into the context of the
window or into the context of the items
in a tree and depending on an object
being available other objects can become
enabled or disabled so for example a
save action can become enabled if a safe
object is published into the context of
a particular object so this is really
the mechanism for creating
a context-sensitive application that
we're at which again is a concern for
large applications with many different
kinds of users so you don't want to have
all your menu items and toolbar buttons
enabled all of the time for example a
save button when there's nothing to be
saved so there's a very nice predefined
built-in concept of a context into which
object can be published and so it's a
very fine-grained context but can be
used to the extent that you need it and
the final point here with the core
runtime no need to write a startup and
shutdown sequence because that's already
predefined but again this could be
overridden if needed so this as you can
see here there are no GUI components
these are all low level service
infrastructure concerns and meaning that
and this is why the whole middle layer
the the key component layer could be
replaced with another layer providing
different components from a different
language or together because there is no
mandatory dependency on specific GUI
components so returning again to the
diagram with which we left we've looked
at the core runtime and the lowest level
and seen the advantages of those
features then are all baked into the
Nipponese platform so now let's go one
layer higher which is the layer of the
debris components and where I can show
some demos so if you break it down these
are the these are the key GUI components
so a window in framework if an
application becomes any kind of size you
need more than one single jframe you
need to be able to detach windows and
think of think for example of stock
trading applications or of air traffic
control applications or any kind of
monitoring application typically the
user has not four monitors and they want
to be able to undock windows and move
them onto multiple different monitors
and view data and and those different
view should all be synchronized with
each other so not only do you need to
have the possible
30 of undocking windows from the
application frame but also the ability
for those different windows to be able
to be aware of each other so that's a
lot of work and and it is this you know
two options either you write this
yourself at the point where it's needed
actually three options one is don't have
a window frame work the second option is
write it yourself and the third is and
use an existing one and in the using
existing one option there is definitely
interesting swing components that exist
that you could use for example from Jade
there's a giant docking framework and
this various other existing winnowing
frameworks but typically what these
provide is only a windowing framework
whereas in the case of the Navy's
platform you have a windowing framework
plus the core run time with this module
system the file system and the the
loan-level service architecture so you
get a whole bunch of other things in
addition to the windowing framework and
that the second thing is the selection
management in the beginning very seems
very fake and very abstract but once you
start looking at applications and you
see how they work and how when you have
multiple windows when something is
selected in one window something related
should be selected somewhere else and
you have a properties window and you've
not put different views and you realize
that you need some kind of functionality
like that and this is built into the GUI
component layer and enabling not refuse
to be synchronized with each other a
third item that's really very very
powerful and useful is in the case which
is you know when is when is this not the
case when you have business objects of
some kind you know you creating an
application for oath oil flow or for car
design or whatever and you have a car
object or even oil object you want to
quickly visualize that to the user in
some kind of visual component in a node
hierarchy showing multiple of your
object and there is a kind of a data
binding mechanism in the netbeans
platform which lets you visualize your
your business objects
by providing implementations of retro
classes of visual representation of our
code nodes then you can display those
nodes inside multiple different swing
components and all of the net nice
platform components are aware of this
node class which is comparable to a
model class in the same way as you have
an abstract list model and a default
remodel and all of the different swing
components typically have their own
model with the NetBeans platform there's
one model that all of this all of the
netnews platform swing components know
what to do with so this enables the
selection management mechanism to work
and also the objects to be visualized
inside the swing components another very
important thing at some stage you're
creating a menu bar on the toolbar and
not only do you with knitting this
platform have both of these already when
you start the application it's a pretty
defined menubar and toolbar but there is
also a nice mechanism for registering
these for registering action listeners
so you have a plane actionlistener like
you would have in a any java application
a plane normal action listener no
special making spat from class and you
need to register this action listener
into a folder and in the virtual file
system and there's a folder called menu
and this is this the content of this
folder is what is put into the menu bar
and the the action listener and the way
that you've registered the action
listener determines what icon is
displayed what display name is provided
and even whether or not the under what
conditions the action is enabled and all
of this information is is just defined
inside of annotations which nitin is
packed from annotation processor turns
into registration entries so so these
are the key components on the GUI level
but there's a number of other things to
be aware of and that that you get and
some some features you only find after
having spent months implementing it it
yourself and at the same time you're
learning model nitin's platform and your
look into the source code and you look
into other applications and this is also
the nice thing about having
a shared framework there's many existing
applications and then you can look at
you can wonder to yourself how did they
implement that and then there's a
mailing list where you can communicate
with all of these people who are
creating these applications and often
they'll tell you well it's just this on
this API from the Nipponese platform and
if not many of these applications are
open source as its NetBeans IDE so you
can take any of the code that you find
interesting and included in your
application you can literally take any
piece from the pins ID if you're going
to change those pieces then the
licensing terms determine that you
should contribute your changes back to
NetBeans but that but if you just take
the code as is included in your
application than there are unknown
licensing concerns there are there's
also a customization dialog another
typical thing you want the user to be
able to change the background or change
the fonts or change some setting in the
application and there is a predefined
dialog together with an API for
extending that the dialog and that in
turn if you look in the source code
gives you an opportunity to learn how
that is done so you can create your own
dialogue based on the how it works with
the options window in netbeans that is
extensible then also java help support
so I think the only disadvantage with
how easy it is to create so but Java
help I mean when you go to the help menu
in the application you click on help you
get a window that shows you some HTML
content only problem with the fact that
it's so simple to create within that
means platform is that there's no excuse
for not writing content anymore and the
update mechanism so typically you
distribute the application to the end
user they find bugs and you say to them
okay we'll fix the bug and now wait
until the next release two of the
application to benefit from the
enhancements you've made with a modular
system there's the the possibility at
least in this case of incrementing the
version of your module and just
distributing that module so in fact you
the the incremented module becomes a
patch for the existing amount
that the user is installed and there's
also a nice mechanism for publishing
these these modules so there's an XML
file that can be generated inside of
which all the modules that you want to
publish and can be registered and you
can then put this XML file onto onto a
server somewhere together with all of
the modules that you want to make
available and then you can you could
pre-register this update center into the
application or let the user edit
themselves and in fact to really
crystallize what that is it's it's an
app store so you can create an app store
for your application just like iphone
app store android app store a
marketplace so potentially a marketplace
where you can quit sell features to the
end users or make patches available or
have different you could have different
update centers for different kinds of
users so there's this admin users and
there's normal users and they need
different features so it's really a lot
of opportunity there for providing
patches for correcting a marketplace and
all of this is provided out of the box
also something in the application that
we started with I had to go to the
command line and type Java minus jar and
then the jar file which is not something
that an end user is going to be very
comfortable with so with the netnews
platform if you use netbeans ide as your
as your software development kit you can
generate an installer for each operating
system you can generate a different
installer so or a web start enabled set
of files so distribution the
distribution side is also at taken care
of so with that said I want to show a
couple of things so first of all with
the window in the windowing framework so
the default 10 in framework is as
NetBeans IDE has it so something like
this and here you can see also the the
communication mechanism in action
because you can see we have a properties
window on the right hand side and we
have a different window displaying our
projects on the left hand side and as we
move up and down
from one file to another the properties
window changes obviously it changes
we're not surprised about that but the
mechanism by means of which this happens
is is a key factor and that is on this
side we publish an object and on the
properties window side we're listening
for an object and this property is when
i was listening for a generic standard
object so not a specific object that
you've created but the wrapper class
around the business object so if you had
create your own wrapper around your own
business object then automatically it
will be displayed in the properties
window when you publish that that
wrapper object around it so this is the
standard typical way that the window
system works so be with the docking and
the unlocking and and so on so all
standard features since netbeans 7.1 I
think you're also for the first time
able to undock groups of top components
so you see a float group and I believe
this was a J developer requirement so
this is one reason why i think the
oracle takeover of some was so cool
because it resulted in a much better
window system for netbeans because
jdeveloper is now based on the same
infrastructure and now oracle has
multiple different projects all sharing
the same framework which means in some
cases conflicting or more interesting
requirements not requirement from one
product but from multiple different
products so we try to combine all of
these different requirements into the
window system for example which leads to
the window system being more expressive
for anyone correcting applications on it
so here I was so I'm going to dock the
group again and so this is just a
standard window system but here are a
couple of other things and each of these
come from tutorials so if you were at
the earlier session and showing javafx
in southern weapons platform but there
in this case it's it's a using the
standard NetBeans window system but and
just
to give you a colorful picture to look
at all the graphs and this is javafx
embedded inside inside the Nipponese
platforms window system so with all
these special effects so if you missed
the tutorial on this topic from 10 to 12
it was really very interesting and the
source code of this is also available so
so you can see the the charts change and
if I select something here but the point
is that there is a swing J table here
and if I change the values and all of
the charts are updated at the same time
and so this is really not its I would
say it's almost trivial to create with
all the documentation tutorials that we
have on this topic so creating really
interesting chart based applications is
completely possible but to look at the
window system here is a completely
different way of working with the
NetBeans window system and its kind of
reverting back to a pre window system
situation once it started up so what we
have here is well first of all you see
you have no menubar toolbar proving the
point that that's completely
configurable but secondly this doesn't
look like the nettings window system at
all and in fact these are J internal
frames inside of a jjs gesture pain so
you can take a standard desktop plane
put it inside of a NetBeans window which
is just a swing container into which you
can put any swing objects and inside of
that desktop pain you can put in your
internal frames and if this is what you
need you know there are applications
that have this kind of desktop
appearance so it will taking over yeah
taking over the whole desktop and you
can minimize into the desktop pain and
at the bottom so this is this is but so
the benefit is i mean this looks like a
certain swing application but the
benefit is that you have a module system
you have a file system you have all of
these the
the nettings core runtime and plus you
have one single window where you've
removed the tab and you've added your
own desktop pain and internal frames and
this can communicate or if you like but
in this case also using the same
mechanism so i'm using nodes inside the
panel inside the internal frame so
that's one situation that is quite
common another one is let's say that
we're creating our own ide no so one
place where the desktop is very popular
is for creating software development
tools so what you can do is you can
include not only the modules from the
NetBeans platform which can also include
the modules from the IDE not from Java
specifically not from any particular
language specifically but just the IDE
so what does the IDE provide that the
netnews platform doesn't provide so for
example the concept of projects is an
IDE functionalities are going to have
this project's dialogue and there's a
project API that you can implement and
register the project implementations
into this dialogue so that the user of
your IDE for your own language or your
own tools that you are curating can
create projects of your type you can see
that there's a lot of functionality run
project and these are unimplemented
unregistered so they are grayed out but
so now you have a complete a framework
for creating an ide for for some
technology whatever whatever that
technology is plus yet you already have
integration with git mercurial
subversion built into to the interview
ide skeleton before you've even begun
doing your specific coding now this this
could definitely be a useful thing an
infrastructure for for IDEs and one
example of this is is microchip which is
created interesting ide of its own on
top of the not estimate with platform
but also it means I ve and the last
winner system related thing I wanted to
show was another way of looking at the
window system which is also quite common
and that is full screen mode so there's
full screen mode built in and let's say
you're creating some kind of air traffic
control application know what you see
here comes straight from a tutorial so
that all the steps are provided but you
see here a map and there's many open
source map technologies that you can use
this also very nice commercial products
like Alice yet map that is used in
NATO's application so you see a map you
see we're in full screen mode you see in
the menu bar there's no toolbar here
with chesley we don't need a toolbar and
you can see all the standard menu items
but in addition these windows that you
see here floating above the map let's
say I click on something I'm let's say
down here so you can see that this so
here is the current wind current where I
am currently so I click on a location
and information about the currently
click location is added so in some cases
there is nothing available there so here
can see for example this is the
currently clicked location and this is
the history of all the locations that
have been selected in the past so we
click somewhere and the top window shows
the current location the button window
shows all the locations that we've been
too kind of simulating a scenario that
could be quite useful in air traffic
control or in general in geospatial
applications and there are many examples
of geospatial applications also the the
Agora sense project that when the
adjuchas choice award yesterday is open
source so you could learn from that
there's also a subset of that agri cells
project that has been published
separately into a maven repository from
where you could pull it and include it
in your application so there's a lot of
support for for this kind of application
and a lot of people with experience
creating this kind of stuff and this is
never going to be browser-based it's
always going to be a desktop type
technology okay so when I mean framework
you've seen the selection management
just to show you the action framework
that I'm
if we have a or let's use one of the
existing ones the air traffic control
system so here is flight control module
so you can see also so I'll close the
other ones that the modular system is
really nice it's not what one sometimes
things ok so now I need to think about
how this modular system I have to use it
now you don't really have to break your
application into modules you could have
one single module then again you can't
really call that a modular system but
it's completely possible to have all
your code inside one module and that's a
typical initial step in the in the
creation of the application but at some
point you think well this part of my
code I want to always provide as the
core of my application but this part I'd
like to provide separately maybe for
money or to specific users and then you
will in a logical way start thinking
about modules and you'll separate out
that code into into another module each
module prevailing a different feature so
here we have this flood control module
that provides a window with some
information but let's add a new menu
item so normally if you want to create a
menu item you will find in your
application where the menu bar is
curated and then you'll find a reference
to the menu bar and say menu menu bar
edge and then you create your menu item
in this case there is this handy tool in
the IDE which lets you create menu items
and toolbar buttons so in this case we
will say it should always be enabled it
could be conditionally enabled so for a
particular object so if a object of my
kind is in the it's in the context of
the application then enable this
particular action so that's so for
example when the context disabled then
enable the action so we in this case
menu item it could be a toolbar button
but here to be a menu item and it's in
flight control so we'll call this one
define flight for example define flight
action define flight and actually what
we're creating here is not an action so
much as simply an action listener so
we'll call it define flight action
listener so click finish and so here we
we have it oh wait let me just fix the
there it is what's okay fine so what we
have is the action listener and but what
what is really interesting is we only
have an action listener so porting to
the netnews platform when it comes to
your action to your actions as a
question of copying action listeners
abstract actions or your action classes
directly into modules and then you need
to create these annotations because what
happens when the module is compiled
these annotations are turned into
entries inside of an inside of the file
system and the way that is done is when
this is compiled and XML file was
created this XML file is registered
inside the file system of the
application so what we will get from
this and I will show this so i will
build this module and you can see here
that an action reference is set so paths
equals menu file so in the file menu
there's going to be an action created
see if I can make this bigger so you can
actually see it so you can see here that
there is an action reference for a for
the file menu so in the file menu there
is going to be a menu item it's going to
be created and the menu item is going to
have this display name to find flag it
could have an icon as well and when
that's defined flight menu item is
clicked whatever we define here is going
to be performed so if I build this
module and I go to the files window what
I see is in the build folder what is
created is a layer file so this is an
XML file you can see how the the
external
most external taggers file system so
this is a contribution to the file
system each module can provide one of
these and you can see here actions so
there's an action here they define
flight action listener so the action is
defined and there is also a menu folder
and in the menu folder there's a file
menu with a reference to a shadow file
so I'm not to the actual instance so
this is like a system link so we have
the instance file referenced in the
actions folder and we have a link to it
in the menu bar we could have a link to
it in the tool bar in multiple different
places and we link to it so once you
click on the menu item we link to the to
the actual instance which is then
curated at that point and so there we
would have our menu items if we run once
again you will see under the file menu
that we have a new action so this is the
nice thing about this first of all is
that this is a standard mechanism for
registering actions secondly you don't
need to care about anything except what
happens when the user clicks on that
particular menu item or toolbar button
you don't even need to care about what
needs to be enabled so here you can see
defined flight has been added so and you
don't even need to care about how this
is enabled so let's say this should be
enabled so I create a constructor if so
let's say there's a string a string now
when this is now compiled this module
what will be created is a different kind
of action a registration entry and let's
clean and build this module and what is
now created is a still running the
application but anyway a different
action registration is its generated
from this which says a string needs to
be in the context in order for this
action to be enabled and then if some
other part of the application publishes
that particular object automatically
this action will become enabled and the
user will be able to click on it so by
passing in an object into the
constructor you're saying under what
condition should this action be enabled
and that handles the enablement for you
it will be disabled until there's a
string in the context because under the
hood this maps to an internal NetBeans
action class that does all the
enablement and and if we look here does
all the enablement for a particular type
so from the constructor the annotation
processor took the information to set it
as a value of the type mm attribute and
that information will then be passed
into the internal action class which
will enable under those conditions okay
I think we should beginning to the end
of things and this how update mechanism
that you see in the net news platform
can also be part of your application so
this dialog is just some predefined
modules that you can include to install
and distribute new new modules new
features and to other users of the
application javafx fits very naturally
into this and this morning there was a
great tutorial by the other pole and
Gayle Anderson on this particular topic
there's another session coming up about
this javafx it's very naturally into
this health story there's a Java flex
panel that you can put into a swing
component and into that javax panel you
can put javafx charts or the java web
view then it becomes possible to style
your Java desktop application because
javafx supports a CSS style sheets and
then you can create style sheets to
style the application it also lets you
if you like my great step by step to
javafx you don't have to buy into all of
javafx if you don't want to you can take
the pieces from it that you find
interesting
if you don't want animations and and
fleshy stuff in your banking application
which would make sense I guess then you
don't need to include those but the
parts that make sense you can include
and that's really a wonderful thing
about javafx too so in conclusion the
net miss platform is an application
framework for the Java desktop whether
it's swing or javafx in theory it could
be anything so that there is also an
open source project for correcting
Scarlett applications on the NetBeans
platform as an example and very widely
used there there are hundreds of
applications that we know of and
thousands that that we hear about but by
the sigh we can tell you because it's
secret and we'd have to kill you and
things like that there are many books &amp;amp;
tutorials and training courses and there
is also a very handy cheat sheet which
introduces you to everything that you've
heard with references to and where you
can go to and these are free for anyone
here who wants to give me their business
card and your business card will not go
anywhere else i will use it to contact
you to say head you want to join a
training course or and and if you say no
I will never contact you again but it's
just it would be very nice to be able to
interact with you and ask you about what
you would like for non that means
platform if you found it interesting
we'd really like to help you and have
you join courses and things like that so
they're up here and waiting for you so
there are also many other sessions
throughout Java one that you can follow
there's one interesting one on Thursday
which is an it means platform discussion
panel what you'll see 66 or so different
Nick knees platform applications being
demonstrated by the architects and
developers working on them so you see
some actual applications you can ask
people how they did it and how long it
took and things like that there's also a
session this sessions about modularity
battlenet means platform there's a
project called nurov which is also an it
means platform application for neuron
networks which you can also attend other
in the one minute that I have carefully
assigned for Question Time any questions
yes yes yes you could do that definitely
yeah except you wouldn't have a window
system if you if you want to do it that
way but you could put your job at X
components into the NetBeans window
system yeah
was for its colorful necklace platform
application development yeah the scholar
support for netbeans is contributed by
an external person it's not officially
supported but the fact that he corrected
that plugin means that he knows about
the NetBeans API so theoretically that
it could be extended to be used for
nikki's platform development but it
would be interesting to see what he
thinks about but there is actually a
very interesting scarlet based native
platform application used for
application useful learning scholar and
it's written in scala on the net news
platform so that's that's the one enough
but they've definitely figured it out
themselves and there's no official path
to that to the
not much not not so far and so you start
blogging about it and demanding that
this happens okay thank you very much if
you have other questions I'll be here
for some time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
