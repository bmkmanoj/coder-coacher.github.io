addresses and enrich account and contact
records in real time from Oracle data
cloud Oracle sales cloud and Oracle data
cloud have different subscriptions the
account administrator for sales cloud
needs to associate the two services so
sales cloud knows which data cloud
subscription to access after their
associated your sales reps can get the
most up-to-date account and contact
records assuming you already have an
active sales cloud subscription and then
add a data cloud subscription you just
follow these four steps steps one and
two are done in the my services
application steps three and four are
done in sales cloud first login to my
services to create a data cloud user
this user will securely communicate with
the data cloud rest ap is from Oracle
sales cloud enter the data center where
your data cloud service is located your
identity domain and your identity domain
password this information is listed on
the welcome to Oracle cloud email you
got after activating your data cloud
subscription if you can't find this
email you can resend it from my account
the username and password should be the
same you use for Oracle support when you
create your new data cloud user make
sure to add the required data service
client app ID role after the user
account is created Oracle sends this
email notification so the second step is
to reset the password for this data
cloud user in my services note that your
new user now has credentials but still
needs to know the service URLs to log on
the service administrator or the
identity domain administrator can
provide this from the welcome email the
third step is to configure the managed
sales cloud to data cloud integration
task in Oracle sales cloud
for the URL enter the address of your
data cloud instance listed in your
welcome email and on the my services
application you just need to remove the
end part from the listed URL select the
security policy to connect to data cloud
and enter the user and password for the
data cloud user you just created and the
last step is to configure the manage
administrator profile values task in
Oracle sales cloud make sure the profile
level site value stays at no this is the
only value supported today now your
sales cloud subscription and your data
cloud subscription are associated and
the two services can talk to each other
and your sales reps can update their
account records and verify account
addresses with the latest data all
without leaving Oracle sales cloud
