configuration of my Raspberry Pi which
we will use for our oracle stream
explorer tutorial on connecting sensor
gateway devices to event processing
using the rest protocol here in my
configuration I have a Belkin router
which are used to connect from my last
be PI to my computer here we have a USB
hub this USB hub connects the various
sensors to my Raspberry Pi here I have
the Raspberry Pi which is used as a
standard ARM processor and here I have a
sensor this sensor is used for
temperature monitoring and so we're
going to show how this sensor provides
live real-time sensing data streams it
through to the Raspberry Pi which is
running a local event processing
embedded to do some basic analysis and
then that flows to the OCO stream
Explorer where you can build your
powerful real-time Internet of Things
applications in this tutorial we will
show you how to integrate two devices
such as a brass beam pie running Alabam
process and embedded using rest after we
login we'll go to our customer
experience customer analytics section
and we will provide and create a
exploration and stream that allow us to
communicate with a raspy PI for the
stream we need to define the context
path that will be used by the stream
Explorer and also the shape of the event
data coming from the Raspberry Pi when
we look at the source that needs to be
defined we will give a nice name and
description to this source
some tags associated with this section
of the catalog we will define the
context path and then the shape of the
rest data coming from the raspberry pi
now we have the source defined we will
create an exploration will give the
exploration a meaningful name and
description we will now specify the tags
in this case customer to associate it
with this section of our catalog and
other useful tags relating to this
exploration once done we will then
select the source which is the source of
the rest messages from our raspberry pi
now we have entered a stream Explorer
expiration with irrelevant properties
and fields we'll look at a raspberry pi
that's running Oh II P oh Clemente
processing for job-embedded and here you
see the analyzing events coming from an
attached temperature sensor the rest
context is pointing to the events
associated with alerts when the Okla
main process an embedded system
identifies that the temperature has
reached out of bounds in terms of either
being too high or too low for a normal
operation of this equipment where we
have the sensor attached here you can
see now we are seeing in the stream
Explorer the events from our EP embedded
running on the Raspberry Pi indicating
that the temperature has now gone out of
bounds we can then use the stream
explorer to take these alerts process
them coming from not only this raspberry
pi or this gateway device but for many
devices and centrally analyse and
provide additional alerting and
sophisticated analysis from the streams
glorification here you can see the
graphical representation in a chart
of the streaming alert data coming from
the Raspberry Pi device
once the temperature value from the
sensor drops below 80 then the alerts
will be terminated from the okhla been
processing embedded system
now you see here that the old event post
is embedded analysis has determined from
the sensor that the temperature is now
fallen within bounds and no more alerts
will be sent to the stream Explorer
as we once again use the temperature
sensor to generate more heat above 80
degrees then once again you will see
here on the stream explore these new
alerts being generated which can be then
analyzed by the exploration for further
alerting to other systems or for
downstream operations once we are
satisfied with our exploration we can
then take an action to publish this
exploration to make it available to
other applications other explorations
that you may have within the stream
Explorer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
