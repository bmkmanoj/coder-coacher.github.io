company I would like to give a brief
introduction of my company Coco electric
was formed in 1920 else its origins were
in the same company as Tokyo Electric
TEPCO the Tokyo writing company limited
taco Electric has been impossible 82
years in cells manufacturing and
development of electric distribution
equipment for electric power industry
password I worked for over 20 years
developments automated grid control
system today I would like to introduce
to you to the st I LG Smart Grid
controller toshiba toko metering system
tpms manufactures smart metal hua TEPCO
and was forms to the southern line as a
joint venture between toco electric and
Toshiba combining the electric beta
business of both companies tems
manufactures and sells electric and gas
and scatter sensors to domestic electric
utilities other industries in Japan
whilst guru network increase Abba
software part owner in US and Japan they
have been working with us in just
intensively sis triple disaster in
northern Japan Australia Tokyo Electric
and wireless Buddha network worked
together special curry to provide
solutions to the needs of demand side
energy market we have wireless good CTO
Johnny with us today to speak fast all
our behalf about the toka solutions tiki
ms devices whilst guru software thank
you and over to you John thank you very
much before I get started how many of
you are related to the electric
utilities industry or have any directly
in the utilities or supplier to
utilities supplier to the ok yeah so um
so today first of all I really like to
thank you first of all poco electric for
this time to you know for for my
opportunity to present for them here at
javaone and I also like to thank Oracle
for this opportunity to use of Java in
embedded controllers is I think
something quite new especially when it
is used with the Java standard edition
which is actually the topic here
and we have total electric has been
pioneering the use of a java-based
controllers in Japan now the particular
technology that we're talking about is
demand side management that is quite new
in Japan it is still pretty new here in
the United States and and not so
prevalent in I think Europe correct me
if I'm wrong and the demand side
management is a very interesting subject
for utilities electric utility industry
because it requires a lot of data to be
processed data to be transported data to
be analyzed and commanding control to be
implemented so we have a partnership
going on here and that mr. Kano had
referred to and this is a three-way
partnership first and foremost is Tokyo
Electric and as mr. Kano had explained
Tokyo Electric is a direct subsidiary of
tap code which is Tokyo Electric Company
and that is the main utility that serves
about 30 million people a metropolitan
Tokyo area and has several very large
nuclear power plants now as you know
after the disaster last year there's
been a severe shortage of electric power
supply baseline power and so the in
Japan specifically the market has
actually evolved quite rapidly towards
to to alleviate the supply or the needs
of electric power not through increasing
baseline demand but by demand management
itself demand side management itself so
total electric being a electric electric
infrastructure provider has really
spearheaded a initiative to provide new
infrastructure technologies for the
demand side and this is what it's all
about now toshiba topo metering system
is also a sister company of Tokyo
Electric and they are one of the one of
few companies in Japan that actually
manufactures the smart meters themselves
now one of the key points in demand side
management is to be able to obtain
accurate data of electric usage because
when you talk about demand side
management you need to account for usage
accurately it's not sufficient to know
electric usage to let's say ten percent
accuracy no that's not that that is that
won't work because this is all basically
billable energy and so it has to be
accurate to the actual smart meter
itself and so the partnership that
exists in this particular form enables
total electric to actually obtain the
electric meter data through the meters
that are deployed in the typical area
and these meters are from toshiba toko
metering systems also toshio toko
metering systems provides commercial
industrial energy measurement equipment
which are basically
data collectors that are installed in
commercial settings like in factories
I'm from wireless networks i'm founder
wireless food network which is a small
company startup just across the bay in
the east bay and we provide java based
software that runs on on the platform
that total electric provides and we
operate both in the u.s. and Japan so I
like to first introduce the concept here
of T step which is total smart energy
open platform you hear a lot about in a
sense of very peripheral electric
service providers talking about the
smart grid and the different services
that they would like to provide but in
fact what is very unique and the
strength of Tokyo Electric is that it is
part of the electric infrastructure it
does provide all the infrastructure
within the tokyo metropolitan area and
that infrastructure spans both the
supply side all the way to demand side
and distribution there off of
electricity and it's also a unique in
the electric service provider space
because it is purely an electric service
provider infrastructure provider whereas
other companies have a much larger I
guess portfolio of services and products
toko electrics sole purpose is for
delivering energy now if you look at
this you see several components to this
total Smart Energy open platform concept
there are smart campuses which are
basically type of community smart towns
that have different commercial and
residential areas shopping centers
another more of a tightly-knit system
type of a setup for
in terms of electricity it's just a you
know big building and factories in
building smart buildings are another
different category of genre of demands
they usually have automated lighting
controls HVAC systems that are in one
system and and they are served by
devices that are called building energy
management systems which have extra loan
or bacnet systems whereas if you go to
factories you have yeah you have long
work so you have back net but you also
have other types of command control
systems in their campuses they you know
it's similar to buildings but also more
smart buildings but but it's it's more
widespread shopping centers at smart
talents they don't actually have
standards quite yet and in fact the the
control of towns and shopping centers or
more of the towns and campuses site are
not direct but they're more driven by
for example real-time pricing or some
kind of a incentive structure and
overlaid on top of this you have besides
electric pricing to affect demand side
usage you also have demand direct demand
response signaling or demand demand
response based dispatch signals that
come up from the supply side so all this
toko sees this can be provided with a
common platform a common architecture
common computing platform common
communication platform and that's the
the whole concept behind you know the
t-step what is that common platform that
can be deployed in all these different
use cases in scenarios and that's what's
the talk that talk is about so here's
just a kind of a smorgasbord of
different types of products that toko
provides and we actually have a little
bit of hardware here to show you
well first of all the meters in Japan
they look very different it actually
they look different in different regions
of the country so this is a typical
style meter Tokyo Tokyo area style meter
so you know it's digital it has modules
you can and power going in here now this
is built by T TMS tokyo tokyo toshiba
metering system it is a joint venture
between Tokyo Electric and Toshiba if
you recall toshiba actually bought land
is in gear a year ago I think and so for
toshiba Landis gear is international
market in the domestic market is T TMS
here TTM s also provides data collection
now this is an example of a data
collection unit where it's a CT you have
these devices called CT clamped current
transformers and they basically clamp
around wires and it detects the current
that's running through this is a sixth
channel current transformer detector
logging system which has like a little
SD card that can log in or with the
network it can transmit the real time
data and now now this is the main
subject of the talk today I need to
watch the time that I know what time it
is so this is called the STI Inc
standard toko intelligent network
controller this is second version of it
you see this is the first version here
okay starting the first version it is
running java this does run java SE
embedded on a linux platform it is
running an arm cortex a8 and i'll go
over the specifications later on this is
what we are talking about in terms of
the common platform so this type of
device allows real-time data to be
collected and also control to be control
signals to be issued to various other
networks or directly to devices and so
if we go back to that concept of the
t-step there are many many facilities
different kinds of use cases but a
common platform can be used to basically
serve the demand side management of all
those areas that's that's the concept in
the root end so there's a strong need to
have a very generic yet powerful
computing environment and platform to be
deployed at a low cost yet so this is
called the STI Inc sometimes we just
call it the ink it means the same thing
other products in in toco line up well
big stuff like the switches that that
basically route energy itself
transformers they also have tokoha also
has meter maintenance programs and
unique to Japan in the United States for
example when a meter is deployed well
it's deployed it doesn't get replaced
until it's broken right in Japan there
is a law that states that every ten
years The Meters need to be retrieved
for calibration and replaced and so
there's opportunity to actually renew
some of these meters every ten years so
it's a very different kind of a market
and so right now this whole change sea
of change is happening because of the
triple disaster Japan is changing its
current meters which is a smart which
are smart meters but they're mostly am i
smart me
years that have networks that are facing
outward and it's going forward towards
having a a meter that has a network
capability facing into the building
imprints for demand side management and
then my company wireless glue we we do
soft we don't do part of what we do a
little bit of hardcore but we we do
software these are two two products that
we have let me just start off with the
easier one which is the bottom one how
many of you have heard of zigbee look at
moms like me right so we've been heavily
embedded into the gb world we
interoperate with a variety of smart
meters existing in the United States and
elsewhere you know meters like I Tron
silver spring-based meters you know
Landis gear Elster whatever they'll have
zigbee chips in them anders california
alone has about 12 million zigbee base
meters already and if you've been
following the news and what the Public
Utilities Commission have been doing
basically they're going to be turning on
these zigbee meters starting this year
there's a pilot program that's running
each of the investor owned utilities
will be turning on about 5,000 of these
smart meters so if you know someone of
the utilities you should ring them up
and try to get on that program so you
can get to turn on your smart meter and
attached devices to it I've already done
I've already put my name in the list so
we provide the first thing we provide is
a in home display the home display
communicates directly with the smart
meter it provides full security 128a es
encryption through elliptical elliptical
curve cryptography digital certificates
and so we work on the firmware on that
device and it
it's a little refrigerator magnets about
this big flip it on you turn it on it
connects to your smart meter and you can
have a histogram of your energy and so
forth it reads the meter every every
minute in this case the meters have a 30
30 minute and summation functionality
now the the other product is a pure
software product this is our flagship
product it is a middleware that is a
abstraction engine for different
communication that are used in a variety
of use cases so if you recall the
picture of T step there are many
different types of facilities different
types of networks in the facilities what
you want to do is to draw in information
and provide control to all those
different kind of networks and in order
to do that well one way to do that is
you can basically make solutions based
on each of the individual networks and
protocol commands or you can make one
solution one application to handle all
networks if you had an abstraction layer
that allows you to actually send those
signals out automatically to different
protocols network so that's what that's
exactly what we do and we connect that
through web service to a cloud server
and we can receive demand response
dispatch signals with from standards
like open a dr which is open demand
response and we call that the smart edge
so let me talk a little more or a lot
more about the st ink itself the
standard toko intelligent network
controller i provide solutions for
commercial businesses it's ready to use
energy management software echo web for
built in and we'll be talking a lot more
about the echo web it's it I think it's
quite unique in the industry how this is
done and and I think we want to
highlight how you know what kind of
functionality provides and it's based on
oracle's SE embedded platform highly
expandable if clearly you can see the
different attachments here I mean it's
an industrial design and so it has
inputs outputs and it's meant to be put
into breaker boxes that type of a
setting and to connect different kinds
of sensors and different measurement
equipment on it and it and as I
mentioned in the overall t-step it
provides for support for a variety of
business models it can be used for
aggregators give you three utilities it
can be used in the context of building
energy management system anything pretty
much you can think of that you can
create a business application okay so a
little bit of specifications so it is
based on a java SE embedded some of the
input output one thing is it uses one
wire I how many of you know one wire not
much okay well it's one wire and what it
is it's it's it's one of the simplest
form of network it it can be did you
basically connect the device on it
recognize it on automatically it is a
quote-unquote plug and play in the in
the functional sense if not not in the
official term plug-and-play used by
Microsoft and stuff but it's you're just
plug in a plug it in and it recognizes
it works there variety of sensors toko
provides a variety of sensors to be
installed in the building's you know
humidity temperature whatever you can
think of there different kinds of
sensors for it all you need to do is
plug it in it's automatically recognized
once you turn it on it enumerates these
devices it figures out it lists it and
it starts to draw data out of it on
matically I has isolated digital
input/output for input for output high
speed USB land rs485 the rs-485 is used
to communicate with other supporting
devices example is this data collector
the data collector can be connected
directly as RS 45 or through ethernet
onto these things it has an operational
temperature range which is geared
towards industrial thermo industrial
commercial settings 22-22 60 degrees
Celsius that's pretty cold in pretty hot
with very high relative humidity it is
running arm cortex a8 from texas
instruments and those are the dimensions
so just a word about how the software is
arranged there is Linux it's running on
Linux in on Linux there is JVM from
Oracle and then there are various
communication drivers for remote
maintenance and these are options for
use in various business models that I
mentioned some of the business model is
for example if you take one of these you
can provide a service to a customer
we're okay here here it is you can go
install it a plug it in or you can have
a technician install it and you'd want
to actually update the software at some
point right and so one way to update the
software is you can have osgi framework
and then you have automatic deployment
or you can have other third-party remote
maintenance systems installed so this
this platform provides for canned I
guess not not the canvas can but can
isn't embedded here some some remote
deploying software deployment
capabilities in Japan Tokyo uses I I JS
system that is a is a is an internet isp
provider and they provided a commercial
service to remotely access and deploy
software
so that type of remote deployment
software ism is installed here as web
server and the application echo web for
comes installed by default as a standard
application and then there are various
sensor communication drivers so that's
the complete package it's already in
here you turn it on then the echo web
application starts to basically operate
so here's here's a little picture of how
things would normally be attached very
some very sensors electric related
sensors from meters we're usually when
you have electric meters these are a
pulse signal and it'll pick up the
pulses and measure the signal and Japan
Japanese meters have different you know
us meters of assisi 12 tables and stuff
but Japanese meters have different
different standards so this is geared
towards Japanese meters here if it's not
the Japanese meter then you with that we
provide the zigbee solution on it you
there would need to be a radio
attachment but there's a gb solution and
the jiggly solution will then allow you
to read an c 12 through the ziggy smart
energy profile so it can work both in
Japan and in the u.s. power measurement
you know like like one of those from t
TMS that can be connected to expand its
capability to do submetering so if this
is connected knee remains panel and you
can actually add more CT clamps for
submetering which sum up to what the
actual meter reads other sensors of a
low water flow temperature humidity some
other just generic analog input and
digital input/output now as I mentioned
there is the
the unique capability of this unit as a
standard features it's able to do this
plug in place so you actually plug it in
it knows it's a water sensor you plug it
in and knows it's a temperature humidity
sensor automatically configures that
information and displays it through the
echo web and the echo lab also has a
basically a restful you interface so
that you can draw that information now
too in addition to having its own user
in web-based user interface there are
high-performance mini circuit recorders
that I mentioned that's connected
directly to it you can use USB memory
other standard systems so imagine this
to be in a factory and and you have
process engineering process management
and you have energy thresholds that you
want to set along a manufacturing
process maybe it's a thermal process
maybe it's very electric you know in
intensive Lowell type of process and you
want to have alarms right so this has
threshold setting capability and also
mail servers essentially as a mail
server in it so that you will send an
email out to alert you that and you've
been over your limit or you're about to
go over your limit it also has the
automatic it has a autumn Auto
configuring let's put the auto
configuring driver that you can connect
a network alarm this little kind of
alarm thing it's it basically it's also
plug in play you know you just stick it
on and it will respond to the threshold
and it will start to actually show the
alarm so it's very very easy to use for
process oriented management too and in
fact that's what it's been designed to
do and it's being used that way a lot in
Japan file transfer is used to bring
data in and out for example that's not
the only way you can use HTTP
too and it will be reading it's time
through a network a time server so just
just a little bit background information
and why why'd you know and one of the
advantages of Java I guess is this point
here you see here that the echo web
itself started as an application in 2004
and 2006 2010 and 2012 it's gone through
several iterations all written in Java
and a lot of hi-hi used reuse of code
and so it's been a you know the first
first time it was created took a lot of
man hours to create but it's become
basically less and less and and the
marginal benefit has been increasing so
okay so the idea is that the cost of
development at first you know you kind
of plunked on the lot of money to start
the development and then 2006 well a
little bit less of money that you plunk
down but you get more marginal benefit
out of it and so it's additive the
effect as additive and and the big
benefit of it is the fact that or why we
can derive that benefit is obviously
because it's all written in Java with a
lot of reuse components and so forth and
so 2004 2006-2007 and then now 2012
version very little upfront investment
to create the 2012 version with high
return is the ID and so that that allows
both the the software side costs the
software costs were low enough so that
the total solution can basically the
price of the total solution can actually
go down and especially if you consider
the increase in processor power more
you're getting better better hardware
platform more processing power more
software capability less and less
so it's a good cycle so instead of doing
a live demo you know this is just giving
you a kind of an overview of what the
echo web for does here this is this is
the main screen of echo web for the echo
web that's that's in Japanese it says
echo on it it doesn't look like it says
aircon it but it is echoed okay it's a
logo so it doesn't have to be translated
into English so so I'm this isn't right
out the bat you turn it on it has you
know it automatically configures and
starts up it detects whatever is plugged
into it and then figures out all these
sensors that are available on the system
on and there are values thresholds that
are set to it and it will start to
basically you know data log all this
information and it will be storing
creating files updating the file with
timely data and then produce also a
summary report so that's all can in this
basically java based software running on
this seizure and this is an example of
multiple types of sensors that have been
actually connected to it so this is one
one group of sensors that's another
group of sensors there's an overlay of
how what percentage of the threshold it
has reached with the bars here is you
see that on the values field there's a
number and then there's some color to it
and the color kind of goes off it's a
bar graph essentially and it shows you
how much of this threshold or how close
to the threshold it is on this side you
have the menu of various settings and
data access to you can help
so this is demand monitoring obviously
this unit is geared towards demand side
management and so the whole idea is to
provide that data visualization is one
of the most effective tools the demand
side management allows the energy
managers to basically see exactly what's
going on and enable control now one of
the key features of this version of the
echo web and the st inc 2 is that it's
it's better in real time it has better
software capabilities so now it can
carry a lot of more powerful software on
top and allow for control so this graph
right now just shows you visualization
not control but by setting threshold it
can actually initiate control some of
the interesting things it can do is you
see these bars here that is you don't
set just one clicker you can have
time-dependent thresholds so that's why
you see these step functions so you can
set different different threshold levels
it's keeping track of how far it's
getting to that threshold you know this
line here and whether it's in or out of
the predicted amount baseline amount and
it'll then if it hits that amount or if
it goes over it then it's configured to
basically send alerts through it's a
simple mail transfer protocol and so
I'll send out a meal to you if you if
you so configure it or because it has a
rest interface it can cause other things
to happen including direct control
during load control for example
this is just another way 11 other way to
display the information yeah it's your
typical bar graph with the different
portions representing the bar graph so
so it kind of gives you some high
capable high user interface
visualization capability for reporting
and all this data is provided for
retrieval and through HTTP and ftp so
this is another screen that's provided
again which is setting of threshold
levels now you'll notice like in the
middle well just just this part there's
a contract so most of the electric gum
contracts have demand contracts so
you're not supposed to go over a certain
amount of demand the reason for that is
that the actual power line that's
actually connected to your factory or
whatever it has a capacity you don't
want to go over to capacity because
things will start to burn or melt or
right and and also having demand
contract implies that the there's a
planning supply side planning going on
in the utility side and you better not
go over that planned amount because
that's what the utilities have this you
know have planned in their purchasing of
energy all right so there's a contract
level and bit you don't you never want
to go over your contract mobile and so
you have level levels in which you want
to actually initiate action and so
you're able to create either a flat
action or you can have like basically
time to action and a time segmented
action and so the first level maybe
notification the third level I mean
second level maybe an alarm for example
okay and and then you'll see here an
alarm lamp setting if you remember
there's that alarm light those are a
network alarm it has an IP address to it
and so when alarm gets hit
basically it will send a signal and it
will cause the the little roll rotary
light to go on and and and you'll notice
their level one and level two so you can
have different colors actually turn on
so these are all plug-and-play so very
very easy to use you can turn alarms off
report right you can also specify record
of the biggest demand through this
drop-down me now this is a different
kind of a configuration setting sensor
setting recall that you know I talked
about a plug-in plate so these are
different one wire sensors each one wire
sensor has unique ID you can just you
can basically plug it in selected
assigned a value of its a new one oh and
and give it give it its characteristic
so that when you actually do replug it
in it'll recognize it automatically
assign a unique ID to it and then it can
start pulling data out some and then you
can group different sensors into one
profile group so you can you can select
to show sensor a screen where it only
picks out certain amount certain number
of sensors and those sensors can be
referring to a group that is for one
floor or one section one manufacturing
process so it's a it's a nice feature to
have here so the benefits of why why was
then why why use Java I guess especially
with the more powerful processors
improved platforms they have pretty very
good performance table operations now as
previously mentioned there's very high
percentage of reuse of software assets
so that as if you have incremental
development every from a big
organization standpoint when you don't
do a crap scrap and build in these
things basically you can have a
development team that
can continue to incrementally increase
the value of your assets as an
organization and with very very little
continuing up development fee so
therefore you have also faster
time-to-market because you can build on
top of what you've already built and of
course because it is Java there is a
very rich development eco eco system so
that developers also can build more
sophisticated applications in very short
time so now let me describe the the next
devote next step for the next evolution
this this I'd like to just kind of point
out this is the one perhaps i would say
maybe the first example of this app this
platform being used as a base on which
to build new application with
applications and so now we I kind of
shift to what I actually do with our
development team locally here and so
what we provide is that we build on top
of that that Java platform embedded
platform to provide a energy management
and control system and so this is kind
of overview of it where we provide
software on this on prime premise
gateway that retrieves real-time
information and also provides control
and then forwards that information to a
cloud platform to actually then allow
you to do remote data viewing and
control also and also to serve as an
interface to other cloud-based
applications and aggregation of these
units so if you apply to a commercial
management company you know the some of
the key systems and turnkey solutions
you can build is that you can have a
aggregation of building energy usage and
energy usage and
easy to expand off right you can provide
over-the-air upgrades so forth through
you know this isn't a case it's for
example we have zigbee expansion we can
actually update firmware through zigbee
or we can actually update through
through the Wi-Fi whatever building
owners if you actually apply this
solution avoid penalties thats related
to energy consumption and so forth and
so on and tenants this is this is
basically a tenant based building
provides compliance with government
mandates on reduction in energy reduce
energy overall costs and so forth this
this particular solution this form of
solution is a being planned and applied
in Japan because of the the big energy
problem there and that's the action
that's a main partnership that wireless
grew in Tokyo has so let's look a little
more about a up-and-coming use of this
type of a platform why we call it a
smart grid controller so you can imagine
having this type of a gateway in various
different buildings I think one of the
patterns that have evolved up to
recently is to have a very simple
gateway at each of the locations because
well it's simple because it was low cost
but simple because you couldn't have a
non simple solution now that's it's a
weird way to say it but the cost of for
example Java sc-based platform would
have been too high to install in every
location and still be profitable it
would have meant like you wanted to put
a PC in every location but now you don't
actually have to put a PC to have java
SE you can just basically put these arm
cortex based units and in that low cost
unit we're talking hundreds of dollars
not thousands of dollars anymore and you
can have the same level of functionality
and you can have the same level of
sophisticated application deployed at
each of the location that the level of
sophistication meaning that you have
multi-protocol interoperability across
different networks so that if a dispatch
signal from demand response system comes
in in this case we're talking about open
a dr through a cloud service well all
the data all the dispatch signal control
can then be distributed to each of the
individual units each of the individual
unit would actually have very different
kind of networks involved some of them
may be zigbee base some of them may be
back net based one word or even one
location may have a whole mixture of
those things and so when a dr signal
comes in if sophisticated gateway can
basically process that signal and then
essentially through a abstraction layer
send out the appropriate signal out to
the native protocol that's existing in
that building that can be done because
you can actually install a sophisticated
software you can do that because the
cost of software on development and the
cost of platform has been driven down
and you can run like an SC platform in
these gateway devices so that's what we
provide so solution benefit it's good
for this is very effective for
commercial property management companies
building owners tenants but even energy
aggregators one of the biggest biggest
roadblocks to demand side management has
been that you can do demand side
management of very large facilities and
you can but but it's very difficult to
do demand side management of the biggest
population of energy users which are
mid-sized companies because they have on
Palmer Smosh of devices it's not
standardized it's everywhere has to be
low cost but finally you can address
that basically a sweet spot of the
market with a low-cost system that can
do more
the protocol and and it's probably the
first time there's a convergence of of
technology that allows you to address
that particular market space and that is
the space that has to be addressed in
order to have effective demand side
management and so benefit is that you
can have one platform with very flexible
technologically flexible platform to
apply to all different kinds of
situations and we're looking at Toco
Toco has like for example two thousand
plus customers which have inks that we
can now replace with new platforms and
then provide effective demand side
management in dr there so that is
wireless glue and i want to take a
little bit of time now to explain this
type of a device which is from tokyo
cocoa toshiba metering systems just
recall that it comes in a combination so
you'd have a smart meter which is
connected with the SDN connects to and
now you want a sub meter so this this
smart meter only gives you one value
right for the entire circuit that you're
connected to or circuits that you're
connected to but in fact for effective
energy management you want to actually
granule eyes that I'm i don't know if
that's a word but you can make you can
get more you want to get more granular
to look at individual circuits and
collect that information so this is this
is the type of device that allows you to
do that ok this way because you can
connect different types of CT CT meters
on it and it's very accurate too so the
idea is that well ok you want to do
energy management and you want to plan
the improvement you know you create a
plan and then you apply it
and the plan you check it and you act on
it so this device allows you to when
you're in the cycle of energy management
of PDCA cycle to actually apply this
type of a device to actually check on
your energy management plants in
different kinds of ways to look at it
you can look at one single item over or
span of time or you can look at many
items over the same over a single day so
just to give you a little kind of
explanation of what what this device
does is that as I said it'll connect up
to different circuits with a CD clamp
and then to collect all the data it can
store it or it can actually forward it
with a connection of rs-485 connected to
serial connection to the SD and the STI
Inc can then forward that information
log it or you can add different
applications on top of it and then you
can do more analysis on it so various
different ways you know you don't salt
it can store that information and SD
card in the CSB they can put that
information out even over land it will
keep hundred seventy five days worth of
measurement at 30-minute intervals and
as I said six circuits it is the maximum
that it'll it'll handle so so that
that's that's a you know used in
combination there other skate at the
type devices that TT ms provides just to
go and find finalized on this discussion
here want to give a little bit of the
plan roadmap for the STI Inc 2012 right
now this common platform 600 megahertz
cortex a8 is he embedded to be used in
building automate a building energy
management factory energy management and
in automated meter reading and user it
provides various support for
sensors next year and going forward
development plans are to miniature make
it smaller right so you notice that it's
the same processing power but but it'll
shrink inside additional security
through java card like sim card type
concept and additional capability with
automated demand control demand response
so dispatch signals like open ATR it can
be you know it'll start to handle open
ADR and with the appropriate software
it'll determine based on the current
price time of use or real-time pricing
what to do in terms of control or the dr
may actually prescribe a load amount to
back off then it will send a direct load
control signal it will include for
example in japan the standard has become
Econet econet nanako web Econet econet
is a standardized object model in japan
for various load devices and those would
then be included into this platform so
that it can actually be compatible with
all the different kinds of automated
device smart devices let's put that way
smart devices that will exist in the
japanese building environment so what I
think you know one of the takeaways that
you should have is that smart objects in
Japan will use a smart object model
which is equal net and there will be a
variety of physical layers and networks
to which to communicate with that smart
object but the object model itself is
unified and so a demand response will
act on those object models to actually
control them that's that's the whole
kind of paradigm that Japan has adopted
starting next year
SCP 2 point 0 can be a smart energy
profile 2 point 0 which is an American
Standard is being looked at in Japan so
toca would be adopting SCP 210 for
American market but in Japan market or
follow Japan Japan market it requires
econet but the physical layer and the
network model is not actually set for
aqua net and therefore sep two point O
is also one candidate to be used for
transmission of the data grams to the
objects and additionally their
collaboration with cloud services demand
response signals are essentially cloud
services already and so while these
devices are sort of atomic in the sense
that it's there it's hard it exists in
the premise that information that
control will actually then be pushed up
into a thin cloud layer and then a
connection enabled to cloud services to
actually send signals to it we have some
prototype pilots I'm going on right now
with American demand response dispatch
cloud services that we can basically use
open and you are to send a telemetry
data receive open a dr signals and then
affect you directly load control
equipment through the SD so we already
have that setup 2014 yet smaller device
yet cheaper device you have more
powerful where one gigahertz processor
speed SE embedded and high security with
java card pretty much you know
application and use cases is building
energy management factory energy
management home energy management
automated meter reading demand response
and more features is the plan so in to
wrap up toko would just like to convey
that the bunch of there may be four
different patterns that
toko likes to engage with other
companies you know off first is offer
existing turkey application solutions to
them or together build cloud services
and developed specialized energy
management or combined with third-party
software and services or just simply
partner based on them for sales of
sensors those other solutions so they're
always looking for distributors and
that's at any questions okay it's 256
megabytes on it and the the flat fee and
and the everything on it only consumes
about women think is our application
consumes about 10 10 mix and so you
actually have ample room to operate
sorry 512 flash 256 make like Ram I like
yeah um yes that's part of the let me
just explain to him first uh no uh
tonight giggles I'm tour in tow vehicles
to do and ever so the way our outside
divine even in some South Korea no
interface all kinda step in and and yes
we do that and in fact we already have a
model that's in play right now to do
that with a demand response aggregate
demand response provider when we talk
about demand response there are two
types of providers one well there are
several types of providers not not just
to write but an example is an aggregator
and they have channel to the customers
customer channels they aggregate the
customers and that they have their own
in technology or you have demand
response platform providers who are
basically the server side so companies
that provide just the dr signals and
that would be like a third party cloud
application we call them smart grid
application providers and we actually
have a partnership going right now where
one way is a common interface if you
look at open a dr there's open a dr one
point i don't know who's heard of open a
dr just just a few so i'll just explain
a little bit open a dr is is a short for
open automated demand response it used
to be called auto dr it started in
california Lawrence Berkeley Lab under
Department of Energy after the energy
crisis and it evolved after the all
smart grid initiative it evolved into a
national standard called open a dr the
national standard i mean by national
institute of standards technology nist
as specified a technology milestone for
interoperability for the smart grid and
it is one of the key official standard
technologies to be used in the smart
grid so that one technology one type of
dwell defined object model and interface
is provided for the entire smart grid so
everyone all the utilities use the same
thing open ADR is one such standard it
is the specific standard called out by
the united states to implement demand
response systems it is implementing a
common information model based on nice
OTC got 57 and already used its the
common information model already used in
the utility space and open a dr defines
how a utility or an aggregator energy
aggregator sends signals out to the load
consumption point to affect load control
or basically demand management right so
one of these cloud service providers is
a dr signal technology provider they
would actually sell their software to or
its software as a service to a
aggregator who has the channel to market
and they would then you know it could be
a utility utility would buy that service
and then monthly they would pay for it
or / / signal they would pay for it and
they would send a dr signal out to their
customer base but the signal has to
actually be received somewhere right and
and these are type of devices that you
would receive and then through these
devices an actual physical demand
management happens so we actually have
that open a dr provides for a
standardized interface for that signal
it could it has created a data model to
allow for that but it's not everything
it doesn't do everything so we do we
work with our partners discuss the API
and then basically send
spit special telemetry up so that they
can do their load curve prediction so
forth and so we do that actively yes I
think we're up times up any other
questions so if not um I think you can
just give us your cards and stuff and
carry on the conversation thank you very
