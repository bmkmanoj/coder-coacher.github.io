you AVM Diagnostics the service provide
an easy way to enable jvm Dion JVMs that
are not already managed by e/m it can be
used by developers QA tester or the
production support team to get a JVM DEA
agent and access the JVM DUI without the
help of an e/m administrator first I
will show how to create the required en
role and how to assign to it
a JVM quota once this is done I will log
in as a user and show how to download
the agent install it and gain access to
the JVM DUI I'm logged into a game as a
super admin I will now create a new role
that allow access to the self-service
portal from the setup menu I'm going to
security roles create and will provide
in your name let's say they've Group one
we'll skip the description no need for
other roles no need for target
privileges I do need to select the
resource privilege and the research that
I care about is cloud self-service
portal for JVM D for JVM Diagnostics
selecting this option and I'm done with
the role now I will assign a JVM quota
to the role this will be the maximum
number of concurrent JVMs a user can
diagnose from the enterprise menu I'm
going to cloud in JVM Diagnostics home
and from the quota tab and create a new
quarter selecting a role and this will
be the role that I just created
um dev Group one select
and let's say that I'm allowing to each
user of this role to have no more than
two concurrent JVMs you could have
select the JVM D engine here in this
case I have only one but if I want to
have its developer user using one JVM D
manager while the production environment
is another one I would be controlling it
from here okay and I'm done I'm going to
log in now is the dev group one user I
created a role offline that can be done
through the identity management or
whatever other system eeehm is
configured to use let me login now since
this user is only one privilege to see
this cloud self-service portal this is
the only page that comes up
automatically
I will now download the agent I click on
this button and save it to my desktop
totally there but I'll take a new one
the agent is the war file that I can
deploy under the application that I want
to diagnose the application can be any
java i just stand-alone JVM in this case
I will use I will put the war file on
the class path and restart application
or it can be an app server in this case
in that case I can use deployments I
will deploy it on the WebLogic server or
servers and now we'll use Ujima dual
control for this so this is Fusion
Middleware control let me login
and you can see that I have several
servers on this in this domain and go to
deployments select deploy we will use
the local file the type the file that I
just saved here's g vm j damaging dot
warn that was the default name of the
file and the next step i will select the
servers that i want to install it on
let's see these three and deployed and
the deployment takes short time let's
see if it's done completed go back to my
portal page i'll refresh the page and i
see that i have the three agent deploys
deployed now interesting that i can see
two of them are working now and one is
not and the reason is that i was
allocated only two JVMs so although i
deployed three DBMS and all three are
connected one of them is not really
sending data over to 2 m and i won't be
able to see the data
the diagnostic data i can easily switch
over and say i don't want to use this
JVM so I'll deactivate it and instead I
will activate it the one that they do
want to use
I'm on done with the diploma now and I
can start using the product for example
if I want to go into this JVM and see
the deployment the JVM Diagnostics
information you can see that this is
last only four hours view so just
starting but I can already see what our
thread on what like my application is
doing right now since there's no load
yet running on this application there's
very little happening here but the
entire or actually most of the
functionality of the product is already
available for me right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
