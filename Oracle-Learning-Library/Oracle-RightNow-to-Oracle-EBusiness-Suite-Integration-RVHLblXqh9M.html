has decided to modernize their customer
experience ecosystem they'll do this by
subscribing to Oracle Service Cloud also
known as right now cloud service which
will help them increase sales build
trust and strengthen relationships now
they need to integrate this data with
their on-premise Oracle e-business suite
they've chosen Oracle integration cloud
service or ICS as their strategic
platform for this integration this demo
illustrates how you can realize a
critical customer experience use case
field service integration in just a few
clicks
Joe is experiencing issues with his
internet service he logs into the
customer support portal powered by right
now to file an incident on the cable
modem issue after submitting the issue
he gets an incident number for his
reference Sharon a customer service
representative at Vision incorporated
logs into right now agent desktop and
reviews incidents for today she notices
the cable modem issue filed by Joe
Sharon reviews and cross checks the
right now knowledgebase but she can't
find a solution that can be delivered
over the phone she replies to Joe that
vision Incorporated will dispatch a
technician to fix the cable modem within
2 hours
Sharon updates and saves the incident a
new e-business suite service request is
created immediately via the integration
between EBS and right now Tom the field
service supervisor receives the
notification that a new service request
has been generated he reviews the
request and dispatches a field service
technician to the customer's premises
the field service technician resolves
the cable modem issue and updates the
service request via his tablet this
kicks off a real-time update of the
incident in the right now web portal and
right now agent desktop Sharon notices
that the incident Joe reported is
resolved now let's take a look at how
you can build this integration using ICS
quickly and without any coding Bob an
integration designer at vision
incorporated logs into the ICS web
console this console provides a one-stop
shop for designing monitoring and
managing all your integrations from the
landing page Bob can create connections
to various
SAS and on-premise applications build
integrations between connections or
monitor transactions through the
dashboard Bob starts with the
connections Oracle integration cloud
service provides a number of pre-built
connections
these include connections to SAS
on-premise social applications and more
you can also review all existing
connections to various applications as
you can see the configuration is simple
specify the URL to access and the
account credentials this configuration
is consistent across all other
connections connections for e-business
suite and Service Cloud have been
configured Bob moves on to the
integration the landing page shows all
the integrations that Bob and his team
have created Oracle integration cloud
service provides pre-built connections
to integrate between various SAS and
on-premise applications Bob uses a
pre-built integration provided by Oracle
to create a service request an
e-business suite when an incident is
created and right now cloud
bob creates a new integration from
scratch to update the incident and right
now cloud service when the corresponding
service request is updated in e-business
suite on the right is a list of SAS and
on-premise connections he's created
previously since the service request
information is sent from e-business
suite to right now cloud service bob
drags and drops the EBS connection to
the source section Bob is securely
connecting to metadata from the
e-business suite instance in the data
center ICS enables you to do this
without punching a hole in your firewall
next Bob configures the target of the
integration right now cloud service
enters basic information like name and
service definition and he specifies
service details the next step is to
create the data mappings between these
two endpoints typically this is the most
complex and time-consuming part of
delivering the integration however with
the simple data mapper and ICS Bob can
easily drag and drop to create the
mapping ICS also has a mapping
recommendation system that can create
the mapping automatically the time and
cost required to build and deliver
mappings are significantly reduced Bob
completes building the integration
and he hasn't written a line of code
worked on an XML schema XSLT or any
other artifacts he activates the flow in
one click messages can now seamlessly
flow between ebusiness suite and right
now cloud service bob can monitor the
transactions in real time by clicking on
the monitor section it provides
dashboards for all key performance
metrics of the transactions you can also
perform error management and
troubleshoot failed transactions in one
place for more information check out the
