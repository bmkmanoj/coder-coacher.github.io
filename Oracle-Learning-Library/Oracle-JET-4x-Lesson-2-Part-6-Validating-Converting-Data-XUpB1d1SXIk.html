second of the three weekly lessons about
Oracle jet in this part you will explore
the Oracle jet components and techniques
relating to validation and error
handling jet includes validators and
converters on editable components
editable components include a jet check
box set o jcombobox
inputs a J radio set RJ select and og
text area these can be used as is or you
can customize them to include features
for validating and converting data input
when you are dealing with dates numbers
currencies and percentages in your jet
applications be aware that there may be
utilities available in jets to help you
let's start by comparing the standard
html5 date picker with the date picker
that Oracle jet provides in the browser
in our application we see the standard
HTML 5 date picker and we also see the
Oroku jet date picker which uses the LT
UI design system by default and
therefore blends in very well with an
Oracle jet application the amount of
work needed to set up a date picker and
Oracle jack is about the same as the
standard HTML 5 component however the
date picker in Oracle jet also includes
a set of options for example you can
display the number of the week and there
are a range of other settings you can
provide in addition there are converters
to convert the value to the display that
you prefer you can see here that the
month is set to long meaning that you
will get as you can see here December
instead of the number 12 or November
instead of the number 11 in the value
displayed within the result of the date
picker the converts as you've seen so
far can be extended with valid data
attributes the validation attributes
easily let you add error handling
features to the conversion components to
which you have already been introduced
when you need era badges for any
editable components in your jet
applications look no further than jets
validation attributes jet editable
components
can be supplemented with built-in
validators as well as with custom
validators that you can curate and
develop further yourself application
level of validation combines the
techniques you have learnt about in
disparate more complex scenarios are
shown in the jet cookbook such as cross
field
business validation between multiple
fields together was a very common
requirement to track which fields in a
form are valid and which are not when
you submit the form in this part you
have been introduced to attributes that
you can use to set conversion and
validation features on the components in
your jet applications for your homework
for this part try adding some basic
input components of various types to
your jet applications using examples
from the cookbook enable some of the
built-in validators and convergence and
as a bonus you can try creating your own
custom validators or converters and
attach them to one of your input
components with that we've completed
part 6 of the second week and we'll see
you again in part 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
