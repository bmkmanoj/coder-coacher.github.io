documentation video series on the
advanced science engine in this session
I'll be showing you how to create an
optimization run of an existing
planogram after logging in I'll select
the ASO overview tab the ASO cloud
services used optimize a category
managers assortment plan by creating
optimal planograms the category manager
creates a preliminary assortment and
wants to determine how well that list of
products can fit in stores given the
available space product sizes
merchandising goals constraints and
rules the application creates virtual
planogram should organize products onto
fixtures in a way that best achieves the
optimization objectives once the manager
finalizes the optimization results the
product level data can be exported for
use in planning applications to run the
optimization I'll click the dropdown
next to action
and click create run
ASO supports fixture type such as
shelves pegboards
freezer chests and shelf pegboard
combinations on the setup screen I'll
assign a name and description to the
optimization run
you
an optimization can be carried out at
one of two location levels store or
space cluster in a store level
optimization each store is optimized
separately based on the stores
individual data one planogram is
produced for each store and store
specific results are produced
a space cluster is an ad-hoc group of
stores used for optimization each base
cluster includes stores that are in the
same assortment have the same product
list and have the same current planogram
length spaced clusters are typically a
level between assortment cluster and
store the planogram set is an ASO
concept that refers to a planogram node
which is the subcategory name and
concatenate it with the planogram season
with a hyphen between
choose the stores
all stores and then select the all
locations checkbox
and the available stores are displayed
and all locations have been added
the location tree displays the node name
in the optimization location hierarchy
tree the lowest level is either spaced
cluster or store
the location description is a brief
description of the optimization location
hierarchy node the optimization location
field is the number of optimization
locations under the optimization
location hierarchy node the lowest level
is always a value of 1 the store count
is the number of stores in the
optimization location hierarchy node if
the location level is store then it will
be a value of 1 for the lowest level the
product count is the number of products
for the optimization location based on
the Associated assortment the assortment
time frame is the start date and end
date for which the optimization
locations associated assortment is valid
across products the planogram fixture
type is a comma-separated list of unique
plant aground fixture types that exist
for the optimization location hierarchy
node and the planogram length is a comma
separated list of unique planogram links
that exist for the optimization location
hierarchy node and then I'll click Next
the fixture and product datastage is
divided into a summary section a
planogram fixtures tab and a product
merchandising data tab the planogram
fixtures tab contains two sections the
locations and planogram links table
and the available configurations table
this table displays the runs
optimization location and provides
metrics about the available planogram
configurations for each run you can
create new lengths which can be either
shorter or longer than the current links
select planogram setup to access the
planogram setup dialog box this button
is enabled
after you select at least one
optimization location row from the table
the planogram setup dialog box contains
the parameters used during the smart
setup process to generate the partial
shell fixture Plan ground you can edit
these parameters and rerun this process
using this dialog box the shelfs
placement using drop-down menu has two
options height percentile and absolute
height the choice you make between these
two options determines the types of
values percentage or numeric use by some
of the parameters and which parameters
are displayed
the product merchandising tab is used to
assign merchandising options to products
these assignments can vary by product or
optimization location this tab can only
be edited by a user who created the run
and only before the Run has a status of
running approved or finalized the demand
and replenishment data tab lets you
refresh the demand and replenishment
parameters it makes overrides to
selective parameters and understands the
relationship settings and there are
effects on results now I'll click Next
and move to the objective and
constraints stage
the objective and constraint stage is
used to modify or set the constraints
for an optimization run and to display
the settings associated with the run you
can specify three types of optimization
constraints product constraints product
group constraints and planogram
constraints even though all constraints
are ultimately applied at the
optimization location level you
generally set or review the data at
higher location levels in addition you
also pick an objective for the
optimization the objective defines what
metric is used as the goal of the
optimization in order to view data in
those tabs I'll need to select a
location in the table on the left and
then select a product in the table on
the right
you
we'll start out with optimization
objectives the optimization objectives
table lists the objective functions that
are being used along with the number and
percentage of optimization locations
that use each objective function the
planogram constraints table shows each
planogram constraint along with values
for the most common value and the
percentage of optimization locations
that have the most common value
the planogram constraints include use
visual guidelines use product spacing
merge adjacent bays and set up usable
space
moving on to digital guidelines visual
guidelines are used to provide attribute
based vertical and horizontal blocking
for placing products on a shelf fixture
planogram you are allowed up to four
levels for the blocking criteria
the visual guidelines are created at the
optimization location level each
optimization can have only one visual
guideline the sorting attributes are
defined at the top level and are applied
across all the levels below the top
level you can add delete and edit the
visual guidelines the product groups tab
is used to define parent groups which
when defined at a location node above
the optimization location can be
inherited by the optimization locations
that are children of the parent location
node the product constraints tab
includes custom attributes which allow
the user to select up to three
attributes associated with a selected
category of products select the
attributes from the drop down menu and
click its show attributes to add the
attributes to the product constraints
table when it finished also like
validate
this provides you with feedback
concerning the settings you have
configured validation can identify
conflicts between settings you see
details in the validation report that
can help you resolve any issues the
validation is the same regardless of
which stage you invoke it from the
conflicts identified by validation
include warnings and errors warnings
occur when constraints can impact or
limit the optimisation process errors
will prevent the optimisation process
from producing a solution
and then I'll click Submit under the
Action menu
and you can see here that the run status
says running
the status is complete we can go back in
to the run and take a look at the
results an analysis stage from the
results an analysis stage you can
revisit earlier stages in order to make
changes to various settings and then
resubmit the optimization
you can highlight the run and take a
look at the virtual planet Graham when
you right-click a facing to select it
you have access to the following actions
editing facings add delete move Save
Changes cancel changes and undo all
changes you can also hover your mouse
over product and see all the details
related to that product the included
products table lists metrics at various
levels of aggregation you can select
specific products from the table and
click the delete button in order to
remove them from the results you will
see a list of products you want to
delete and are prompted to confirm the
action the dropped products table lists
all the products that have been dropped
for optimisation process rules including
but not limited to user override action
or if the inclusion product constraint
is set to do not include
you can also toggle between a tree view
and a table view to examine the results
