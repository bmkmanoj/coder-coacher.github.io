you to deploy Oracle databases in the
cloud you have full access to the
features and operations available with
Oracle database with Oracle providing
the computing power physical storage and
tooling to simplify routine database
maintenance and management operations
after logging into your Oracle cloud
account go to the Oracle database cloud
service page and open the service
console then launch the easy to use
wizard to create a database deployment
on the service page enter a name for the
service also known as the database
deployment select the service level of
Oracle database cloud service which
includes Oracle database and supporting
software and then the release of Oracle
database choose a software addition each
includes a set of predefined Oracle
database features options and packs you
can also select the database type
including a data guard configuration and
a real application clusters database on
the details page enter the database name
also known as the system identifier or
SID and provide the password that will
be used for administrative users such as
the system system database users enter
the amount of usable data storage for
the database in gigabyte increments up
to a maximum of two terabytes you can
add more data storage later as you need
it
select the computing power for the
associated compute node from a list of
supported Oracle CPU and processor RAM
combinations to use database cloud
service you need a secure shell or SSH
public and private key pair you can
easily create a key pair through the
wizard
wizard creates the key pair
download the zip file to your computer
to take advantage of autumn
check backups and store them locally and
on an Oracle storage cloud service
select both cloud storage and local
storage provide the name of an existing
Oracle storage cloud service instance
and identity domain the wizard will
create the storage container using this
name
the cloud storage container has been
created for the backups after reviewing
all of the configuration choices you're
ready to create the database deployment
after the database deployment is created
you can view more information about the
database deployment on the overview page
including the public IP address of the
computer you will need this IP address
to access the compute node through
certain tools such as putty
now you open ports to enable secure
network access to the database
deployment by enabling predefined access
rules you want to enable the access rule
for the Oracle net listener on port 1521
so expand the menu for the Ora p2 DB
listener rule
confirm that you want to enable the rule
the rule is now enabled you can go
through the same steps to open the ports
for tools you want to use such as Oracle
Enterprise Manager database Express and
sequel developer and now you're ready to
begin working with your new database in
the cloud</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
