curriculum developer and server
technologies in this demonstration I
will show you how to create and use a
manually created soap web service
reference in your application in this
example you will create a web service
reference that will display country
information such as capital city phone
code and flag based on a country code
the application has already been created
you're going to go in and select shared
components and then web service
references in here you'd want to click
on the create and then you want to
create a manual one so select that
option and click Next
here's where you're going to put in a
name country info and then put in the
URL where that web service is located
with a proxy and then if you scroll down
this is where you're going to put in
insert the soap envelope and enter in a
response for the collection and then
click on create you can test the web
service by clicking on the link for test
and then changing the country ISO code
to something that's valid in this case
USA and click test if you scroll down
you'll see the result in the response
field and you see that it was run
successfully so now we can add it to our
application you want to click on the
application breadcrumb and create a new
page you want to select form and then
form and report on a web service here's
where you select the web service
reference country info and then click
Next you want to accept the defaults for
the page and region attributes and then
click Next and put in a valid label or a
more meaningful label and click Next
this is where you're going to put in the
result node path in this case full
country info result and specify the
message namespace which is part of the
definition of the web service and click
Next here's where you can put in some
parameter names that will dis
bleh in your report when you run it so
you notice that the just the parameter
names are displayed here and then click
Next you don't want to include tabs so
you click Next and then create form and
report now you're ready to run it and
log in with your login information and
click login and then you can put in a
country code we'll put in USA and click
Submit
notice the parameters are now listed in
the report you can change the country
code to something else in this case GB
for Great Britain and select submit and
you'll notice that the values change you
have just seen how to create and use a
manual soap web service reference in
your application thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
