solutions architecture at Oracle cloud
today we're going to review the key
concepts and terminology customers
should understand for using the Oracle
bare-metal cloud for the first time
a tenancy is an account on the oracle
bare-metal cloud the bare-metal cloud is
deployed in two regions and availability
domains a region is three or more
availability domains each availability
domain is physically separated from
every other availability domain by some
number of miles
this creates independent fault domains
this means that what happens in one
availability domain can't impact your
operations in another availability
domain this makes it easy for customers
to deploy highly available redundant
infrastructure compartments are a
collection of related cloud resources a
new tenancy comes with a single root
compartment customers should create
additional compartments to isolate
different workloads for example a
compartment for a QA for development for
production virtual cloud networks are
virtual versions of a traditional
on-premises network
they include subnets route tables
gateways firewalls VPN devices all of
the things you would expect in a
traditional network a compartment can
have multiple virtual cloud networks
virtual cloud networks have subnets a
subnet is a division at a virtual cloud
networks IP range there could be any
number of subnets per virtual cloud
network security lists are stateful
firewall rules attached to a subnet adrd
or dynamic routing gateway is a virtual
router that acts as a VPN headend
customers can use the drg to attach
their on-premises data center to their
virtual cloud network a user is an
individual or process that manages
Oracle bare-metal cloud resources
groups are collections of users that
need the same type and level of access
to the same resources a user can be in
multiple groups Identity and Access
Management policies are comprised of one
or more statements which specify which
groups can access what resources and
what level of access users in that group
have policies are written in an easy to
understand easy to audit sequel like
language
an instance is a computer host running
in the cloud instances are defined by
their shape the Oracle cloud offers
bare-metal and virtual machine shapes a
shape describes the amount of CPU the
amount of memory and local storage on
the instance a bare-metal instance is an
entire server vended to a customer with
no virtualization involved bare-metal
instances are still provisioned in
minutes and billed by the hour block
volumes are remote I scuzzy attached
Lunz block volumes are protected against
hardware failure and can easily be
backed up with an API call or via the
web console the object store is exposed
via simple restful api interface it can
optionally expose a swift interface
that's traditionally used for oracle or
man backups the oracle cloud provides
our man and hadoop connectors as well as
a CLI to the object store service limits
our default limits on resources that can
be created in a tenancy all the service
limits are listed in the documentation
and most limits can be easily raised by
contacting support
