databases the brand new addition to help
you achieve your consolidation goals
pluggable databases enable a high order
of consolidation without requiring any
change to the applications it provides
you with the desired application
isolation and security while lowering
your total cost of ownership Enterprise
Manager 12c provides comprehensive
management capabilities and adds unique
value enabling you to consolidate
migrate and manage database 12s
pluggable databases this video showcases
enterprise managers automation features
needed to achieve your consolidation
goals and support the total lifecycle
management for pluggable databases if
you have already deployed a few
instances of pluggable databases you can
directly discover them and start
managing the databases seamlessly with
the rest of your Enterprise Manager
environment use the deployment
procedures to deploy one or more
pluggable databases with a container
database or directly into an existing
one the databases can also be deployed
as rack architecture on clusters for
scaling out and fault isolation to
ensure consistent and standard
deployments you can use Enterprise
Managers provisioning profiles and
configuration lock downs for example as
a lead or a designer you can define
standards by choosing a gold image and
locking the configuration parameters
required for the deployments share those
with other administrators who can then
perform the operation with very minimal
inputs and zero errors use Enterprise
Manager to upgrade older database
versions directly to database 12 the
automation enables you to scale and do
upgrades in Mass you can quickly
operationalize by migrating
11200 three databases into a pluggable
database using Enterprise Manager you
can also migrate existing non container
12c databases into a pluggable database
rapidly create clones of pluggable
databases within the container databases
you can clone a PDV and store it in the
software library add annotations like
version maturity and then share the
software library component with other
Enterprise Manager administrators they
can then create copies of new PDP's out
of it you can perform configuration
comparisons across pluggable databases
within AC DB or compare them across
other container databases schedule these
comparisons to avoid configuration drift
as you go through the lifecycle during
maintenance our on-demand you could
easily move the pluggable databases by
unplugging from one container and
plugging it across into another
container database you can also retire
the pdb by unplugging and storing it in
the software library repurpose it by
plugging it back when there is a need
all of these key features of Enterprise
Manager allow you to consolidate and
administer multiple pdbs from a single
console Enterprise Manager automates
ongoing maintenance of pluggable
databases you can patch the databases
both in in-place and out of place mode
this support is available for pluggable
databases in single instance and rack
configurations as you select the
database for maintenance Enterprise
Manager does the impact analysis and
selects all other associated targets in
the topology that will be affected you
can then either choose to selectively or
do bulk maintenance automated patching
simplifies managing the large
consolidated environments with ease of a
single database Enterprise Managers
topology viewer provides graphical
representation of the container database
along with its pluggable databases and
their relationships across the stack it
also enables quick drill down through
the hierarchy to the specific component
during root cause analysis of issues as
the density increases because of
consolidation you can use configuration
search feature to quickly identify
targets based on their configuration
attributes keep track of the sprawl with
inventory charts and trending
Enterprise Manager 12 cease compliance
management supports new compliance rules
for container and pluggable databases
these rules validate the databases
against Oracle best practices and
security standards you can then take
corrective actions based on the
violations Taylor these standards to
suit your organization by customizing
them assimilate these rules into
standards track them in a dashboard and
generate reports to complement the
year-end audits Enterprise Manager 12
sees comprehensive support enables you
to quickly roll out efficiently
