curriculum developer at Oracle in part
one of this two part video I showed how
to request and activate an Oracle cloud
trial service in this second video I
will show you how to administer a new
Oracle cloud service including the
management of users and roles before we
proceed let's view a diagram of the
cloud service provisioning workflow to
look at the role players and Oracle
cloud applications used to administer an
Oracle cloud service in part 1 of this
video series we saw that the buyer of a
free trial or paid subscription to an
Oracle cloud service designates who will
be the initial account administrator the
account administrator activates a
service and designates who will be the
service administrator and the identity
domain administrator a key task of the
identity domain administrator is to
define the users and the user roles that
will give users their access privileges
the identity domain administrator
creates users and roles for all of the
purchased or trial cloud services the
job of the service administrator is to
develop and administer one particular
cloud service typically it is the
service administrator who assigns roles
to each user of that cloud service the
service administrator is also the person
who will likely provide their users the
URL and signing credentials to access
the service keep in mind that depending
upon your organization's size and
structure the same person can be
assigned to perform several of these
roles in my role as the identity domain
administrator I will open the identity
console for my identity domain I open a
browser and enter the cloud oracle.com
website I click sign in at the top of
the screen I make sure the correct data
center for my service is selected and
click sign in to my services I enter the
oracle.com credentials for the identity
domain administrator and click sign in
the my services application appears
displaying my new database service to
create users and roles I click the
identity console button roles give users
privileges within a service let's
examine the roles that are initially
assigned to me in the identity console I
select manage roles initially it appears
that no roles are defined for me to see
all the roles available enter an
asterisk in the search area and click
search a list of roles is displayed here
you can create assign revoke into lead
roles because we are looking at an
Oracle cloud database service the roles
our database related such as database
user database developer database
administrator and so on I'm ready to
create a new user note that only an
identity domain administrator can create
users then either identity domain
administrators or service administrators
can assign or revoke roles for those
used in the identity console I select
manage users no users are listed I click
create to create a new user
I enter the information about the user I
want to create and click create I
receive notification that the user was
created successfully I click OK
still no users are listed to see a list
of all the users in the service I need
to enter an asterisk in the search area
and click search a list of users in the
service is displayed including my new
user and myself I'll select the last
name of the user I just created the user
details are displayed notice that there
are no roles specified next I will
assign a role to the user that will
allow him to manage this service so I
click close to assign a role to my user
I select manage roles again no roles are
initially listed to see all the
available roles to my new user
I entered asterisk in the search area
and click search
let's look at the list of roles the
identity domain administrator will see
all roles for all Oracle cloud services
in your identity domain the service
administrator will only see all roles
related to the services that he or she
manages in the identity domain I will
select database database user from the
list and click assign
now I need to enter my new users name or
a portion of his name in the search area
and click search
I select my user from the list and click
assign the role was assigned to the user
successfully I can click OK in addition
to manually adding users via the
identity console you can create a CSV
file to batch upload the definitions for
multiple users using the cloud services
file uploading utility there is another
video that shows you how to perform
these batch uploads of users go to the
Oracle Learning Library and search for
the title how to upload users in batch I
created a user and assigned him the role
of database user now I will find the URL
to give this user so he can access the
predefined sample application included
in the cloud database service I am still
locked into the identity console with a
high level privileges of the identity
domain administrator I go back to the my
services application and click the
details icon the details page has a
number of tabs I click the applications
tab to see the packaged applications
available in my cloud database service
there is one packaged application
provided the sample database application
I right click the Run button and select
copy link location to get the URL for
running this application this URL is
what I would give to my new user to run
this application while we are here
looking at the details of my service
let's look briefly at some of the other
tabs available in the Oracle cloud
database service the utilization tab
shows usage information such as the
amount and percent of storage space used
in the number of database objects in the
database schema the data export tab lets
you create an oracle data pump export of
your data and data structures using a
secure FTP
utility the administration tab lets you
write a description of the service back
up your application Express applications
and lock out the service from end users
and developers and that's it you've now
seen how to manage a new Oracle cloud
service including the creation of users
and roles I'm Rick green thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
