and order dates begin by creating a
project and selecting a data source then
select order date and hold down the
control key while you select revenue and
category there are too many values
displayed to identify any patterns so
create a calculation to group the dates
by here to reduce the clutter on the
canvas open the calendar date folder and
double-click year to create the
expression and double-click order date
to replace the variable with a value
validate and save the expression swap
order date and order year it looks like
sales peaked in 2015 across all
categories but it's especially
pronounced for the internal category you
can track the progress of your
exploration and build a story by adding
insights update the title and add a
meaningful description for this insight
insights enable you to capture different
snapshots of the report at different
phases of your exploration duplicate the
canvas and rename the new one delve
deeper into the exploration by creating
a second calculation for revenue except
this time use the month variable
validate and save the calculation add
the new month calculation to explore its
impact on revenue it looks like your
initial conclusion was incorrect the
year-to-year comparison decline was
actually due to comparing a full year of
data for 2015 with a partial year of
data for 2016
save this as another insight insights
are great because you could save
snapshots of the analyses as you move
through the data investigation process
be sure to rename the insight to help
you remember your discovery add a third
canvas and rename it to the mobile
category appears to be fairly flat this
is surprising and disappointing given
the rapid growth in the sector overall
explore the mobile category further by
adding a filter and continue looking
into the cause of the downturn in mobile
revenue add a second chart and drag it
below the line chart drag Depot name
units and category to the new chart
position the mouse over a value and then
use the right-click menu to sort the
data to see the lowest values first
create a marquee by
dragging the cursor over specific values
and then right click to keep only the
depot's that are performing below
expectations both charts reflect the
addition of the filter this is called
brushing continue exploring by swapping
item type with category in the color
drop target
it looks like tablets are responsible
for the downturn across the depots
continue to build the story by adding
another insight add your observations
about mobile sales name the insight and
navigate back to visualize mode create
the last canvas for this project next
right-click a data value and drill down
to the store type level it looks like
only the computer store type show any
revenue growth and based on the broken
lines there wasn't revenue for some
store types in some months add this as
the last insight to the story capture a
description of your discovery rename the
insight and then save the project based
on this exploration you now have a
better understanding of the downturn in
revenue for specific item and store
types click the tabs at the bottom to
step through each insight you can
present your findings as a comprehensive
story by using the story navigator you
use presentation mode to share your
story in this video I showed you how to
create a project swap columns limit data
create a calculation drill down and
create a story line
