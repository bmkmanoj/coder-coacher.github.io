accurately test the performance and
scalability of your web applications and
web services Oracle load testing is a
component of Oracle application testing
suite
we sent a piece of the Oracle Enterprise
Manager solution for comprehensive
testing of packaged web and
service-oriented architecture based
applications
for performing a load test on your
application or color testing uses the
automated load and functional test grips
created an open script the load test
script sends API requests through the
application to generate load while the
functional test script simulates user
interactions via the front-end to start
you with first define a load test Mario
in this scenario we will add multiple
tests for a sample medical application
for each test we specify how many
virtual users will run a test script lvu
represents concurrent users that will
execute the transaction at the same time
or corrode testing allows you to specify
a number of other parameters for each
script the system field defines which
machine the virtual users were run on
oracle load testing can run load from a
local host or remotely using remote
virtual user agent systems iteration
delay defines how long virtual users
will wait after every iteration of the
script before starting another one
virtual user pacing controls how long a
virtual user spends on a page before
proceeding to the next page there are
additional parameters that you can
configure in the details window
including browser emulation connection
speed emulation IP spoofing and more
load execution settings are specified
through the autopilot tab where you
define the execution start and stop
settings and specify how quickly virtual
users will be ramped up the addition to
load execution or Colo testing allows
you to configure back-end server
monitors to analyze the performance of
the underlying implication for structure
during a load test this can help you
identify the source of application
bottlenecks under load stress for this
test we will not configure any server
monitors and just allow virtual users to
generate load load test execution has
started with the play button we'll want
to save our performance data for future
analysis virtual user grid shows the
status of all running virtual users in
this case the load test begins with 30
virtual users while the load test is
running viewer on graphs shows the
real-time application performance under
load here the performance vs. users
graph shows test performance for example
the response time for a given
transaction as the number of virtual
user grows the statistics versus time
graph shows key performance parameters
like pages his per second kilobytes per
second and transactions per second
during the Lotus run the performance
statistics report shows detail
statistics with minimum maximum and
average values during the Lotus run it
also shows a breakdown of the response
times for the individual pages of the
test script
the Korea reports tab allows you to view
historical results from earlier load
test sessions and compare the results of
multiple load runs as you make changes
in tun application performance orca load
testing provides an easy-to-use
scripting interface this interface
allows you to leverage your existing
open script load and functional test
scripts for load testing this results in
saving time and effort and helps you to
perform load testing faster than any
other solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
