experience cloud provides a simple way
to create and manage your Enterprise
focused websites with each site you
create a theme is used to define the
overall style of the site you can change
the style of a specific site by applying
a different theme when you edit the site
but managing the content of a theme
allows you to change the overall look
and feel of every site using that theme
this helps when rebranding your site or
product lines with a different logo
style sheets page layout or even custom
code to manage the content of a theme
click themes a list is displayed of all
the themes that either you created or
that someone has shared with you and
they're published status right click a
theme to copy the theme share it with
others and even delete it if all you
want to do is change the theme logo
right-click the theme and select
properties in the properties dialog you
can enter a theme description and change
the logo if you want to change other
assets of your theme such as style
sheets HTML or site navigation options
right-click the theme and select open a
list of all assets used by the theme is
displayed if you are a contributor or
manager of a theme you can edit any of
the theme assets note that if the theme
has been published a folder named
publish is listed this folder contains
the published assets and shouldn't be
modified directly you can reserve an
asset so others know you are working on
it and view the access and revision
history to see who has accessed the item
and what has changed once you've changed
an asset and uploaded the new revision
you need to publish or republish the
theme for changes to take effect if the
changes were made to a copy of an online
site then you need to edit the site and
apply the new theme
