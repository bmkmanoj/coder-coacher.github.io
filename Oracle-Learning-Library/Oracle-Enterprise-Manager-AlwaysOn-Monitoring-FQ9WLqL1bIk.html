training series my name is utakata katsu
I'm one of the product managers in
Enterprise Manager product management
team
in this video we'll talk about Oso
monitoring or a OEM in short which is
one of the major features introduced in
the Enterprise Manager 13c the OEM
provides continuous monitoring during
the planned
Enterprise Manager downtime mmm sends
email notification to administrators for
critical alerts and here is today's
agenda I'll first talk about the
overview of always a monitoring then
we'll see the demonstration and lastly
we'll go through the list of ethic use
that are commonly asked by customers
so today's topic is always a monitoring
but before jumping into that let's
quickly review the enterprise manager
infrastructure in high-level right hand
side with screen shows simplify a
diagram of components in Enterprise
Manager cloud controls 13c but there are
really three core components we have
work on management repository or om our
Oracle management server or OMS and
agents when compared the human body OMR
is a heart of Enterprise Manager it is
responsible for storing critical data
OMS is a brain it is a centerpiece of
product and handles all the activities
that go was in the Enterprise Manager
and agents can be compared to nerve
endings to get there but of information
from target and then send it to OMS OMS
then communicate with AMR and takes care
of the rest of the world so this is how
Enterprise Manager works only when these
three components work together
Enterprise Manager provides complete
monitoring solution to your on-premise
and cloud environments so always-on
monitoring what if we built this it is
because there is a time when these three
components om our OMS and agent do not
work the Kaiser and that is particularly
when you have Enterprise Manager
downtime that happens when you are
applying patches were upgrading
Enterprise Manager and most likely at
the time you need to bring them or a
mess and OMR when this happens there
will be no alerting to the targets your
monitoring and no notification are send
to administrators even though the
targets are having problems so this was
a problem for many Enterprise Manager
customers raised and discussed for a
long time
in enterprise manager 13c we introduced
always a monitoring to meet our
customers demand and address the problem
of no monitoring during the enterprise
manager Dante basically AOM is a life
support for M when there is undergoing
maintenance it provides continuous
monitoring of targets during the
Enterprise Manager downtime and a OM is
a lightweight java application which is
completely independent from Enterprise
Manager so it runs standalone so no
matter what the status the Enterprise
Manager has a OEM can continue to run in
the key features always-on monitoring as
the name States provides 24 365
monitoring of Enterprise Manager targets
and because the installation is
completely separate and independent from
a.m. it can be always on regardless of
the status of Enterprise Manager AOM
receives target availability events and
metric alerts from agents in parallel to
what agent does with elements
so basically agents and this information
separately to both OMS and anyway then
AOM sends email notifications to users
who are listed in the downtime contact
target property then this downtime
contact is a new target property which
is introduced in 13 C along with a new m
and this need to be configured as a part
of Helium set up basically when a OEM
receives alert information from agent
for a specific target he looks up the
target property for that target and if
finds a downtime contact define then it
sends out email notification to the
email address of that conduct this can
be configured at a global level which
includes everyone or at the target
specific level that only contains users
who are interested to monitor a specific
target there is also an API that
generates the list of downtime contact
for that target so let's take a look at
the architecture the diagram on this
slide shows how a OM works
in a traditional enterprise manager
environment once again you have OMS omr
and Asian the agent monitor targets
collect information and send the
information back to OMS OMS processes
the data received then writes to omr or
read information from Weimer over here
we have a OEM and alien repository the a
OEM talks to the LM repository just like
OMS does to Omar a OEM service
synchronizes with the Enterprise Manager
repository to retrieve the latest target
properties and email recipients for
downtime contact so this is an
information of what the monitor and food
to notify there is one time setup we
have to perform in order to have agents
send alerts to a OEM once a OEM is
installed and configured you need to run
a command from Enterprise Manager to
upload a oh em you are l2 agents
basically this is a step to the agents
know the location of a OEM so once this
is done
Ian pushes the URL to all agent also to
the future agents that will be deployed
so again this is a one-time setup and
from that point the agent will send
alerts to both OMS and LM service so at
the time of plant maintenance you may
bring down OMS in OMR but AOM remains
operational and will continue to monitor
targets in the send email notification
in case of critical failures in those
targets now let's see the
raishin the demo will take around 10
myths but before jumping into the demo
let me go through the assumptions and
flow of the demo first of all in this
particular demo setup we assume
Enterprise Manager in the target server
which is monitored by Enterprise Manager
are up and running in the target server
we use in this demo is a WebLogic server
then you plant the stop Enterprise
Manager as a part of your scheduled
downtime then you have already
configured and started in time so it is
up and running but you have not started
the am notification yet so at this point
that notification is disabled and that
is a default setting also you configure
the downtime contact which is a user who
receives notification mail from a om so
during a demo you want to enable aom's
notification before you put Enterprise
Manager to a downtime so that you can
continue to monitor the target WebLogic
server and receive notification in case
anything happened to disturb and during
the downtime for any reason the target
WebLogic server stops perhaps unexpected
fader but because we have a om up and
running it sends you a notification mail
for this fader
although Enterprise Manager Asia so
these are the physical and behavioral
sumption after them and the right hand
side of the screen shows the demo flow
the first thing we're going to do is to
make sure the OMS in the target server
which is way below the server in our
case are up and running then verify that
halema status whether it is running or
not whether the notification is enabled
or not and based on the status we're
going to enable a web notifications then
stop OMS as a part of your scheduled
maintenance and stop the WebLogic server
for a demo purpose then receive
notification in email then once the
Enterprise Manager in back-end service
we are going to disable a OM
notification so these are the steps of
them
so let's start the demonstration so what
I have here is Enterprise Manager 13c
open my screen I already have my
credentials type thing so I'm going to
click the button to login to the
Enterprise Manager web client quick
and here is my middleware home page I
already have a two WebLogic domain
target configured expanding this node
and here is the WebLogic server I am
interested in the name of the server is
the main server and the current status
is up and running I also have a web page
of this little application so I want to
verify whether it is running or not by
looking at the web page so I'm going to
click the second top of this browser
where it says Oracle WebLogic server
click and here is the login page on my
web work application and this is the
target server I want to continue to
monitor during the Enterprise Manager
downtime
so just to recap as mentioned in
Assumption section in this particular
demo setup AOM is or D running but the
notification is not enabled yet so let's
first check the am status I am opening a
terminal window in the machine where I
have a ome installed and from the arrow
and home directory I'm going to type
down a command that shows us the status
of area press Enter the command has
executed well for some time here came
back to result so looking at the status
message came back AOM has started on
July 25th 8:35 a.m. PDT so AOM has been
running since this time also down here I
see notification enabled parameter set
to false which means notification is not
enabled so at this point notification is
not started and that is a default
setting I also see one downtime contact
configured and this is a user who
receives an email notification from a om
if notification is enabled and for this
demo setup I only have one done time
contact configured but you can have many
downtime contact us he wanted to okay so
from the status message I confirmed that
the AOM is running but the notification
is not enabled so the next thing I want
to do is still stirred up the
notification so I'm going to type
another command to start the
notification press Enter
the message already returned the same
notification has been enabled so at this
point the notification has started the
command is still executing so wait for
some time and came back to result in the
food settings arrow and synchronizes
whilst in the plasma repository one
swing 24 hours so you can change the
frequency but this is what we have in
default in addition to that whenever you
enable notifications or when you run a
sync commit it doesn't incremental sync
so what happened here in addition to
enabling a notification was a
synchronization with the Enterprise
Manager repository so it synchronized
with circuit data alerting ability data
notification metadata target metric
metadata and completed the
synchronization okay so now the AOL
notification is started I am ready to
put my Enterprise Manager to a downtime
and in this particular demo setup I have
a OM and Enterprise Manager installed in
the same machine so I'm going to switch
to the Enterprise Manager home directory
and type in a command to stop OMS please
note however from 13.2 AOM and OMS can
be installed in different machines and
that is a recommended setup in order to
avoid a single point of fader but for
this particular demo setup
they just reside in the same box so I'm
going to execute a command to stop OMS
in the currently stopping in the Oracle
management server this may take some
time
and here
result the message says Oracle
management server successfully stopped
and the server is down
so now Enterprise Manager is in a
downtime I want to verify that in a
browser window so I'm going back to the
first top of the browser where I let the
Enterprise Manager web page open click
and here I am back at the middleware
home page I still see the contents
though but if I take a closer look at
the upper left side of the screen here I
see red lights which indicates this web
client is no longer able to communicate
with Oracle management server so the old
information you see here is obsolete
this is not the current status of your
target so Enterprise Manager is
officially de the next thing I want to
do is to purposefully close down my
WebLogic server for demo sake so that I
can test out a OEM ability so I'm going
to open another terminal window but this
time in the machine where I have web
logically installed and from the command
line I'm going to type down Aquaman to
stop the WebLogic server press enter
type the map sudo password press Enter
here came back to result now the
WebLogic server is stopped I also want
to verify this in my web browser so I'm
going back to the second top of the
browser where I left my WebLogic login
page open click but I can't see the
contents it is unreachable this is
apparently because I purposefully
shutdown WebLogic server so this is a
situation your target is down during the
Enterprise Manager downtime and because
the Enterprise Manager is down OMS a
centerpiece of VM is also down and
unable to send out notifications however
because you have am I am up and running
as a separate and independent entity
also because you started a web
notification you should be able to
receive notification in
from him although in the branch manager
is in Atlanta so let's prove them I'm
going to open a mail client Thunderbird
in my case and I apparently received a
bunch of email from a OEM around the
same time so I'm going to open the top
message from my mailbox and the subject
says fail to connect to the WebLogic
server in the name of the target is
adenine server which is the WebLogic
server I just chatted on severity is
fatal availability status is down but
most importantly if you take a closer
look at the bottom of the message sent
by Oracle Enterprise Manager who is on
monitoring so this message was sent by
AOM not by OEMs so this demonstrated the
ability of a OEM to send out email
notifications during the Enterprise
Manager downtime then lastly let me
quickly show you how you can disable the
AOL notification once the enterprise
manager is back in service you know
number need a OEM to send you
notification because OMS is going to do
that for you in this case you can keep
the alien running but only turn off the
notifications so let's see how we can do
that I'm going back to the Enterprise
Manager web client because it's back
from the downtime login and Here I am
back at my middleware home page and I
see blue lights this time at the upper
right side of the screen which indicates
a successful communication with Oracle
management server so when the press
manager is back in service the next
thing I want to do is turn off the LM
notification because I don't want to
have a duplicate messages one from OMS
but from a OEM I don't want to have fun
so I'm going to open a terminal window
in the machine where I have a om
installed and from the LM home directory
I'm going to tap the McMahon to stop the
notification the name of the command is
disable notification simple as it is
press enter now the notification has
disabled please keep in mind however
I only turn off the notification the AOM
service itself is still up and running
so next time you have Enterprise Manager
downtime you can simply come back here
you can able back the a.m. notification
and you can continue to monitor targets
and receive notification mail from a.m.
if anything happened to those targets
during the Enterprise Manager downtime
so this concludes the demonstration of
always a monitor so let's go back to the
slide next let me talk about the current
limitations we have this always-on
monitoring this is the first release and
we know it is not perfect yet we started
from what we can do so there are open
enhancements that we are aware which
will remain limitations for now the
first limitation we have after OMS comes
up from maintenance it will receive cute
notification from the agent the OMS will
send the same notification as a Liam
this happens because agent queue up
alert information when OMS is down and
flushes them out to OMS once it is back
so during the Enterprise Manager
downtime a Wang will send notification
if anything bad happened that server and
once OMS is back in service OMS will
send the same notification to
administrators so basically you end up
having duplicate messages this is the
first limitation the second limitation
we have a OEM does not currently owner
incident rules and advanced
notifications the notification a OEM are
based on downtime contact of the target
and this is the only source to determine
how to send out notifications for um so
any additional computation than at the
OEMs side is not supported that includes
incident rules corrective actions and
advanced notifications such as PLC Coe
SNMP traps and less commands and with
the same reason notification blackout is
not supported as well
mmm still stands out notifications
during the notification blackout period
in case of blackout however as agents do
not monitor targets in that case no
alerts are sent to anyway and because no
alerts alien receives he will not send
out notifications next limitation he
will send out notifications for target
availability metrical alerts and metric
collection letters there is no switch to
configure which type of alerts to enable
or disable so currently when you enable
notification it enables all types of
notifications when you disable them it
disables all type of notifications the
request here is to have granular option
to select which other type to enable or
disable for example target availability
only and this is also the limitation
that we are aware and working on here
lastly a way notifications are sent via
emails only so we are aware how requests
from many customers for adding more
types of notifications such as SNS
messages but at this point supported
notification is email only lastly let me
share the frequently asked questions
that we have from customers so far
because you might have the same
questions the first question is always
on monitoring a repository database
included in enterprise managers restrict
that use of license the answer is no kom
repository is not included in the
restricted use license so if you are to
install a OEM repository in a brand new
machine you need a database license for
that on the other hand um database is
very lightweight so we do not think it
requires a dedicated system to host our
database so if you have database license
already that you can set up a OEM
repository in one of the database system
that you already have
but just please do not install in host
where you have Enterprise Manager
database - about a single point of
failure but least it should be installed
in a separate host from the Lamar and
you may wonder whether a OM is licensed
product or not the answer is now here M
itself is not a licensed product you
only need to have license for um
repository
the second question does a OEM need to
be installed on the same host as the OMS
this is es 4 13 to 1 but no for 13.2 we
had a limitation in 13.1 AOM and the
Enterprise Manager have to be installed
in the same machine but in Enterprise
Manager 13.2 this is no longer a
limitation so they can be installed in a
separate machine
actually there is a recommended set up
to avoid a single point of failure next
question does am directly communicate
with the OMS the answer is no the a
limit does not talk to OMS he only talks
to a more support of the synchronization
and is how it is designed so that it can
be independent from OMS as much as it
can the next question do we support a
OEM 13.2 with am certain to one agents
the answer is no AOM 13.2 works with
agent person 13.2 yo am 13 to one works
with agent Persians 13 to 1 so basically
it requires the same agent Persia the
next question how do I receive alerts
from a om only for mission-critical
targets but not from the non
mission-critical targets basically you
can do this by setting downtime contact
only to the mission critical targets in
a OEM notification are based on downtime
contact that is only source for am in
terms of where to send notifications so
if targets have done time contact define
then a1 will send out a notifications
but if the targets do not have done time
contact define no notification will be
sent to those targets
who are en patching or upgrade downtime
be reduced if I use a om the answer is
no um does not affect the length of the
e/m downtime the purpose of a om is to
provide monitoring during the Enterprise
Manager downtime but it is not a tool
that reduces the downtime window itself
can even automatically enable
notification during unplanned downtime
the unfortunately the answer is no a
Wayne cannot automatically enable
notification during the unplanned
downtime anyone is designed for planned
downtime primarily so it does not
consider the use cases of unplanned
downtime at this point for unplanned
downtime please consider setting up the
HEA for OEMs for more robust solution in
the last question should we use a OEM
instead EMH a and as already mentioned
above answer is no a OEM can be a part
of your Enterprise Manager HCl solution
but does not replace AJ here when
basically is a utility that provides
continuous monitoring during the planned
downtime of Enterprise Manager so this
concludes a OEM overview presentation
