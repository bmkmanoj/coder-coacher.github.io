haven't got any slides we're going to
capture ideas though if people have any
honor dr. Jess are so I'm just going to
give you brief introduction on my
experiences with the doctor Jess are and
kind of how it all started out so it's
about 18 months ago when the lymph java
community was voted onto the EC and
around that time we started kicking off
with in London java community a small
committee that would kind of handle the
day-to-day running of our representation
on the ec so what really happened that
was so we had some very informal
sessions down at the pub we started to
grow our membership base and I think we
ended up with around 10 at the beginning
and we kind of progress from there and
what we our first sort of initiative was
how can we get more involved you know
how can we make what is effectively now
and at the time I didn't really know
much about Jess ours I could they kind
of come up with like a buzzword that
people can kind of relate back to code
somehow and they've seen it in Java doc
maybe and so I got involved specifically
with Jess a free 10 and the way I got
involved that was purely accidental so I
started off with like Martain slides
earlier which was how are we going to
sort of promote jrs amongst our group so
I start off by doing a lightning talk
and that lining talk involved me going
and meeting Stephen Colburn who's a spec
lead on the Jess are getting to know him
a bit and getting to know some of the
problems that was currently being faced
in that Jessa after I'd done the
lightning talk we started to get more
involved in terms of thinking about how
we'd actually formed this adopts Jess
our process bull we used it as a pilot
basically for how we'd put together a
framework of best practices really and
most just be clear that even though
there is like herself this is what you
can do is by no means what you should do
is just a template there to help you get
started so the next next thing I did was
our local developer sessions i was going
round greeting people and discussing my
waldman jess every 10 which was where i
met Richard
I after meeting Jim who suggested I come
along to one of the JTP committee
meetings which I did and then have been
helping out on there ever since and Jim
was pointing out that one of the things
that was lacking in 310 was a proper
property TK split where there were lots
like on a unit test but no no serious
TCK situation and the first step to
getting this out the door was actually
fixing their ant script so that there
was some kind of sanity with what was
going on there so that was the first
thing I did which was quite an
interesting first step something
reasonably easy to do and then having
split that up we picked up a few more
external contributors for sorting out
the ttk and started making some progress
and had a meeting with Stephen where we
said you know what what what things
should we deal with on the tck from
watch we split out and we figured out
what bits were still kind of fluctuating
in the API and what was stable what we
what were able to work on and then the
bits that was stable we kind of sorted
out the ttk situation on that and the
bits that were fluctuating carried on
fluctuating so we caught up with our bit
of progress and then ended up helping
steven also more the design issues and
helping talk to some of the guys oracle
as well on that front and then on 310 we
also ended up running a hack day for
getting feedback getting developers to
try out the API and getting a directly
addressing open design questions by
getting people to go is this actually
good way do you understand what's going
on here can you solve this problem
easily that kind of thing and not also
helped out on the lambdas Jess are a
little bit by running a couple of hack
days there the first one was actually
not run by me at all it was kicked off
by ben and martine but i run the last
two and we've been getting feedback to
the list
then there seems to be you know quite
good quite good appreciation from some
of the eg members on that front for
getting feedback so there's that there's
the kind of two things I've been
involved in one of them's like really
really actively involved and one of
them's much more kind of as an outsider
but still kind of you can make a
contribution even if you're not even if
you don't have direct design changes I
guess one of the biggest contributions
that we've made today is actually coming
to Java want to speak about this with on
a global level so at the moment there
are global jokes that participate in the
adult jess our program and i think that
although we're participating on it
independently we need to try and push it
is to be more a global effort amongst
developers i think that's one of the key
things that we're trying to get out of
java one between myself martine trish
and richard just to mention a few things
about the hack days and we've tried
different varieties of hack days that
we've been running and I think one that
has worked the best has been where we've
kind of given the free 10 API just as a
jar with in a clip so the first thing
the guys do is they pick / USB stick and
they have they have a development
environment set ready to go so it lowers
there's no set-up time and if people
have to fiddle around for an hour to get
so the chances are that your hack day or
two hours is not going to be productive
you need to get that down to within 10
to 15 minutes I think and the way that
it's being done with open JDK is to
provide a virtualized box that people
can spin up and run the next thing we
did with the free 10 hack day was we
actually presented the problems in
failing unit tests so it was actually to
the spec weeds had something very
specific very specific questions that
they wanted to get out of developers
using the API for the first time so we
did that with with unit tests and we
found that to be quite good at steering
people into one exploring the API and
trying to figure out what it was doing
but then also to get that egg
act feedback that people wanted on the
actual API yep I think the the lambdas
hack days were a little bit more
open-ended so they were running for a
whole day for Saturday there wasn't a
situation of failing unit tests it was
just kind of do what you want but again
we were providing bill binary so it's
easy people to get up to speed and we're
also providing kind of helpers going
around so that they could ask questions
of people who you know they wouldn't
just get stuck bored and then go home
you know if they got stuck there was
someone who knew what they were doing a
little bit more they could ask questions
too or talk to get involved with yeah
yeah
it was really interesting
yeah that's a really good point I think
at the start of that hack days well we
put up on the slides that here here is
where the javadocs are and that's it
whereas when we've done presentations
and sort of taught people through the
API we've gone into a lot more depth to
describe here here the key parts of the
API here's how it differs from jodha
time and date time and yeah that's every
year you have to be careful you don't
scare people off at the same time if
you're going to take that approach I can
you give some more insight how you do
what are you organize things it'd be
published summer
then implement can I also have the
example from the subject which were
organizing groovy or whatever people are
people are going there they have no clue
about Bowie so there has to be some
introduction you know this is wrong so
this is what you do and all
more need more information organized on
so on the 3 10 11 of the open issues we
were worried about was whether people
would purely from javadoc understand
what the hell was going on in the API so
I think there was there was an open
presentation to tell people why they
were there but there were literally
there was there was one slide that
defined five datetime related terms and
then that was all the help they were
given specifically because we were
trying to find out whether they would
need more help because if they did need
more help it was probably a bad bad API
design choices or bad javadoc somewhere
along the lines gives you this concert
ten years so in that case year I think
thin game probably a good heart our
presentation yeah first of all
functional programming
for in letting people go
and then we're asking from the people
know there are some specific problems
that they had to solve or how do we go
for example I don't know where to solve
problems with the API or things like and
Istanbul there are some things that have
actually code so yeah so that's things I
mean basically the way that we
structured it was we had three different
sets of problems and the first set were
very specific API questions so it was
like can you create a date that is the
end of the first world war for example
and questions like that that were really
specific and there was basically five
questions that people could go through
and if you if they were familiar with
the API you just be going bang bang bang
bang bang however because of the way in
which we introduced the problem people
were spending time really understanding
the API and trying to figure it out for
themselves I mean in that case one
example was rather than creating a new
local date quite a lot of people weren't
familiar with the pattern of actually
using like a static builder so you'd be
doing local that time of and then the
construct and those are the kind of
things that we were really trying to get
out of that problem the second one
Richard I could remember but I think it
was the problems were slightly more
involved and had there are more kind of
computed calculate time calculation type
issues like finally you know the end of
the the first friday of the month of
something or other or things like that
and then there were a third set of
exercises which was like an actually
quite hard problem but there was like a
kind of domain modeling aspect to it as
well it was it was it was school
holidays for two different schools with
different holiday rules in different
time zones using different calendaring
systems so the way that we and I think
just going back to the beginning of your
question how did it all start we
actually publish the event through the
london java community so we already had
a captive audience and we basically put
out the you know we'd be going along
meeting the spec weeds and trying to
solve problems on on the API but I don't
I mean yeah it does help you go
drug but it I don't think it is actually
something that you need to have a jug to
run properly because I think if you have
any kind of local technology meet up or
user group or any kind of forum for
advertising or promotion at all you can
get that kind of to it yeah you p you
know it's an interesting point you
mention that because the first time I
met Steven was because Jim advertised a
meet-up between me and himself in a pub
and Steven came along because he worked
about five minutes walk away from the
pub so that was actually very convenient
the sense that we were literally five
minutes walk from the the EG lead but
you know it yet Twitter that it actually
surprisingly effective and we did the
same thing in Crete so when we were
talking about the daytime api's that was
one of the things that we made available
because all the materials that we used
for that and hack day were porn to get
hub and they could be potentially reused
by any jug globally then
so for 310 we had both of the expert
group leads at the hack day and everyone
was kind of wandering around and then I
sent an email to the list at the end
just summarizing points of feedback
which I thought were important we did
also have uh yeah that was for lambdas
though and faster now I'm getting
forgetful of my old age yeah that was
actually that's a very good point so
there was a google doc which was anyone
who had the link could write to it and
then the URLs just written on a board
and then anyone can just hop along and
under CC over tea company but I don't
experiment that make a feeling really
stupid quite often and being able to say
that in a doctor okay too
so maybe you were just walking around
the machines and they were looking how
people yeah yeah then you could say or
any people just yes and I mean lambdas
was quite good in the sense that because
we have people who are going around
helping you could very easily gather
feedback from helpers at the end of the
day so you didn't have to like stare
over people's shoulders the entire time
you could use the fact that they were
asking for help to know what needed help
and I think that's a good point those as
as you start to grow these out I think
if you're going to have sort of five or
six of you having a hack day in your
office for example at lunchtime then
having one person that's experiencing
the problem domain is probably enough
but as you start to go out to 20 or 30
or 40 people I mean martini burn a
hands-on lab this morning how I mean how
many people that was at 150 and how many
people did you need to be involved to
make that run smoothly in terms of
instructors it was busy
all pretty taken back you know and it
was there you know they just the just
wait gave you know I don't know if it's
the same with the tactics or if you will
please literally make it very well the
ones we run we've deliberately made it
very guarded so
I think the other point about the
feedback is you know everything's got an
open mailing list now so so you can sit
so there is an easy place for you to
send feedback and it's always helpful to
try and contact expert group leaves even
once you don't really know particularly
I mean we obviously very easy to meet
Steven Martin been put me in contact
with Brian who we contact you when we're
in the lambdas one but I also run a one
a brief hack day on type annotations
which only had a few people turn up
because it's quite a niche topic but
even though I was emailing the guys out
of the blue about two days before the
event I had quite good response back
from Michael Ernst and Alex Buckley I
think is also one of the spec leads I
had a few emails back from them saying
be careful the following things and have
a think about this as well so you know
even if they're even if they're people
you're randomly emailing out of the blue
they'll there they seem quite keen to
get get some feedback
question
the two days
just hours or is there a way we're here
we're in first
there's a pretty clear split though I
think all active se stuff is quite easy
to find people are interested in and no
active noee stuff has an active adopter
jsr group particularly who's up yet yeah
yeah the it does it's a good point
because but but JMS 2 point 0 had a lot
of effort put into it to try and make
sure there was some adopts chairs are
going around I'm a Trish complaining
that she had a load of people who were
like enthusiastic at a pub and then
didn't really do anything you thinking a
half the hoods
that is why we've learned I think
they're running with workshops is the
yes
so one thing that I'm taking away from
from this a sort of both is that we've
had today some quite senior people on
Twitter say that a dr j sr is one thing
that they are the most excited about in
technology at the moment yet we're at a
java conference and there's only around
10 to 12 hours that are here so i think
that although we've done a lot of effort
in publicizing this so far there's well
I guess there's a couple of outcomes as
either that people don't know about the
ball there's people that don't know
about a doctor Jess are all those people
that didn't want to come a lot I think
it's worthless all need beer
please
to give reschedule it allows for
pleasure yeah okay it's also worth
noting that you had a session at the jug
stay on a very similar topic that had a
lot more people attend now I don't know
whether that's because it's dinnertime
you're better known than we are or
there's less competition on the drugs
they for events or maybe all three yeah
but but that but there was there was I'd
say a lot better attendance then under
guard from Toronto as well seem to be
quite enthusiastic about having stuff
mr. featured stop the
had days or something for someone else
us to go in Upendra
squirtle and the second one again so if
you want to adopt entation more pair for
maybe I am I police may put the second
question later on so if some of us it's
a start some tough days you know from
starts right right now work or the best
thing to do is just go to just run one
we have no much material how did you
start folks at home
already there now when we organize this
ones that we've bunch of us okay always
a history of teaching run training
courses or whatever so weary head
experiment actual practical aspects of
something that's taught in full of
people like where do I find space do I
provide the laptops would have picked up
with moving around how do i get the
source code to the
something that Richard is actually
written article recently which is going
to go to job magazine shortly on how to
run it
but yes Jim have you got have you got
your is your Silas whole sentence again
if you grab your give me your email
address or if Jim's already got it then
I can probably send you an advance draft
if watching as much information as
Google have someone wants the stuff I
mean I know what you start it's I mean I
would say the usual thing for hack days
is just ask people to bring their own
laptops on the computer front but but
it's interesting because I had an email
from a couple of guys from Russia who
were looking at running a hack day as
well on on lambdas who were basically
asking the same kind of question where
to start so it's probably a koala quite
popular thing
because I thought unless you really sir
yeah one of the other difficult things
is finding space as you grow I mean it's
easy to do something in your office or
and I think Heinz doesn't met his house
so I'm so I'd have said that the when he
did the dedlock's thing a creep that
would be an example of a hack day even
though you just unboxed it to an hour
and a half in my opinion that would be
what we would call a hack event there's
not a quite a day I think one of the
things is finding space is quite easy if
there's a company because I if there's a
company who are looking to recruit
people because we had there's a cover is
quite a few people in London who we have
really good contacts with who are
usually happy to give away free space
and sometimes free pizza because they
want to get their name out there to
developers yeah yeah yeah
Ohio has fell short necks yeah but also
keep trying to create overnight so we've
done things like actually talk to a
local cafe we guarantee that Tim that
we're going to come in i'll give you up
through virtual copies for two hours can
you reserve us first two tables over
there but offer sure so much you need to
get into
so I'm talking the JSON what does it
means that you just find a sign on the
internet if you want that you like like
the numbers or whatever just organized
on my hack days get some feedback so it
doesn't have to be a hug day could be i
would say it's just do anything you can
to help yes i think i think my first
something that's quite broad that's
that's really fearful but that yeah that
is the bottom line the first step though
is to go to java.net look at the adopt
jess our page and see who else is
working on it because they on that page
it will say you'll give you contacts too
so you can like for example if you came
along today looked at 310 and saw that
mine Richards name was there you build
contact is we'd be able to give you all
the materials to run a hack day we've
got countless lightning talks that range
from five minutes to 20 minutes it's all
the material and contents there yes
yes I think it's well that kind of
depends at what stage the j searles at
so if it's a very early stage then you
can obviously be involved with the
discussions that will will shape that
API in the future where we went on to
Jess offre 10 there was already the
majority of an API there but it didn't
quite mean meet the design goals so we
helped out with the design goals and the
testing and there's some for example
lambdas which is nearing completion so
the way that we're helping out with that
is by taking the openjdk eight builds
with lambdas and running sort of like
awareness days of getting people to use
use the tools and then give feedback to
the spec leads Jason here okay here are
the five or six guys our with possibly
play sex I think too I think perhaps to
be honest there's them it once there is
a public jira instance that's probably
writable you know it's not unreasonable
for there just to be a tag for something
for writing an issue to say please try
and help out a feat a feedback tag or a
Jew glove tag for maybe a small issue
yeah
yeah we got about six o'clock movie
going
I guess and as part of the lemons and
javi's where do those cool we rerun a
secret let me get better delvis
particularly so therefore we get all the
commuters again that patent on
there's no stupid questions okay that's
a good question so dr. Josiah was what
we started off with and we were trying
to obviously we join the JCP we're
trying to encourage brasserie
participation in jrs and what we found
with the people we were talking to okay
well I see this jess r is it's probably
going to go into OpenJDK at some point
but what I really want to get my hands
on is this bug that's been annoying me
for ages I want to go and have a look
how hash maps implemented for example so
out of adult a JSR came October JDK and
we kind of ran it side by side to start
off with and that was kind of the same
thing we wanted to the efforts we wanted
air was lower the barrier to entry to be
able to work with the JDK and this was
before the build infraprojects was done
so it was very difficult for someone to
get up and get started so to ease the
Avera venturi Martain and worktop with i
think it was for yourself richer than
been to build a out of the box virtual
machine that you could just load up in
virtualbox and you could then start have
a look around how to play with that
since then the initiatives kind of we
split initiative off away from Jo dr.
jet are into its own thing and now that
has its own participation group where
we've had some like people again that
have come along to hack days on on the
open JDK stuff and are now pretty much
helping to run that community just from
having that two hours contact time
it doesn't seem to you that
how
interested
and start playing with it was kind of
there that was a little bit but I guess
we've got our stuff so it needs to be a
lot more for javi I mean I think it's
ready i would say probably one of the
points about a doctor OpenJDK is trying
to get more people who are familiar with
comfortable with and perhaps in the long
term serious contributors to OpenJDK as
a project as an implementation and you
know they've been there's been some good
start made on that with respect to
patches going back but a dr j sr is a
lot more about kind of trying to get
what are some extent feed feedback
evangelism design improvements around
the standards themselves so you know
this there's that big split between
design feedback and also working on
implementation so i guess it might be
fair to say as well that if you're going
to adopt jess are the scope is a lot
more limited so adopting an open jdk or
even just getting involved in that is
quite a massive step and it's not
something you just go in and start
changing stuff you know you have to be
able to build it then you have to start
to be able to understand certain bits
you do warnings and you get used to
stuff and that that's not a quick win
scenario where as it's very easy for
somebody to go on to the doctor nope
adopter jsr page pick up a topic and
then do a lining talk I at their local
drug or in their workplace so I think
that barriers to various venture even
though we've made them lower they're
still quite a lot of work you have to do
on your own to be able to be at that
point where you'd be considered to be a
contributor
there is an overlap
so one of the ideas of the past people
here that we need but this is this code
to actually fund a person out of the
community to promoters
to promote in full time physically go
around kickoff workshops for the
different user groups and ethical
corporations but also so kind of speed
at full funded we does it totally does
the facebook because pajamas on their
blog posts that side of me see you on an
evangelist people go through notice here
the other day Neary we've got the
leadership numbers to support it in
theory it's hard to say ready because
London is a place where I think people
have a lot more money than time but that
might not be the case for other areas
whereas it would be hard to ask the
broker job which is just starting out
for examples a hey
you
so long gotta love it yeah I think we
have that with John I mean maybe we just
need to build a landing page on the on
WordPress and just have it pointing to
those different things I know it sounds
kind of sad but yeah yeah there's also i
mean there's also the to twitter
accounts which we have registered all do
consider that owes its into deducted
think of it there is no coordination
between
I guess the other thing is that probably
the thing that's hard to get is not
necessarily people to turn up for a
one-off hack day type thing the thing
that the people it's hard to get our
people who kind of lead an ish and
initiative independently and do you
think that an evangelist is the kind of
person who's going to be able to attract
people who are into kind of mini onio
mini leadership roles someone who and I
mean imagine if you were doing that
full-time if you do that full time and
you went in somewhere then you'd have
the time to follow it with the people
that you'd been and done the workshop
with ask them if they what they go out
with what they wanted to do next and you
be effectively compiling materials that
can used everywhere and it would be your
job to make sure that things are going
well things that are being followed
followed up on yeah but then it's
finding the money to do it I think
that's probably the biggest problem but
what would you give people for giving
money an Oracle t-shirt
No
you
I certainly would ask horrible as are
being imaginative the community but
there are also going to IBM agree
attacks being where everyone yes
absolutely yeah absolutely not we're not
be upset at uncle Larry is known as the
money to ever yeah I think that's I mean
after the question of what would you
give somebody I think maybe you could
suggest if you could get jugs if you get
a joke to raise money for their you
could guarantee that your guy would get
your person would go and visit them
that's I guess one
well I think you'd have to employ
someone here that you have we have a
certain degree of interest okay thank
you again ideally I'd love to give this
sort of Rome someone who has got the
enthusiasm and you also maps currently
it hasn't got a day job the start of the
corner and I think there's plenty of
mentors in this room alone that would be
able to help that personnel especially
in the initial stages might even be that
you know people volunteer their time
just even go along and bring them up to
speed on how we've done stuff for
example
Jesus
Gary yeah
situation
it just her teeth into the game in
between us I guess we're just a lot of a
lot of people are very suspicious to
look at e3 good i read the sponsorship
yeah yeah maybe something to think about
cool so I think we're starting to run
out of time so does anybody else have
any final questions or is it straight to
taylor street
so as Martin was saying java.net is that
site the problem is that Google doesn't
index it and that's why you can't find
it on that there's that if you actually
go to that right landing page there is
loads of material on there it's just a
case about and I think going back to
what we were saying earlier we probably
need to have some indexable data that
just points you into the right place on
Java dot next that's the right place to
be hosting community java project is it
not the case that the project
director
yeah it's some chocolate on that yeah
its own job honestly is on Javed on that
it might not be on Google Brits on job
yeah that's a problem because yeah
google endings if we do with the other
than the jobs on 18 try and solve that
so they cross they gonna fix that really
there go so I think that's got to be our
main takeaway then I mean if there's
someone say in the room that can't find
the information that we're talking about
then we've made a mistake yeah thanks
for pointing out yeah I mean it wouldn't
take long to put some landing pages
there
better than what i'm talking
show
but have you just found the LJ sees a
doctor j sr project we do because we've
linked to our page from our blog several
times yeah cool the doors are open so
you're now allowed to leave thank you
