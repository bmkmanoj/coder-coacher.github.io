up and tear down your development and
test environments or thinking about
moving your enterprise apps to the
public cloud subscribe to oracle compute
cloud service and easily launch and
manage virtual machines to handle all
your business critical workloads here's
how it works you can choose a
multi-tenant subscription model and
share the environment with other tenants
or subscribe for dedicated capacity and
get an environment that's physically
isolated both options provide the same
enterprise great features on virtual
machines you can play with various
resource combinations start small and
scale up when needed create virtual
machines with as little as 7 point 5
gigabytes of memory and just one
processor core or ramped up to 16 Intel
Xeon processor cores and up to 240
gigabytes of memory per VM choose from
several robust virtual machine images
all backed by Oracle's world-class
support and maintained patched and
upgraded for you or run your own
operating system on the Oracle cloud
infrastructure you control your
networking at a granular level down to
each VM and external host with just a
few clicks in a web console you can set
up a firewall around one set of VMs but
allow another group to communicate
freely with the internet with each VM
you can attach up to 20 terabytes of
efficient block storage capacity spread
over up to 10 disks you can attach and
detach disks to VMs on demand the
storage disks are independent of the VMS
so your data remains intact regardless
of the state of the via
you define and manage all the M
resources in orchestrations when you
don't need a set of VMs simply stop the
relevant orchestration and restart it
when you want the VMS running again sign
