hi this is Matt from the Oracle
Primavera curriculum team in this video
we'll look at managing organizations and
password policies in the Primavera cloud
administration application 16.1 this
allows you to control the rules for user
passwords in Primavera cloud a user's
password policy is determined by its
organization organizations are also used
when granting partner companies access
to Primavera unifier to access your
organization's click actions manage
organizations select an organization to
view or change its password policy to
add a new organization as the child of
an existing one click Add row from the
context menu then type a name for the
new organization by default the new
organisation's password policy is
inherited from its parent the details of
the policy are displayed under password
policy overview to change the assign
policy first clear the check box for
inherit password policy then select a
new policy note that if you change the
password policy for an existing
organization with users assigned the new
policy will not be enforced until the
affected users have changed their
passwords when doing so it is therefore
recommended that you reset the passwords
of all affected users be sure to save
changes after creating or editing an
organization to access your password
policies click actions manage password
policies select an existing policy to
view or edit its password rules add a
new policy by typing a name in the add
password policy field on the general tab
the policy rules are defined all rules
are optional except for a policy type
set some basic rules such as minimum
password length and how often the
password will expire
next select a policy type the complex
password option contains predefined
criteria for acquired characters and
disallowed items select custom policy to
define these options and others such as
maximum password length and maximum
repeated characters allowed the assigned
organizations tab allows you to assign a
policy to or remove it from multiple
organizations simultaneously click
manage assignments then use the right
and left arrows to add or remove
organizations as previously discussed
password policy changes are not enforced
until the affected users change their
passwords therefore if you edit the
rules of a policy or change the
organization its assigned to it is
recommended that you reset the passwords
of the affected users thank you for
