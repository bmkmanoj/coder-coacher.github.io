cloud control 12c demonstration series
in this demonstration I will show you
how to authenticate Enterprise Manager
users with Microsoft Active Directory
this demonstration assumes that both
Enterprise Manager cloud control and
Microsoft Active Directory are already
installed you need to have also the
following information for Active
Directory the actor directory host name
the Active Directory port the Active
Directory principle who is the user in
the Active Directory administrators
group
the password for the Active Directory
principle the user base DN and the group
base DN first you need to create a
couple of users in the Active Directory
I'm going into the Active Directory
users and computers utility they select
users then new user I am going to be
creating the Active Directory principle
which is the Active Directory user who
will have the administrator's privilege
and will be communicating with WebLogic
server so here I'm just entering the
password for this user which is mgc
admin and what you need to do is to
uncheck the option so that the user does
not have to change password at next
logon verify that the account is correct
then click finish and then I will go to
the EMG see admin user right click on
that user add the EMG C admin user to
the administrators group again the
administrators group is a group within
Active Directory
finally I'm going to be creating another
user which will be sort of a generic
Enterprise Manager user
and I'll put in the username and again
enter the password uncheck the option to
force the change in password click
finish next we go into WebLogic server
select security realms select my realm
select the providers tab lock and edit
so that we can ensure we can make
changes we're going to be creating a
provider for Microsoft Active Directory
so I'm going to click on the new button
the name for the provider is ms Active
Directory and the type is Active
Directory Authenticator click OK and you
see that the MS Active Directory
authentication provider is now in the
table click on the link for that new
provider you want to set the control
flag to sufficient save then select the
provider specific tab you need to fill
in the connection host for the Active
Directory the port we're going to use a
default port of 389 remember that the
principal is the Active Directory user
that we'd created Kali ma c edmond you
need to enter the user base DN we need
to enter the group base DN check the
propagate cause for login exception then
click Save click on the common tab to go
back and then click on the breadcrumb
link for providers and want to reorder
the providers and make MS Active
Directory the topmost provider then we
need to activate the changes that we've
made changes have been saved and
activated
but there are some items that were
change that require restart first we
need to stop the LMS using the EMC TL
stop command and stop all components
next we are going to be modifying a
property in e/m to enable auto
provisioning so that when a user is
added in Active Directory it is
automatically propagated through
WebLogic server into Enterprise Manager
after that we start the LMS again let's
go into WebLogic server and go into the
users and groups tab for my realm to
verify that the user was propagated and
you see that the new user was propagated
to WebLogic server before you can assign
any privileges to the enterprise manager
user who's actually being authenticated
through Active Directory you need to
first log in as that user so we're going
to go and log in as Jacey which is as
you remember the user that we created in
Active Directory which was then Auto
provisioned through WebLogic server into
Enterprise Manager once we've logged in
we lock back out and we log in as the
e/m administrator system an and sis man
can go into the setup security
administrators screen to grant
privileges to this user who's being
authenticated through Active Directory
