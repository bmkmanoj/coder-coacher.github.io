Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 12 seed
emissaries application replay is the
next generation application testing tool
under Oracle's application quality
management solutions that enables you to
perform realistic production scale
testing of your web and packaged oracle
applications unlike traditional
application testing tools it uses real
production workloads to generate load
against applications under test and does
not require any script development or
maintenance with Oracle application
replay back you can reduce your testing
time by more than eighty percent it
provides the most efficient optimized
and I used quality testing for
validating application infrastructure
changes these demonstration assumes that
a rural version 12 dot one has been set
up to capture the network traffic at the
middle tier the backup strategy is in
place to restore the mid-tier stack and
below to test system changes the test
system is available for testing and
required patches have been applied the
application whose web traffic that is to
be captured is being monitored as a
system in enterprise manager cloud
control 12c this first part of the
demonstration is going to show you how
to capture a workload let's log to
enterprise manager cloud control first
go to enterprise menu at the top and
from there select quality management
then application replay these takes you
to the application replay homepage click
the capture tab here we are creating a
new capture task based on an existing
one that is already selected so click
he ate like specify the name of your
capture task and the description then
review the prerequisite information and
ensure they have been met workload is
capturing to a specified oz file systems
so ensure you have sufficient storage
space to capture for the duration ensure
also you have a rest'll plan for the
application data bus to the point in
time that you started the capture this
is only for database synchronized replay
this will allow you to min eyes
divergence during replay then click Next
now you need to specify a system that
exists in Oracle Enterprise Manager
cloud control as a target here because
we use the create like option to create
its capture task one system is already
pre-populated but you could select
another one if you want then make sure
the status of all the components for
your selected system are available
before you start the capture click Next
to capture the workload am uses a real
user experience in site called Rui so
specify a valid username and password
combination for your Rui system and this
user must have security officer
permission the show applications button
shows the applications that are set up
to be monitored by Rui here you can
select EBS r12 once done click Next now
specify whether database capture should
be enabled during application capture
this is required for synchronized replay
if enabled specify the necessary
database and host credentials then the
file system location on the database
host system used for intermediate
capture storage and whether automatic
workload
repository data should be exported in
this demonstration we use the default
and we are only capturing the meteor
traffic click Next specify the host file
system location well the capture data
should be stored note that this includes
capture files andrewy files from which
they are derived as well as any data
synchronization information click Next
specify the start and stop times for the
plan capture and by default the capture
starts immediately and runs for 15
minutes click Next review the plan
capture properties before launching it
the overview the system the ruie the
database the storage and the schedule in
this demonstration we will not launch a
new capture
as you can see one capture task already
exists and so we will now look at its
results once the capture has started you
can monitor the capture process to
ensure the intended traffic is being
correctly captured and the application
is working under normal conditions here
the screen shows the requests on the
primary axis and no error on the
secondary axis now let's have a look at
the results tab we show you the
performance summary with the average
request rate the capture information the
top pages by average load time and the
capture progress let's further drill
down to the page analysis septum further
capture drill down by page analysis by
various criteria average min max
cumulative load etc it is an Instagram
graph of response time we will cover
this section in more details in the
second part of this demonstration this
is the end of the first part of this
demonstration thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
