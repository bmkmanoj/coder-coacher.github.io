creating database schemas for 12 see
this is the fourth in a series of eight
videos about upgrading Oracle BPM suite
to version 12 see if you haven't yet
seen the first three videos start at the
beginning and view the sequence in order
if you've already seen them welcome back
you're in the right place we've taken
care to verify our pre upgrade
requirements have been met including
making sure our operating system JDK and
Oracle database are certified to work
with 12c we've installed the version 12c
software in a new Oracle home directory
now in this video we're going to stop
our 11g servers and other processes and
create the new schema is required for
version 12 13 the repository creation
utility or RCU is used to create and
manage Fusion Middleware database
schemas before creating a schema RCU
performs prerequisite checks to ensure
that certain minimum requirements are
met the schemas are created the required
table spaces and data files are created
RCU also maintains a database table
named schema version registry that map's
the schemas and their related prefixes
we'll see each of these things as we
demonstrate using the RC you to create
database schemas for our 12c
installation before we run the RCU we
need to shut down the managed servers
node managers administration server and
system components such as OHS that may
be using the schemas we want to upgrade
we also need to be absolutely certain
that no other components or users are
operating on the same database instance
that will be at
assessed by the repository creation
utility there are multiple ways to do
this including using enterprise manager
PL sequel or other tools in our
environment the easiest way to do this
is to stop and restart the database and
listener once the databases we started
we're ready to run the RCU to run the
RCU we login to the host open a terminal
window and set the Oracle home variable
notice that's the new Oracle home that
was established when we installed the
12c software we navigate to Oracle home
Oracle common bin from there we invoke
the repository creation utility the
welcome screen appears when r CU is
started the navigation pane on the left
summarizes the tasks that are see you
will help us complete each item in the
navigation pane represents a specific
scream that will prompt us for
information required to create our
schemas depending on the options you
select when running the RCU your
sequence might vary a bit from this one
if you have the necessary permission and
privileges to perform DBA activities on
your database select system load and
product load on the create repository
screen if you do not have the necessary
permission or privileges to perform
those activities select prepare scripts
for system load instead this option will
generate a sequel script which can be
provided to your database administrator
in this demo we have the necessary
privileges so we're going to accept the
default option system load and product
load on the database connection details
screen we provide the information RC you
will need to connect to our database we
start with the hostname the port number
the service name the username that's any
user with DBA or assist DBA privileges
and our password checking prerequisites
and all as well on the select components
screen we're asked to select whether to
use an existing prefix or to create a
new prefix for our schema for our sample
installation we're going to use the
existing prefix death the prefix in your
production environment will probably be
different for more information refer to
the documentation titled creating
schemas with the repository creation
utility in the components section we
select the new schemas to be created for
12 see the correct choices for your
environment may be different the RCU
checks that various prerequisites have
been met the green check marks are good
news we specify how we want to set the
schema passwords on our database in this
video we're going to use the same
password for all schemas we provide that
password twice
the map tablespaces screen shows the
default and temporary table spaces that
will be created for the components
selected earlier the managed tablespaces
button provides access to options that
will allow you to create or modify
tablespaces will accept the defaults and
click Next we are prompted to confirm
and the table spaces are created the
summary screen shows all the input we
provided we review that input for
accuracy and click create to continue
the completion summary screen reports
the actions that have been taken note
the access to the RCU and other log
files you can access these log files to
debug any issues you encounter or to
verify logged confirmation of success
when you're done click close to dismiss
the RCU earlier in this video we said
that the RCU maintains the mapping
between the schemas and their related
prefixes in the schema version registry
table we can use the sequel query on
screen to view the version status and
upgrade state of each schema record in
that table here are the schemas in our
sample database first we see our newly
created 12 13 schemas their versions and
their status this confirms that the RCU
was successful we see our 11g schemas
and their information as well your list
will probably be similar but not
identical to this it will vary depending
on what components you have installed
and their current versions the Oracle
documentation upgrading with the Upgrade
Assistant includes a list of schemas
that are available for upgrade and
instructions on how to interpret your
results to determine if your version of
that schema is supported for upgrade
we'll set this information aside until
our next upgrade task that concludes our
conversation on creating database
schemas for 12 see in the next video
we'll use the Upgrade Assistant to
upgrade our current schemas and our
active instance data I'm Rosie pillar
