president of product development I
wanted to speak to all of you about what
we're doing with sequel and Peele sequel
you know these two components from the
heart of Oracle's data management
technology and we're investing heavily
in them were focused on three primary
things with sequel and Peele sequel the
first one is to make sequel the language
through which people can access both
structured and unstructured data you
know historically we've done lots of
things with sequel with our relational
database but now we've broadened it with
two important capabilities literally in
the last six months the first is with
our in-memory database extending the
expressiveness of sequel and pl sequel
to give you huge speed up in how you can
access data from the Oracle database
representing it in Columbus structures
in the database second is our sequel and
Hadoop project something we call
internally big sequel this is the
ability to access data on Hadoop using
Oracle sequel engine and feel sequel so
you can reach out to data that can be in
a Hadoop cluster but simply program it
using the language that you're familiar
using so why is that important it allows
every person who knows how to write
Oracle's sequel to be able to access all
your data and Hadoop whether that
structured data or unstructured data so
we're bringing together in a single
programming language the ability to
access and evolve the capability in the
relational database improving speed up
and data access performance with calumny
as well as broadening out to
unstructured data and the second thing
you will hear about here at open world
is a lot of new capability we're
introducing so in the no sequel world
which is traditionally focused on key
value oriented paradigms we're actually
introducing table oriented
representations so you can access data
that sits in the Oracle no sequel system
what
tabular representation and over time you
can program against it using the same
language constructs you familiar with we
are also adding JSON in the database
this is a lot of people have wanted us
to be able to to build applications
decoupling the client in JavaScript or
in a mobile application framework and
accessing data from the Oracle database
/ rest but having JSON as a model to
separate the client and server well when
you've got JSON as that intermediary
format you need to persist that data
somewhere you need to persist your JSON
is somewhere and we're going to provide
the ability to both access data services
in the Oracle database using rest and
also persist data in the Oracle database
using JSON and so there's a lot of new
capability we're introducing to allow
our developer community to exploit the
capabilities of sequel and Peele sequel
and bring these technologies forward
bringing it to support new programming
models like restful api s javascript in
json we're also evolving the
infrastructure that supports our
developer community with a new developer
program focused to people who know
sequel and Peele sequel and modernizing
their understanding of all the things
they can do with the Oracle product
portfolio the Oracle database are no
sequel solution or Hadoop solution and
building applications in JavaScript and
JSON using sequel and Peele sequel so
that's why we're having this new yes
sequel celebration at oracle openworld
and it's the first step in revitalizing
this community and bringing them to
understand all of the capabilities and
all of the investments were making in
these two very important technologies so
I hope you enjoy the celebration I hope
you enjoy the community that we have and
we're building and I hope you understand
most importantly the commitment that
Oracle has to these technologies and the
power that these technologies will give
you as we go
or thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
