welcome to enterprise manager cloud
control 12c video series in this series
we will learn how to deploy and hybrid
cloud a agent on Oracle cloud before we
deploy an hybrid cloud agent we should
understand the architecture of the
hybrid cloud management there are three
components that we need to understand
and they are the hybrid cloud gateway
agent the hybrid cloud agent the hybrid
cloud gave me proxy the hybrid cloud
gateway agent is a regular Enterprise
Manager agent that creates a bridge to
one or more hybrid cloud agents it is
created by converting an on-premise
enterprise manager to act of hybrid
cloud gateway so you created through an
e/m CLI command EMC alive register
hybrid gateway agent and you would
specify the enterprise manager agent and
once this is done it will be created as
a hybrid cloud a free agent the next
component the hybrid cloud agent is
deployed on or to club its functionality
is the following a whole premise OMS
initiates request to the hybrid cloud
region using HTTP tunneling over secure
shop the hybrid cloud agent on Oracle
cloud talks to the on-premise OEMs why
are a local proxy that routes request
back to on-premise OMS through secure
shell tunnel the age at OMS
communication tab is created by the
hybrid cloud gateway the third component
the hybrid cloud gave me proxy the proxy
runs on the hybrid cloud agent and the
process is initiated by the gateway
agent now that we have learned the three
components now let's see
how to deploy and hybrid cloud agent on
Club to deploy an agent it is very
simple click on setup add target ad
targets manually and click on an hose
and now i'm going to click on the Add
icon now you need to specify either the
IP address or the hosting of a virtual
machine on or become so how do I get it
so whenever you create a service either
a database service or a Java service on
the Oracle cloud what you would get is
an IP address so here I have an IP
address and by creating a database
service and I'm going to use that IP
address and deploy the hybrid cloud
agent and i'm going to select the
platform and i'm going to click on the
next button now it wants me that i have
specified an IP address so i'm going to
click on ok I'm going to ignore this and
click on ok and I'm going to click on
the next button now you have to specify
the installation base directory so this
is very similar to deploy a regular or
agent on the Orca public cloud the
software by default is installing the
slash u01 directory now I would like my
hybrid cloud agent to be deployed or
install under you 01 @ agent directory
now i am going to specify the name
credential on the Auto Club so the name
credential here is a search based
prudential which I created earlier now
you have a new option in the enterprise
manager trololo 5 release which is
configured hybrid cloud agent
since I want to install as a hybrid
cloud agent I'm going to check this box
and you get two options one is it will
ask you for the hybrid cloud gateway
agent now i'm going to pick the hybrid
cloud gateway agent this was created
earlier to the e/m CLI command so i'm
going to pick that hybrid cloud it get
me agent and the hybrid cloud get me
proxy for by default it is 1748 if this
port is occupied used by some other than
processes then you have you can leave it
blank and the system will select any
port between 1830 and 1849 so I'm here
I'm going to accept default and I'm
going to click on Next button so that
leads us to the review page so I'm going
to review the details and I'm going to
click on deploy agent since the agent is
already deployed on this box and where
to click on cancel this concludes this
