curriculum developer here at Oracle in
this demonstration I'll show you how to
secure Oracle service bus services this
is part two of a three part series on
Oracle service bus security here's the
setup for this demonstration which you
saw in the introduction to this series
in this demonstration we're going to
configure the keystore create a
credential key for Joe and secure the
proxy service with the OWS M username
token service policy so let's get
started first we'll configure the
keystore using Oracle Enterprise Manager
here we are on the home page for the
service bus domain let's go to the
WebLogic domain menu and select security
security provider configuration down
near the bottom you see this key store
section let's expand it let's scroll
down and let's configure this you can
see that the key store type is Java key
store which is what we want we don't
need to change the key store path as I
place the default key store jks file in
the domains config fnw config directory
and will enter the keystore password and
now let's set up the default identity
certificates for this key store for the
signature key we'll enter a key of or a
key and a password and we'll also set up
the encryption key with a crypt alias of
or a key and a password so now we're
done and here you see the message that
the key store has been configured
successfully
after configuring the keys door you need
to restart the service bus server for
the change to take effect I won't show
that in this demonstration now we'll add
a credential key for Joe so that the
client in this case the service bus test
console can look up his user name and
password and send it to the proxy
servers so now back on the OSB domain
we'll go to the WebLogic domain menu but
this time we'll select security
credentials and let's create a key we're
going to add the key to the Oracle WSM
security map this map and a set of keys
are already provided as part of the
keystore file the default key store jks
that we configured earlier will call the
new key Joe key and the type is password
now we'll enter Joe's credentials his
username Joe and his password and of
course these must match what was used
when this user was created so let's
finish up and you see the message that
the key was created now if we expand
this Oracle WSM security you see the new
key for Joe now that we've set up the
key store for the domain and the key for
Joe our next task is to secure the proxy
servers by attaching the username token
service policy to it here we are in the
service bus console and first let's
start a new session now we edit this
proxy service validation for CC proxy to
add the owsn username token service
policy to it we configure policies by
going to the policies page
and here you see no policies are defined
we're going to use the policy from the
owsn policy store so we'll select that
and then add it here you see all of the
policies that we could add from the owsn
store let's go to page two and we're
going to choose the username token
service policy and submit and now we can
see it listed as a service level policy
so we'll update and here you can see the
proxy was updated successfully
so now we'll activate our changes and
enter a description and submit so now
let's test the proxy service to ensure
the username token policy is in place
we'll launch the test console for the
validation for CC proxy and we'll enter
a valid credit card number and if we
scroll down you'll see the security
section and you can see the policy we
attached which is the username token
client policy the property is CS F key
which is the credential key and we're
going to override the default value with
the credential key that we previously
created for Joe which was Joe key let's
move this up and we'll execute it let's
scroll down and look at the response and
we can see a valid response which
indicates that the service was
successfully invoked so that's it for
part two of our series on securing
oracle service bus services
