the ability to compare a property value
from one streaming event with a
subsequent property value from another
event and then determine over a defined
time period that the second value has
not occurred you can imagine a
circumstance when a pressure valve opens
but should automatically close after 10
seconds if this process does not occur
it could have serious ramifications this
pattern will identify this type of
situation and facilitate an immediate
response first we'll give this pattern a
name determine value status pattern we
provide a description and one or more
tags the a not followed by B pattern
requires the following parameters event
stream event stream is a previously
created event data stream of shapes in
which properties are flowing that need
this pattern determination these streams
for example can originate from actuators
which is a type of motor that is
responsible for moving or controlling a
mechanism or system partition criteria
is generally the unique identifier in
the stream
such as the device or actuator code or
name state a field is the name of the
primary property column shape in the
stream state a value is the actual value
to compare such as the text open etc
state B field is the name of the
secondary property column or shape name
in the stream
State B value is the actual value to
compare such as the text closed etc
duration is a time period to wait before
an output event shape is published
related to the pattern match criteria
the range is between nanoseconds to
hours
once the a not followed by B patent
parameters have been specified the
patent expiration immediately and
continuously execute and after the time
period duration has elapsed it will
indicate at the event shape or shapes
that has satisfied the property state
change that has not occurred
