from an FTP location to your ERP cloud
service Oracle integration cloud service
or ICS now includes the new
orchestration pattern which allows the
execution of business processes and
long-running runtime activities in this
integration data from a secure FTP is
sent to ICS for orchestration and then
it's uploaded to ERP cloud the data is
pulled from the SFTP location by using a
trigger file mechanism ICS schedules the
orchestration flow for pulling a trigger
file it also has the capability to unzip
and decrypt files the file is staged in
ICS the zip file may contain multiple
files and each file may have multiple
records because of this a for each loop
is needed to process each file and
record and to enrich or transform the
data before it's written to a new file
for ERP cloud once the new ERP file is
ready it's uploaded by the ERP cloud
adapter in ICS the adapter invokes the
ERP import service and specifies a
callback the data loading and processing
start on the ERP endpoint
additionally ICS allows the definition
of callbacks a callback receives logs
and errors encrypts them and sends them
through the FTP adapter let's build this
integration in ICS the connections to
the ERP and FTP endpoints are already
configured on the integrations page a
new pattern for orchestration is
available when creating integrations all
configured endpoints are available on
the invokes panel here the FTP endpoint
is configured with a file name pattern
to read a trigger file from the FTP
location a schema is defined from a CSV
file which has the format of the trigger
file a new actions panel is available to
add activities to integrations the
assign activity is defined to declare
the set of variables the expression
builder allows setting values for each
variable by using functions
for example to extract the zip file name
from a relative path to download and
stage the file temporarily in ICS an FTP
endpoint is configured from the invoke
panel by using the download to ICS
operation the input and download
directories are specified along with the
unzip option map actions are
automatically generated every time new
endpoints or stage file actions are
added to the integration in this case
the mapping sets the extracted zip file
name the zip file may contain multiple
files for each actions enable iterating
over a repeating element to read each
file from the input directory in ICS a
stage file action is configured to
specify details like file name and
directory by using the expression
builder the schema format is also
specified by loading a CSV file that
contains the data structure when a file
is staged in ICS another for each action
is required to iterate through each file
record it's time to transform and enrich
the data by adding a stage file action
to write each record into a new file the
expression builder is used once again to
set the file name and output directory
all the enriched data is appended to the
existing file in this case the schema
format for the new ERP file uses the
same data structure as the source file
the data mapping and transformation are
performed in the map action functions
operators and XSL elements are useful to
enrich and transform the new file for
ERP once the new file is ready a stage
file action is configured to write a
manifest file with the business data
details
the map activity allows the definition
of the manifest content once the new
file for ERP is built a staged file
action allows recipient for sending it
to the ERP cloud endpoint just as before
the expression builder is used to
concatenate the zip file name
finally the ERP endpoint is added to
import the data into the financials
cloud application the operation to
perform in the target Oracle ERP
application is import payable invoices
once the data loading and processing are
complete an email notification needs to
be triggered the callback is also
defined to retrieve more details about
any failed records the file references
for the ERP endpoint are defined in the
map action so the ERP system processes
the result file accordingly after
activating this integration the activity
stream can be monitored from the runtime
health page where the activity stream
and diagnostic logs are available for
download thank you for watching to learn
