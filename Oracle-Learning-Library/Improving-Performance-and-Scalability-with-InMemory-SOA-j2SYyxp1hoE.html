of your solo composite applications
would you like to avoid disk reads and
writes and leverage the coherence cache
and Sola Oracle so sweet 12 to 1 offers
a new in-memory so a feature that
greatly improves performance and
database maintenance reduces database
growth rate and allows better scaling of
the cluster it enables short running
processes to live in memory and memory
Sola provides the ability to run
synchronous and asynchronous instances
in memory by leveraging WebLogic
coherence these instances can live in
memory and get written to the database
only when faulted or at regular
intervals using a right behind thread to
configure processes for in-memory
execution there are three simple steps
to perform design the process to be non
transactional set the persistence flag
at the component level and turn on the
in-memory flag in Enterprise Manager
Oracle JDeveloper 12c allows processes
to be designed as non-transactional by
adding the BPL config transaction
property as not supported to each of the
BPL processes to handle the consequences
of no transaction the BPL process may
require the fault handling to be changed
before deploying the in-memory enabled
application in the same way set the
persistence flag at the component level
by adding the beep l dot config dot
completion persist policy property as
faulted so that only faulted
transactions are persisted to the
database immediately once composite
applications have been configured for
in-memory execution a SAR file is
created and deployed by using Enterprise
Manager to a so a domain that's enabled
to execute process in memory as the
administrator on the Enterprise Manager
sulle infrastructure sella
administration common properties page
clicking advanced configuration
properties opens the M beam page where
the in memory environment property is
set to true after the in-memory flag is
enabled and applied to the environment
the in-memory application instances
aren't visible in the flow instances
page
unless they faulted have been dehydrated
programmatically or due to application
logic if any in memory instances have
faulted as administrator recover them
from the flow trace page or by using the
normal error Hospital recovery processes
that enable bulk recovery to summarize
the key steps to enable the in memory
feature are the developer modifies the
application to set the required in
memory and transactional properties by
using JDeveloper the developer generates
an application SAR file that's deployed
to the sella domain by the sella
administrator and the so administrator
turns on the in-memory flag in Oracle
Enterprise Manager for more information
