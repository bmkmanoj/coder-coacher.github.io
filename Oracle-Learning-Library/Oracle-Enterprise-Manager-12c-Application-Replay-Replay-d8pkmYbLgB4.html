Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 12c
demo series the first part of this
demonstration showed you how to capture
a workload now the second part of the
demonstration shows you how to replay
you captured workload assuming the test
system has been setup and production
URLs remapped appropriately to that of
the steth system we can start a replay
from the application replay homepage
click replay task tab as you can see
there is an existing replay task called
replay one which is already selected
let's have a look at this replay task
you can see that multiple replays exist
for this task let's select one and then
click create like to create a similar
replay this involves the exact same
steps as if you were creating one from
scratch specify a name for the replay
which must be unique you can optionally
enter a description then review the
prerequisite information and acknowledge
the checkboxes to indicate they have
been met once ready click Next you could
select the system that represents your
test system against which the capture
should be replayed here it is already
pre-selected review the studies of your
system components and ensure they are
all available before starting your
replay once ready click Next specify the
credentials of the Select storage host
then click Next the application replay
clients are automatically deploy on the
replay hosts the number of clients is
automatically determined but
could add more hosts for large workloads
and specify for each of them the number
of clients bone to drive the workload in
addition you can also specify your
storage location accessible by all
clients to stage the captured data to be
replayed as well as to stall the replay
results once done click Next specify
whether database synchronization should
be enabled during replay since we did
not perform a database replay capture
for this workload the database
synchronized replay is disabled click
Next specify the URL mappings that
should be used during the replay that is
how the urls encountered during capture
should be substitute when we play within
the test environment this is an
important step you want to make to point
to the test system click Next Rui can be
configured to omit the logging of
sensitive information such as password
credit card details and so on from being
recorded on disk because the values of
these fields is not recorded they need
to be explicitly specified for replay
application replay allows one password
for all users and all users should exist
on the test system click Next specify
whether the replay should progress at
the same rate as the original capture or
at an alternative rate in the custom
case you need to specify the appropriate
session start time scale Fink time scale
and whether the request rate should be
maintained at the original rate once
done click Next
specify when the replay should start
here it will be immediately and then
click Next the summary of the plan
replay is displayed verify that your
system components are up and running
look at the replay clients information
your database synchronization URL
mappings data masking information
scheduling and you can also look at the
advanced replay configuration once done
click Submit you can now see your replay
is in progress you can refresh this page
until completion however here because
other replays were already performed we
will not wait and look at a completed
one to analyze its results the results
tab provides more detailed information
about divergence this includes a
comparison of page performance during
the original capture and the replay and
the application pages that experience
the highest diversions let's look at the
page analysis the page analysis section
allows you to analyze each application
page across selected metrics for capture
and replay now let's have a look at the
divergence page the divergence section
allows you to view information
restricted to specific divergence type
such as access server network and
content now let's look at the chart
section the chart section allows you to
view detail replay information across
specific metrics such as average page
load time maximum page load time as well
as details about the selected time
period and various metric information
you can also change the replay charts
for example click select matrix then
check the metric you want to add and
click OK as you can see the new metric
was added to the chart section these
concludes the demonstration thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
