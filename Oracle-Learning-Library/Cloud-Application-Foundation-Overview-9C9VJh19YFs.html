of the server technologies curriculum
group at Oracle my job is to teach
people about Oracle products and
technologies in this session we're going
to learn about Oracle's cloud
application foundation the cloud
application foundation consists of two
main technologies application servers
and cache servers these components fall
between your clients and your databases
and for that reason they're called
middleware first let's learn about
application servers let's say you've
just moved to a new area and you need a
place to live one option is for you to
build a whole new house from scratch and
your new house is going to need a
collection of different services like
water and electricity and the internet
and maybe even a security system
similarly let's say you're a programmer
who needs to build a new application
maybe this is an application for human
resources or it's an online store or a
trading system similar to building a
house if you created this whole
application from scratch there are
several potential complications first
you'd have to write the code to handle
all of the low-level incoming and
outgoing Network protocols for a website
that would mean HTTP and HTTPS your new
application likely also needs to connect
and talk to one or more databases so
you'll have to have some SQL knowledge
so that your app can actually get data
and update data in these databases
similarly you'll have to write code to
ensure data integrity that means that if
your code fails your databases aren't
left with incomplete or
data and don't forget about security
you'll need to verify a user's identity
and then make sure that they're
authorized to do the requested feature
now let's go back to our house example
sure you could put in all of the
required plumbing and wiring yourself
but that's going to mean a lot of
learning on your part a lot more
opportunities for errors and it's
definitely going to delay the completion
of your home instead consider an
apartment building none of the tenants
in an apartment building need to create
the necessary infrastructure to access
water sewer electricity the internet or
security why because it's already there
and none of the tenants care about how
this infrastructure got there only that
it works and it's reliable an
application server like Oracle WebLogic
server works in much the same way as the
apartment building WebLogic server
supports client protocols like HTTP and
soap and also provides other services
like database access and persistence and
transactions for data integrity and
security so a developer can just
concentrate on the interface and the
business logic of their application like
letting employees view their paycheck
stubs for example and let WebLogic take
care of the rest
let's revisit our multi tier
architecture once again next we'll learn
about another middleware component the
data cache so we're back at our
apartment building example suppose that
every time someone in this building
wants to borrow and watch a movie they
drive back and forth to a video store
that's located on the other side of town
if they want to watch a movie every day
this driving takes up a lot of time and
this is time that could be used to do
something more important like actually
watching the movie alternatively let's
say the same apartment complex had its
own digital video library with all the
most popular movies that all the tenants
could share at the same time this
approach eliminates the need to drive
somewhere every time you want to watch a
movie a distributed cache like oracle
coherence offers the same kind of
benefits as our convenient shared video
library for example consider a suite of
human resource applications running on
WebLogic all of which need access to
employee data sure each application
could retrieve this data from a database
each time it was needed but a more
efficient approach would be to instead
cache the employee profiles in memory
since retrieving data in memory is much
faster than retrieving it from a
database distributed caching offers the
same benefits to other types of shared
data perhaps there are several
applications that work with stock quotes
calculating stock prices is an expensive
operation and there's no need for every
application to recalculate the values
every time they're needed once again a
central in-memory cache like coherence
can offer a more efficient solution
next we'll address the issue of
scalability which is the idea that you
can easily distribute a software system
across machines without redesigning the
system or modifying your code suppose we
have a single instance of WebLogic
server that's hosting our application
along with a single instance of
coherence both WebLogic and coherence
support clustering technologies so that
you can quickly and seamlessly scale up
or down your system as performance
requirements change these clusters also
avoid a single point of failure in
addition WebLogic and coherence clusters
can be scaled independently of one
another some types of applications may
require more computing power and others
may require more memory as they're
scaled up WebLogic and coherence are the
main pillars of Oracle's cloud
application foundation this means that
they form the backbone of all of
Oracle's leading-edge products this
includes general-purpose middleware
solutions like service-oriented
architecture identity management data
integration and Enterprise Management
and also includes business solutions
like human capital management customer
relationship management supply chain
management and financials and it's even
the engine behind Oracle's new cloud
computing solutions such as
infrastructure as a service so if this
foundation is good enough to run
Oracle's entire portfolio of products
then it's certainly good enough to run
your own custom applications as well if

products or their underlying
technologies be sure to visit us online
