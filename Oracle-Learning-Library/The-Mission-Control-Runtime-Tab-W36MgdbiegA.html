the runtime tab group from Mission
Control and we can see here that I have
the system tab pulled up to start we
have a processor chart at the top seen
that before we have a GVM statistics
table right here in the middle and then
we have a systems property table at the
bottom of this is a searchable table so
let's take a quick look at that I'm
going to go in here and let's hide that
one and I can do very searches so these
are the standard system properties that
you find in any JVM so let's say I want
to search for keys that begin with Java
I can do java star you can see they're
all the various system properties that
start with Java are listed just by doing
that basic web filtering it a little bit
I could also do for example the AWT I
could do a star awt star and then
anything that has that those three
letters and it shows up so in addition
to just regular wildcard searches I can
also do regular expression searches so
if i do Reggie XP colon then now I'm
doing a regular expressions expression
search so if i do the same thing in
regular expression so I Do's dot star
awt star then I get the the four values
that I had before from doing a wildcard
search so you can see very powerful I
can do very similar a lot of stuff so
any table that's similar that has a
search option you can do the user
regular expression or wild tread search
let's get rid of that data now i'm going
to go ahead and look at the other tabs
the next tab is the memory tab and this
shows this has a chart of the heat
memory at the top we have some g vm
memory statistics here and then some
system statistics shown below so pretty
standard stuff
I'm going to go ahead and look at the
garbage collection tab next and then
that shows a table with young generation
so we can see here that this JVM has
been up a while 21 minutes and it has
done 228 young generation collections
and then this is old generation
collections we have four and it shows
the time at the top for eat you know the
collection time for each each one the
next tab is memory pool and that just
shows that the various pools your
standard garbage collection areas and
the usage percentage here in this column
max used peak all that stuff and all
these columns are sortable so if I want
to sort by max I can just do that or go
back to usage or however you want to
sort it so that's cool that's standard
most tables once again it this one could
be filtered like we did the earlier one
finally we have the threads tab you can
see here this is groupings of threads
that are running on the system and so
it's just your standard you know number
it's the state blocked count things like
that notice here we have some checkboxes
so we can look dive in a little deeper
and I've got I'm going to go ahead and
turn on cpu profiling and just be aware
that you this can be a little intrusive
so there it could have some performance
impact on your running vm if you do turn
some of these options on so i'm going to
go ahead and click that and i can see
the event queue thread is the one
getting the most using the most cpu time
I can also see if any of the threads are
deadlocked that doesn't look like there
are and then I finally can turn on
allocation which will show me which
thread is taking up the most memory so
if I start that I can see it's still the
event queue so pretty straightforward
you can once again everything sortable
you can also click on it and see the
stack trace related to that
our event to see what's going on by line
with that particular thread so that's it
for the runtime tab group</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
