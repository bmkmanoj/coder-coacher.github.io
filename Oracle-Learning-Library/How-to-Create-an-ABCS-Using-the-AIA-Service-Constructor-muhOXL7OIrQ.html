principal curriculum developer here at
Oracle in this demonstration I'll show
you how to create an application
business connector service
what ABC is using that aia service
constructor in JDeveloper will create a
new application and we'll call it credit
card validation will ensure generic
application is selected and click finish
now we'll create a new project and
Dauntless old technologies page we'll
select projects and AI a service
component project this brings up the AI
a service constructor the first step is
to select the service solution component
request that was entered in project
lifecycle workbench by the solution
architect so we'll click this import
service component request button here
we're going to connect to the AAA
lifecycle management database so we need
to choose that database connection and
here we'll choose the database
connection that I created earlier and
JDeveloper to the AIA lifecycle database
and we'll confirm our database selection
and now you see the eligible service
solution component requests this expand
this left-hand column and let's select
this request for a provider ABC s for
the credit card validation business task
on this service description page you now
see the information entered by the
solution architect for the service
solution component in project lifecycle
workbench will accept these values this
service details page defines details
about the participating application as
well as the service that's been created
you see some values that are already
populated from project lifecycle
workbench the product code of the
application the industry which is core
and the service type which is a provider
ABC s listen to the rest will make the
participating application name a user
friendly name to describe the service
credit card validation service the
system code will make a a a demo c cv o
1 the application short name is just a
short code to quickly identify assets
the service operation or the verb of the
service is process and since this is the
first version we'll into one for service
version on the service object page we
define the type of message that this ABC
s will receive here we're defining a
provider ABC s and provider ABC SS are
invoked by enterprise business messages
or EBM s which are routed by Enterprise
Business Services or EBS EBS have
published wisdoms
so the service constructor can inspect
the service and auto populate variables
for us so let's click the select service
operation button and since a IA EBS
wisdoms are published
MDS will do a search and will select the
resource pallet and navigate down into
the AIA
MDS connection into the Enterprise
Business Service library core eb o
and here we're going to choose the
received payment EBS now the service
constructor reads the wisdom and
provides you with a list of available
operations and we'll choose process
credit card authorization now back on
the service object page you can see that
the service constructor has inspected
the service and operation and has
automatically populated the attributes
that make up the interface of this
service such as namespace input now put
messages message exchange pattern and so
on so let's continue and similarly on
the service object fault details page
the fault information is also auto
populated we will accept the defaults
derived from the EBS wisdom and continue
now on this target service details page
we'll define the details for the target
service this provider ABC s will invoke
in this case to validate the credit card
will invoke the credit authorization
service from the AIA demo application so
let's find the wisdom for this service
we use the resource palette and again go
down into the AIA
MDS connection
into the application object library AI a
demo version one wisdoms and let's
select this credit authorization service
wisdom know that typically you wouldn't
upload a concrete was built to MDS but
it's done in this case for easy access
in the aaaa demo application and we're
going to use the authorized credit
operation now back on the target service
details page the service constructor has
inspected the service and operation and
pre-populated nearly all of the
attributes we just need to set the
object name to credit card and note that
by default all the old auto populated
fields are not editable if for some
reason you need to change any of these
fields select this enable with still
define fields to make them editable if
you wish you can go to options which
allows you to configure various target
service options the composite
application validation service or Cav's
and reference list or creation are
enabled by default if an extension
service is used you can enable it here
in this case we'll use the defaults on
this target service fault details will
also accept the default values that were
supplied automatically by the service
operation inspection on the service
options page we'll set the runtime
location of the AIA async error handling
people process service
here I'm pasting the actual runtime end
point location value we're not adding an
extension service nor creating a custom
fault policy and that's all we need to
do so let's finish up
and now JDeveloper is generating this so
a composite and here we see the
generated composite in the composite
overview you can see the exposed service
the external references to the error
handler and the credit authorization
service and in the middle is the
generated people for the ABC s the final
task is to compile the composite will
right-click the project and select make
and let's scroll down and ensure there
are no errors and that the build was
successful so that's it for creating an
ABC s using the aia service constructor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
