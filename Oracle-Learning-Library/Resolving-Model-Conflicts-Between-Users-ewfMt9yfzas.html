resolve modeling conflicts between users
from the user one session we're going to
make a change to the customer table so
we're going to add a column and we'll
change the name of that column to be
cussed comments and specify a type for
that column so I'm going to a bar chart
256 and then save that change we want to
save these changes to our local copy so
we're going to say Save Changes and
you'll notice that there are two
outgoing changes we now want to switch
over to user to and make some changes so
we're going to go ahead and double click
on the customer table again and add a
different column this time we'll go
ahead and add a column for created date
and specify a data type of date and
click OK we went to save this change to
our local copy so we're going to save
the model and then let's go review the
changes that we just made so we'll go
ahead and double click on customers
identified change and scroll down again
the left is your repository the right is
the local copy so we're going to go
ahead and save these changes into the
subversion repository so the changes
have been made so now we're going to
switch back to user 1 and we're going to
refresh the incoming changes and you'll
notice that we have some changes that
are in red it indicates that there's
been a conflict so if I double click on
the customers conflict and take a look
at that conflict you'll see that the
plus sign indicates that the creative
date is in the repository it's going to
be added and we want to deselect the
cost comments deletion that's going to
take place and click merge and so what
we've done here is we've added the
created date to our local copy but we
also did
not delete that so it's still in our
local copy and now we want to go ahead
and commit the change that we made for
cust comments into the repository so
that everything is in there now so we
specify a comment click OK and now both
of the columns from both of the users
have been added to the subversion
repository you have just learned how to
resolve model conflicts between users</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
