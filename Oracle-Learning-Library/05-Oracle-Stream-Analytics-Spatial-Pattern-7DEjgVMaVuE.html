to implement geoprocessing analytics
using a combination of geofences define
polygon areas on a map and a stream of
events that includes a specific
reference object that can uniquely
identify a common data value and
location-based GPS information
specifically the longitude and latitude
of a point using a spatial pattern you
can instantly execute a visual
representation exploration of the
selected moving objects and receive
generated event data shapes that will
show the relationship of the object to
its associated map locations first we
give a name to this spatial pattern next
we give a description
next we provide tags these can be used
to search the catalog and we press the
create button the spatial pattern
requires the following parameters map is
a previously created artifact of defined
locations required for the solution this
can be bus train stations gas stations
airports emergency services regions of
fire or natural disasters or constantly
moving areas such as weather conditions
the event stream is a previously created
event data stream of events that provide
location based movement objects
the stream provides the
latitude/longitude and object key
attributes as part of the provided data
depending on the semantics of the
solution the tracking events criteria
for the spatial analytics can be
specified which determine the type of
movement event status properties
generated near will generate status
properties by an event when the movement
of the identified objects is within a
specified distance enter will generate
status properties for an event when the
movement of the identified objects falls
within the bounds of a defined location
exit will generate status properties for
an event when the movement of the
identified objects leaves the boundary
of a defined location and stay will
generate status properties for an event
when the movement of the identified
objects remains within the boundaries of
a defined location for a specific time
period
now you can select the required
geographic coordinate system which can
generally remain as the default this
coordinate system enables every location
on the earth to be specified by a set of
numbers or letters or symbols
you
to complete the parameters for the
spatial pattern a distance value should
be specified in relation to the
selection of the near option
you
and the time period should be specified
in relation to the selection of the stay
option to indicate how long the
identified objects should remain within
the boundaries of a defined location
you
once the spatial pattern parameters have
been specified the patent expiration
immediately execute and shows the
individual movement events and an
addition shows generated event
properties for their object such as
status that represents its relationship
to define locations
the results are shown in a tabular
format and any numeric properties in the
event stream are represented in the
available charts
