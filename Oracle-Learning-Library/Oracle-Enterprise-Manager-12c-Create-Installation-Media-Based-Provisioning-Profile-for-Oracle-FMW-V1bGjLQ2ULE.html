Cloud Control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I will show how Oracle
Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c can
help you to ensure that future Oracle
Fusion Middleware installations and
configurations adhere to best practices
and standards in your IT organization
Oracle Enterprise Manager accomplishes
this by enabling administrators to
create gold images of Oracle Fusion
Middleware software these gold images
can be stored as provisioning profiles
in a centralized location or in what
Enterprise Manager refers to as the
software library these provisioning
profiles can then be leveraged as the
source for future provisioning or
cloning operations being able to
provision or clone from a provisioning
profile simplifies the installation
process and ensures that the Oracle
Fusion Middleware software being
installed across your data center meets
IT standards
Oracle Enterprise Manager supports
creation of three different types of
provisioning profiles the first type is
a WebLogic domain based provisioning
profile a WebLogic domain based
provisioning profile includes the
weblogic server software installed in
the oracle homes for a domain as well as
the configuration of that domain this
type of provisioning profile requires a
source domain that has already been
installed perhaps has already been
patched configured and discovered as a
managed target in Oracle Enterprise
Manager at a very high level this type
of provisioning profile takes a copy of
the existing domains Oracle homes
including binaries and patches as well
as its domain configuration and stores
all of that in the software library this
type of provisioning profile would be
leveraged when administrators need to
both install weblogic server software as
well as configure a new WebLogic domain
the second type of provisioning profile
is an oracle home based provisioning
profile an oracle home based
provisioning profile includes just the
oracle home in which weblogic server
software has been installed this type of
provisioning profile requires a source
oracle home that has already been
installed perhaps has already been
patched and discovered as a managed
target in Oracle Enterprise Manager at a
very high level this type of
provisioning profile takes a copy of the
existing Oracle home including binaries
and applied patches and stores that in
the software library this type of
provisioning profile would be leveraged
when administrators need to install just
the weblogic server software but they do
not need to configure a new a logic
domain the third type of provisioning
profile is an installation media based
provisioning profile an installation
media based provisioning profile enables
administrators to perform first time
installation of Oracle WebLogic server
software and first time configuration of
a WebLogic domain this type of
provisioning profile requires
administrators to have already
downloaded Oracle WebLogic server
software from Oracle
either downloaded from edelivery or the
Oracle technology Network at a very high
level this type of provisioning profile
takes a copy of the installation media
used for installation and configuration
for instance the weblogic server 12 12
jar file for the weblogic server 12 12
release and stores that archive file in
the software library this type of
provisioning profile would be leveraged
when administrators want to perform
first time installation of illogic
server in cases where they may not
already have an existing domain
installed and configured or do not wish
to clone from a provisioning profile
based upon an existing domain to create
any of these three types of profiles
will log into the console as an
administrator with a provisioning
designer role granted to him or her then
we'll navigate to the enterprise menu
provisioning and patching sub menu and
then select the middleware provisioning
menu item the middleware provisioning
page provides a summary of all the
middleware related provisioning profiles
stored in the software library and the
summary of all the middleware related
deployment procedures available to the
administrator we are logged in as from
the profiles region at the top of the
page we can access the create drop-down
menu to expose the three types of
provisioning profiles we can create in
the software library for the purposes of
this demonstration we will create a
profile from installation media
specifically we want to create a
provisioning profile that contains
installation media for the 12 12 release
of weblogic server I've already
downloaded the jar file for the 12 12
release of weblogic server from
edelivery so we can go ahead and
continue creating the software library
component now in order to create this
profile we'll give it a name and a
description so when we refer back to
this profile we know exactly what the
profile contains generic weblogic server
12 12 jar file will select weblogic
store
ever as the product notice here that
other fusion middleware software is also
supported will select generic platform
as the platform and will select version
12 12 as the version notice here that a
variety of versions are also supported
now we have to specify the host where
the weblogic server 12 12 jar file has
already been downloaded to then we have
to specify credentials for that host now
we can specify where on that host target
the weblogic server jar file resides and
select the directory in which it resides
notice how enterprise manager found to
jar files in that directory since we
want our profile to contain generic
weblogic server 12 12 only we will
remove the jar file that contains
weblogic server and the jrf we will
accept the default software library
upload location this is the location
where the archive file will be uploaded
to and stored having provided all the
necessary inputs to create the
installation media based provisioning
profile we can now click the Create
button from here we can then track
progress of creation currently the
procedure to create the profile is in
scheduled status however we can choose
to have this page automatically refresh
every 30 seconds so we can track the
procedures progress more closely
reviewing the page we can see the
various steps involved in creating the
provisioning profile steps such as
initializing the procedure creating the
profile component and uploading the
archive file we can obtain further
details on these steps by selecting a
specific step and reviewing the details
and output from the step on the right
hand side of the page it looks like the
procedure to create the provisioning
profile in the software library has
completed successfully let's return to
the middleware provisioning page to view
the newly created profile here we can
see the newly created provisioning
profile we can click on the profiles
name in order to view additional details
on the profile details such as who
created the profile when the profile was
created the profiles product details as
well as exactly what archived files were
uploaded for this profile with the
installation media based provisioning
profile creation completed and verified
we can now use this profile as the
source from which to provision future
oracle weblogic server software so that
concludes this demonstration thanks for
watching how to use Oracle Enterprise
Manager cloud control 12c for creating
an installation media based provisioning
profile for Oracle WebLogic server using
this capability simplifies the
installation process and ensures that
the Oracle Fusion Middleware software
being installed across your data center
meets IT standards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
