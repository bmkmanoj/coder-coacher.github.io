a huge talk to you about web development
using scallop wicked and java ee first
introducing myself i I've been working
with Java since 2000 I like to speak at
conferences mostly in Brazil because I
cannot afford four tickets myself but
but I could I could go to attach econ a
few times and it was great I used to
evangelize for Apache KML and apache
wicked yesterday I gave him an Apache
camo talk which brought some attention
on twitter if someone was there you know
why i joined the Oracle recently which
it's kind of weird being talking about
patchy frameworks but uh those thoughts
were proposed before and join the
company I look at some pollo have a
golden fever marriage yeah I am a
high-current gamer I like to hike when
I'm not playing video games so the
agenda here is about web development but
I don't know who here were at this mech
down on Monday night led by Marcus none
of you okay so that there was there was
a Smackdown for web frameworks they had
like play javaserver faces and so on but
no wicked okay I'm gonna give you an
overview about wicked if you humming of
you do not know week it okay cool
alright i'm also going to introduce you
a little bit about scholar and how to
use color to build a dynamic specific
language at the main specific language
for web development and how to use the
Java EE platform to get all the
resources order the thing is that we
need like database connections male
session answer
and I'll introduce you to a project that
I've been working on it's called bimbo
it's actually a maven archetype to use
all that stuff together so starting with
web development is there any web
designer here designer just designer No
okay so there's this fight between web
designers and web developers you know
web developers they like to call you web
designers like to design they have a
different mindset on their minds they
use different tools different methods
different processes so thinking about
the designing process of a web designer
we see they use white framing to like
balsamic then they go to the photoshop
and they draw the page they drown how
it's going to look like but just an
image of the page and then they do what
we call that a Tamiya HTML and slicing
they slice the image into pieces of of
jpg s and CSS and all that stuff then
they actually build the HTML so we get
the prototype of the website if you go
to like template monster.com you get a
lot of templates just HTML so what else
they do they preview in the browser that
HTML you know how many of you have
worked with starts before what happens
when you change the HTML with threats
the designer cannot preview in the
browser anymore right so thinking about
all also thinking about all that stuff I
came up with these design processes I
think about websites being billed by
different to turn using two types of
designing process one is bottled up when
you have the functional requirements
like a page with panel on the left a
menu a navigation bar form database with
crud
so you come from the data and then you
start building an app which is quite
good for java 7 faces for instance or
Orrico EDF or any framework that
connects to the data and you actually
build based on the data and then we have
top down the designer makes a prototype
and then we start mixing server-side
code or client code client-side code on
that HTML that's what i call the top
down because we came from that
functional prototype a very very pixel
perfect version of the website and then
we start adding server side stuff well I
came up I realized that there is no web
framework able to do both it's quite
impossible I mean productively speaking
it's impossible right you can do that
but it's not easy so then we have these
two differences between pixel perfect
websites and functional websites then
you because are thinking about those
marketing websites that it's like a call
for action for coca-cola something like
something like that so thinking about
pixel perfect websites the perfect
frameworks until now are basically PHP
Ruby on Rails and a Python or simply
JavaScript with rest which is really
good too for that what about function
websites well functional website again
they are bottled up designing strategy
and javaserver faces really good on that
GWT valdine wicked and a few others what
about pixel perfect websites in the Java
world we can use JSP and servlets we can
use a stretch to the tapestry wicked we
can use javaserver faces if we work more
with facelets we can use play lift and
so on
what if we could have a framework that
doesn't force us to totally modify the
work that the designer did prototyping
the other website so that's actually the
point of this talk here pixel perfect
websites are always top down you cannot
you cannot start like you can do in the
end have a peaks of perfect website
building button up from javaserver faces
for instance but your designer will have
a lot of work mixing CSS and so on on
the page and probably he will touch some
server-side codes and then the developer
will have to fix that and then you go
back and forth right it sucks so we have
actually two kinds of markup here we
have the imperative markup and the
declarative markup when they think about
imperative markups like struts do what's
try to do or what javaserver faces do
whatever framework PHP does that right
you have to put server-side code on the
page and screw everything up so what
happened when you do that you the
designer mrs. he lose the ability to
preview in the browser the prototype
that he made before and what happens if
he needs to change the layout of the
page he cannot do that change anymore
using the prototype he has to use the
actual modified page with all the server
side code in it and then you hope you
come back to all that thing about mixing
up server-side client-side code so what
about the collective work up we have
wicked we have tapestry we have isolates
and I don't know any other framework but
there might be someone out there what
those frameworks do is that they really
don't know change that much there are
some changes that can happen but the
concept of the framework is to actually
use the HTML as as it was during the
design process the prototyping process
so this way programmers and developers
they are happily ever after they can
work together one doing the layout the
other one doing the programming stuff
and the customers are happy to see
statically how the website is becoming
he can just work open the html5 it
doesn't have to run a server or even
that does the designer so uppish wicked
patch wicked is a framework that takes
an HTML like this one and then just
declaring which components will be
controlled by the service side framework
on the server side of the system to
manipulate the data to manipulate
attributes behaviors and so on but for
every time you have a page on a client
side on the HTML you have to have
server-side code so that's why we get
requires you to build a class Java class
to control although all that page and
those components that are in it so here
we have the class that follows the same
name as the HTML and it's a Java class
extending web page and in the
constructor we just add all the
components that we have declared on the
HTML file like a label or form lists and
boutons and so on for every component on
wicked you can attach a model and with
the model you can have dynamic data
being provided to that component so in
this case we have the user object as the
model for the form so whenever the
component name wants to display which
data it has to display it will say to
the compound property model there give
me the property name which is my name
for the component of the object so the
lake the taxi field for instance we'll
ask the model of the forum to
the name from the user and then it will
display that on the HTML the cool thing
about wicked is that it's easy to create
components it's like it's just Java and
if you want something serve a
client-side HTML or JavaScript you can
do that during pairing with HTML and
Java and some JavaScript on top of the
HTML so for instance you can do like a
google apps panel like this one with
those five lines actually the google
maps between the TV's optional is just
to say here will come up with the google
map component so if we want to build a
component and then share that with other
projects we just put that component in a
jar file and then the developer just
have to import and that's it okay so it
has a very close programming model with
the swing applications what else we have
a jquery it was recent applied by the
wicked team as the engine for
client-side JavaScript on the favor work
so all the core components that require
any JavaScript they're going to use the
aquarium we have page composition by
events or panels or borders so we can
have like that J map span over there
that's a panel so we can just plug in
whenever we want recently one of the
commuters added support for CDI and I
working last night I was just updating
my archetype to come up with their back
button support it has control for stage
the history of your page flow and and
lots of components there is a community
called wicked stuff where you can
provide it's on github you can use the
components over there or you can share
components it's really huge there are
more than 50 components in there the
scala component I've been contributing
to it with the scholar dsl language for
wicked so anybody here that feels
interested about the framework can join
the team on github it's just dropping
email at the mailing list and people
will give you access it scholar scholar
language so quick introduction it's
object-oriented it's functional and this
it is aesthetically typing it doesn't
seems to you but it is the compiler of
scholar is a little bit magical about
this so in this case we have foo equals
eight then we try to assign our string
and then we have a compile mismatch it
was on top of the JVM it is very
extensible if some of you are aware of
the paint my library pattern you can
easily extend the the course color
library with your own features how
however you want so that's why it's easy
to define dsl's so functions in scala we
have a the ability to exchange objects
that are actually functions that were
announced it was announced at the
keynote in java one here that we are
going to have lambda expressions in the
Java language so what you are seeing
here is basically what we will get on
Java 8 so it's it's quite cool song so
it looks like ugly at the beginning but
then you get used to it like JavaScript
callbacks some constructions its color
gives you the ability to seduce some
easy straightforward things that like
Ruby does so I want a leash of 129 I
just express them
email list of 129 and if I want to
iterate I just used it for each which
enables me to offer function to be
evaluated for each element that was one
of the demonstrations of the lambda
expressions in java at the keynote cool
things about our lists and maps here we
have to lease a B and three lists a B
and C is one to be three four and then
again if we put all together with least
see those double commas over there maps
in this case people say tend to think
that the numbers over here are the
indexes but they are actually the keys
of the map so you can use whatever you
want you can use a string or another
object so going back to weekend like I
said it we get the programming model of
Wicca is very similar to swing you'll
have to create panels add components to
them and override methods that will give
you behavior or event and so on so it
reminds of sweet swing we have to use a
lot of anonymous inner classes for
instance because of the listeners and
events which is quite good for a
functional programming model that's why
I think that we can we'll have a very
good I think if the usage of developers
of wicked will increase after Java 8
because I'm sure they will come up with
ideas to take advantage of lambda
expressions or closures because it is
easier to develop using that to override
the behaviors of components well until
there is color wins so the point between
integrating wicked and scholar in this
case is that we can move from a very
verbose class like this one and we can
just get few last lines in this case
it's the same class same functionality
same components but it has less code in
there now if we do the domain-specific
language for week eight using Scala we
got something like this which it's even
even less verbose and it's I think it's
easier to understand the code you just
have a form you declare components to it
you give them IDs and you give a
behavior for instance the form there it
gets a functional expression that it's
it calls the on submit method which will
call the service the stateless session
bean and then we'll update the data so
about java ee where it fits engines in
this case well java ee we can develop
using enterprise javabeans we can use a
CDI we can use GPA and JT a bean
validation in jax-rs those are the main
features of java ee that can be easily
used in web applications in this case
you know there are a lot of things like
indeed in this integration that I've
come up it comes with embedded plugin
for glassfish it comes already with a
data source configured for you so you
can work on jpa no more web.xml and this
column has this great feature it's
called beam property expression they
don't have to call any more Gators in
satyrs its color will generate that for
you the compiler will do that for you so
let's say I want to configure my
application the framework wicked on the
web container I just create these
scholar class with a few annotations and
then my application is able to be run on
the servlet container really no more
web.xml in this case in order
the weather's and setters if I have a
property like ID I just give the beam
property and then I get the gala geese a
tidy and so on so I can I can interrupt
between scholar and Java if I want if I
have to because in this case it is a
javabean pattern being applied to a
scholar class so oh sorry in this case
it's a trade it's a kind of an interface
in Java but it has the ability to to
offer default methods that are going to
be implemented in Java 8 again and it's
also can also be used to provide lots of
cool stuff it's hard to describe it's
not it's not easy we have to spin or
maybe 3-4 it slides on this but in here
what I'm doing is you know a user
extends identifiable identifiable will
have the ID attribute the primary key
and I'm going to add two more attributes
in this case name and email and it's
going to be an entity on jpa so putting
all these together what can we have you
can have an architecture for rapid up
web application development that I gave
the name of gumbo project so if you
follow that link you're going to end on
my github account at their gumbo a
project report story so you can you can
start working and see how it goes if you
if you think you can offer me some
feedbacks i can add the features that
you want what i'm going to show you is
about the gumbo archetype now at the
demo so the gumbo archetype comes with
the ecology yourself or wicked that is
part of the wicked stuff repository it
has three types of archetypes it comes
with java ee archetype one event
archetype a base archetype for spring
that it can be speeding
21 for mongodb and another one for
couchdb and the directory structure is a
little bit different from maven because
the point is to have a more simple
straightforward directory structure like
Ruby on Rails does like PHP can do so we
don't have to we don't need actually to
follow that made in convention these
case so these are the structure of the
Gamboa project that people get when they
actually create a project on this search
folder we just put all the color code
that we have on the config folder we
have the the domains dot XML at four
glassfish we have a few a few files for
properties if you if we want and we have
the templates for email sending for
sending emails using velocity it already
comes with velocity integrated in this
case so all the templates that you have
to send just putting this folder and
then you can easily use them yes not yet
that's a yeah so yeah I have I have a
few things on my road map that I'm
trying to catch up yeah no test folder
damn so sorry yeah I'm not very good on
tdd nice Adam there so on the layout
page on the layout folder we put all the
HTML and CSS and JavaScript then is the
folder that the designer will be working
on so the developerworks on source and
the designer works on layout so they can
open the HTML preview whatever they want
they do not have to touch on any server
side code and vice versa and we have the
Pollack's ml4 for maven so let me show
you one demo that I could make it work
few minutes ago here at the beginning
so here's the birthday project that I
created you see there is only source
config and way out but the developer the
only thing that developer has to do on
the layout page is to actually give the
wicked attributes on each component that
will be controlled on the server side of
the page so for instance i want the
login page here I can actually preview
the page well eclipse is not that good
on previewing but I check here the form
so here's the form wicked ID form and
all the components that are in it I can
just give them attributes just like the
idea to put that the designer used to
reference that component and on the
server side of this page I have all this
code that gives me the login button the
sub to create account button and forgot
password link so it all use functions to
give the behavior of what will happen
when the user clicks on the button of
different sizes pretty bad for you guys
are there sorry ok no it's easier Wow ok
all right so for instance I I want to
mount the login page i just use the
wicked annotations feature and then i
want to create a form i just called form
to deal with the user and the same
attribute that is on the page from this
point on the developer has doesn't have
to touch on the HTML gain all the server
side code will be done in this class yes
like a plugin for Eclipse no no not yet
you can do that okay so yeah there are
some plugins for a wicked that it can
give you the back and forth between HTML
and Java side but not for a scholar yet
just for java just for pure java and
wicked projects i think it integrates
with netbeans and there are another one
for eclipse but i think the NetBeans one
is better okay so so i'll just go keep
keep going developing all the things
that are on the HTML and create
components on the server side like a
feedback panel or an email field and
then i make that email feel required in
this case so when no data goes to the
server side it will throw an error
message saying yeah you forgot to feel
something here the login button use the
function that receives a button which
will be the login button and then I just
got data from the user object and I'll
teen skate on my session so here's the
logic for authenticating it should be
somewhere else but this is the plication
that I've made few months ago I was just
trying to make it work so let's let's
let's run this code and see what we get
using this approach first let's start
with the HTML that we have here for
let's say the logging HTML so this is
the login page that I've been using so i
can preview it on the browser then the
developer if he wants to change the
layout he can just do what he is good at
like CSS he comes here on the chrome and
makes some different thing like thirty
percent
or it takes the background off and makes
a few changes and then yeah maybe it's
okay okay I'm going to go back to the my
page on login or CSS and makes the
changes but the thing is the page that
hit he modified is actually the same
page that will be used by wicked on the
run time so I'm sure you birthday I just
come here and calm even that will come
up with the embedded glassfish plug in
and start the program one of one of the
things that I still have to come up with
is some way to modify the HTML and then
I can preview on runtime like the page
or or the server side code as well just
like a hot deployment okay so I just
create an account thank you for
registering then you can all sign in so
there's a page this is the lists page so
this is the running page and let me show
you the templates page so here's the
template page that will develop the
designer gave to me so I put all the
code that I wanted for server-side for
instance like wicked ID there they are
and the same HTML did like this one is
being used here on glassfish so again
about gamboa going back to camp over how
we create a project and what we get when
we do that so gumbo is actually an
archetype from Haven so when we run the
archetype generate code like this one
it's full of parameters but if you run
this it will create a sample project
that we will already come with
java ee integration between scala wicked
with the without a data source that is
on memory on glassfish it will have a
male session for you so you can send
emails the velocity integration it will
also come with with a Twitter bootstrap
layout and will come with a login page
so you can already have the logging
feature if you need let me open the page
oops my project at bay ouch h index dot
HTML so this is the page the index page
so in this case we cannot preview it
because I modified I the developer
modified the HTML in a way that it
doesn't come with any any CSS because
it's a composite page one page extend
the other page so that's why you see on
the code here the wicked extend so in
this particular case this is a feature
of wicked I can break all my layout in
two pieces of pages like templating so
here i have my layout so I have my base
page i have my layout page and then i
have my actual pages like index and log
in so if i open base page then I have
all the HTML from the Twitter the
Twitter bootstrap like the CSS
references and the JavaScript so what I
can do to get a preview back in this
case is to just move this part of the
code into outside the ex
10 here see there's the change and also
the the other part here there you go so
now I have the actual layout of the page
so then I can preview but the thing is
that all that HTML bit outside the
wicked extent will be ignored by the
framework on one time so i can i can do
a lot of things a dreamweaver for
instance has a feature where you can
lock hearts of your page so then you can
modify your layout and then it will deal
with all the templating from pages that
are they look the same so you can you
can take advantage of that in this case
let me let me do this now I have to show
you this page running so what we get on
when we when we do this is is a project
able to start coding from top down we
can just get all the HTML and CSS from
the designer and throw into the layout
folder and then start coding on top of
that layout and they go so we have this
kind of this code here that we can start
using for let's say the login page is
just a fog in wit form the form is a
page with fields and button and a button
and I have the full form that it enables
me to create an account let me show you
this running so this is the
were the bimbo project running I have
the login but the logging field form I
can just create a lock on here it will
create in our database in memory oops
sorry the email is not working in this
network I cannot send emails so let me
ignore this no email here and just a
return here and okay so so just going
back to the slides before wrap-up few
things so when we when we think about
web development maybe we should think
not about just the features of the web
frameworks but more about the design
process that we have in our company in
our team with the designers and
developers we maybe should think about
will this framework feeds provides me
the ability so then my designers will be
productive and as well as my developers
and they want they will actually work
together to build my website or should I
just follow what everybody's using know
maybe you should think about more in our
designing process more and about the
type of website as you are doing so
don't think that everything work that
you like we will be able to do whatever
kind of website you want so maybe we
should start thinking about choosing the
right web framework for the right
website for the rights designing process
for the right team there are a lot of
companies that they they give the part
of the design of a page to our company
and then they will come with the layout
like a marketing agency or something
like that so maybe you should think
about this before thinking I'm going to
PHP because I like it think that now you
have to you come up with all this page a
mixing code and then your customer says
you know what I do not like the layout
can i change it ya know cuz you're going
to have to do that all again so think
about this and next time just the
framework I have a I have a few more
minutes so if you guys have any
questions if you want to see more coder
yeah okay so let's say lucky are hiding
a component because someone cannot see
it okay in this case we get to the
wicked framework because all that other
logic has to be added to the components
for let's say layout I can have here oh
I actually have this one see I have a
page layout and then when the page is
going to be rendered I'm going to check
if the user is logged in if he's not
then I'm gonna change the visibility of
the login form on the top to false i'm
actually true because looking at the
page here we have two looking forms
right but they are all the same
component first of all they are all the
same component but second when i login I
want to hide that component because they
are on the same page the navigation bar
and the login form here on top they are
on the same page
yeah yes now I actually have that
structure on the HTML so when you open
the HTML on the browser you're going to
see both the navigation panel end of
looking for let me show you javaone my
project at the edge edge or gain got up
sorry so here so on the HTML I actually
have the component showing up and the
navigation bar with that should be
visible only to sign it in users so I
console that on the server side and if I
want to use JavaScript I can create an
HTML I like a deal this this way I put
let's say here lay out dot HTML and I
have a jib here div wicked ID equals
whatever and then some script here and
then I can get these go to layout assign
a container for that
and then I can hide it here ok so I
actually connects the server side with
the any element on the HTML or using
this approach the container here in this
case is the general the most common
abstract way to connect to some element
on the HTML question yeah ok let me show
you the example on that the exhibit one
that is on birthday while it's running
it's starting I'm show you the layout
first and then the decode your birthday
source pages and then I have at least if
it's this one yes it's this one so this
this page will show a list of items and
then what I do here is create a function
that will be run on each element of the
list be visible on a page so for every
element from the database I create a
label for e meio a label for birthday
name a link to delete that they'll
record or to edit and then i create
another component here that is the page
able list view so on top of a list I can
page that but not just the page table in
severe I also need to add another
component that will be plug it to the
page a bolus view that will provide me
the navigation the the page navigator
feature on top of that list so here we
create an account we login we create a
list Bruno
Khan save list ok so here we have that
least showing up and this is the
navigation of the page of the PG abusive
you wicked provides a very simple page
navigator but you can customize that you
can add CSS if you want so let me show
you just add a few items here so no oops
not a valid date sunday right then I
have one page here so when I click the
boot button here for instance i will
come to this part of the code here that
is the edit so if i want Paige flow I
just set response page and you page the
Edit item page which comes to this class
that is called item / item and on top I
get item and i'm editing Bruno and the
the HTML edit least dot HTML I have to
attach a wicked ad ID to to the list so
we are here so here I have a table and
the table will have four columns I have
the column for name the email and
birthday so use the least the actual
list that will be iterated through the
data coming from the database in this
case it will be here a page a bolus view
so i can i can run a list view without
paging capabilities but i can also run
the page a bullish view but at the end i
have to add an extra component for the
navigator
they are bound to a model and a model
and on that model you can provide at
least you can provide a PG able least
you can page on the database and just
provide chunks of data to the page you
can eat yeah yeah but I it depends on
what you want you can you can put the
whole list on the memory and the session
of the user and just iterate on top of
that or you can get the parameters using
a different component to get the
parameter of the page that user is seen
so then you can page all the database
just get part of the list more question
okay well one thing that people think
about wicked is that like I said memory
lots of all this state is managing on
the user session of the component and
that's why it has those server-side
capabilities that's what it get that's
that's why it has that and the first
question that comes up is we might
server handle all that memory well there
are a lot of websites ecommerce websites
there are few in Brazil actually they
are we using wicked and if you if your
developers do a good job you can
actually have I don't know thousands and
thousands of users current users
accessing our page your website and no
memory problems on that well you always
have clusters and so on but the answer
is there is no problem unless the
developers don't screw up which can
always happen yeah yeah yeah no well
there are some companies that I what
they do is they put terracotta to manage
all the session memory in memory so yeah
yes it is possible yes
so what you guys can do now is to go to
the gumbo project get the archetype and
start doing some some some projects
start with the Quick Start week it also
has a quick start archetype that you can
play with and the only thing about gumbo
is actually it's it's it is using Scala
which brings to a higher level of coding
but it's a good way to start learning ok
if you want to check the scholar dsl for
wicked it's on github we catch stuff
core a lot of the path is huge but it's
on wicked stuff / score and then you go
down to jdk one dot six and then you go
to this color component then you will
see the dsl for scholar that is part of
the gumbo project and then and then you
may maybe maybe gonna give up on studies
scholar after you see all this code yeah
it's because I from I i I've put a
format that I can just have one line of
code you know for each method of the dsl
they are not that big but yeah you have
implicit manifest you have a crazy stuff
here I mean that that was the way that i
use to learn Scala so I think it's good
to do crazy stuff when you want to learn
something like this arrow when these
underline I mean why God why do they
come with this but uh you got used to it
it's it's a good language to learn
functional programming and lump
expressions I like a lot I think it's
it's over now yeah all right thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
