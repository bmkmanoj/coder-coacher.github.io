hello and welcome to the Oracle
Enterprise Manager Cloud Control demo
series today we are going to focus on
cloud management more specifically we're
going to look into cloud infrastructure
setup you will learn about discovering
Oracle VM servers into the cloud
configuring storage for the cloud
configuring networking creating
silverpool and cloud zones let's go to
the cloud management homepage here you
see our Oracle Enterprise Manager
already connected to oracle vm manager
let's go ahead and discover some servers
you can specify IP address or hostname
for discovering oracle bein servers into
the cloud then specify the hostname and
the credentials to connect to the
servers once the discovery job completes
you will see you will see the servers in
the cloud management homepage enterprise
manager provides bare-metal provisioning
for automatically provisioning Oracle VM
software on Hardware boxes here I have
just discovered existing Oracle be
observers into the cloud the next thing
we will do is manage some storage let's
go to the storage management page and
registers some NFS neta filers
Enterprise Manager supports I skazhi
fibre channel Sam or NFS for cloud
storage let's give a logical name to our
NFS filer give the host name of the
storage server and there is a default
port by which Enterprise Manager
connects to the server once the
registration job completes you would see
a storage server here let's go ahead and
discover the file systems within the
storage server once the discovery job
completes you can drill
into the storage server and you can see
the various file systems that were
exported using the HC exports file on
the NFS filer let's now go ahead and
register or add an administration server
for storage administration server could
be any oracle vm server so that that
that allows Enterprise Manager to
connect to the storage so let's go ahead
and pick one of the Oracle VM servers as
administration server once the job
completes you will see an administration
server added here let's go back to the
file systems within the storage you can
see that these file systems are not
refreshed that means they are not
available to be used in the cloud let's
go ahead and select the both the file
systems that we have and refresh them to
refresh the file systems Enterprise
Manager requires you to specify a oracle
vm server that can be used to access the
storage so let's go ahead and pick one
of the oracle vm servers to connect to
storage once the Refresh job completes
you can refresh the page here and you
can see that the refreshed column
changes to yes file systems that are
refreshed already can be now used to
create server pools or to create storage
repositories let's go ahead and create a
storage repository
from the storage repository page you can
use the create operation to give a
logical name for your storage repository
and create a storage repository so here
I am specifying the file system that I
want to use for the storage repository
if there is a sub-directory under the
repository directory I can specify that
as a share path since I do not have a
subdirectory I'm just going to use a
backslash as my share path also I
specify a oracle vm server that would be
used to connect to this storage
repository once the storage repository
creation job completes you would see it
under the table here let's go ahead and
drill down into the storage repository
here you can see that the storage
repository stores assemblies ISOs vm
templates virtual machine disk files and
virtual machine configuration files
let's go ahead and first associate the
storage repository with the two servers
that we have discovered earlier what
this does is it makes sure that all the
virtual machine workloads that a
provision on these two servers will be
stored in the storage repository that's
associated with the server now let's go
ahead and import some oracle vm
templates into the storage repository
that we will use for provisioning the
guests you can import the templates or
assemblies from either software library
or an external location we already have
uploaded the components into the
software library somewhere and just pick
a template from the software library and
import it again you can schedule the
import for immediately or for a future
time i'm going to say import now once
the import job completes you would have
your oracle vm template
or Oracle virtual assembly imported into
the software library imported into the
storage repository now let's go ahead
and configure some networking from the
network management page you can go to
the nic management page where you can
generate a bunch of virtual MAC
addresses so let's go ahead and generate
some mac addresses you can specify the
initial starting point for the mac
address and the number of mac addresses
that you need once the job completes and
you can refresh the page and you will
see a whole bunch of mac addresses
created this pool of mac addresses is
basically used to assign mac addresses
for new virtual machines that are
created in the cloud once a modular
machine is assigned the mac address
it'll appear here in the third column
let's go ahead and create a network now
since we do not have any vlans in our
environment we are not going to create
any meal and groups so let's go ahead
and create a new network you see that
there is a default network already
created this default network contains
the already discovered servers and it is
primarily used for as a management
Network we will now go ahead and create
a second network which we will use for
traffic between the virtual machines to
create a network you can either again
use a VLAN group in case you're using
vlans or just continue with the network
creation without the vlans I go ahead
and specify the network name so it's my
virtual machine network again the
network could span different hypervisors
different Oracle VM servers or it could
be within a specific oracle vm server
i'm going to choose inter oracle vm
server also I'm saying that the role of
this network is to carry traffic between
what
machines since I do not have any VLANs
i'm going to leave the first table empty
in the second table i'm going to pick
the knicks to be added to this network
so first i go ahead and pick all the
oracle vm servers that i want to add to
this network since i have two of them i
pick both of them as you can see the
first oracle vm server has a second and
a third neck and the second oracle vm
server also has a second and a third
make the first nick of both the servers
is added to the default network that we
saw earlier so let's go ahead and pick
one nic each from these two servers and
then add it to our network you can also
attach a network profile to your logical
network a network profile is a pool of
IP addresses and administrators can
control what IP addresses get assigned
to virtual machines that are provisioned
in that network since we do not have any
network profiles we're going to skip
this step we review the network
parameters and then finish once the
network creation job completes you will
see a second network appear in this
table now that we have configured the
storage and network let's go ahead and
create a server pool a server pool is
essentially a collection of oracle vm
servers we provide a full names it's a
production pool and i can activate the
cluster that means all the oracle bein
servers in the pool are clustered if any
oracle vm server fails all the workloads
on that server can automatically be
restarted on other servers in the pool
that means it offers fault tolerance and
high availability i can choose the file
system to be used with this server pool
this file system stores the server pool
cluster files I specify a freely
available IP address as a virtual IP for
the pool and I add the two servers that
I have discovered earlier into the pool
once the pool creation job finishes you
will see the pool here the pool is still
being created I go ahead and refresh the
page and you can see now that the two
servers are under the pool let's go
ahead and create a zone that a zone is a
collection of server pools it can be
used for geography or functional
isolation of resources within a cloud so
you can say these bunch of servers
storage and networking belongs to this
zone and this zone is my East Coast zone
or a vest goes on or this zone belongs
to a certain cost center or a business
unit so all the charges for applications
deployed in this zone will be charged
back to a specific cost center so a zone
is a very flexible concept in this case
we are just using it as a collection of
civil pools so I create a new zone
called manufacturing zone and I mark
this zone to be exposed to the
self-service portal to the self-service
consumer or the cell service user of the
crowd I add the tube add the one pool I
have into the zone and I say okay once
the zone creation job completes you see
the manufacturing zones show up under
the cloud and the pool shows up under
the manufacturing zone what we have seen
in the demo today is how enterprise
manager automates the setup of the cloud
infrastructure thanks for watching this
demonstration
