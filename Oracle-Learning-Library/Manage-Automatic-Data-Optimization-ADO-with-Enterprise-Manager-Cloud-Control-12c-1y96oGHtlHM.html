Manager cloud control 12c demonstration
my name is Maria Billings I work for
Oracle server technologies curriculum
ideo or automatic data optimization is a
new 12c feature that allows you to
optimize storage with only a minimum
cost the functionality is based on data
access patterns you set policies on your
data a policy is an action for example
that you want to compress or move data
to less expensive storage and you
specify the condition when this action
is supposed to be taken so II do then
performs your specified action when the
condition is satisfied we will show you
the e/m interfaces and the tasks
outlined in this slide to access a do
select administration storage automatic
data optimization the ABO home page
appears with two tabbed pages segment
activity and policy we've a look at
policy at the end of this video here you
see the database level heat map that
shows you the 100 table spaces the 100
largest in the database as you see my
cursor moving over it more details are
displayed about each tablespace
scrolling down you see the same
information in table form you see the
tablespace name size segment count then
access date to write date lookups candid
and for tables can date and for these
states you see each the earliest latest
and the average value these excess
criteria can also be viewed him by
instead of last right date you could
choose to look at last access date and
as you see the database heat level map
changes this heat map exists on database
level you can use it
drill down by clicking one of the
tablespace then the objects within this
tablespace appear and the layout of the
page by the way is very similar to the
database lever one you can continue to
drill down by clicking again and here
you see the object level that is the
segments in this example to navigate
back to the top level you can use the
breadcrumbs or the navigation bar a few
additional details here under the heat
map is a data selector but default the
earliest and last activity dates are
being short chosen you can change that
you can also change the color slider
here having moved it to the thirtieth
Timber means that all activities earlier
than the 30th September are shown in
bloom and the remaining objects are
phone according to the color on the
slider my next task is to add a policy
and I'm here on the tablespace level you
can see that some tables have policies
others don't I select one that doesn't
have a policy and click Edit policy on
this page I click ed on the ed automatic
data optimization policy page I specify
my policy that I want a compression
level of loyalty P that is active after
hundred fifty days of no excess so then
the compression should occur
I click OK then show sequel for those of
you who are interested the click
returned and apply the policy is you see
this table has been successfully
modified so from now on the AVO
framework will automatically execute the
policy but you can also explicitly
execute a policy if their eyes need for
it let's return to IDEO
you can see that this table now has a
policy I can see more information by
clicking on the policy tab page this
page provides
see summary overview execution within
the last 24 hours in settings so we've
come to the end this slide shows a
summary of the tasks that you can review
in this video thanks for watching this
