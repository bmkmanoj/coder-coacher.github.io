Capacity planning ensures that your
enterprise databases have sufficient
resources to meet future business needs.
As an IT Administrator or Capacity
Planner you can use Resource Analytics
for databases to understand how your
critical resources, including CPU and
storage, are used. By default, all
databases are selected but you can
select specific databases, or a group of
databases, for which you want to view
resource usage. For example, you can
select all your production databases. The
database selection applies to all
reports within the application.
The selected time period for which you want to view data, either by choosing one of
the predefined time periods, or by
specifying a custom time period. The time
period selection applies to all reports
within the application.
Clicking the tabs in the navigation pane
direct you to utilization information
specific to the corresponding resource.
For example, clicking the CPU tab loads
CPU utilization data. The first chart
shows the trend of CPU resource
utilization. From this chart, you can also
view your available CPU capacity. From the
second chart, you can view the CPU
utilization for each database, along with
changes in CPU utilization during the
specified time period. Each cell
represents a database. The size and color
represent the amount of resources used
and the growth of the database.
Red indicates a growth in resource usage
while green indicates a reduction in the
resources used by a particular database.
You can also choose to view only the top
10 consumers of your CPU resources. By default,
your databases are grouped by version.
Alternatively, you can group the
databases by other measures such as host
or life cycle status. You can drill down
further and view the trend of current
resource utilization for the selected
databases, and use this to generate a
forecast of expected future usage. You'll
have to select a time period of at least
six months for the forecast feature to
work. You can also select different
algorithms to generate the best fit for
the resource utilization. We hope this
video helps you understand how Oracle
IT Analytics Cloud Service helps you
analyze current resource utilization and
plan for future business growth.
