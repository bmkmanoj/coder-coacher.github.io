Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud control
13 C demo series we will cover in this
screen watch the system broadcast and
always-on monitoring features which are
new in 13 C Enterprise Manager cloud
control is a management tool that
provides monitoring and management
capabilities for Orko and non Oracle
components it is a complete integrated
and business driven cloud management
solution in a single product customers
depend on Enterprise Manager for
monitoring and management of their cloud
and data centers and it has become one
of their mission critical systems as
with any IT application routine
maintenance is required for Enterprise
Manager taking it out even for a short
period of time for maintenance is no
longer acceptable as Enterprise Manager
is now a critical component of IT
operations in Enterprise Manager 13c
we've added a number of new capabilities
and features to address this specific
situation first there is a new system
broadcast feature for super
administrators to notify users they are
currently logged into Enterprise Manager
super administrators can customize the
broadcast message and notify logged on
users the Enterprise Manager will be
undergoing maintenance this is achieved
by sending a command from the Enterprise
Manager command line interface we've put
together a script to demonstrate this
capability the script connects to the
Enterprise Manager server and executes a
send popup message statement the message
recipient and type of alert is
configurable by the super administrator
once this is sent from the command line
users they are logged into the
Enterprise Manager console will see a
pop up system broadcast in our example
the message indicates iam will be taken
down in an hour for maintenance you will
continue to receive alerts for your
targets this leads us to the second
feature which is always on monitoring
always-on monitoring is a highly
available and scalable service which
provides continuous monitoring of
mission
critical environments bring both planned
and unplanned Enterprise Manager
downtime it receives target availability
events and metric alerts from agents and
sends email notifications for target
down in critical metric alerts it is
downloadable via Enterprise Manager self
update and runs alongside Enterprise
Manager as a quick demonstration of this
feature we have a monitored pluggable
database called pdborcl that is
currently up and running what I'm going
to do is first acknowledge the pop-up
system broadcast and then I will shut
down Enterprise Manager
now I will open up a second command line
in which I am locked into the host where
the pluggable database resides here we
have a prebuilt script which runs the
alter pluggable database statement to
shut down the pluggable database
Enterprise Manager is down because there
are little red flashing lights which
means it is no longer able to connect
let's run the stop PD B script and we
can see here that the database is down
let's check my inbox for the email
notification about the pluggable
database within a few seconds here
now that the pluggable database is down
I should receive an email notification
about it here's the email notification
and you'll notice that it's not sent by
Enterprise Manager itself it is sent by
the event monitoring service which is
also known as always-on monitoring
service this shows that Enterprise
Manager can still send critical alerts
while it's offline this concludes our
demo for system broadcast and always-on
monitoring thank you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
