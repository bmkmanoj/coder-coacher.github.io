of the three weekly lessons about oracle
jet in the previous part you were
introduced to oracle jet components each
Erica jet component consists of business
logic and JavaScript and a view
expressed in HTML in this part you will
learn about the requirejs text plugin
library which is an extension of require
required text is another useful free and
open source library that is part of jet
require.js text lets you load text
resources in jet requirejs text lets you
separate your HTML templates from your
javascript files by separating a
business logic from your templates
you're able to separate the concerns of
business logic from those of the view
for example UI designers can
independently work on the user interface
of an application
well JavaScript developers work on the
underlying business logic as a first
example of the usefulness of the
requirejs text functionality we're going
to replace this hard-coded set of data
with data coming from a file right now
the data is inside the incidents JS file
I'm going to copy it and I'm going to
paste it into a new file into a JSON
file that I will call data which will be
inside of a folder also called enter of
course the file and the folder could
have any name at all I'm going to paste
this in here and then add quotation
marks around each of the texts that
don't have a quotation mark to make it
valid JSON and once I have done that
just to make it look a little bit better
I'm going to format it now we have a
JSON file the point of the exercise here
is to incorporate the data found in this
file inside of our Oracle jet module the
way to do that is to use requirejs text
so we start by first of all parsing a
payload that we will call
that doesn't exist right now take note
here that JSON dot parse works fine
though you are recommended to use the
jQuery get JSON call to get any JSON
data this approach also used throughout
Oracle Jet's documentation allows for
the code to wait for a promise to be
returned before continuing with the rest
of the code that may require the data to
be present also note that the required
is text plugin allows you to load local
resources from the file system as a text
string and then manipulated as needed
wow you could use an ajax call to load
local JSON data using something like get
JSON from jQuery you can also use this
alternative method with a simple
required text plug-in call you could use
this to load static HTML fragments or
even CSS style information we're going
to put in the callback function of our
define block the parameter file which
right now is not defined and we can see
that it is the fourth parameter one two
three four up until this point we have
not discussed function callbacks yet
this is part of the define block and
also part of a require block we can see
that we have four different items right
now referenced in our define block the
order in which these items are
referenced should reflect the same order
as in which they are used within the
callback function right now the file
item is the fourth item and therefore
our first second third fourth item
should be a reference to that file the
way that we reference the file F by
means of the text protocol which comes
from the requirejs text plugin if our
code jet did not include requirejs text
we would not be able to use this
protocol here text with the exclamation
mark followed by the name of the folder
relative to the J's folder followed by
the name of the file data
when you look in the browser we will see
that the requirejs text plugin loads
data JSON that it is passed in to the
callback function as file and that that
reference inside of our JSON dot parse
is that same file that is referenced
inside of our callback function and
hence that our data is loaded back in
the browser we see the same result as
before with the difference that thanks
to requirejs text the data is now loaded
from a file rather than being hard-coded
directly inside of our oracle jet module
in short require.js text is useful when
you want to load files into an oracle
jet module the requirejs text plugin is
also used internally within Oracle jet
you may have been wondering why
dashboard jeaious and dashboard HTML are
loaded together as the Oracle jet
dashboard module and why incidence
jeaious and incidence HTML are loaded
together as the Oracle jet incidence
module how that happens and what makes
that possible is something called ój
module ój module is used inside of the
index file you will see within the index
file that there is a reference in the
main part of the index file to a data
bind set to a J module you've seen data
bind being used before data bind is an
attribute provided by knockout you've
seen the data bind attributes being used
to connect the text attribute of a span
element for example you have also seen
in being used together with the
definition of oracle jet components and
here you see a different binding
provided by Oracle jet called Oh J
module this is a binding provided by
Oracle jet to enable the loading of our
Aquajet modules here you see that a J
module points to something called a
router which is a topic that we
we'll look at later the router is
defined in the app controller javascript
file you can see a set of keys dashboard
incidents customers and about which is
the way by means of which by default the
LJ module binding loads Oracle Jett
modules for each of these keys LJ module
is going to look inside of the J as view
models folder for a matching JavaScript
file and in the J's views folder for a
matching HTML file you can override this
behavior but this is the default way in
which a J module works using under the
hood the ricotta is text plugin to load
together as one the dashboard J s file
and the dashboard HTML file as an Oracle
jet module the urgent module binding
enables a separation of concerns between
business logic in JavaScript and the
view defined in HTML in this part you
have learned about the benefits of
separating the business logic from the
view of your JavaScript applications
together with the support that require
J's text provides for your homework we
recommend you explore this concept
further and as always we thank you for
taking part in the course and look
forward to seeing you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
