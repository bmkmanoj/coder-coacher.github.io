submitting a new link to the community
repository so you've entered the submit
link page and the first thing you want
to do since it's a link is enter the URL
now suppose you're following steven
feuerstein s blog that's me by the way
and he's entered a new blog post and you
want to put it into the repository so
you go to his blog post you grab the URL
put it into the URL and then the next
step is to pick the topic so the topic
tells us what this thing is about and
that's critical in terms of people being
able to find this information later on
so i'm going to put an optimization
level or just optimization we've got a
number of hits let's find if we can see
if we can find one that's good compiler
optimization that looks really good so
we'll grab that topic and then a title
I'll take that right from the blog
optimization levels in native code
generation what is it it's an article I
can enter the source but chances are
it's already in there and in fact we
will figure it out for you automatically
one way to tell that is if you scroll
down and look for similar links you'll
see that we've already picked up some of
this information so don't worry about
the source and then we can put in the
description and you can either lift it
from here or you can just type in a
summary so i'll type in a summary steven
feuerstein shares insights and charles
weather all on the interaction between
optimization levels and native
compilation great estimated minutes it's
really helpful to give people a sense of
how much time you think it might take
for them to go through this material and
it's not very long but it's not trivial
stuff so i'm going to put down ten
minutes for that difficulty level
intermediate minimum version well native
compilation was introduced in 11g so i'm
going to put 11g is the minimal feature
if you're not sure of any of these items
you can just submit it and we'll sort it
out later in the review process so it
looks like I've got everything filled
out I can either save it as draft if I
want to go back to it or if I feel like
it's ready for a review
I press submit for review and it's
entered into the repository now let me
show you one other things suppose you
came somebody else came to this site and
said Oh Stephens got the screen new blog
post I want to put it in grab the URL
put it in and you're immediately
notified the URL is already registered
so we're going to save you time and not
have you put in all this information
then be told it's already in the
database so that's how you submit a link
and i encourage you to whenever you find
something interesting out there
regarding oracle database technology or
other Oracle related technologies come
on over and add it to the community
repository then everyone can benefit
over time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
