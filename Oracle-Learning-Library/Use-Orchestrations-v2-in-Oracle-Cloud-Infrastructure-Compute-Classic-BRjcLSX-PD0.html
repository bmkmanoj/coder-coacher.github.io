Oracle compute cloud service in this
demonstration we'll use orchestrations
v2 to create an instance and set up all
the required networking objects that
enable us to connect to the instance
using SSH in this orchestration will
create an IP network and add an
interface of the instance to the IP
network we'll also create a v-neck set a
security protocol a security rule and an
access control list or ACL this will
enable us to connect to the instance
using a previously created SSH key first
we'll look at the orchestration file
which is in JSON format with
orchestrations v2
there are several features that we can
use when creating orchestrations one
important feature is the desired state
of the orchestration which indicates
whether we want the objects to be
curated immediately when we upload the
orchestration in this example the
desired state is specified as active
which instructs the system's create the
objects immediately for each object that
we define in an orchestration we can
specify a label and a description the
label provides a reference ID which must
be unique in the orchestration we use a
label to reference an object in other
objects for example if we create a
storage volume we can attach it to an
instance by referencing the storage
volumes label and its name field in the
instance definition the type field
indicates the kind of object to create
in this case we're creating a storage
volume so the fields within the template
defined the storage volume the fields in
the template varied depending on the
type of object that we want to create
effectively any information we specify
in a template is used to create the
underlying object we also have the
ability to mark individual objects as
persistent this is useful when we want
to tear down some but not all of the
objects defined in an orchestration if
we specified that all storage volumes
should be persistent then when we
suspend the orchestration non persistent
objects such as instances are deleted
but storage volumes and the data stored
on them or not
for example this setup would allow us to
modify an instance without compromising
our data
let's explore an example of object
referencing in this orchestration when
we define the v-neck set we refer to the
ACL that we also create in this
orchestration we do this by specifying
the name of the ACL in the applied ACLs
field consider the security rule that
we're defining here instead of
specifying the name of the ACL we
reference the label and the name field
of the ACL when we use object references
like this we don't need to specify
relationships between objects because
references are implicit relationships
for example if an instance references
multiple objects including storage
volumes IP networks IP address
reservations and so on the orchestration
waits for all of these reference objects
to be created before launching the
instance in this orchestration we define
a number of different types of objects
first we defined storage volumes we also
add an SSH key which we previously
created this is the value of the ssh
public key when we connect to this
instance the corresponding ssh private
key is used to authenticate access to
the instance next we define networking
objects we create an IP network that
will add the instance to and we create
an ACL and a v-neck set we also create a
security protocol and a security rule
the security rule uses the security
protocol to allow access to instances
that have an interface in the
destination v-necks set the ACL is used
to apply a set of security rules to a
v-neck set next we create a public IP
reservation this provides the public IP
address that we'll use to connect to the
instance note that we set persistence to
true for mostly objects in this
orchestration including the IP network
the security rule in ACL and the public
IP address this ensures that if we ever
shut down e and since none of the
networking is disturbed with the IP
address reservation set to be persistent
the public IP address of the instance
won't change if we suspend the
orchestration and restart it later and
finally we create the instance note that
most of the objects that the instance
depends upon such as store
volumes the v-neck set and the ssh key
are included in the instance definition
by using object references that is by
referencing their label and name field
this ensures that the instance is
launched only when all of the referenced
objects are ready now that the
orchestration file is complete let's
upload it using the web console because
we specified the desired state is active
the orchestration starts immediately
while the orchestration is creating the
objects its status is displayed as
starting when all of the objects have
been created the orchestration status
changes to ready as the orchestration
starts objects defined any orchestration
are created the storage page shows us
that the Sorge volumes defined in the
orchestration are now online the IP
networks page lists the IP network that
we defined in the orchestration on the
virtual NIC sets page we see two V Nick
sets Phoenix set 1 and default Phoenix
at one is the v-neck set that we defined
in the orchestration the default Phoenix
set is created out of the box and a
default ACL is applied to this Phoenix
set this allows traffic across all V
Nick's in the default Phoenix set the
instance we defined in the orchestration
hasn't been added to the default Phoenix
set because we explicitly specified that
it should be added to V Nick set one on
the access control list page we set the
default ACL as well as the ACL that we
defined in the orchestration ACL 1 the
default ACL applies the default security
rules to enable traffic across instances
in the default Phoenix set ACL one
contains the ingress security rule to
allow SSH access next let's go to the
security protocols page here we see the
security protocol that we defined in the
orchestration and finally here's the IP
address reservation that we created in
the orchestration the instances page
shows us that the instance is running
with all of the network objects in place
let's log into this instance using SSH
we can look up the public IP address of
our instance on the IP reservations page
to start an SSH session on a Windows
system we launch putty and enter the
public IP address of the instance we
enter the passphrase for the SSH key and
we're done we've logged into the
instance as the default OPC user we can
now proceed to customize the instance
install apps and use the instance to run
workloads as required now let's say we
want to stop this instance but we don't
want to delete the storage volumes
associated with it with orchestrations
v2 we can suspend the orchestration to
stop non persistent objects remember
that we define the IP network and other
networking objects such as the security
rule and ACL to be persistent of course
to ensure data isn't lost we also define
the storage volumes as persistent so
when we suspend this orchestration no
persistent objects are deleted later we
can restart the orchestration to
recreate the instance and any other non
persistent objects that were deleted
when we suspended the orchestration or
if we no longer need any of the objects
we can either stop or delete the
orchestration if we stop the
orchestration all objects are deleted
but the orchestration itself is still
available and we can start it later if
we delete the orchestration all of the
objects created by the orchestration are
deleted and then the orchestration
itself is also deleted for more
