off this panel discussion on sequel so
the intended the title of this panel is
making a sequel great again some of you
might not might sound familiar to rip
off of Donald Trump's presidential
campaign making America great again
thanks to Iggy for coming up with a
catchy title so this is a panel
discussion the questions have been pre
chosen already we want to get people
time to reflect them on their thoughts
and organize them our time is short here
we only have seven questions but I think
if we spend five minutes on each
question are a little longer than that
will fill up the whole time so the
session is going to be video by Oracle
so look forward to seeing a copy of this
video the developer advocate program I
think we'll be doing the video Stephen
wipe and Linda and then the note can
Carl the note coop journal we printing
an edited version of this panel
discussion if Oracle is says it's okay
the way I look at this panel discussion
I see three sort of high-level questions
one can seek will ever be replaced and
Steven might mention this we just told
me about a survey that came out where
eighty percent of developers and then we
say they use sequel and over ninety
percent say they connect to a database
so sequel really seems like it's the
ubiquitous way to access data could it
possibly could could there possibly ever
be another way to do it and then the
other big question we have here is how
does no single plane to this there's no
seagull offering something that horrible
doesn't have or should we do it all in
horrible that's one of the big that's
why the big core of this conversation
one tangent which I'm sort of interested
in but I don't think we'll touch on is
the differences between oracle rd mess
and the relational algebra set of I cod
are those differences causing problems
or is it not a big deal so anyway I want
to go start with introductions I'm very
honored to have animals in here and the
rest of the panel Graham brand common
Steve so I want to do come on people go
through deductions tell us a little bit
about your story how you got involved in
order like an Andy I heard that you
joined as a young cee programmer and
design the original btree index so you
found to hear about how you got started
Oh so how much does fit so yes I am with
tenants and we did 35 minutes of
questions unlikely probably over but we
had 10 minutes again short stories yeah
i joined miracle in 1984 over norica was
a actually a seven year old company I
was a developer on version 5 so I didn't
do the original Oracle btree index but
when we rewrote the lower half of the
product in version 6 which was 1988 yeah
i wrote the b-tree index there which is
still used today inside article I'm sure
didn't lots of bugs have been fixed and
everything else but then I also worked
in the sequel layer of the product and
you know did all sorts of management
after that
I'm Graham would I have been with oracle
quite as long as andy i joined in 1986
but I did start using Oracle in 1984
which was Oracle version 2 on a PP
eleven if anybody remembers members
those right so i use some of the pre
Andy index code it has improved a lot
since then I have to say it did work in
the sea end well sequel one of the
things about the sequel that we wrote
that is you can still run it now against
the database that's one of the strengths
of having a standardized language hello
and Bryn and I started with Oracle in
1990 widely more interesting to say what
I did before and how I ended up with
Oracle i started off writing for trunk
programs and things like image analysis
and then I had a phase in your way
writing object or two
runs in similar the language that
predated small talk and C++ and finally
in that period I was on a team were
doing the requirements analysis and
general architecture for a system for
and patient records in hospitals was all
the paper study at first but one thing
was clear and that was that people were
going to have to operate on smallish
pieces of data in whether we kind of
think of at least joining understand the
other and we worked out of course
immediately we needed a relational
database but we also needed and what was
then called RPC remote procedure call I
suppose thought procedures is the term
we here now and then oracle didn't have
it in sybase did so we chose I basics as
simple as that their native course
things switched around then I found that
when i returned to England and needed a
job I made some speculative approaches
and I'd heard Oracle Here I am
good morning everybody so I think I have
to confess out of these panelists on the
rookie here I join Oracle in 92 but just
like Bryn before joining Oracle I'm
actually was busy writing fortran
programs trying to simulate fatigue
management in three-dimensional models
of composite materials to ensure that
airplane stone fall of the sky well so
far you know we were partially
successful with that and then when I
tried Oracle 92 I have to say that I'm
actually one of the guys who wrote
select star from M as my very first
sequel segment and it was a little bit
of an epiphany for me cuz in that very
moment I thought about what it would
have meant for me to actually do that in
Fortran just defining a variable so the
output would have been a nightmare and I
wouldn't claim that I ever was a very
successful or good developers so it
would have been probably way more
error-prone at just using sequel as a
language as of today you know over the
years i was with oracle since 92 child
headquarter in 99 product management
side now trying to think about the
things to make oracle even better and
when i look at what happened you know
with the relational system and secret as
a language I'm i have to say that i
think i'm getting better with what i'm
doing and what I know about sequel but
I'm not so sure you know but I'm faster
in catching up or whether the database
and sequel is faster in actually
handsome introducing functionality so
that's me in a nutshell hello my name is
steven feuerstein and i am i'm the man
who knows
only pale sequel more or less so I'm
really lucky back in 94 I wrote a book
about kale sequel and because PL single
is such a simple powerful readable
language I could deal with it that was
nice and so since then I've really done
nothing but Kelsey will rejoin Oracle
back in March of 2014 and I'm leading a
team of advocates evangelist to help our
user community leverage sequel and Peele
sequel and other Oracle database
application development features were
fully because as some of you may know
oracle database is packed with all sorts
of amazing goodies and we don't really
use very much of them and i think one of
the biggest challenges we on this stage
we have our collab and also you as
experienced users of the technology is
to not only leverage things like
analytics model clause pattern matching
Cpl sequel advanced features such as
they are would also help your fellow
workers learn how to use this stuff more
effectively and that will make this
whole platform more successful with
those other developers out of like
JavaScript developers and so on who need
a strong database but mostly don't
understand how to leverage sequel to do
it thanks with introductions so now
we're going to go into the questions
I'll quickly read over the 7th only
seven questions so give idea where we're
going and then we'll go into the answers
so the first question is why are you
even having this discussion and that has
two parts isn't sequel great already I
mean isn't ubiquitous we really need a
dependent and the second part of that
question is is no sequel something
that's important that we should start
using or is it just a fad that's going
to pass away you know like you know
management object-oriented management in
the database system the second question
is no single folks as you might have
seen the video claim that their web
scale what is web scale and is a
horrible our team you know sports scale
the third question is how does the pale
sequel performance fit into this with
sequel fourth question is horrible now
has its own notes equal
product and does that mean that there
are cases where it should actually be
the secret five if sequel is the best
language for big data then why why is
the rise of the Hadoop so important that
why's it so popular six what is oracle
doing the phenomenal sequel in big data
and finally seven what is the Oracle
developer advocate program doing to
promote the RT mess and horrible people
so the first question this is really the
core why we're here why are we having
this discussion isn't sequel good enough
could something actually replace equals
something often wondered when I first
saw sequel I thought it was easy only 25
years ago would after working with it
shook for a little while I quickly not
that I thought it was super complicated
man and it was not actually not
intuitive to me like doing set
operations I'm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
