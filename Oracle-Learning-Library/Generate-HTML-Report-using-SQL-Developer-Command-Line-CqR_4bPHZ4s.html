demonstration in this demo you'll learn
how to generate a HTML report using the
sequel developer command line I'll be
using version 4.0 so I have this data
type chart I'll go ahead and generate it
into HTML to get access to the command
line syntax you just go to the sequel
developer and bin directory there is a
CD CLI exe file that you want to use I'm
going to open up the command line and
I'm going to go to the bin directory so
single developer supports various
features on the command line here I'm in
the bin directory and if you want to
take a look at all the features that
command line supports just go ahead and
run the exe file and this will give you
a list of all the features that we
support on the command line
so you can use the command line to run
the cart you can format your sequel
migration reports and unit testing so to
take a look at the syntax for generating
a report into HTML type in the exe file
and reports and this will give you the
commands so here you'll generate a
report specify the path name the
connection name and the output file
where you want the report to be saved
so I'll go ahead and type in Mike man
and here the name of the report is data
type chart and I have it in quotes since
there's a space I'm using the HR
connection and here is the location
where I want the report to be saved run
that command and now let's go to the
location of the report
and here is my generated HTML report
