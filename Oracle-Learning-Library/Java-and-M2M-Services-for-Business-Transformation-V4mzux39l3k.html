it's the last day and close to the last
session if not the last session so
thanks for joining and i will force you
to make this interactive so when we were
setting up the conference we were trying
to figure out what topics and sessions
we would want to cover and one of the
things as we think about our java
strategy and what we're doing in the
embedded space it's really hard for us
to think about how we can get java to be
out there and be pervasive without
considering the impact of services that
are going to actually ride on all of
this infrastructure so my talk today
we'll focus on Java services and the
things that we have to consider
everything I say here you should take it
as being the God's truth not just
kidding a safe harbor statement up front
okay first part waking up to change I've
had the pleasure in the last couple
months of looking at a lot of hockey
stick slides and growth and big waves
and it's all going to happen I what's
excites me is that there seems to be
consistency and how big they are how
steep there I'm looking at this in a
little bit of a different way I think
you may have heard this morning if
you're at the keynote this idea of
looking back at the IT advancement
that's been made in the last 20 30 years
and thinking of it in different phases
when I look at this I say okay there are
things that happen to network devices
there are things then that carried over
in networked industries the third wave
really is going to be about making sure
that everything is networked and
everything is connected and everything
is able to provide value right so if I
talk about what the dream is or where
we're headed or what the impact would be
I think you do have to raise it up to
the highest level right and there are
three kinds of things that I can point
to pretty
quality of life for us I but I can think
right now just my smartphone my kids
texted me pictures them yesterday
improves quality of life well this
should have a thousandfold impact on
quality of life human efficiency right
just us being able to do more with less
work and thirdly frictionless business
right I think ten years ago when I was
working on a product we did a project
with a large not to be named overnight
shipping company and I was amazed
because they had been in business
forever but they still weren't at the
point where they were actually packing
the trucks in the order that they were
doing their delivery because the problem
was too hard for them to solve right so
just for them to be able to tackle that
problem and to move them forward is the
idea of adding or reducing friction for
a business and everything that we are
talking about all of this change that's
coming at us should guide us towards
trying to hit these goals quality of
life becoming more in fishing and
improving how businesses work and how
they work with each other there's a lot
of you know we've spent the last two
days talking about m2m or the Internet
of Things or all of these embedded
devices and technologies that are coming
together if I look back at people
running around probably less now but
maybe a couple years ago saying oh I
just got this app on my phone I got this
app you got that up everybody was about
putting on a little app on their phone
and people were about creating apps and
now there's a massive amount of apps
that are out there if you look at what
they actually do they kind of take data
from different places and bring it up in
a presentation layer to give you some
kind of value but mostly it's about
bringing kind of enterprise applications
or applications and data to your phone
so you can have a little UI and do
things right we're just starting to see
people actually
make a change or direct and do something
we're getting excited in this market
about I can change the lights at my
house from my phone in my living room or
change the music on my stereo based on
this but if you take that apps metaphor
about how much convenience that brought
and now you think about where we're
going right like a little dog collar
Fido is now running around with that dog
collar and you have information about
where it is and what you can do take
that to the next level and say now I can
actually force change of the things from
here right really what that's going to
mean it's going to change these into
something else and we're going to have
much richer applications and it's not
just going to be about pulling
information and data together the
services that will be able to drive by
doing this consider it a little bit
about like our senses in our body and
what we use them for right if I'm
walking down the street having a
conversation with somebody and a really
large fire truck goes by I don't think
about the fact that I'm either going to
raise my voice or I'm going to stop and
talk or I'm going to say to them hold on
a sec wait till he goes back that's all
in your subconscious this is something
in the sidewalk that's an obstacle you
walk right around it you don't even
think about it that's because we are
wired with senses and think of those
senses as little services that run
within us that provide us value so i
don't have to stop think dog move to the
right right there all services and
they're all hardwired and their wiring
the senses between us you know between
each other and providing that and take
that now and think about connecting all
these devices these devices and the
value they provide in services that we
build on top of them is almost like an
extension of our senses so how can I
take things that are out there connect
them together and have it be either a
placement for some of the things that we
do ourselves some of the things that are
conscious that we have to do or some of
the things that that our subconscious
that we won't have to do right so like
when I come home and I look go in the
door look my alarm things on the wall
my alarm service has done its job but I
have to look and verify at it right how
can I now take that and change it and
make it such that it's automatic in just
an extension of what we do right
figuring that out and providing services
on top of devices and on top of things
that we connect is really going to bring
out the real value rinse and repeat and
you do it over and over again okay so
now I'll make up a fictitious service
let's go out the the hound out how to
never be late for work service right and
as I've been traveling around I've had
loads of people share with me and tell
me about either things they would love
to see with devices being connected or
companies that are actually working on
things and developing them we're kind of
at that beginning cusp thing where
people are dreaming things up that are
cool right traffic data traffic accident
on the route that I go to work traffic
data gets sent to my house and at my
house the logic says okay traffic data
it's going to take them 30 minutes more
Oh 30 minutes longer to get to work that
event let's send it in reset his alarm
clock he's got to get up early because
of that traffic data at the same time
coffee's got to be made sooner so an
event would go to the coffee to the
sensor to the coffee machine and turn
the coffee machine on sooner well of
course there's a weather report and it's
really cold outside in fact it got much
colder than they thought so we'll send
an alert to the car and the car will
start warming up right I didn't have
under now I have to think about all this
and I'm late and I'm stressed in the
rest of it these things should just run
in the background in our lives as
services on top of the devices and all
the things that we're talking about
engineering and connecting and
developing and delivering right that is
just a service I made up and I don't
just mean made up like today for this
presentation that service would be the
Peter how to never never be late to
service Mike service might be different
right every one of us is going to
have to have a different one of these
because guess what we are different our
lives are different right so services
right are going to drive a value shift
right we have to be able to look at the
devices the data that they're going to
produce and be able to provide easily
services on top of them these are going
to change right these ultimately tablets
smartphones are going to change to be
ultimate remote controls and guess what
they're going to be in everything and
they should be portable and we shouldn't
have to think about it I shouldn't have
to bluetooth to my phone and then put it
in a thing I should get in and it moves
my life the services that are associated
to me to the glass in the car right or
if I'm in a gaming console and I get a
text message it should just come up on
the console at the bottom right so we're
going to rethink what these devices are
and what they mean for us in our
industry yeah these are going to play a
big role but really it's just a window
into all of the services and all of the
things that we generate you saw
cinterion here connectivity right we've
got to be able to have things connect
seamlessly regardless of what the
distance is and it's being built into
the devices right so protocols that are
in the home protocols that is you know
cellular protocols wire protocols
connectivity is also helping shift that
value lastly I want to talk about
services as composites because that how
not to be late Peter service is really
only possible if the things that are
made up of in the service have to be
open and available to be joined together
and mixed in a combination it's got to
be simple this isn't a go to bestbuy get
a piece of equipment come home not read
the manual plug it in fire it up it
doesn't work and then you do have to
read the manual and then you have to go
out and get a piece of firmware just to
get a little router to work right the
simplification that's going to be needed
for this
is a very large barrier for adoption and
certainly if you're talking about
services challenges we know right now
that we're facing huge fragmentation
right we built and develop devices to do
singular things thermostat on the wall
probably anybody there's a bunch of
people my team here sick of me talking
about the thermostat on the wall the
poor thermostat on the wall but it was
designed developed and built by a
company who chose the hardware wrote the
software and had a very very very narrow
band of functionality in mind very good
it reliable does what it does right but
they chose a chip because that was the
chip they always used or because they
got a good deal from the company they
worked with oh that's the architecture
that they already had built drivers to
write and now there are millions of them
right so we have to take fragmentation
we have to take interoperability and we
have to really really really think about
scale the number of devices is daunting
right we're hearing big data you know
and I you know my previous job did a lot
with very very large data sets in very
large or high transaction environments
all very big and scary it's nothing
compared to what's coming it's a
gazillion devices producing all kinds of
data security protocols costs you know
bom costs right now seems to be the
reason why people aren't willing to
change and aren't willing to get on to
things we have to shift our mindset from
bom cost being the center of the
universe to it being something that you
have to consider but in the totality of
the solution and what's available on top
bom cost isn't everything actually right
because the value will shift from the
hardware to the software product life
cycle now it's a thermostat it's on a
wall it'll be there as long as I own the
home it breaks or somebody else buys it
and they rip it out okay but it
enough to change what happens now if it
has to change what happens now if I
start building services and connecting
it into other things back to my example
and that means it needs more power it
has to be able to handle multiple things
I'm going to have to upgrade it I'm
going to have to possibly change out a
component to it serviceability of things
has to change and the data right this is
not named large customer virus really
cool idea let's make cars tell us
everything that they possibly can online
to a data center and let's do it with 10
million cars well you've got a mountain
of data all valuable has to be sorted
through when you heard a lot of it this
morning right but that's a big challenge
okay so how are we going to get there
well firstly we've got to change our
mindset on a service and what a service
is when I say in a box to no box right
now people are you know i would say
pioneers early adopters market makers
are out there developing and delivering
things which are services but in order
to force them into the market they're
having to deliver the hardware what
resides on top of the hardware the
application the control mechanism the
app and the phone so they're delivering
it in a box because all of those other
challenges we have to shift and say you
know what that's not going to work a
service has to be no box it has to be
able to be something that you construct
from bits and pieces together we're
going to require an openness which
allows us to be able to recycle
different things and piece them together
we have to be able to combine data
change it to information ie make it
smarter pull the right bits together and
we've got to take that and make it from
information turn into change so it's not
as simple as just saying okay my alarm
things on the wall it's a service it
calls a thing
no if something happens in my house I
want my alarm to go to the next level of
security I want it to alert me right
drop down steel doors automatic machine
guns right I want to be able to take
that data turn it into information and
have it cause change right so the
service itself and that goes back to
thinking about just apps on a phone
isn't enough like that's all information
coming at me and I can make changes and
type it in as a human how about this
thing being able to make and drive
change into whatever the thing is or
system that it it drives we have to hide
complexity like our industry is actually
not great at hiding complexity right and
we have to make things as simple as
possible you know Apple perfected this
everyone says we're doing the Apple
model haven't seen a lot of people
actually do the Apple model well right
we're talking about things that's that
are inherently complex we've got to
simplify them and for services to be
successful for them to be that sixth
sense we've got to reduce the need and
amount of human intervention needed I
think every service that doesn't require
me to do anything but makes my life
easier and runs and is smart and
produces value is a good service right
and we have to be able to do that so
that that traffic report gets to my
house it does a thing I didn't have to
do anything I didn't even have to know
there was traffic you know maybe by the
time I get in the car or I wake up and
there's a dashboard next to my bed and
it says late coffee's ready cars ready
but I shouldn't have more stress at my
day because of other events we can
automate and keep those out of the way
we may or may not control the service
right I may have a service I may have a
service that alarm service my house why
do I even need to have the thing in my
house why should I even have to worry
about it why do I need the little pin
code thing in the house I've got me my
phone
we have recognition stuff I can walk
into the house in and out armed armed
kids are coming in and out their arm not
armed we may have to have a chip put in
to us right but we may or may not
control them so we have to change what
we think of a service we have to be able
to create service fabrics right how can
I take one service the traffic reporting
service and connect it into another
service right well we've got to expose
end points this sounds a lot like so ax
right I have to be able to expose the
thing that I'm producing and I have to
be able to take it put it somewhere else
and have it bad value and it do its
thing and the whole thing know about
each other and hold state we have to
take the composite of the things
together and make something bigger out
of it right it isn't just like my
example where one thing happens it
causes another and causing another and
causes another there might be collective
knowledge that's gained and forced
change across multiple things right it's
only going to happen if we have shared
devices shared value shared service
right but this idea that there will be
multiple services shared service gateway
market right now we're pretty much
thinking home gateway or home
entertainment gateway well that gateway
is going to do a lot more than that it
could be the security gateway the health
gateway the home gateway a lot of other
things at once they're all going to
reside on the same infrastructure right
so how do you share that together and of
course once you talk about services
you're also going to be talking about a
lot of infrastructure and how do you
bind them in right how many people know
what cep is complex event processing not
just the acronym okay right CP is a
technology that's been looking for a
problem
right it never really took off except
for very very small areas this is a
great opportunity for CEP how do I take
a number of different disparate events
look at them through a window and be
able to pull out value how do i send
that value up so that I can put it into
a bigger bucket where we've collected
these little bits and artifacts of
information together right so when we're
designing systems and we're creating
services we have to be able to integrate
them into a larger system all of this
has to tie back into all the 80s
availability serviceability scalability
we're not going to get away from that in
fact in some cases it'll be worse right
lifecycle management right how are we
going to be able to take something that
isn't necessarily under our control is
made up of different things and revit
right and push out new functionality to
different devices this actually could
end up being a nightmare right I have a
sensor on my wall three services depend
on it I need to go to the newest version
for it to still work with one of the
services that runs over here okay but if
i upgrade that then it'll break on the
other two services right we're talking
about all this stuff and we're saying
all these wonderful things with my
example controlling lights doing this
the rest of it well it's going to get
complex right and we have to be able to
have kind of a common way to manage
things cloud not a cloud and on and on
so these things are going to be added on
top of it as well so talk a little bit
about Java you're here two days
everybody saw this slide hopefully this
is an older version that has more text
on it right well
when we're thinking about services and
we're thinking about complexity and
we're thinking about scale and we're
thinking about fragmentation in the
market right the industry is looking
forward vendors leadership but also
technology just raw technology that is
going to come together and work to help
to fix this right we've see we have seen
this movie before write Java has already
come in and helped out on the enterprise
application application development you
know we heard some of that this morning
so for us we're taking a playbook that
worked well before right how do you take
job as a platform middleware shrink it
down and adapt it to the special Pacific
needs of the embedded space and that's
what you were here for and that's what
this conference was about to start
talking about and getting ideas out
there so that we could get feedback
we've already started we've taken the
first couple of steps we're going to be
providing building blocks right to
tackle some of that complexity and to
provide infrastructure so that people
can more easily design and build
services you know to design and build
multiple things can run on the same
infrastructure to bind in all of these
different devices and bring them in from
a vendor perspective people who are
designing and delivering things it is
faster time-to-market with java than
without java right reduce the complexity
of development reduce the amount of
testing it takes introduce repeatability
both of code and process into your
environment and we'll deliver value and
continue to deliver value and add more
value right java has done this an
infrastructure for a long time and I
have some of those things here as well
so you've seen probably the small medium
large slide several times right we
introduced a new product that came down
to that small region we could
week well we are taking into
consideration the different aspects of
these devices at their size for their
function for what they do and making
sure that job is able to adapt to them
as well right so we know this isn't a
one-size-fits-all proposition for Java
and that of course maps to our product
portfolio and how are delivering it
there's more to jaavan than just
technology right weird next-door to what
is effectively the largest developer
ecosystem in the world certainly in the
world it's the largest developer
ecosystem that's ever existed in IT
right how do we take Java resources that
are out there and map them to what we're
doing and make that make sure that that
value that they can bring can also come
into it but we have that ecosystem it
already exists and that's a key part of
this right our stewardship now Oracle
has spent a lot of time and
consideration and investment to make
sure that Java is not only thriving but
is in a really good position to take on
the challenges of the future and we're
looking at it from not only the
enterprise space but also the embedded
space and and that's also a change it's
a change for us it's a change for the
community right because we're taking
Java taking the values that we had and
we're kind of transforming it as well so
that we can take the goodness that's
already been established either
historically within the embedded space
and where Java existed or lessons that
we've learned from the enterprise side
and partnerships they talked about
yesterday as well
one of the most interesting things for
me when I came into Oracle I actually
still thought Oracle was a database
company in 2007 when I joined and I
didn't realize and appreciate the amount
of technology that Oracle had acquired
and I commend before be EA and son so
there was all kinds of additional
technology that came in and was acquired
after I came in so there's a lot of
technology within Oracle that's built on
Java that we can bring to bear for the
embedded space right and as you heard
today middleware was introduced a week
of go I know on the demo grounds the
event processing that I just mentioned
there's also a demo running on SE
embedded so we'll take IP and components
that we have and recycle them repurpose
them to fit into the embedded space and
the embedded story that we're evolving
and then there's everything else Oracle
does backend system clouds you know
there's a lot of technology here that
Oracle will bring to bear behind Java so
we know that there are challenges we
know that things are changing I think I
certainly don't want to lose sight of
the infrastructure that we're building
what we're doing to provide development
and developers the tools that they need
to build the things that are up top
that's what we can't lose sight of
services and applications we have to be
able to develop infrastructure that
allows people to be more flexible in
what they do right we don't know right
now what services are going to be built
and deployed we don't it's all anecdotal
it's all what what people are coming up
with them what they're delivering now
the thing that we do know is that we
don't know so we have to make sure that
we're not building things that will
prevent us from you from being able to
develop and deliver future services in
order to take advantage
the huge opportunity right and we do we
have a huge opportunity so that was a
relatively quick walkthrough of my deck
I'd really be happy and and enjoyed if
we could open it up for questions this
is that interactive part I was telling
you about because I'll go off my deck
and talk about the conference and what
you thought of it and what people learn
well I would I wonder and I i wonder if
things that don't have to have human
intervention can be much more simple to
design and make right we tend to put a
gazillion features and buttons on pretty
much everything we build right I mean it
you know everything from office to
remote controls to cars to whatever we
have like incredible feature itÃ­s right
and so I absolutely you know and and and
by the way eat well and that's the other
thing anything that's a service that's
going to involve human intervention will
be inherently more complex because of
choice right and and I think part of it
is how do we extend services so that
they have an impact but they're
transparent like a great service like I
said you shouldn't even know about you
know do I think about my electricity
service know once a month right when you
get a bill or when it's I
wave but SB state starts coming from the
food revolution those who who those are
great devices that can seamlessly and
without human intervention communicate
and work well with other devices
definite with the people who do the
old-style software you have to open a
file and change anything they're gonna
die well I bet there will be more apples
right we want to a choice okay I'm going
to squeeze questions out of here not one
sec
to be repurposed
enterprise services that well when you
put it that way not off the top of my
head give me an a give me an example of
what you mean by an enterprise service
while I think
okay yeah that's the notion of micro
decisions versus macro decisions and I
think there'll be two categories of them
on the edge one are things that we do
and decisions that are driven out to the
edge for the simple purpose of reducing
data right so we should be aggregating
filtering deciding what's relevant or
not relevant as much as possible on a
very dumb little stupid sensor not going
to be possible but where we can put a
little more business logic in to tell
intelligence possible right and then the
second category of things that we're
going to push out is where they are
going to be able to make a decision
based on other things that are local to
them and not have to go up right and
especially if you have a mixed
environment you may not have the control
of another thing within that environment
to send the data back up to make a
decision right as you can see services
human V agree that we are we changing
because this means i won't behave i want
my temperature to work at this level in
my home p at this level you suddenly
feel that some are getting longer and
which of the getting colder i probably
wanna enjoy event of this winter last
two winters so how in this company of
services the ability to have booths
being is changing in the services as you
change of the first also add even more
complexity to and how you need to let it
be like oh my jah maica right then that
they have to adapt yeah it'll be you
know we may not have seen all of that
though Simon I'm sure you have a
question in the back okay how is when I
throw up the challenges here what are
people seeing out there I know there are
a bunch of people from our organization
pick on Brian that they are seeing as
challenges that you know in addition to
these or other challenges
to bridge those rivets between different
players Mike respected that I think the
point of interoperability and standards
whether medical device enough
combination he'll have their own
standard five going to make that to work
with them to try to reduce the
complexity yeah well in that I mean if
we just take me our own standards body
with Java you know that's that's part of
the point and I was in one of the I was
at a press briefing yesterday and and
the guy that runs the ee engineering had
said actually part of the new the new
spec that they're putting forward is to
drop a lot of j srs right and they're
not going to drop them completely out
but they're going to make them optional
because they are actually adding weight
to the specification in there adding
complexity to the specification they
were written a long time ago they may
not even be relevant now right so so yes
i do think we have standardization will
be a way to do some of that and i would
hope that that that the market will
drive to simplification itself because
their urgency to get so simplification
will be a result of wanting to get
adoption you know and it's the same
thing with this eyelid piece if
organizations see money here all the
sudden silos kind of break down fast
like that as well Josh or make the late
service you know all those pieces your
alarm clock weather all those pieces are
applications that don't necessarily open
up a few guys allowance of the exposure
services and there's a mindset around
frame and application that does a
certain thing like whether a weather
application is very different than a
weather service right so it's not just
about the corporation's viewing the
money but also saying okay well somebody
might trace them out I don't know why
should be playing to expose my
functionality or my service as well
that's right Tomas
new revenue
if we recall the hardware however they
made their own complication therefore by
manufacturers on a drink too stable they
can make a difference
and I'm trying to try to control
everything ok any other questions it's a
good discussion
there are other challenge they're needed
their universe
smaller
very good job
well I I don't be when you say to help
them overnight to to create an ecosystem
or to create something yeah well I don't
know that it's that that's the point of
Java is to help them do that Java should
be enabling technology to help them get
their idea off the ground so that then
they could they could build an ecosystem
but Java per se i'm not so sure right
right well I guess I when you say create
an ecosystem an ecosystem of what people
using their devices or right well I
don't know about that I like the burden
of maintaining and growing I mean that
effectively that's what a lot of open
source initiatives which are built on
among other things Java have helped
people do right
it also happens organically write a one
of the guys I work with sent me a link
last week he's got the whole Kickstarter
fetish and likes following new ideas and
what people are throwing in there and
one of them is a little it's they've
made a compact fluorescent light bulb
which has Wi-Fi in it so you say okay
big deal well put all these in your
house they can change color and they can
be dimmable so you don't have to put in
dimming switches and they have an app so
from your phone you can have mood
lighting and say you know friday night
at eight when the kids are in bed i want
to go to read and dim it down right turn
the music on and they when when he and i
spoke he actually knows one of the guys
that's involved and they part of that
project they actually didn't know that
Java now could fit down to that small
thing and and now they're they're
actually going to take a look and try
and do to see with that in and there was
a there's a second project as well they
built a device they didn't even don't
Java was part of it right so there's an
awareness issue as well go back up
whatever time in the morning program and
so my wife and no idea what
why what I want to never want another
system except that you don't know what
you don't actually have and I think
that's the point the conveniences that
are available like what she wakes up in
the morning the Cubs are you ready hot
to the exact temperature degree cheap
repo rate so it's just kind that's where
this is going what is available we don't
even know what you have right and Mike's
not tracking them down to see if they're
using Java 2015 20 and 40 so let us
assume that these visually is in the
right direction because this wheel has
been there even 1998 at that time Apple
was not there people are not aware of
this app stores and all those things so
based on these projections how how we
would be market let us a pic one data
point to other 15 2020 that is one
question let us assume that it is a few
minutes of hundreds of millions they are
behind them if for hundreds of billions
it is not only order a lot of other
people also look into this the
opportunity right yep so what would we
see the computing platform for java if
we 100 billion dollars let us IQ x 20 40
right these are hypothetical question
yeah yeah sure well I so there's two
ways to answer that right now currently
there with the additional last product
there is no other technology right now
that can span very small devices to very
large devices right so Microsoft has my
Windows Embedded which has a fit in one
place some of the operating systems guys
are coming up and bringing more value
with embedded things so and of course
there's there's a lot of native code out
there right there's a lot of C and so
right now I I don't I can't see another
framework being able to do you can't
just invent Java overnight and the IP
and whatever that doesn't mean we Oracle
won't have competition though there
won't be alternatives in fact just the
opposite i hope what we do because you
know competition breeds success as they
say
so I don't think and I even think you
know 2015 is closer than you think right
I think 2000 by 2020 sounds like enough
time for more stuff to change I think
the important thing is within the last
two or three or four or five years
Moore's Law is hitting the embedded
space hard and fast right and and the
biggest change that I think I'm looking
at is how is that going to drive
consolidation such that people will also
start coming together and getting onto a
couple of platforms or alternatives
instead of a gazillion right so that and
connectivity I think are going to drive
the biggest amount of change right and
the in connectivity itself is going to
be limited right the carriers are
terrified by this coming you know on the
one hand they want it and they want to
make money off it but they modeled their
infrastructure based on text messaging
and voice right and data coming from
computers right but it's like tear up
the model and and move on right so they
already know that the infrastructure
they're putting in place will be
inadequate what do you call me they was
like yeah last year if you see the
number of people schools again via I
don't know a lot but this year you hear
m3m from each and every CEO from a major
event yeah sure but for me that's hype
cycle right you know the hype cycle but
yeah it's a nice big whoo and we're
we're kind of in the curing cancer phase
at the top of the hype cycle that right
and then you fall down and you hit the
trough of disillusionment and that's
when we're going to start really
integrating and piecing these things
together and and probably repeat a lot
of the in mistakes we've been doing for
20 years and we'll of teething and we'll
go through it we're definitely at the
hype cycle piece but it is good the
thing is this this industry is very
funny right
we there you know XML was going to cure
everything you know take your pick on on
what hyped technology was going to cure
everything some of them stick some of
them don't I think this one has to
because there are just too many forces
and things coming together to prevent it
and so anyone else sure right
but in general lot of people don't
realize is
and the question is it is that an issue
yeah yeah that absolutely is right look
but it's it's also like anything else
where technology ships emphasis in one
area or applicability in one area to
another right and you know as none any
had mentioned earlier today you know
Java card and its pervasiveness is
probably like the most pervasive unknown
technology other than like who makes the
glass on a glass fiber cable under the
streets I mean it really is that way I
think the work that we are doing tapping
into the developer community you know
there's a reason why this conference was
here next to Java one and not down the
hill at open world you know I would like
to see this conference grow with your
helps such that you know we are really
also drawing in and evolving the
developers across the street to take
interest in EM where and how they can
affect things and also will push content
out the other way and we have you know I
have an evangelist team on my team and
we're plugged into the user groups so
we're also now that we have our plan
sorted out we're delivering on things
will also push it out into the ecosystem
but certainly awareness is going to be
one of the key things it has to get done
anybody else we there okay very very
good thank you for coming to the
conference by the way and to my talk in
particular and safe travels wherever
you're going back and hopefully we'll
see you all next year thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
