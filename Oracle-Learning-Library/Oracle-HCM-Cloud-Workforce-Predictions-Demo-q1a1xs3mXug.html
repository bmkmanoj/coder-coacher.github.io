Oracle's workforce predictions in HCM
cloud voluntary termination performance
protections are made using the data
mining features of Oracle's advanced
analytics and then those predictions are
integrated into Oracle's HCM cloud
product for your convenience workforce
predictions are currently available to
line managers using HCM cloud however in
future they'll be open to HR specialists
as well before I start the demo I'm
going to address some frequently asked
questions about predictive analytics
firstly I'm often asked about how
predictions are made we use around 80
attributes from within Oracle's HCM
cloud some are simple like the workers
manager or their pay increase and others
are more complex like the change in the
workers sickness or the ratio of their
pay to others on the same grade in the
same country the data mining software
assesses those attributes and looks for
patterns in the data it tests itself
against a subset of the data and
calculates its accuracy it then makes
predictions based on the observed
patterns the accuracy of those
predictions tends to increase over time
the second question I'd like to address
is around the viability of such
technology people often feel that it's
too new and untested
however this couldn't be further from
the truth predictive analytics are all
around us all the time
retail sites predict what we'd like to
buy next based on our purchase history
or even our browsing history social
sites target adverts based on our
predicted interests based on our
browsing history criminal behavior is
predicted in the US UK and Italy leading
to a measurable reduction in crime visa
has predicted impending divorce based on
our spending habits and target predicted
a pregnancy before anyone else other
than the mother new predictive analytics
are already here and their tried and
tested
Oracle's workforce predictions are
currently available to line managers
using Oracle's HCM cloud product you
access workforce predictions work area
from the my team menu the work area
opens to show the predicted voluntary
termination in other words the
likelihood that workers will voluntarily
leave and the predicted performance
plotted in a chart the person markers
represent individuals or teams the size
represents the size of the team you can
hover over a marker to view the team
size and the average predictions for
that team notice that the chart is color
coded the green area indicating high
predicted performers and low predicted
levers and the red area indicating the
opposite controls across the top of the
page allow you to refine the display if
we select a team marker we can view the
most important factors contributing to
each prediction across the whole team in
this case the most recent salary change
is the main contributing factor to
voluntary termination
changing the group by two none will
display individuals rather than teams
show table will display the results in a
table rather than a graph if you select
a marker you can then view additional
details about the worker you can view
the reasons behind the predictions and
their relative strengths
you can also access an extremely
powerful feature of Workforce
predictions when you have an individual
selected you can perform what-if
analysis selecting a worker from the
what-if analysis tab displays the
factors in descending importance to
voluntary termination you can use this
pop-up to view the impact of changes to
an individual without actually making
those changes in the system so in this
example we'll increase the amount they
could have received and their latest
salary change click apply and you'll see
now that the predicted voluntary
termination has dropped from 13 percent
to zero and predicted performance from
68 to 100 it's possible to save this
course of action for later use
in addition to the line manager work
area there are also a couple of
analytics that can be added to the
manager resources dashboard we're often
asked if it is possible to change the
attributes that are used to make the
predictions and the answer is of course
yes we have provided a set up task
it's called manage HCM predictive models
and it allows you to view the trend in
model accuracy and also allows you to
change the attributes that are used to
make each prediction you can only change
the what-if parameters of attributes
marked as predefined and you can also
remove attributes predefined attributes
from the model new attributes must be
based around an existing database item
group of which there are thousands when
you are happy with the attributes to be
used in a model you can calculate the
predictions and once that process is
complete you can see whether your the
changes you made any difference to the
accuracy of the model in summary then
workforce predictions provides accurate
system predictions of who is likely to
leave and who is likely to perform these
predictions are based on tried and
tested advanced analytics that are
already all around us today thank you
for taking the time to watch this demo
