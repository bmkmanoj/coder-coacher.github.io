Enterprise Manager 12c cloud control
release 3 and some of the features that
are available for managing and
monitoring ex oolitic systems and
machines we'll start here on our ex
oolitic systems homepage and we can see
on the right side of the screen we have
a software dashboard and we'll get back
to this later we'll start by looking at
the target navigation panel on the left
side we can see the top level we have
our X oolitic system and though we
support both virtual and physical
deployments the one we're looking at
today is a physical deployment with one
XO lyrics machine so as we drill down
here into the XO lyrics machine level we
see the information on this page based
on this single machine and it's been a
virtual deployment we would have seen
the aggregated information for all the
various virtual guests that would be
running on this extra little machine
this page is fully customizable and you
can add or remove regions that you're
interested or not interested in to build
your own customized excellence machine
home page the third level down is the
host level and here we'll get some
information on the actual XOX host we
can see some Diagnostics information if
we had any incidents of configuration
changes there's some general
configuration information about IP
address the amount of memory in this
machine as well as the actual Hardware
model we also see some key performance
metrics here we see CPU and memory
utilization as visualizing the two
graphs here on the top we also see file
system and network usage and utilization
further down at the bottom we have the
number of incidents and problems that
have occurred on this XO lyrics machine
and we also have any potential
compliance standard violations listed
here let's go back to our ex oolitic
systems homepage the software dashboard
is designed to give a quick overview of
the health and status of it systems as
well as providing some key performance
metrics we can see here on the top we
have a region for our business
intelligence components as well as our s
base server following that we have our
weblogic domains as well as our time ten
instances we also have a region for the
host
and at the very bottom we have a region
for the incidents and problems that
might have occurred on this system let's
dig a little deeper into the performance
pondering available for our excel lytic
system and look at the performance
summary page the performance summary
page is a user build dashboard with the
metrics that you're interested in by
clicking the metric palette over here we
can see a listing of all the various
metrics that are available for the
components on this X oolitic system by
checking a checkbox in front of the
metric will add a graph for that metric
you can also drag and drop a metric from
one component onto a metric chart from a
different component to do correlation
between the components running on our
system we can also use the slider up
here to change the time period we're
looking at or we can use the quick links
to the 15 minute or two hour time
periods now we can also save that the
chart we have here in case you want to
have a few different charts that we want
to be able to quickly access another new
feature is the routing topology viewer
the routing topology viewer gives us a
graphical representation of the
relationships and dependencies between
our X holidays components and we can use
this to navigate around our system and
from here we can drill into the various
instances and we can get more
information about the metric history we
can also get more information on the job
activity the incidents as well as some
configuration for this component you can
also use the arriving topology viewer to
quickly isolate in the incidence or
problems that might have occurred and
see how they potentially can impact
other components that they are dependent
on or have relationships with so we're
using the search and filter up here or
example by clicking on this one critical
incident we have up here we can see that
the target with is critical incidents
get highlighted and all the other
targets get grayed out so you can
quickly see and find this target in our
topology the last thing we'll look at is
the configuration management
in addition to performance metrics
Enterprise Manager also collects
configuration properties and will change
the configuration management to browse
through the collective configuration
profits for all our components in this X
oolitic system we can also use this
basis for comparison with another
accelerating system and see what
differences to our information between
the two systems it's also possible to
save a snapshot of the configuration if
we have a point in time where we know
the configuration is good I'm going to
go back and compare with this
configuration to see if anything has
changed we'll save a snapshot and then
we'll compare at a later time our
current configuration with this
historical snapshot you can also go in
and search the repository and see how
things have changed historically and we
can see here for our system that we've
had a number of creation changes over
the last seven days and we can use these
to drill into them and see what actually
changed and at what time they did change
this is extremely useful in case you see
performance issues for example and you
want to go back and see if there are any
configuration changes that might be
correlated to the performance issues you
see and that concludes this demo thanks
