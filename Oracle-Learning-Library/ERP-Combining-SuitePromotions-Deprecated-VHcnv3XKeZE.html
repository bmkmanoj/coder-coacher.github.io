new combining options available with
sweet promotions we will see how each of
the options impact the best offer logic
when promotions are applied to a
transaction sweet promotions allow you
to stack multiple promotions on the same
transaction we can also determine
exactly which promotions can or can't be
combined with others the following
options are available when you have the
new sweet promotions feature enabled
combined herbal promotions exclusive
promotions item line exclusive
promotions or the type exclusive
promotions and shipping type exclusive
promotions let's take a quick look at
each of these options combined herbal
promotions can be stacked or combined
with any other promotion that the
transaction is eligible for to
illustrate say we have an order that
includes one scarf that costs $10 and
several promotions that can be applied
to the order all the promotions are
combined able so they are all applied
started with item promotions then order
promotions and finally shipping but what
happens if we make one of our promotions
exclusive this means the promotion
cannot be combined with any other
promotion in our example let's make the
$5 off scoffs promotion exclusive this
means we have two choices we can apply
the exclusive promotion and remove the
other three or we can keep the others
and remove the exclusive promotion if
Auto apply is used the best offer logic
will apply the promotion or promotions
that provides the best offer to the
customer after considering any shipping
costs in our example the exclusive
promotion is applied and all other
promotions are removed
if instead we make the 20% off the
spring collection promotion exclusive
the best offer logic would remove this
promotion and combine the remaining
available promotions we can however have
even greater control of which promotions
are exclusive Auto type exclusive
promotions simply cannot be combined
with any other combined herbal promotion
that offers discounts at the order level
so if we have two ordered side
promotions that can be applied to a
transaction one of them is an order type
exclusive promotion we keep the
promotion offering the best discount to
the customer and the other is not
applied shipping type exclusive
promotions working exactly the same way
they cannot be combined with other
promotions that offer discounted
shipping while order and shipping type
exclusive promotions focus on
exclusivity based on the type of
promotion item line exclusive promotions
are concerned specifically with the item
receiving the discounts this means that
item promotions may still be combined if
they do not discount the same item so
let's see what happens if we make our $5
of the scalf's promotion and item line
exclusive promotion now the promotion
cannot be combined with other promotions
of a discount on the same item which
means in this example any of the
promotion offering discount on scarfs
the spring collection promotion includes
scarfs
as well as blouses therefore we cannot
combine these two promotions we keep the
promotion with the best offer plus the
order type and shipping type promotions
it's important to note however that we
can still apply other item type
promotions to illustrate let's add a red
blouse to our order this blouse is part
of the spring collection promotion and
also eligible for another item type
promotion for red blouses in this case
all the promotions remain but the $2
discount on scarfs as part of the spring
collection promotion would not be
applied thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
