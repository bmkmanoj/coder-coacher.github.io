as a diabolical developer was anyone
here at my session last year a few of
you so that you'll know what to expect
so there are a number of complaints last
year that I had told a bunch of
nefarious lies and I was told this year
to bring along someone else who would
actually tell some truths so I brought
with me my colleague Ben Evans good
morning
it's good to see so many of you here
it's kind of cool on the usual
punishment that we're all here at 8:30
and there wasn't even any coffee outside
I mean how do they expect us to function
so I hope I will be able to do something
to counteract the the dastardly and
diabolical influence of my colleague
here over the next hour fortunately we
know that it's the time of the day when
when brains are not working ever so
quickly
so we won't expect too much code and too
much hard thinking out of you yeah maybe
we promise there's no closure in here
see anyone code closure you know Lisp
yes yeah as always one of the front
fantastic so this is a closure this is a
closure talk for those of you who didn't
realize yes right lock the doors please
they're all stuck now so what are we
gonna talk about today we are going to
talk today about the ongoing NT
developments there are patents that are
anti patterns in software development so
last year I spoke I had a bit of a
lighthearted talk shall we say about
some of the evil things that you
developers love to do to your colleagues
in order to stay in your jobs and we
just thought would continue the theme
this year but perhaps actually give a
little bit more serious advice this time
on how you can get around your evil
colleagues because you know it takes one
to know one
say we have your own private house so
shall we ask them to give million so
yeah so so basically over the course of
the talk you know we're gonna we're
going to cover a whole bunch of
different anti cut-ins but we thought
we'd start off by making you think just
a little bit so who wants to shout out
some of the anti patents that they they
see in the code and we'll see if we get
to them all yeah over here
Oh an empty seat okay that doesn't
matter to count as an anti patent but
it's the empty armory was down empty
seat community Peten yeah
good well that won't be it's just like a
remote worker that does no work yes good
to us is going on Stanton what does your
cut what if your colleagues done to you
last week that you just nest your teeth
and went there that's horrible
oh yes okay there's nothing wrong with
their statements they're really easy to
follow I don't know what you're talking
about love a strategy pattern too if
statement yes so I think okay I think
I've actually got a utility that does
that okay I relate any others on who
there was somebody here yep
go for it empty test block Oh empty
catch block and get yeah yes
that's one we were actually discussing
this yesterday with a bunch of people it
has if you came to the deadlocks talk
yesterday that deadlock slab yeah yeah
we know exactly what will be Eric reacts
look perfect it's a great way to did
lock your entire machine by having empty
cache blocks good stuff ah visit a
patent a big switch isn't it a big
switch brilliant classes with 1500
constants why what's the problem with I
can't think of like a big open source
project that would do that can you my
taint no no not one at all that I might
happen to be involved in um 1,500
concepts I think there's a pretty good
start so we'll try and cover those off
towards the end of the talk I think a
couple of those are actually kind of
present from no go so she would you
offer centigram will go for our first
and he fed the first anti pet mean
you've seen it all this week conference
driven delivery yep
so he's done a talk at a conference or a
lightning talk at their local user group
yeah you wrote it literally 10 minutes
before you had to go speak it's the only
way forward so anybody who is thinking
that they might suggest that this talk
was an example of this anti patent and
that would be nice and that it wouldn't
it well we have someone you should be
talking to desk guy easy our trained
killer otter notice the sharp teeth yeah
and he is running around this room
somewhere so you just keep an eye on
under your chair if you hear a
high-pitched yipping noise and so
there's someone said too much coffee or
it's this guy
so I like to say the real professionals
and you would have heard some of them
talking last night at some of the
parties I personally like the pressure
of having to deliver 10 minutes before I
have to speak and I think that people
tend to work best under pressure so I
always argue especially if you're doing
a keynote at JavaOne or perhaps you're
Larry Ellison during the Oracle
OpenWorld keynote get those slides
started probably about 25 minutes before
you've got to do your talk thirdly if
you're hungover yeah 30 if you're
hungover that's certainly the way to go
people think I'm right and so if you
think and if you think we think we're
right but this is the way to write talks
excellent extra glad to see the gospel
is spreading few disciples in all
seriousness who knows what this stands
for
the six six peas peas no milk no
ex-military people here no yeah okay it
stands for proper preparation prevents
piss-poor performance right and it's an
old adage that the the people of the
military of use for quite some time and
it is certainly true when it comes to
preparing your presentations not just
for conference speaking but for
presentations you've got to give your
colleagues presentations you've got to
give to your bosses because you have to
remember that communicating is really
really important probably making more
important than the code you write
interesting enough yeah it's it's one of
those strange things that the more you
you give a talk and more you get
comfortable with speaking in front of
groups of people the easier it gets so
it's always good to do at least a couple
of run-throughs of the talk just dry
runs if you if you're going to be giving
a talk at a conference then make sure
you and you know maybe set up a user
group meeting hands up if you're a
member of a Java user group anywhere in
the world okay that's interesting so for
people who aren't I'd really like to
know why because one of the things we're
trying to do is to is to boost
attendance and to get the word out about
user groups so if you want to come and
talk to me afterwards and tell me you
know what the barriers are which stop
you from attending because you know
they're great ways to practice your
speaking skills get new skills getting
your contacts to network
so whatever it is that's holding you
back from joining I'd really like to
hear it so so come on talk to me yeah we
were talking about test-driven
presentations you can literally test
drive it yourself record yourself on a
google hang up record yourself and a
Skype conversation and just listen back
to yourself how you're giving a
presentation so if you're if you're shy
initially of even talking in front of a
few people start with that then start
with a group of a few of your friends or
maybe boy your partner or your wife or
your husband to death with your
technical talk and go on from there and
it's amazing what you can what you can
find out just by watching a cell speak
you know the pacing the particular
mannerisms of speech it's it can be
horrendous the first time you do it
because used to oh god do I really sound
like that but you get over it remarkably
quickly and it's one of the best ways to
to improve your own speaking confidence
alright so that was a bit of a myth one
but on to number two now I know we first
we should we should we do of I
constantly number two this is my
favorite really mortgage driven
development hands up of you you know
what movies driven development means a
few people yeah okay who here practices
a artistic all right well obviously we
have got tough economic times folks
we're in a recession around the world
everyone's worried about keeping their
jobs so what you have to make sure is
that knowledge is power okay
do not share anything you know about
your system or your software with any of
your colleagues right because when it
comes time to fix a problem in
production you're the only person who
knows how to fix it which means you're
an invaluable cog in the machine and you
can't be fired don't tell me that you'd
actually you know advocate I don't know
restricting access to source control oh
absolutely yes if you can get into the
the team the IT architects team that
controls source control and make sure
that all patrons have to go through you
first more power to you that's fantastic
what about documentation no
documentation is allowed anywhere if you
must have documentation of someone
insists on seeing it put it on a USB
stick afterwards take it home with you
lock it in a lockbox
seriously the best way to secure your
career in these times is to make sure
you communicate properly with your with
your peers with the stakeholders with
your business and documentation is a
very important part of that up until
recently one of the largest DNS
providers we're still running a DNS
demon that had a comment in the source
code which said if you don't understand
what happens next you shouldn't be
looking at my code I think there was a
hand up over here yeah hi absolutely
source control on your USB stick because
you should really have folders called
ABCD efg if you need to have more than
26 revisions just go a 1 you get the
idea right yeah so you could be a cave
troll but as we as we go through our
development careers we find that more
and more it's about the social
interactions it's it's crazy how much
software development is not about the
technical aspects of the craft but is
about the communication aspects it just
seems to get more and more so each year
and that means that the developers who
communicate best are the ones that are
going to have the most success he has a
github account okay yeah point proven
right hands up if you know what github
is because actually had a few people the
other day who didn't okay
so github social coding it's it's is it
on the tin right perfect all right hands
up hands up who thinks that wall which
room development is an anti-pattern now
and who thinks it's a pattern I think
it's a patent ok cool next one
distracted by shiny now we're all
technical people here and I don't know
if you saw in the technical keynote the
Raspberry Pi and that cool little
encasing a head and the first thing I
wanted to do was was get the hell out of
that keynote and go down and play with
one right so I think that's also very
important your day job you're not there
to work for your boss you're not there
to work for your customers you're there
to work for yourself and keep yourself
excited so pick up that latest framework
try out a bit of Scala try out a bit of
closure use that latest bit of html5 you
know wipe wipe off that stupid Windows
installation they gave you and put you
know a decent Linux distribution on
there
preferably something obscure and you
know keep yourself happy you might even
get yourself on Hacker News which is
what we all want to do right so always
use the latest tech always upgrade to
the very latest point release versions
of everything don't worry about the fact
that you know Apple's iOS Maps sucks you
know you're on the latest and greatest
so you're ahead you're ahead of the
curve winning too soon we have an Apple
fanboy in the room get out okay so how
do we counteract the the nefarious
effects of distracted by shiny
well you post type in evaluate there is
a place of new technology innovation is
one of the lifeblood of our industry and
of our careers but at the same time
there's also the question of consistency
you know you shouldn't whack something
in to your architecture just because you
feel like it there should be sound
reasons for everything you know that the
number of architectures that I've seen
which littered with things which the
developers clearly put in because they
thought they were a good idea yeah and
you go right through the changelog and
you realize that it was just that it was
half of it was added on Friday afternoon
when people were bored do people here
have to evaluate web frameworks fairly
often I find this was quite a common one
so if you do have to evaluate freight
web frameworks where you're trying to
pick up the next wid framework or even
just any next technology you want to
pick up go take a look at met rables
comparison spreadsheet and presentation
on SlideShare okay he shows you how to
go through in the space of about half a
day or a day and evaluate things on
twenty criteria okay and you pick in
prototype from there and then actually
implement okay a cup its met Raible so M
a TT is first name arrival last name Rai
BL e yeah apologies for the lack of the
URL but you I can give it to anyone
afterwards and there's also there's a
great blog post which if people haven't
read then they definitely should called
why the good technologists make bad
technology choices and it lists the five
main reasons why decent developers and
decent technical people can end up
making you know a decision which is bad
for their business you know it's
reasons like boredom desire to have you
know new shiny things on the CV
frustration with existing process lack
of understanding it's it's like two
pages long and it's one of the one of
the best insights into the
decision-making and the cognitive biases
that technologists have yeah we had the
question in one of the boffins yesterday
actually all the day before I think
we're someone's going I want to be able
to combine spring dependency injection
and CDI
just for fun and I want to put it into
my production servers and we're like no
why why are you doing this because it's
interesting yeah yeah at the end of the
day as technologists we're here to solve
actual business problems and provide
value hands up if you work in a
financial or another large corporate
environment okay quite a few people so
does anybody know how long a new piece
of technology on average will stay in
your architecture if once it gets in
anyone take a guess he's good 50 15
years 25 years okay so these are long
periods of time and if you if you work
out what the support cost is for every
line of code and every new technology
which you get into your architecture in
which you can't get out again
you know that's that's a huge cost to
talk to your businesses and the people
you work for for now and for a very long
time into the future we often talk about
the pyramid as people familiar with ona
binney's pyramid now okay so the way
this works is not every piece of code
not every part of technology which goes
into a business system is created equal
if you imagine the a pyramid with
essentially three layers in it and
towards the bottom of the pyramid are
the things which are the longest-lived
you know if you're a financial
institution this is a risk or a pricing
engine you know or some part of the you
know the internal infrastructure of the
of the bank this stuff does not change
very often here is where the code which
is going to stay there for seven or
fifteen or twenty five years that's
where it lives
higher up you see places where more
agile and more flexible technologies can
can fit in because that layer of the
pyramid is stuff where the stuffs
changing on maybe six months maybe three
months you know it's it's web pages for
intranet and customer-facing sites and
then at the very top level you have
stuff
which is potentially changing every day
or every few days so figuring out where
which component you're writing where it
fits into that overall pyramid and how
long its lifespan is is essential when
making technology choices and I'll just
add my personal favorite from the Java
Enterprise space remember when everyone
thought that SOA and soap was a really
good idea yeah how many people still
have to deal with soap how many people
like still dealing with soap on the back
as I said before to the Apple fanboy get
up all right we're gonna go on to number
four another one of my favorites design
driven design who has read the gang of
four patterns design book the people who
were talking about the strategy pen and
a visitor pen if we know who you are how
many of the patterns have you fit in
your code well lots and lots and lots of
them right and if you use UML code
generators like the rational unified
modeling suite from IBM back in the day
fantastic tool you literally type in
strategy MVC session facade pattern JPA
thing comes up in the UML diagram and
you go generate code fantastic now you
see personally I never learnt UML
properly I mean all right I'll play do
it with sequence diagrams in class talk
whenever got that into the whole UML
thing that's because I always secretly
suspected they'd be teaching it in hell
and now I have proof so yeah quite
seriously if you want to impress your
colleagues and impress your bosses and
be able to talk about best practices you
should be using design patterns left
right and center right MVC session for
subs data access objects or SOA all this
great great stuff right and you know the
more jargon you have as well especially
when you're walking past a manager you
just spit out some jargon about the best
practice design patterns you're using
ties back into that mortgage driven
development we were talking about
earlier good good stuff exactly cheating
okay so true story so I was I was
working for financial institution who I
will spare the blushes of and I was
interviewing a guy that had come to us
from an exchange which recently had a
major technology change and this guy
found himself with the wrong skillset so
he'd come to me for a job and I said you
know he seemed to have you know sort of
bad you know he was talking about so I
said can you sort of describe what would
mean what your job is and he said well
you see what what what what I
essentially do is I take patterns from
the insert name of management
consultancy here approved book of
enterprise architecture patterns and
apply them I was just dumbstruck I
couldn't believe that someone would
actually say that it was their job to
root through some approved book of
patterns and just apply them to solve
problems I'm not quite sure how I made
it through the remaining 15 minutes of
that interview before I could politely
ask the guy to leave but I was calling
the war was pretty much straight away
after that that management consultancy
by the way is one of the largest in the
world and incredibly successful business
so I argue personally that he is dead
wrong and they've got it absolutely
right design patterns are definitely the
way to go
so everybody here I hope has done you
know at least a little bit of that sort
of development so yeah it was nothing
good so the idea is that the design is a
separate activity is something which of
course belongs to waterfall with agile
methods you do you know and I'm not you
know a huge believer in the Church of
agile and you know the white robes and
it's kind of a bit like a cult but there
are some good ideas in there and one of
the ideas is that the design represents
a huge cost to the overall development
process so anything which you can defer
and not do right now that's a good thing
and so that leads us the principle of
just design what what you need right now
and we'll add to this as well that you
actually want to promote and incentivize
less code less patterns less frameworks
less boilerplate right so there's a
famous saying that we we quote and we've
been using in our careers is that you
should pay your junior developers for
the lines of code they write and the
things they add and you should pay your
senior developers for what they take
away right and this has actually worked
really well for both Ben and I on our
various careers and the teams we've
we've led is that as over time you
encourage people to take code away and
you encourage change sets that have a
nigga
if the code base gets simpler the code
base reflects the actual business use
cases you're trying to solve as opposed
to just all of us framework plumbing
code okay so go back and think and think
about applying those sorts of techniques
in your day to day coding next week yeah
another another true story from the from
the trenches I was on a project to
decommission a very large system and the
manager who was responsible for it might
manage to get 98% of the way there and
they were very very pleased and they
managed to argue themselves to a very
very nice bonus that year after which
point they immediately left and the
reason why they media left became
apparent the following quarter because
the stuff was running on a huge
mainframe and although they managed to
produce 98% of the system and get rid of
it the 2% that was remaining still
required a mainframe so in fact that 98%
of getting rid of the code equated to
0-0 percent reduction in cost because
you still need an entire mainframe to
run the 2% of the job that was left so
if by not being as aggressive as they
could be and actually making sure that
you get all the last bits of a system
out and refactoring where necessary
you know you sometimes end up carrying
around a huge system burden which you
don't need so being you know very
strongly incentivized to get rid of
source coding to get rid of of whole
subsystems where they're no longer
needed is is a very important thing to
your point this is this is kind of why
we end up with twenty five year life
spans of coding systems it's because
people don't get aggressive about
ripping stuff out so anyone heard of an
open source project called PC gin any
Dungeons and Dragons fans out there
don't be shy yeah well I'm first in the
back yes so it's an open source project
I'm involved with we are proud to admit
we have seven hundred and fifty thousand
lines of Java code alone for some reason
we can't get new volunteers to come on
board our project and help out and we
can't really understand why it's almost
like it's a huge bullet mark yeah all
those so if anyone would like to come
along and gain some practical experience
and reducing a large code base in please
contact me afterwards we could do with
your help
okay so your five Pokemon patterns this
is this is this is a follow-on to the
design driven design so hands up if you
think you know what a Pokemon pattern is
anybody have children yep
yeah okay play fun yeah you've got it
you've got it you don't have a system
which have which contains every single
pattern in it yeah that's right every
single one of them so I mentioned this
before use all of the game for design
pens the spring framework is fantastic
for this has anyone taking a look at the
source code for the spring framework yes
default abstract factory factory beans
singleton this is why rod Johnson built
a two hundred million dollar company and
sold it it's fantastic
he's recently joined typesafe the Scala
folk be very very afraid for Acker and
Schuyler if you're a fan it's but unfair
to rod ez-zor is a friends so it's okay
to needle him I think but yeah again use
all the design pens if you can get
really long class names with lots of
abstract and Factory in there it shows
that you're building a framework and
frameworks last frameworks keep you in a
job ok hands up if you ever written a
framework if you've written more than
three frameworks and hands up if you if
you haven't written a framework but you
think it sounds like a cool thing to do
yeah and that's pretty much everyone out
there we go brilliant all right so the
appropriate design patent is your friend
it with all of these things I think that
one of the one of the one of the
challenges we don't have in programming
is that we can't code quickly enough yo
instead one of the challenges we do have
is that people don't take enough time to
think before they code and and you know
learning what the patterns are the only
one is appropriate time to use one and
not just randomly trying to you know
spew out you know fifteen hundred lines
of code in one day you know is it's the
way to go there's another important
thing that you should really keep an eye
on especially when you're choosing
technology sets and this is something
that we've been learning recently we've
been and I have a small technology
startup together called J clarity so
we've been doing a lot of us recently
is that design pens over time tend to
turn into frameworks they tend to turn
into libraries and then after a little
bit of time yet again actually turn into
being part of the core language itself
keeping an eye on that transition is
actually really really important for you
as technologists because instead of
using the design pattern and having to
write that yourself you should be able
to transition to a framework if people
remember the people you remember the
struts framework for example right who
wrote their own kind of strap see like
thing before struts arrived right and
you were stuck with it for ages because
you just refused to move to struts at
the time so that that's the kind of
transition I'm talking about that you
really need to keep an eye on well and
not only that but as new languages come
out you also get the the the the the
development of the frameworks and
certain ideas which were originally
encapsulated in a pattern turning into a
language feature I mean it's perfectly
possible to write object orientated code
in C but what you end up doing is
constructing V tables and you know crazy
things with function pointers and then
you have to write your code in a very
specific style to take advantage of this
pattern which then later of course in
C++ is completely built into the
language so another example would be so
Java's concurrency which is is you know
it's great it's showing its age somewhat
it's now 15 years old
and we've learned a lot about how to do
concurrency and concurrent programming
since then and so new things like like
akka and closures agents which represent
a much more message-passing style of
concurrency you know but they're they're
things you can you can use from Java but
they require a very you know specific
code style and discipline to not use
threads for everything to let the
platform try to manage your thread pools
as much as you can
whereas newer languages have those those
features built-in by default so over
time this is kind of transition between
a design pattern their style of coding
into a library or framework and then
from there into a core language feature
in some new language and that's that's
kind of an interesting trend to watch
throughout the throughout the industry
so what can you do so here carries
whiteboard markers with them at all
times
yeah good on you sir that's fantastic
anyone else a few a few more of you
right you carry some for any other
reason other than to sniff them from
time to time when they get
I'm person over there all right we got
any security in the room yeah just in
case
yep I'm not kidding people absolutely
deadly serious here Carrie whiteboard
markers with you at all times especially
at your day job right it was one of the
most vital things you can do is to take
five minutes out with your colleagues
and sketch out an idea right don't go to
the keyboard
don't go bashing out code actually write
out first one of those the hell you're
trying to do okay really really vital
it's it's it's amazingly amazingly
important if you want to ever call
yourself a software architect or become
an enterprise architect it's this
combination of being able to whiteboard
in code which is what's going to make
you successful in your career is doing
that and it's also great to to build the
communication within the team one of the
ways you spot really effective teams is
because developers in the teams don't
have massively entrenched positions yes
they fight for their ideas yes they do
you know they can debate but it never
turns into into that level of bad blood
they used to be saying that son that you
make a decision and then you commit and
move on and whenever the decisions were
made even the people you know the
decision went against went with that
decision and accepted it and owned it
you know and it's it's not an easy thing
to do but if you can get to that your
team's become far more effective and
that leads you to the place where
developers can can express ideas and
architectural constructs that they've
come up with without without having a
lot of fear you know so you can you can
bring out you know when you call these
ideas you know you can trust that though
idea is good and then you can verify it
in an atmosphere which isn't hostile and
that's that's a huge step forward to
making your team's a lot more productive
and again from personal experience so
we're doing deep diving jvm performance
tuning stuff for our startup and with
the two guys working for us as both got
PhDs and computer science and
engineering being here has got a
master's degree in mathematics from
Cambridge University our chief scientist
used to work for Cray I'm the stupid guy
in the room right so you can imagine
their sort of high level arguments that
these guys all have and and we will
happily spend an entire day at a
whiteboard to knock something out and
then spend the 35 minutes writing their
code because
we all agree to agree with the idea and
we're all absolutely behind it we can
move on and it's a really valuable thing
to do it's kind of counter to what a lot
of managers would like to see you doing
because I believe you should be at the
keyboard typing away yes I mean our job
is to think our job is not to hit the
keyboard and that it's rare that you'll
find a manager who understands that and
believes it but when you do they're
worth their weight in gold yep typing is
easy part
next one tuning by folklore who here's
had to do some performance tuning yeah
yeah who was actually successful at it
well a few of you that's good today yeah
that's good to hear so how do you how do
you perform this tune what's the what's
the secret magic switch oh yeah that's
right yeah I personally like black
candles I sacrifice some chickens I hope
there's no vegetarians in the room
apologies if you are but this this is
the truth in our industry today right
most people are just out there guessing
okay guy am i plication slow so what do
I do Ben oh I get out the profiler
that's right isn't it it's got to be
somewhere in the code right yeah
absolutely
okay who does that hoop hands up you
know if the first thing you do is reach
for a profiler
when you look up when your code is like
I did this when I first started as well
sure um wrong
so it just flat-out wrong because you
don't know that the problems in the code
it's not the code that's flow
it's systems that are slow and until
you've proved that the the problem
actually is in the code brought leading
rot you pick up the profiler was just
the wrong thing to do because it will
always give you an answer that's what
tools do they give you answers but they
don't tell you that the answer they've
given you is in any way relevant to the
question you asked okay you will always
see a piece of code which comes top of
the profiler which looks to be the
bottleneck okay but what happens if
that's i/o what happens if what's really
keep keeping the code slow is the fact
you've got a slow disk controller on an
NFS server over there somewhere we've
had classic examples where we've had
users whose mouths drivers were slow on
their client machine that was the real
performance problem a network card that
was
half-duplex insert a full duplex okay if
you're not looking at your time budgets
and if you're not actually measuring
what your hardware is doing then you're
not actually measuring you're just
guessing so empirical evidence
Trump's intuition Trump's experience
okay in at Trump's guesswork yeah
developers always think that the
problems code because that's that's what
our stocking traders yeah we basically
we'd go in a path of trying to think
about you know the golden path for our
algorithm and our code paths but when
thinking about performance you actually
need to think much more broadly you need
to think about what else is going on in
the system and what could be causing a
degradation and what all the actors and
all of the moving parts are and that's
that's often a very different sort of
mindset to the one that developers have
by default and there's nothing wrong
with that you know people who are
testers people who are operations people
are sometimes better at doing this stuff
by default but it's a skill that every
developer can learn and because you're
an evil talk run by me
there is a shameless plug so what can
you do come join our little community we
talk about the stuff all the time we
share horror stories with each other and
yeah it's it's damn good fun we aim we
name but we don't shame so we have one
of these earlier than we we certainly
did the deity class otherwise known as
the god class or the Buddha Vista class
or whatever you want to call it who here
has a class and their source code that
is over a thousand lines long can we go
five thousand can we go ten thousand 15
one on 15 20 yes 30 yr goodness me
that's superb give that guy a round of
applause you sir win a bear come click
that from us afterwards so for me
personally I like God classes PC Jim the
open source project I was talking about
before we had one that was 58 thousand
lines of code long it's some idiots gone
and cut that down to about 32 which I'm
really unhappy about and the reason why
because if you ever leave your code in
one file it is easy to find yeah all
right who here has tried to navigate
through their IDE to try and find where
the hell their code path was going I
freaking hate Eclipse and IntelliJ and
NetBeans because I can't
actually follow where my codes going
anymore heaven forbid if you're using
something like springy you have to duck
out the XML you got no idea what's going
on anymore
so grab right grip yeah grip and VY
let's see only you only need to use VY
and you just use grip and I tell you
what I can still heck far faster than
these young kids and their IDs terrible
so who here has heard of the solid
principles you only a few people okay
that's interesting okay so basically
this is an acronym which stands for five
different principles which which all
developers should should be aware of
when when doing design activities so S
stands for SRP the single responsibility
principle hands up if you know what the
single responsibility principle is a few
people okay so okay that's good so
people have you heard of individual
parts of solar today okay it's good oh
is for open / closed which is basically
that the components should be open for
extension but closed and in terms of
encapsulation L is the one that people
always forget hands up in room what the
L stands for the Liskov substitution
principle absolutely hands up if you
know what that it's only a few people
okay I promise you you all know what
this principle is it sounds like
something off Doctor Who but actually
it's not what it really is is it's the
idea that if I have a class then I can
have an instance of a subclass in place
of that that the instance of the
superclass it just means that
inheritance works that's essentially all
that it means but it's got this this
nice fancy name
iOS for interfaces and I hope we all
code interfaces don't we not seeing a
lot of nodding out there that's that is
that's that's not good and the D
Tennessee injection dependency injection
so who here uses dependency injection
who here understands dependency
injection or is it just the magic that
spring does for you hands up it's magic
the spring does for you yeah yeah there
we go one stay in the room today that's
great yeah that is good dependency
injection is an incredibly powerful
technique especially if you are trying
to test or test drive your code
all right so if you haven't looked into
this design principle you know I
strongly suggest you do because it will
actually allow you to test your
components a lot easier and these kind
of awkward situations where you have we
go oh I can't test my database code
because it means I'd have to have my
database up all the time
things like dependency injection will
help you with that it helps you mock out
components and things yeah so do do go
take a few practices more King as part
of their test infrastructure oh that's
all see that is awesome
much better than last year yep fantastic
so what can you do well if you read the
code you know offer a few beers at three
o'clock in the morning and you still
understand it that's that's a good thing
yeah very well this is only half a joke
seriously because most programming is
maintenance programming hands up if
you've ever been on call and you've
actually had to deal with a situation
where you had to deal with an outage at
3:00 in the morning after you've been
drinking and struggle to understand what
the code was telling you yeah that's
both Year's Eve 1999 best pay day of my
life by the way fantastic yep so you can
always get somebody outside of your team
yeah this is this is kind of a hard
thing to mock up you know and you
certainly don't want you know be
drinking while on call as as abroad is
to try to get to this situation but you
could for example just ask somebody else
in a different bit of your organization
but outside your immediate team to just
walk through the code with you you know
it takes 20 minutes from even for a
relatively large system and if they can
follow it and they can understand the
basic principles that's good
the only other piece of advice I'll give
is naming naming naming naming is
absolutely vital right you shouldn't
actually have to even really document
your code base in a lot of cases because
you should just be able to read from
your method names your variable names
your class names your package names what
the heck it is your code base does okay
we actually run what we call a noun
scanner over our code bases and if we
get back from our class names and things
just names like list ArrayList hash map
collection we know we've done something
wrong we're not actually modeling our
domain correctly okay
what we want to have coming out of our
our particular system is things like
performance counters correlations things
that matter to us and our domain is
performance tuning specialists yeah
so number eights Lean Startup ninja
everyone new Lean Startup ninjas in the
room or are we were pirates in here yeah
pirate monkeys okay are we pirates parts
robots ninjas okay the lean startup
ninja and I don't know if you've seen
the YouTube video are you iterating
enough are you afraid enough if you're
not iterating you're not a lean startup
ninja recommend you go check it out
though this is what isalean start-up
ninjas do okay if your code compiles get
it out the door okay let your users be
your testers okay
feedback is important early feedback is
important and your users will love the
honesty of the interaction they have
with you yeah this is it this is a
modern form of the absolute classic anti
patent owners throw it over the wall
yeah in all seriousness through it there
is a little bit of truth to compiled
sequel ship it is actually a principle
we follow in our startup and a lot of
other smart small fast-moving
organizations do actually do this some
large organizations such as Facebook do
this as well they deploy what 20 30
times a day I think yep that's why
Facebook's always broken
there's the in all seriousness
continuous delivery hands up if you if
you practice continuous delivery yeah oh
actually that's pretty clear it's really
good Wow
and what about continuous integration
hopefully she's had some team studies
yeah okay so that's interesting because
when we actually put the product names
in there a few more hands went up so
it's interesting that people knew the
product names we're not necessarily the
general term yeah okay cool and
basically for continuous delivery you
need to make sure that you've got
stakeholders that are properly engaged
if you if you have a large organization
like a bank and you have you have
traders if anyone's ever had to deal
with traders this may not be the best
fit outside of of teams which really get
it so you need to spend time working
with your management working with your
stakeholders to get people bought into
this it can be a huge business enabler
but you need to be aware and conscious
of the costs that it's going to
represent and the things that you'll
need to do
terms of organizational change to get
this to get this implemented you can't
just you know try to do this and and
expect to succeed without understanding
you know the dynamics of the
organization and how it's actually going
to fit with the people that you actually
work with and the key thing here to sell
it to your management to sell it to the
business is that it is actually a
business enabler okay I spent two years
at a very large investment bank doing
this exactly for their risk trading
trading teams and by the end of it the
business could come in in the morning
and say we need to make this change in
the system to react to the Apple IPO or
to the Google IPO or something similar
some some massive large-scale event and
we need it in production in like four
hours can you even physically do this
and after the two years of getting this
continuous delivery pipeline in place
the answer was yes okay and that was
incredibly powerful for the business and
therefore they actually threw a ton of
budget at it to get to get the stuff
done right and IT and business became
closer together
and it was you know a nice sort of joint
organization actually trying to deliver
business value so it does change your
entire organization okay so what can you
do in the meantime okay well you can get
your continuous integration story
straight because one of the building
blocks that you need to get continuous
delivery out there is you need to have a
solid pipeline to build off if you don't
have your continuous integration
pipeline working properly you can't
really do continuous delivery because
there's no where to start from so make
sure that you're your aunt your Gradle
your maven you know it's hooked into
Jenkins or Hudson or team SETI or
whatever continuous integration product
that you're that your company uses make
sure that you have test cases I know I
know I shouldn't need to say that but I
really still do hands up if you do test
coverage and have an automated coverage
tool okay that's that's good that's
about half the room that's a decent
score so yeah so if you don't have a
coverage tool you should think about
getting one there were some open source
options there are some payware versions
there's a whole bunch and to get started
we know it can be difficult to get these
things installed on test servers and
infrastructure inside your large
organizations put it on your own machine
put it on your own laptop start showing
people okay once other people start
seeing the new shiny okay you'll be
amazed how quickly it'll spread three
organization okay
it
you can't get it from if you get
approval from above do it subversively
from below it's easier to apologize in
to ask for permission so when I CD + +
cv + players who here is a contractor or
an independent independent consultant
well not too many of you all permits
okay interesting
well cv + + really is a contractor's
dream and the idea is that you just need
to add more and more technologies to
your CV and how you get those
technologies is by finding jobs where
you can learn on the job so you lie in
your interview scholar of course I know
scholar I heard the book yesterday it's
absolutely fine because chances are it's
someone from the HR department
interviewing you anyway so they're not
going to know any better right then you
use that job to actually learn scholar
on the go edit to your CV and your
salary goes up by another grand a year
fantastic another great indicator for
this is the TOB index do people know
what the TOB indexes kind of indicates
popularity of programming languages by
google searches right it's actually
statistically freaking terrible yeah but
it does give you a little bit of an
indication of where the next wave is
going and the next thing you should be
adding to your CV in all seriousness
there are actually analysts out there
that are doing a decent job of tracking
trends in the industry so hands up heard
of an analyst firm called red monk Wow
ok I ever go check them out yeah if I
seriously yeah probably the one thing to
take away if you don't take away
anything else is to go and look at red
monk and the analysis they're doing we
know that a couple of their main
analysts personally they do actual
proper maths and stuff and their data
science and data analytics is is we
think one of the best out there
yeah sure re d M o NK yep so I guess
what we're really trying to say is just
be good at software development
principles so we talked before about the
solid principles they can apply to any
language that is you know effectively an
object orientated language right so with
you're a c-sharp developer Java
developer dear I said even a Ruby or
JavaScript developer just be good at the
underlying principles the languages the
frameworks you know whether using
hibernate or JPA or whether using spring
or juice European C injection it doesn't
actually matter
learn what dependency injection is learn
how JPA works i motherhood so in other
words learn how object relational
mapping technology works don't learn how
hibernate works okay you can pick that
up and in a day after you understand the
principles ok principles will be
prompted every single time yeah so yeah
there's another theme on top of that you
cover this one till so software
development is is more about about more
than just programming you know it's
about more than bashing the keyboard
it's about thinking about what you're
doing it's about communicating it's
about understanding the business problem
understanding the environment there are
so many developers out there who don't
think it's their job to understand the
business domain you know just give me
requirements I don't need to know
anything else but that how many times
have people heard that hands up have you
ever heard someone say that yeah hands
up you think it's true
Oh two very people down the front it's
not true our job is to is to get
embedded with business to understand the
other stakeholders and to to make sure
we deliver what they want and also the
constraints of a particular language
like Java Java is not a particularly
complicated programming language has
anyone ever you know phoned up a
recruiter or had a recruiter tell them
they couldn't go forward for a job
because this role requires 10 years Java
experience and you only have five
anybody had that I had that years ago
yeah it's crazy you know does anybody
think that in between the five year and
the ten year mark with programming with
Java you're gonna actually gonna learn
much more about the language you know
come on I mean this is this is one of
the simplest programming languages one
could think of but you know if you if
you haven't learned everything there is
to know about it inside you know the
first the first three or four years yeah
you should worry about that so in short
if someone asks you to code up a square
wheel ask them why the wheel of square
don't just give them a square wheel
because it doesn't freaking work and
also don't don't assume that necessarily
that the business site holders
necessarily have a better idea than you
do about about features always thought
with them you so many developers just
blindly assume that because the the
business people of the domain experts
that they can just you know they should
just take us as gospel everything that's
said by the business the other thing to
know is that because we deal with
computers when our minds are trained to
think in the way that computers actually
work we think about things which have
quite rigid process sometimes so whereas
business processes quite often have
trapdoors and special cases and
shortcuts and things which were a little
bit squishy and and fuzzier than the
models we actually ended up building so
our models can end up being too brittle
and too inflexible to actually handle
the the business process and we then
have to go back in again
and add in all these exceptions and
special cases and that leads to this big
mess a lot of if statements and switch
statements and so understanding upfront
exactly how the business process works
including how how fuzzy it is versus how
Chris can save you a huge amount of time
later on okay we're gonna go a little
bit more rapid-fire now because now
we're entering into the age of fun new
technologies that this one is this AI
has the cloud suit has the cloud how bad
yes yes some people who has cloud
fantastic this is what I think of cloud
all right pretty cloud if you are not
part of a cloud if you're not involved
in the cloud you might as well give up
your technology choice now you are dead
in the water you're a dinosaur give up
go run a bar and a beach somewhere
because if you're not part of a cloud
then well you're just not one of the
cool kids anymore and tough luck
pretty much alternatively how many
people bother have actually heard that
speech about you know we have to be in
the cloud from people who have no idea
what the cloud is
we are the Oracle OpenWorld like keynote
sessions and stuff yeah right
so valuable
coming back next year I don't think you
are there are a whole bunch of providers
out there and it's important to
understand what your what your drivers
are fit for doing the cloud yes there's
a huge amount of potential and we are
seeing real shifts in the industry but
at the same time there's also an
enormous amount of hype not every
process can or should be moved to the
cloud straight away so just go slow and
easy
who here wants their medical records out
in the cloud owned by like Google for
example yeah
no nobody absolutely you don't do that
what does it you can do there is a
fundamental shift happening okay the
cloud is here it's real it is it is
going to become a utility like
electricity or like water in the next
probably we think between three and five
years as our estimation there's
obviously a lot of interesting things
going into it and it is dead easy to try
out and dead easy to work with today as
a Java developer okay 2012 was the year
of Java and onto the cloud there is a
ton of providers which make life really
easy for you to go on there to survive
simple web console fire up a cloud
instance fire up a tomcat or a GT or a
JBoss or a ba WebLogic deploy some
little toy app like a little war file
you know with hello world on it maybe
takes you all of 30 minutes to start
understanding the paradigm so again when
you go home after Java one take the hour
out to just go go to one these providers
and do it if you're a little bit afraid
if you're a little bit worried you don't
know don't know how to do this stuff
grab your colleague grab your friends
like sit down together and there's nut
with stuff out okay a lot of people are
really scared of that all this cloud
stuff that's coming don't be just try
all these providers out there absolutely
did simple and they're very very cheap I
mean you can you can do this stuff for
basically nothing zero costs so go do it
next one okay so mobile fantastic who
here is doing some sort of mobile
developments that's actually really high
cool mm-hmm okay so I hope you're all
quitting your day jobs and that you're
all going to make millions off the Apple
Store right no no no any success stories
here
oh really you'll probably won't be
sitting in this room if you were you'd
be sitting on your island in Hawaii
somewhere yeah
again this is another thing that if
you're not in the mobile game if you're
not in the cloud and mobile game again
you're a dinosaur you're going to be
left behind
so mobile mobile Mobile going back to
coding and Objective C is a wonderful
experience because you have to think
about your memory management again your
pointers and all sorts of fun stuff like
that makes you a real programmer again I
think personally no html5 absolutely for
the win right it's it's it is our
standard coming to you in about 2017
it's what they call a living standards
I'm going standard fantastic precisely
how that's different from anything that
the browser vendors decide to make up
I'm not sure but yeah maybe somebody
nicer than I do so sure a lot of apps
are going to require mobile and there's
gonna be a chain of mobile all the way
through to to cloud and large data
servers on the back end but always think
about what your user X user experience
needs actually are yeah there's no point
in building an app just for the sake of
it you know I think one of the things
which I find the most frustrating at the
moment is Facebook you know you click on
a link which someone's posting on
Facebook it take you to a new site and
instead of taken to the new site it says
do you want to install our app no I
don't want to install your app I want to
go and look at the link which I clicked
on because what I want is the web I
don't want you know an app for
everything don't want map fragmentation
so do you think before adding to the
ecosystem of horrible apps which no
one's going to use you know if it could
be done with just a decent mobile
website do it leather yeah so right if
you are involved in mobile development
please please please step back and think
to yourself we're all mobile phone users
here right we're all tablet users and we
all have rents every day I hope some of
you go visit the oatmeal for example or
the daily WTF site all right think about
what really pisses you off about the
apps it used today and don't repeat
those mistakes you know we've got a big
opportunity here to learn from the first
ecosystem that came out well let's not
repeat those mistakes yeah I mean a case
in point
we spent an awful lot of time on the
tube why is there no decent offline
Twitter client why in all this ecosystem
of that apps that exist is there not a
Twitter client that can cope with being
offline for the foot for reasonable
people offline clients for all sorts of
things right absolutely crazy crazy
here's a business idea for some of you
out there make millions big data
who here has been doing big data it's
all about big data right if you click
terabytes and terabytes and petabytes of
data you've won
you've got all the information about the
customers and it's game over just like
Facebook oh wait what's happened to the
Facebook price again they're doing ok ok
yeah so all this data for example mark
marks ding okay masked him doing this
fine yeah there's no one who works with
Facebook here is it good I made that
mistake last time one of the things I
like to say about Big Data no sequel
databases everyone's heard this meme I
hope
MongoDB is web-scale now that's the
other thing which you should Google when
you get home but not in the office not
the office again if you're not in the
Big Data game if you're not in the know
sequel game right you are going to be
left behind so you need to get out of
this relational database nonsense you
need to get out of this capability of
querying your databases and getting real
valuable data out and you need to just
have these giant hash maps and memory
and just chuck everything in there and
because you've clicked that everything
you've won yeah think about the data
you're actually storing I mean there's
the I can't realize you have to say this
but I another true story a bank again
who's sure my nameless decided that they
were going to start using no SQL instead
of SQL for transactions and yeah that
ended well
hands up if you would like to see your
your bank statements and your financial
transactions stored in an MongoDB say
nobody-nobody
yep so it's important to think about the
data you're actually storing it's
important to remember that for very
large degree of applications look we had
relational databases for a great many
years and there's a good reason why they
work and you know where they thought
about but not only that but the
non-functional really do matter people
think that there's something magical
about without the relational database
and there's not it's just that in major
organizations you have dedicated
infrastructure teams you have dedicated
DBAs who provide you know a high level
of support because those data stores are
seen as being critical to the
organization and it doesn't actually
matter whether those stores are
relational or non-relational you know
you have to have the organizational
buy-in and the commitment to provide you
know the resourcing to actually have
DBAs and that costs a lot of money so
when you when you have you know all of
this investment in relational databases
it can be hard for the quality of
service for non-relational to meet that
same level so it's got nothing to do
with the technology it's got an awful
lot to do with the investment and the
non-functional think about things like
how on earth do I backup 10 petabytes of
data because I've got this all stored in
my had no sequel databases out there in
the cloud right it's these kind of
things and the replication of that data
and how do I get reports out of that
data ok stuff that people and businesses
have been used to for 20 years there's
all of sudden kind of being thrown away
by this no sequel wave right the tooling
is starting to get there but I would
strongly suggest that you do not blindly
jump into it ok however again just like
with the cloud stuff from the mobile
stuff you can try these things at home
right you can install MongoDB Cassandra
nodes was a neo neo4j which is a graph
database whole bunch of things you can
just try them out at home this spring's
got bindings for it java E's got
bindings for this stuff now it's really
easy to use and try out try it out with
your colleagues see what's coming around
the corner ok be be prepared for what's
happening because you know no sequel and
big data is coming for a lot of you guys
especially in large organizations so you
will have to think about this stuff and
that's kind of the final point whatever
you do take a deep breath and think
think about what you hear
evaluate critically don't just take it
because somebody who's up on the stage
or has written a book says so we like to
ever saying that those who can't code
teach those who can't teach write books
those who took two take two years to
finish their book become conference
speakers so yeah be very very careful
about who you're listening to you've got
to evaluate things for yourself and in
the context of the organization that you
work on or the Hobby project that you're
working on okay it's more important to
think upfront and design upfront and try
prototyping out front then it is to take
a 60 page document the heck out code so
thank you very much for listening we
hope you guys enjoyed it and feel free
to come up and speak to us afterwards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
