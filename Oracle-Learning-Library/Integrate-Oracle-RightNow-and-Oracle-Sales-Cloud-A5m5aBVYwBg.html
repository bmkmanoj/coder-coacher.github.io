integration cloud first create
connections for the integrations and
then integrate those connections for a
right now and sales cloud integration
let's start by creating a right now
connection select the right now adapter
from the list add basic information
about the connection add the email
address of the person who's going to act
as contact administrator at the URL of
the wisdom that allows integration cloud
to find the right now instance because
the application is password protected
add the credentials required to access
it next test the connection when the
test completes successfully save and
exit the canvas the new RightNow
connection appears in the connections
list repeat the configuration process
for the Oracle sales cloud connection by
entering the basic information about the
new connection the contact email ID of
the sales cloud admin wisdom information
and credentials required to access the
wisdom test the connection and save and
close the canvas the new sales cloud
connection appears in the connections
list after the source and target
connections are created create an
integration
first and our basic information about
the integration then to configure the
integration configure the trigger and
the invoke then map the Business Objects
that flow between them on the
integration canvas configure the right
now connection as a trigger add basic
information about the connection in the
connection configuration wizard then
configure how to process the request to
receive organization objects in the
request select organization from the
list then move on to the response
because this is a one-way flow and
there's no response select none review
the summary of selections now that it's
configured the canvas shows the right
now instance and it's inbound flow
configure the invoke using the Oracle
sales cloud connection following the
same steps as for the trigger fill in
the basic information to create an
account in Oracle sales cloud select the
account service from the services option
be sure that the create account option
is selected review the integration
details in the summary screen now that
both the invoke and trigger are in place
map the data to be shared between them
the source data structure is on the left
of the mapper and the target data
structures on the right to map the two
fields drag the name field from the
source to the organization name field in
the target the green check mark and the
line connecting them indicates that
these fields are mapped when the data
structure is large
use the search feature to locate the
next fields to map drag the number of
employees field over the employees total
field finally search for the currency
field and map currency name to currency
code save and exit the mapper next
configure a business identifier this
identifier is used in the dashboard
monitor to track the associated payload
field in messages during run time one
identifier is required as the primary
business identifier but you can define
as many as 3 now that the request is
math mapper icon is green and the
progress meter is at a hundred percent
save and exit the canvas activate the
integration by clicking the activate
button the status is now active and the
integration is complete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
