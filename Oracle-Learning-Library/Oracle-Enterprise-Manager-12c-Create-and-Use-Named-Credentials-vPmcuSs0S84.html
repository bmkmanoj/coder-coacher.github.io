to create and use named credentials
credentials our identity information
stored in Oracle Enterprise Manager and
used to access targets monitored and
managed by Oracle Enterprise Manager in
the case where you have team members who
need certain credentials to run jobs on
targets but they are not allowed to know
the specific credential information you
can create named credentials and share
these credentials with the team members
to create a shared name credential
select set up security and named
credentials click on create specify a
credential name that does not include
any spaces in this particular example
we're going to be creating a share
credential to run OS commands on hosts
the authenticating target type is set to
host and the credential type has host
credentials selected notice that you can
also select SSH key credentials we're
going to set the scope to global so that
this share credential can be used on any
of the hosts next you fill in the
credential properties with the host OS
username and password the run privilege
is where you can specify sudo if you
need to have root privileges to perform
certain OS commands but you are not
allowed to specify username as root
specify who can access this named shared
credential by clicking add grant select
the username that you would like to
grant access to notice the default
privilege is view meaning this user can
view and use the shared named credential
let's add another user who can not only
view and use this credential but also
can modify the credential once you've
added the second user select that user
then click change privilege set the
privilege to edit now let's click on the
test and Save button to verify that the
hosts credentials specified does work so
we're going to test the credentials
against a specific host once you've
selected the host click select then
click
the test and save button again
successful test it means that the
credential is also saved now let's
verify that the credential works I've
logged in as the user who was granted
the view privilege on the name shared
credential I'm going to use this named
credential to submit and run a job from
my library of jobs once I find the job
that I want to submit which is to run a
host command I select the host to run
the job on then you can see in the
parameters for the job that the command
I'm running it running his ID and then
to use the shared credential I click the
credentials tab and set it to named and
select the host credentials named
credential click on the more details to
see who created the shared credential
and the user name notice that the
password is not shown I run this job as
a one-time event after I submit the job
I see that the job is successfully run
and the ID command was executed
successfully going to now log out and
log back in as the other user whom I
have granted the shared named credential
access the second user remember has the
Edit privilege so notice that I can go
in to name credentials screen and click
Edit now I'm going to be changing the
username for the share credential and as
well that will change the password so by
giving an user it's the ability to edit
the name credential you can have this
person come in and modify the
credentials as the
Cerie in some cases you may have a
policy to change the share credential at
once a month I'm going to just test this
named credential by going back and to
the job system as the first user and
submitting a job I'm going to go to the
credentials tab just to select name
credentials and specify the one that I
want to use and notice that in the
credential details the new username is
now used the ID command was successfully
executed thanks for watching this
