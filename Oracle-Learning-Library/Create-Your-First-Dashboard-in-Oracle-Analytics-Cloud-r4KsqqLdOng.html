data for specific brands by region the
first thing that you need to do is
create a dashboard prompt prompts limit
the data displayed on the dashboard
select the column add a meaningful label
and then decide how the prompt should
look on the dashboard by selecting the
user input type such as checkboxes and
other options now add a second prompt
for brand name the prompt and make it a
checkbox use the display pane to see how
the prompts will look on the dashboard
use the new column checkbox to rearrange
the prompt so that brand is positioned
to the right of region save the prompt
you need to ensure that the analysis
which will be added to the dashboard
respects the new prompt that you just
created view the analysis the analysis
is only filtered for time for the prompt
to work properly on the dashboard a
filter for both region and brand that
needs to be added the value for each
prompt should be set to the is prompted
operator only records matching the value
of the prompt will be displayed you'll
need to add the brand prompt to save the
analysis create the new dashboard if you
want to create the dashboard for
personal use change the location to my
folders in dashboard builder drag and
drop the region brand prompt to the work
area of the new dashboard page notice
that a new column and section are
created automatically into which the
objects are placed
now add the revenue by region analysis
it's likely that you'll need a second
dashboard page in the future use
dashboard properties to change the name
of the first dashboard page
add the second page that will contain
content in the future when in added mode
review the print and export options for
the revenue page you can change the page
settings print layout and so on to
adjust the appearance of the printed or
exported dashboard page change the
report links available for this analysis
to these links will be displayed along
with the analysis on the dashboard save
and run the new dashboard you can see
the new page report links along the
bottom of the dashboard ensure that the
prompt works properly
next check the AMIA region for all
brands print the current dashboard page
now you know how to create a dashboard
that tracks revenue create a prompt add
content and print a dashboard page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
