curriculum developer here at Oracle here
I'll be introducing you to a series of
demonstrations on securing Oracle
service bus services this is the first
part in a three-part series on Oracle
service bus security in Oracle service
bus 11g you have two options to secure
service bus services you can either use
the WebLogic server web service policies
or use Oracle Web Services Manager or
OWS M policies the WebLogic server web
service policies are part of the
WebLogic security framework and these
are enabled by default
OWS M support and service bus must be
enabled at the time of creating or
extending a service bus domain in this
series of demonstrations will look at
securing services using owsn policies
here we see the setup for the
demonstrations there's a so accomplished
that application deployed to a WebLogic
server that validates credit cards and
I've created a business service and a
proxy service for the so accomplices
which are used to mediate security to
test this we'll use the service bust his
console to provide the credentials for
the user Joe and this user has already
been created in WebLogic server the
proxy service will authenticate Joe
using username token-based
authentication so the first thing we'll
demonstrate is how to configure an OWS M
key store for the Oracle service bus
domain a key store is a key database
that contains both public and private
keys for all secure connections within a
WebLogic domain the default key store
is contained in a file called default
key store jks and I've already placed it
in the domains fmw config directory next
we'll create a credential key for Joe's
so the client in this case the service
bus console can look up his username and
password in the key store and send it to
the proxy service then we'll secure the
proxy service by attaching the username
token service policy to it once Joseph
indicated in the service bus will
propagate his identity to the critic add
validation so accomp
using security assertion markup language
or sam'l sam'l is an XML standard for
communicating identities across the
internet this allows the user to log on
once for separate sites so we'll attach
the same or client policy to the
business service and then we'll attach
the sam'l service policy to the solar
composite to see how to perform these
tasks please proceed to the next
demonstration in the series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
