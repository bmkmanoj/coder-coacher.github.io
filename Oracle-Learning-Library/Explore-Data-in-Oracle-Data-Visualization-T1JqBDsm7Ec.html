and order date begin by creating a
project and selecting a data source then
select order date and hold down the
control key while you select revenue and
category there are too many values
displayed to identify any patterns so
create a calculation to group the dates
by here to reduce the clutter on the
canvas open the calendar date folder and
double click here to create the
expression select the variable in the
editor and double click order date to
replace the variable with the value
validate and save the expression swap
order date and order year
it looks like sales peaked in 2015
across all categories but it's
especially pronounced for the internal
category you can track the progress of
your exploration and build a story by
adding insights update the title and add
a meaningful description for this
insight insights enable you to capture
different snapshots of the report at
different phases of your exploration
delve deeper into the exploration by
creating a second calculation for
revenue except this time use the month
variable validate and save the
calculation add the new month
calculation to explore its impact on
revenue it looks like your initial
conclusion was incorrect the
year-to-year comparison decline was
actually due to comparing a full year of
data for 2015 with a partial year of
data for 2016 save this as another
insight insights are great because you
could save snapshots of the analyses as
you move through the data investigation
process be sure to rename the insight to
help you remember your discovery the
mobile category appears to be fairly
flat this is surprising and
disappointing given the rapid growth in
the sector overall explore the mobile
category further by adding a filter and
continue looking into the cause of the
downturn and mobile revenue add a second
chart and drag it below the line chart
drag Depot name units and category to
the new chart
position the mouse over a value and then
use the right-click menu to sort the
data to see the lowest values first
create a marquee by dragging the cursor
over specific values and then
right-click to keep only the depot's
that are performing below expectations
both charts reflect the addition of the
filter this is called brushing continue
exploring by swapping item type with
categories in the color drop target
it looks like tablets are responsible
for the downturn across the depots
continue to build the story by adding
another insight add your observations
about mobile sales name the insight and
navigate back to visualize mode next
right-click a data value and drill down
to the store type level it looks like
only the computer store type show any
revenue growth and based on the broken
lines there wasn't revenue for some
store types in some months add this as
the last insight to the story capture a
description of your discovery rename the
insight and then save the project based
on this exploration you now have a
better understanding of the downturn in
revenue for specific item and store
types click the tabs at the bottom to
step through each insight you can
present your findings as a comprehensive
story by using the story navigator you
use presentation mode to share your
story in this video as shows you how to
create a project swap columns limit data
