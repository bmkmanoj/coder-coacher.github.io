demonstration my name is Maria Billings
I work for Oracle server technologies
curriculum this demonstration shows you
how to use the predefined suspect
privilege and user Oracle provides them
first in release to have one to
facilitate the separation of database
administration duties we will create
simple test tables without any grounds
to show you the difference between sirs
DBA and Swiss backup at the end of the
demo we login to our men with a suspect
privilege and execute some Armen and
sequel commands for example the Select
and described commands whose
functionality have been enhanced in
released of one on the slide you see the
precise steps that we will be taking
first we log on Asus DBA using OS
authentication now logged into secret +
I'm executing some formatting commands
for the ease of reading before executing
my theory against the DBA users view
here you see the output the suspect up
user you can also log into sequel plus
using OS authentication with the suspect
privilege and in this case you are
connected as this suspec up user you can
execute the same command as this sista
be a user you see the results are the
same oracle recommends that you create
your own a privileged user which we do
as sis DBE so here we are creating the
sample user account called myiasis DBA
and granting it let's back up
privilege we can review again the
account status for all users who have
the word as part of the name
and you see the newly created user
account if you're curious about the
granted system privileges we can use the
D BSS proofs data dictionary B and I'm
clearing the Zeus backup privileges the
column EDM means that backup does not
have the with admin option and comm
means it is common yes for container
databases of Oracle multi-tenant to view
details about the granted role we use
the DBA role proofs data dictionary view
let's create a test tablespace the
details are not really important or you
could also use the Scott M table so I'd
first like to show you the just created
test tables here they are logged in SS
backup you cannot view the table content
finally we view the password file and
you see that the source backup in my
Swiss backup users do not have sis DBA
privileges or super privileges you also
see that the container database is not
configured for this demonstration so the
value is 0 next we use the Zeus backup
privileges with Arman you login to our
mean by specifying SS backup within
single quotes and double quotes we
execute some command in this case
looking at the schemas and you see that
our sample database has the data files
in ears M here's our test tablespace if
you're curious about the content of the
test TBS you can execute a select
command from within our mean with 12:1
that is simplified you do not need the
SQL keyword anymore we can also execute
good queries and see that this database
is an archive log mode and open retried
you can use the describe command in
Arman as you see here within the spelled
out version or you can use the
abbreviated des see on the slide you see
the steps which we just covered in this
demo thanks for watching this
