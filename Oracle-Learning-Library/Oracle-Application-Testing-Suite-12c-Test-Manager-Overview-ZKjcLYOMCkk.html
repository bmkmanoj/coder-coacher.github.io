training series in today's session we're
going to cover Oracle test manager and
provide a general overview of the
different features of Oracle test
manager and how you can be successful
with a product my name is Carolyn cow
and I'm a senior product manager for
application testing suite the agenda for
today's session is as follows we will
start with an overview of application
testing suite an Oracle test manager for
quick reference I may refer to
application testing suite as ATS an
Oracle test manager as otm we will cover
some topics to get you started with
Oracle test manager these topics include
installation and deployment
administration coverage of each of the
tabs within otm and the menu options
presented at the upper right hand corner
when you log into the product we will
finished by providing a demo of Oracle
test manager Oracle application testing
suite this an integrated testing
solution that helps you ensure
application quality performance and
reliability
ATS consists of three separate but
integrated products there's Oracle
functional testing or open script for
automated functional and regression
testing the same product is used for
generating low test scripts for
functional and regression testing once
the script is recorded you would replay
it from open script to see the results
for load testing you would do the same
to ensure script replay is successful
now to simulate a load test you can add
the load test script to Oracle load
testing and run hundreds of thousands of
virtual users against the application
orgullo testing has a built-in server
monitoring capability called server
stats server staff can monitor the
application infrastructure during the
load test and detect bottlenecks and
report on performance metrics
finally there's Oracle test manager for
managing the test process including
requirements has plants automated and
manual test cases and defects Oracle
test manager is the focus of today's
session
or go test manager enables consistent
delivery of high quality high
performance applications by bringing
structure repeatability and visibility
to testing efforts the five integrator
modules of otm are represented by tabs
in the product these tabs are test plan
requirements test test execution and
issues each tab will be covered in
detail in the following slides oracle
test manager facilitates team
communication and efficiency by having a
common repository for all test assets
and a very easy to use web-based
interface it is easily customized to
accommodate existing test practices
allows users to track manual and
automated tests and allows administrator
to define roles and field Oracle test
manager increases visibility of
application readiness via prepackaged
reports and dashboards and also allows
users to have customized reports and
dashboards to fit their own needs there
are five integrator modules of otm and
these are represented by tabs in the
product the first tab is the test plan
tab which allows you to define a test
code for your feature functionality the
second tab is requirements which lets
you document and manage all your test
requirements or what needs to be tested
in the application following that is the
test tab where you manage all of your
manual and automated test cases the next
tab is test execution where you design
test sets to reflect application modules
versions or Sprint's to be tested the
issues tab allows you to generate
defects where any issues identified
during testing and track their
resolution all these modules have
Association capability so they can be
referenced to one another for
traceability for example you can
associate a test plan to the requirement
that it is testing you can associate
requirement to the test cases that
fulfill it the test cases are associated
with a test set that they belong to and
they are also associated to issues which
are generated as an outcome of executing
that test case ot
has two additional modules in the yard
the report and dashboard tab these tabs
allow you to report on all test assets
the reports tab comes with a set of
out-of-the-box default reports that can
be used right away users can also create
their own custom reports for project
requirements tests and issues the
dashboard tab also contains
out-of-the-box dashboards that can be
used right away each dashboard page is
comprised of several reports and
represents an executive summary of the
project again users are welcome to
create their own custom dashboard page
to suit their reporting needs the
administrator module which is the first
module we were covering detail in later
slides allows you to define users
permissions create projects and
customize fields to fit your test
process now that we have an overview of
otm let's talk about the installation
and deployment Oracle test manager has
the following system requirements we are
certified against both windows and
Oracle Enterprise Linux operating
systems the minimum memory requirement
is 2 gigabytes of RAM we support x86
32-bit or 64-bit processors there are
2.6 Cuba Hertz or faster there is a
minimum requirement of 10 gigabytes of
free disk space and at least 3 gigabytes
free on the system drive we support both
ie and Firefox browsers we support
Oracle Enterprise Edition 10g or 11g
databases as well as 10g Express Edition
database for the application server we
use WebLogic 11g both oracle test
manager and orgullo testing utilized the
same WebLogic server architecture and
can run on the same server for demo
purposes however for production
deployment we recommend separate servers
for otm and olt the system requirements
mentioned are minimum requirements only
and actual requirements will vary
depending on the quantity of test assets
stored a number of concurrent users
accessing the application
if you have a large quantity of test
cases requirements or issues or of your
deploying or go test manager for a team
greater than 10 users you should
consider deploying or Co test measure
only faster server fast machine with
additional memory Oracle 10g Express
Edition database can be installed as
part of ATS were used with Oracle load
testing and Oracle test manager this is
useful for demos
however for production usage switching
to Oracle's 11g Enterprise Edition
database is highly recommended the
Oracle 11g standard edition in Oracle
10g Enterprise Edition or Standard
Edition are also supported leacy release
notes for additional system requirement
considerations this is a graphical view
of the otm architecture the Oh team
application server is the WebLogic
server and the database is an Oracle
database users access the application
through ie or Firefox browser and
connect to the WebLogic server all data
are stored in the Oracle database it is
important to note that the WebLogic and
database servers can be on separate
machines
this is especially recommended for
larger deployments our go test manager
has the following components basically
there is an Oracle test manager server
where the ODEs application service is
used to run the Oracle test manager
server typically there's only one otm
server per deployment the OU teams
application server is essentially
WebLogic 11g released one there's a
web-based user interface accessible
through ie or Firefox the odium database
is used to store all assets managed by
otm again or column G and 10g are both
supported there's an 11g Enterprise
Edition restricted use license that's
included with the otm licensing Oracle
Express Edition is included with the ATS
installer for out-of-the-box demo
functionality for production systems
again you should use a full steno long
Oracle database instance
database configuration is a utility that
comes installed as part of the otm
installation it allows you to manage and
create database connections for otm by
default the installation comes with a
demo database called oats ot MDS you can
create new database connections for an
existing schema via this utility you can
also create new schemas using the same
utility now that we have an overview of
installation and deployment let's talk
about administration the administrator
is a component of o TM and is probably
the first component you should get
familiar with once you install the
product it allows you to manage users
permissions projects and fields and also
create user accounts or update existing
ones you can setup road base user
permissions for each project add delete
manage projects add or modify fields and
update option values for project
specific and general system fields the
way you will get into the administrator
is through the program's menu or you can
directly launch the browser and enter
the URL where server name is the name of
the actual host you then select the test
manager database you want to administer
when you log in to the administrator
again the oats ot MDS database is the
default database configure for you I'll
install for demo purposes you can
configure additional databases using the
database configuration utility when you
add additional databases you need to
remember to restart otm server in order
to access the newly recreated databases
by default you will log into the
administrative console with the username
administrator and the default password
of which you entered during the 80s
installation after you logged in as the
administrator you are welcome to modify
administrator password or grant other
user accounts administrator access
there are four tabs within the
administrator console the first tab is
the users tab this is where you add user
accounts specify account username
password email and also enable options
for email notification and administrator
access you can assign users to projects
based on roles in the users tab the row
tab is where you add or edit existing
roles by default after you install otm
you will have a set of default roles you
can create your own roles and specify
which permissions they have users will
be assigned a role for each project to
control their permissions for that
project
the administrator projects tab is where
you would go to create new projects
projects are used to store common tests
assets that you want to keep together
for a specific application module
release etc you can store multiple
projects per database or a single
project per database a separate project
per database gives you more control to
customize the fields and also allow you
to manage permissions for that project
since you administrator each separately
you can assign multiple users to a
project through the projects tab the
administrator fields tab is where you
manage default and custom fields for
test plan requirements tests test sets
issues and test runs you can enable
disable or edit default fields add or
edit custom fields you can change the
order that fields or options are
displayed and also specify which field
changes trigger email notification the
administrator tools menu is where you
will set up email configuration which
allows you to configure an SMTP server
to use to send email alerts from otm
there's also some options for you to
specify general email notification rules
you can manage default reports from the
Tools menu which allows you to control
which default reports are viewable and
these settings are specified per user
the administrator tools menu also allows
you to purge deleted records
this will purge all records marked for
deletion from the database right a fault
when user delete a record from the OT
Mui there's a delete flag that is set on
that record in the database however
they're not removed until the
administrator goes to the Tools menu to
purge those records we recommend doing
so on a periodic basis in order to free
up space on the database server the
administrator tools menu also allows the
administrator to unlock locked records
this allows you to unlock the records
that are being logged in the event that
you have a crash or related server issue
to summarize the administrators where
everything begins this is where you set
up the tool for the first time to create
new projects users and roles customize
who can access it what permissions they
have and specify any custom fields and
field options required for that project
you will then come back to the
administrator module on an as-needed
basis to make further modifications the
remaining slides will cover the otm
product itself from a user's perspective
to start we will talk about the test
plan tab Oracle test manager can be
accessed by launching a browser and
going to the odium URL when you access
oracle test manager you will be
presented with a login page after you
login you will only see the tabs that
you have permission to view or edit if
you have permission to see everything
you will be presented with five main
tabs representing each module followed
by the reports and dashboard tab the
five main tabs all have a very similar
user interface and setup with the
exception of the issues tab which does
not have a hierarchical tree view the
first tab in otm product is test plan
once you click on this tab you will see
a tree view on the left-hand pane as you
click through the tree view and
highlight individual nodes the test plan
details will be presented on the
right-hand pane any attachments links
and associations to other test assets
will be shown on the far right-hand side
of the screen test plans can be created
in a multi-level hierarchy this beings
within a parent node
have several child nodes or some nose
underneath this provides you the
capability to organize your test plans
in any way you wish you can also use the
arrow buttons to move a particular node
up-down indent or outdent
the toolbar contains several buttons for
you to create a new test plan edit an
existing test plan
Dulli copy and paste a test plan there's
also a history button that allows you to
see the history of edits to the test
plan the fields that you see within the
test plan details view can be customized
via the administrator module by default
a set of system fields are available out
of the box such as created owner
priority and description the
administrator can modify the options
available for each field in our custom
field and field option values as needed
when you add or create a new test plan
it is automatically given a unique ID
which essentially is the Recker ID
within the test plan table this idea is
permanent and cannot be changed even if
you move the test plan up or down to a
different location the beauty of this
unique ID is that you can place the
number within the go-to field and jump
to that record quickly when needed
as mentioned previously you can click on
add or edit buttons to create or modify
test plans the arrow buttons gives you
the freedom to move the test plan
anywhere within the tree hierarchy the
test plan fields that you see in the add
or edit dialog windows are a combination
of default and custom fields specified
by the administrator the administrator
can also specify which fields are
required change the view order that or
modify drop-down option values for
option list fields the fields with an
asterisk next to that means they are
required fields and when you add a new
test plan there's an attachment section
that allows you to quickly attach any
necessary files or website links to the
test plan attachments and links are
shown on the far right-hand side of this
screen when a node is selected in a tree
view attachments can be anything from a
text file to a screen shot to a word
document any additional material that
help clarify the test plan can be
attached to the test plan as an
attachment you can add links which are
URLs to online references and resources
and you can also associate requirements
and test sets to your test plan for
traceability the nice thing about
associating one asset to another is that
you can click on the associated link and
that will bring you directly to the
Associated asset so as you work through
the test management process you can map
the different assets together and those
mappings will be shown on the right-hand
pane you'll see you later on that the
other four integrator modules within otm
all have a very similar user interface
and set up as well as we go through the
slides for the remaining forming modules
I will highlight areas where each module
is different we have completed
introduction to the test plan module and
how it works now let's take a look at
requirements the requirements user
interface is very similar to the test
plan user interface it has a multi-level
hierarchy and details are enter into
fields that can be customized by the
administrator as you add your
requirements they are assigned a unique
number the add edit dialog windows work
in the same way as the add edit dialog
windows for a test plan the fields
displayed are a combination of default
and custom fields specified by the
administrator you can add attachments
and links to a requirement in a similar
fashion as a test plan requirements can
be associated with test plans and tests
there are used to validate the
requirement on the requirements toolbar
you'll see two buttons one is group and
the other is filter the grouping button
allows you to change the way the tree is
displayed by default the tree is display
as a hierarchy with parent nodes child
nodes and sub nodes based on how many
levels you have setup with grouping you
can change the way the tree view is
displayed based on folders and the
voters are mapped to the fields that are
specified for each requirement in this
particular example we have grouping
based on priority then status
you can see that the parent voters are
based on priority with the subfolders
based on status you can apply the group
into the current view and then save it
for later use once a group definition is
saved it will appear on the toolbar drop
down and you can select it to quickly
rearrange the way the tree view is
displayed you can have multiple group
definitions saved and they can be
accessed at any time from the toolbar
grouping allows you to view your data
from a different perspective
you can view data based on priority
status owner type created by and so
forth filtering can work in conjunction
with grouping or standalone requirements
can be filtered by their field values
you can bring up the filter dialog by
clicking on the filter button on the
toolbar and then specify which field in
value to filter on you can define
multiple levels of filters using equals
and not equal to operators for drop-down
lists and equals contains and not equal
to operators for free text fields you
can set up the filters to match any all
or a combination of the filtering
criteria similar to grouping you can
save a filter definition with a
meaningful name and pull up quickly from
the toolbar drop down to apply it to the
tree view in addition to being
accessible from the filter drop-down
saved filters are also available for use
when you click on the find button on the
requirements toolbar or when you create
or modify requirement reports from the
reports tab the same grouping and
filtering feature is also available in
the tests and issues module the test
execution reports tab currently only
have filtering capability we have
completed an introduction into the
requirements module how it works now
let's take a look at tests the tests
user interface has a multi-level
hierarchy both manual and automated test
cases can be managed within the tests
tab manual test cases are those of which
the user needs to execute the test
manually these are documented and stored
with detailed information on test steps
and expected results
the screenshot shown is an example of a
manual test case as you can see there's
a test step section where you specify
the action and expect the result of each
step this information can be either
manually entered or imported from a
spreadsheet automated test cases are
those of which the testers are executed
via an automation software such as open
script these test scripts can also be
managed and executed from otm when you
add a new open script test case the test
steps are automatically imported you can
run both manual and automated test cases
from otm and the nice thing about this
is the run history is tracked within the
tool under the run history section the
add edit buttons allow you to create or
modify a test case again manual test
steps are in turn manually or via import
whereas automated test steps are
imported from open script once you add
the test case the right-hand fly of the
test case will display any attachments
or links it will also display any
associated requirements test sets and
issues the three shots on this slide
shows what you will see when you execute
a manual test case from otm first there
will be a test run info dialog window
where you specify the run name and
version the run name field will default
to current day and timestamp fields on
this dialog window can be customized by
the administrator after you complete the
required fields and click on run the run
manual tests dialog window appears here
you will see the test steps for the
manual test case you're running and the
result column will allow you to set the
status for each step notice on the far
right hand column there is an add issue
button you can click on to create an
issue on the spot if you do so the issue
will be automatically associated to the
test case once again
results are archived in run history you
can also execute automated test cases
such as open square for the test tab a
similar test run info dialog window will
appear
which will prompt user to complete the
same fields in addition there will be a
system and command line run setting
field so you can specify the odium agent
to run the script on
any additional input parameters for the
script test manager then launches open
script and runs the test automated test
cases can also be scheduled to run on a
periodic basis or execute it as part of
a test set before running the open
script Testament otm please make sure
the following requirements are met both
open script and Oates
agent need to be installed on the otm
agent box also both or Co ATS agent and
Orko ATS helper services need to be
running if you are running a script on
the same box as the otm server then you
should already have everything installed
please check if the require services are
running prior to executing the script
make sure this grip is accessible by the
otm agent box by doing one of the
following you can copy the script to the
same location on the o TM agent box for
example the script is located at C or
koi ts oft directly on the o TM server
which is the default location where
scripts are stored these scripts need to
be copied to the same location on the
agent machines an alternative approach
is to create a repository that points to
a shared network drive where the script
resides
for example if scripts are saved under C
or Co ATS oft directory on the o TM
server this oft folder needs to be
shared on the oft server and accessible
by o TM agent machines you would then
add this repository ask backslash
backslash host name backslash oft
through the o TM UI and then add the
script from the tests tab this way the
script is loaded from the shared network
drive when you execute it from otm and
in this way you don't have to copy the
scripts to the same location on each
agent machine the following types of
open script scripts require them to be
running using an interactive desktop so
they named Windows user account that is
always logged in these four script types
are Siebel functional Oracle forms
functional where functional scripts that
rely on system input events and web
functional squares that display
modal dialog windows force people and
Oracle forms the name users account must
have visited the SIBO Oracle forum site
at least once to ensure that all
necessary ActiveX controls and plugins
are installed in the named users browser
so what this means is you need to log in
as the named user account on the o TM
machine and then manually launch the
browser that you want to test with and
manually navigate through the screams
that are going to be tested to ensure
that all the necessary ActiveX controls
and plugins are installed prior to
automation on the Oracle test manager
agent machine that will run the scripts
stop the Oracle 80s agent service and
configure to start manually on the
Oracle test manager agent machine you
need to log in as the named Windows user
account that will run the scripts so
from a command prompt you will run the
falling all as one command where C or
80s is the oats install folder the
command is shown at the bottom of this
slide and what you need to do is copy
and paste it into the command prompt hit
the enter key this will allow the Oracle
80s agent service to be started manually
via the command prompt again this is a
requirement for the for script types
listed on this slide
one very important thing to know is that
for Windows Vista 2008 or Windows 7
users you need to select run as
administrator from the right-click
shortcut menu when launching the command
prompt to do this you will click on
start all programs accessories highlight
Commun prompt right-click and then
select run as administrator from the
menu option here are some important tips
for a successful open script replay from
Oracle test manager by default otm does
not display browser during script replay
to see the browser you need to stop the
Oracle 80s agent service and started
from the command prompt also by default
o team does not replace crypt with think
time to do so you must enter the - delay
percentage space mode command-line
argument into the command line run
setting field for the test case there
are two ways to run the script with
time one way is to enter the
command-line option directly into the
command line run setting field of the
test case when you add the test case
another approach is to enter the
command-line option when you execute the
test case either way the command-line
option needs to be added in order for
the script to replay wasting time
because by default buti'm runs from the
command line and does not replay with
anything time the mode values are
explained in open script users guide
section 2.1 general settings open script
users guide can be launched from the
Start menu and it could also be found in
the installation directory docs folder
another tip is that replace filling try
starting the oates agent service from
the command prompt again instructions
for this are shown on the previous slide
if replay fails and the script type
you're running does not require an
interactive desktop you can try running
or go ATS agent service as a Windows
named user account using this approach
however no browser will be displayed
during replay the script types that
require an interactive desktop once
again are display on the previous slide
if the script type you're running are
not these four and you do not need the
browser to be launched during replay
then you can try the approach of
launching the or going TS agent service
as a windows name user account instead
of from the command prompt instructions
to do this are you stop the org or ETS
agent service right click on the service
and then select properties then click on
log on tablets like this account radio
button then you would enter the username
password for a Windows named user
account and typically this is the same
account used to log into the agent box
then you would click OK to save the
setting and then start the service again
there are other test type options in the
tests tab when you add a new test case
test motor will create a folder note to
allow you to organize test cases in a
hierarchical view this won't be very
useful if you will be using grouping by
specific fields however a lot of people
find it useful for organizing their test
asset
there is a third-party test test type
option which allows you to launch batch
executables and retrieve results this is
useful when you want to integrate
third-party test tools that provide
Camille my interface or similar
interface to launch the execution
there's also a che unit test type which
is new for otm 12.1 this will execute
JDeveloper unit tests from test manager
there's the flexible ID which the
forceful software development lifecycle
there's support for single unit tests or
groups of unit tests and all the testing
is centralized within a unified
reporting instance in the tests tab you
can group the test by field values the
group settings can be stored and
accessed from the tool bar tests can be
filtered by fuel values as well the
filter settings are again stored and
accessed from the tool bar and these
named filters can also be used in search
and reports we have completed an
introduction into the test module how it
works now let's take a look at test
execution users can create a multi-level
test folder and test the hierarchy
within the test execution tab the
left-hand pane shows you the test
execution tree view and when you
highlight one of the nodes the test set
details or test order details will be
displayed in the right-hand pane when
you highlight a test set it will show
you additional sections in the details
view you will see a test list section
which displays all the test cases that
have been added as part of the test set
there's also a run history section which
will display the run history of the
particular test set both manual and
automated test cases can be added to a
test set when you click on add or edit
buttons in a tool bar you can create or
modify test sets or test voters test
cases can be added to a test set by
clicking on the add edit link within the
test list section users can specify file
attachments or links for each test set
or test voter
test sets or folders can also be
associated with requirements test plans
and issues test sets can be filtered by
field values as well the filter settings
are stored and accessed from to a bar
and the name filters can be used later
on in search and reports we have
completed an introduction to the test
execution module in how it works now
let's take a look at issues the issues
tab lets you document bugs or other
issues identified during testing and
allows you to assign the developers and
track their resolution issues can be
associated with tests and other related
issues as well when you add an issue is
automatically assign the next available
number in the database and is added at
the bottom of the list
this number cannot be changed anoche
hierarchy exists for issues when you
click on add or edit buttons in the
toolbar you can create or modify the
issue the issues for your are a
combination of default and custom fields
specified through the administrator
console users can specify file
attachments or links for each issue
issues can be created during a manual
test case run and associated to that
test case automatically issues can also
be associated to other issues you can
group by field values in the issues tab
as well these settings can be stored and
accessed from the toolbar for later use
issues can be filtered by field values
as well the filter settings can be
stored and accessed from the toolbar and
again they can be used later for search
and reports now that we've covered the
finding modules of otm let's quickly
recap the five modules are represented
by tabs within the otm product in
addition to those five tabs you will
also see a reports tab and a dashboard
tab for viewing the results and status
of your project the administration
module is a separate module which allows
you to manage user accounts permissions
and fields for the project a sample test
management flow is as follows you have a
test plan which validates a number of
requirements from the test plan and
requirements a series of test cases were
created
these test cases are associated with the
test plan and requirements that they
fulfill a couple of test nets were
created and test cases were added to
their test list these test nets are
executed from low TM and issues were
created as the result of executing the
test sets the outcome of this is
end-to-end traceability of the entire
test process and this is the value of
which otm brings to you as the user to
summarize Oracle test manager allows you
to define and manage test modules and
links them together so you can keep
track of your test status we have
completed an introduction to the issues
module which is the last of the five
main modules within otm now let's take a
look at reports in dashboard reports
allow you to view information on the
entire test project by leveraging
default summary reports and charts or
you can also create your own customized
reports you can print the report or
export them to excel or HTML for text
reports or you can export them to jpeg
for chart reports the reports can be
saved as public which means all users
within the project can see the report or
you can save the report as private which
means only you can see the report once
you save the report as private it will
be saved under the my reports motor when
you save it as public it will be under
the public reports folder you click on
add report to create a custom report
after doing so you will be presented
with this dialog window which allows you
to define report and define filters
defining the report lets you select what
to report on by specifying the report
type and which fields to include
defining the filter lets you specify
filters or select store filters or data
you want to report on the dashboard tab
allows you to combine multiple reports
in a single view this is nice though
that you don't have to go through
several reports in order to get an
understanding of the progress of the
project
therefore the dashboard view is kind of
a one page view or an executive summary
for you to see your project progress you
can include default or custom reports in
your dashboard or you can create your
own dashboard and store it as a public
dashboard which is accessible by all
users within the project or a private
dashboard which is accessible only by
you when you click on the new dashboard
button you can select any number of
default or custom reports to add to the
dashboard you can also specify the
layout which includes two column or
columns and so forth and then you can
save the dashboard under the public
dashboard or private dashboard folders
we have completed the introduction to
the reports and dashboards take a look
at the menu options available to the
user when you log in to the or go test
manager on the upper right-hand corner
there's a few menu options one of them
is the project menu when you hover over
the project menu with your mouse you
will be presented with the Falling
drop-down options open import data and
export project when you select open it
allows the user to select which project
to open and work on user can only open
projects they have permission to view or
edit when you select import data it
allows you to import data into the
project for requirements issues tests
voters test cases and test results the
user importing must have right access to
the project currently we support both
CSV and XLS format for data import
there's a number of important plates
that can be found on the odium server at
the installation directory data samples
protium import directory selecting the
export project menu option allows users
to export test plans requirements tests
test sets issues and/or attachments from
the web UI you can use the exported zip
file to import data into another otm
project or otm server the Tools menu has
the following option systems
repositories and options the systems
option allows you to manage otm agents
to connect to and executing scripts
remotely by default there is a noti'm
server system for localhost and it comes
pre-configured with the installation the
repository is where you manage your
script repositories for automated test
cases and by default a default
repository is there pre-configured with
installation or localhost the options
menu option allows user to configure
their user information tree preferences
change their password and also reset
user state from the login user we have
completed an overview and introduction
of otm now let's take a look at the
actual product via a product demo hi
welcome to the Oracle test manager demo
we will start by reviewing the
administrator console to begin
I am currently logged into the Oracle
test manager server because I'm on the
server I can launch the Oracle test
manager administrator via the Start menu
another way to log in to the
administrator console is to launch the
browser and enter the following URL
the format for the URL is as follows
HTTP colon slash slash hostname colon
8080 8or slash admin please note that
because I'm currently on the OU team
server I can enter localhost as the host
name if I were to log on from a remote
location the host name would be the name
of the otm server box also 8088 is the
default port however it is configurable
and can be different and required SSL is
also supported
therefore if the administrator had
enable SSL mode the URL would be HTTPS
instead of HTTP when you install otm it
comes with two default accounts you can
log into the otm product using both
administrator or default usernames with
the same password that you entered
during a TS installation both accounts
have full access to the product for the
database drop down both ot MDS is the
default database for otm befall olt
database is the default database for
oracle o testing multiple databases can
be added to this drop down list which is
configurable through the database
configuration utility Meldrick is a
sample database that I have added using
the configuration utility therefore you
probably won't see this after you
install the product I will go ahead and
log in as administrator to the oats ot
MVS database once you're logged into the
administrator you will see the four tabs
that we reviewed from the slides in
their users tab the upper pane shows a
list of user accounts on the OT MVP if
you highlight any of the user account
the lower pane will show you the rows
assigned to each project for that
account again default and administrator
accounts will be set up to get you
started as part of installation of the
product the first thing you probably
want to do is set up new users in otm so
let's go ahead and add a new user
the add user dialog window has two
checkboxes one is for an enabling email
notification and the other for enabling
administrator access I will go ahead and
select enable email notification so by
default a new user has viewer permission
for all the projects you can
multi-select the projects and assign
user roles in one shot the edit role
dialog window allows you to set the same
row for all the projects or you can
assign a different row for each
individual project
let's move on to the Rose tab the Rose
tab contains a set of default rows that
come with the installation of the
product highlighting the row on the
upper pane will display the permissions
on the lower pane you can create custom
rows and assign any permission as you
wish let's go ahead and add a new row
when adding a new row you can select a
base row to pre-populate the permissions
then you can modify the permissions as
required these permissions map to
different areas within the product for
the test module there's an execute
permission for user to execute scripts
for this custom role let's go ahead and
grant full access to requirements but
only reaper mission for everything else
the project's tab is where data can be
set up for multiple projects a default
project called empty project will come
with the installation of the product I
went ahead and renamed empty project to
demo project a project can map to a
particular application or module within
an application or anything you want to
consider as a project highlighting a
project on the upper pane will display
the users row to that project on a lower
pane let's go ahead and add a new
project
when adding a new project there's a
checkbox to an enabled track history for
requirements test cases issues when this
checkbox is selected history tracking
audit trails will be unable to track
changes to every node for almost every
field for the project this resulting
additional rows in the Oh team database
which may cause some performance
degradation
hence we provided an option to not
enable tracking by default all users
have viewer role to a new project which
can be modified you can multi-select
all the users in assign roles in one
shot users can be assigned to different
roles for each project
the edirol dialog window allows you to
set the same rule for all the users or
you can set different row for each
individual user
you can also clone a project which will
copy all the users and their permissions
over to the new project essentially
you're cloning the project setup for
users rows and fields if we were to
clone this my project the data from my
project will not be copied because the
assumption is you will be populating the
new project with new data the fields tab
is where all your fields are setup for
the project a set of default fields will
come with installation of the product if
you click on the module name you'll see
all the fields for that module whereas
if you select just the default fields or
custom fields node you will only see
those field types for each field you
have a name and a label the label is how
the field will appear in the UI there
are a number of different field types
such as user list option list text etc
let's go ahead and add a custom field
for the test plan module and here in the
new field dialog window you can specify
field properties
such as whether the custom field applies
to all project or to a specific project
if the field is required enabled if any
field change within this field will
trigger email notification whether to
include this feeling notification emails
and some other project specific options
let's go ahead and make this new module
custom field required and because it's
an option list field you will be
prompted to enter the new option go
ahead and add options a and option B in
the drop down list
finally the Tools menu is where the
administrator can do a number of tasks
the unlock lock records is an emergency
feature to be used to clear all locks in
a database when the product fails and
leaves entries locked for editing the
purge deleted record physically removes
all deleted data from the database
deleted items are marked as such and are
not showing in the user interface
however they're kept in the database
until the database is purged
we recommend that the Oh team
administrator regularly purge deleted
records in order to free up space in the
database setup email configuration
displaced the dialog box for configuring
the mail server to use for email
notification there's also a traceability
section where you can configure a number
of out-of-the-box notifications that
come with installation manage default
reports is where you can manage the
default report for each individual user
you can check the boxes for the reports
you want the user to see and uncheck it
for the reports that you don't want the
users to see we've covered just about
everything in the administrator console
let's go ahead and log out and log into
the otm product as an actual user to do
so launch the browser and enter the
following URL HTTP colon slash slash
hostname
: a da da for /tm again in my case since
I'm on the OU team server I enter
localhost however if I were to log on
remotely Luca host would be replaced
with the server name let's go ahead and
login as the default user with the
password specified during installation
the default user has full access
permission for all the modules therefore
this user will see all five tabs in
addition to reports and dashboard if for
example this user does not have Reaper
mission to the test plan module then the
user will not see the test plan tab
after login the test plan tab is where
you define any information related to
your testing examples of this would be
information around scope of your testing
project testing methodology to use any
entry or exit criterias and test
strategy and approach let's quickly
review the user interface I will go
ahead and zoom in a little bit to make
things a little bigger on the left-hand
pane you have the tree view all of the
main modules with the exception of
issues tab have a multi-level hierarchy
in the tree view this means you can have
a parent node with child nodes when you
hover your mouse over any of the parent
node it will display the count of number
of sub nodes so for example if I hover
over master test plan it shows that
there are foursome notes underneath it
please note that this does not include
the child nodes within the sub nodes
when any node is highlighted details for
that node will be shown on the
right-hand pane along with information
for any attachments links and associated
assets
I've pre-populated this test plan with
an attachment a link and associated
assets clicking on the attachment link
will prompt the user to save the
attachment
clicking on the link will launch a new
browser and bring user to that URL
clicking on the Associated assets link
will bring user to that particular asset
so let's go ahead and click on the
associated requirement with unique ID to
this brought me to the requirements tab
into the particular record which is
requirement number two you can then
click on additional associated assets
for into and traceability so for example
if you want to see The Associated test
plan for this requirement you can click
on one of these links and it will bring
you to that test plan and if you want to
see associated issues for this test plan
you can click on that link to see the
issue so this is the nice thing about
associating assets with one another
there's traceability from one tab to
another or end-to-end accountability
let's go back to the test plan tab on
the test plan toolbar there's buttons to
add edit delete copy paste and a history
button to see the history of any edits
to the test plan in addition there's
also up down indent and outdent button
for you to move the test plan around
within the tree view the go-to field is
a very nice feature in that it allows
you to pull up a particular record as
long as you know its unique ID every
record with an otm is automatically
assigned a unique ID upon creation so we
want to jump to test plan 35 quickly we
can enter its unique ID into the go-to
field and get there please note that a
unique ID stays with the record even
when its location moves within the tree
view let's go ahead and add a new test
plan
notice that the new custom module field
is required and it contains the drop
down values that we've added when
creating a new test plan you can quickly
add an attachment or link to it in the
attachments section the test line will
be created as a sibling of the
highlighted node this means that it will
be at the same level as the highlighted
node and a unique ID will be assigned to
the new test plan and you can move it up
down or indent and outdent
let's go ahead and move this up you can
outdent it or you can indent what other
thing worth mentioning is in addition to
toolbar buttons there's also a
right-click menu that provides many of
the commonly used features to the user
the user interface for the four
remaining integrated modules or tabs
within odm are all very similar to the
test plan tab I will go through each tab
very quickly and highlight areas where
each module is different the
requirements tab UI is similar to the
test plan tab requirements is where you
specify the feature or functionality to
test within the application what's new
on this tab is the fine fun which allows
users to search for a requirement based
on filtering criteria any filter used
will be displayed in the middle of the
find dialog window
with results displayed on the lower pane
you can highlight and navigate to the
record by clicking on the navigate
button here we have highlighted
requirement number ten let's go ahead
and click on navigate that will bring
you to requirement number ten on the
requirements tab you can also click on
preview to preview that record and if
you wish you can also save the filter
for future use by clicking on the Save
button
and once you've saved a filter it will
show up in a safe filter drop-down list
this brings us to the grouping and
filtering features which we see on the
toolbar here within the requirements tab
grouping allows you to organize the
treeview differently and presents the
data from a different perspective let's
go ahead and create a group by priority
and status
so as you can see here we now have
different folders based on the priority
and the status you can expand each node
and drill into the sub nodes and
highlight the node to see detailed
information on the right-hand pane you
can group by a number of default system
fields and save the group requirements
for future use so let's go ahead and
save this grouping as moved by priority
and status you'll see here that once
it's saved it shows up under the saved
groups drop-down when you save the group
requirement it will appear in a group
drop-down list for ease of retrieval and
when records are grouped you can
highlight any parent node to get a count
of the node so for example let's go
ahead and highlight this node and you
will see that there are 11 requirements
underneath it another nice feature is
filtering filtering can work in
conjunction with grouping or standalone
filtering allows you to view only those
records that meet the filtering criteria
let's go ahead and create a filter
called owner equals the default user
this will result in only those records
being displayed you can save the filter
for later use and it will appear in the
filter drop down list since right now
the filter is not save you will see as
current - unnamed let's go ahead and
save the filter
once it's saved you will see it under
the drop-down list the same filter will
also appear under the same filters list
when you click on find button to search
for a requirement or when you modify or
create a new requirement report let's
move on to the tests tab the tests tab
UI is very similar to the requirements
tab tests is where you document detailed
tests of information regarding the
feature or functionality to test the
test folder type allows you to map test
cases to different segments of your
application within the test folder you
can have manual or automated test cases
or both each test case has a test step
section which displays detail steps to
test and a run history section which
displays all the test execution results
of that particular test let's go ahead
and add a new manual test case
as you can see the test steps have to be
manually entered thankfully this
information can also be imported from a
spreadsheet to expedite setup data
import will be covered later on during
this demo
when adding test steps you can also add
attachments to each step okay
now that we've added the manual test
case and also enter test steps let's go
ahead and execute this manual test case
to do so you would highlight the test
case right click and then select quick
run a test run info dialog window will
appear there will be two default system
fields that appear one is run name and
the other is version there may be other
additional fields displayed depending on
how your administrator has configured
the tests module the running field will
default to current date and timestamp
the version you will have to select
after you click on run they run manual
tests dialog window will appear this is
where you enter detailed results for
each test step you can make all the
tests that results the same or you can
select a different test step result for
each test step notice on the far right
hand column there's an ADD issue button
you can click on to create an issue on
the spot if you do so the issue will be
automatically associated to the test
case
so here you see the issue we've created
is automatically associated after
executing the manual test case you'll
see a run history section with the link
that contains the date and timestamp of
the time of execution clicking on the
link will display additional details
such as a result parameters and result
details for individual test steps now
let's go ahead and add a new open script
test case and then run it I'll go ahead
and add the open script test case under
the performance tests folder you'll
notice that when adding an open script
test case the UI is a little bit
different first you have to click on
find and then navigate to the automated
test script selected to add it to the
test case also there's a command line
run setting field which allows you to
enter input parameters for their
automated test case if you had to enter
something here that setting will be used
for every execution if you leave this
field blank you can also enter a input
parameter per execution let's go ahead
and leave this field empty notice that
the test steps are automatically
imported from the script let's go ahead
and execute the open script test case a
similar test run info dialog window will
appear which will prompt user to
complete the same field in addition
there will be a system in command line
run setting field so you can specify the
luteum agent to run the script on and
any additional input parameters for the
script for system let's go ahead and
select otm server which means the script
will run on the Opium server itself
let's go ahead and select in version 4
command line run settings by default ot
and replay scripts from the command line
therefore it does not replay the ink
time if you like to replay within time
you must enter - delay percentage
followed by the mode into the command
line run setting field the mode 4 -
belay percentage input parameter is
explained in the open script user's
guide for the purpose of this demo we'll
go ahead and enter 1 which means
replacing time as recorded once you
click on the Run button you can refresh
the screen and you'll see here that
there is a timestamp under run history
followed by the result and as you can
see the browser is launched for this
particular automated test case and is
navigating through the application
okay let's go ahead and refresh the
screen again and here under the run
history section you'll see that the
automated test case has passed and if
you click on the run history link you
will see the actual opens group report
that is this played with an open script
itself you can scroll through this
report expand all the nodes and even
click on the link for the screenshot
automated test cases can be scheduled to
run on a periodic basis if you wish or
it can be executed as part of a test set
let's go ahead and schedule this test
case to run scheduling a task is very
straightforward basically you select the
agent box that you want to automate a
test case to run on you specify a start
date and time the recurrence and then
you can specify or override command line
run settings then you add the actual
test case which can be an individual
test case or a test set let's go ahead
and schedule the quicklinks test case to
run once at 8 p.m. tonight
you can even configure to send the
completed report to a particular user
within the otm project once a task is
scheduled it will appear in the calendar
and the status will be shown let's
quickly review the requirements and tips
for a successful or go open script
replay this information is also covered
in detail slides 37 to 39 slide 37
mention that both open script and/or go
ets agent need to be installed since I'm
on the odium server box I already have a
full installation and therefore this
requirement is fulfilled another
requirement is both or Co ATS agent
and/or go ATS helpers
need to be running if you look at the
services window you'll see that the orca
80s helper service is running but not
the ortho 80s agent and let me explain
why why 30 I mentioned that if the
script is one of the four types
mentioned which requires an interactive
desktop then the Oracle 80s agent
service has to be started from the
command prompt the script I'm running is
the web functional script with system
inputs therefore I have started the
agent service from the command prompt
one last requirement is the script has
to be accessible by the otm agent box
either by copying the script to the same
location on the agent box or by creating
a shared repository on the Opium server
box let's pretend I'm on the machine
where the open script scripts are
physically saved and this does not have
to be the O team server box itself it
could be any accessible machine out
there within the network so here under
or going TS oft directory is where my
open script scripts are saved and I've
went ahead and shared this folder on the
O team server I added a repository
called
shared repository which points to the
share location afterward I added the
open script script from the shared
repository and using this approach will
allow ATM to load the script from the
share network location and execute it
some other tips worth mentioning from
slide 39 are as follows by default Oh
team does not display browser during
script replay to see the browser stop
both agent services started from the
command prompt and this is what I have
done if you start the or go 80s Asian
service from the command prompt the
browser will be displayed during replay
from otm another tip is by default ATM
does not replace crypt with Bing type to
do so you must enter - delay percentage
mode into the command line when setting
field of the test-case mode values are
explaining open script users guy section
a 2.1 general settings another tip is
that replay fails in the script type
you're running does not require an
interactive desktop you can try running
or go ATS agent service as a Windows
named user account
using this approach no browser will be
displayed instructions for starting the
or coit es agent service as a windows
name user account can be found on slide
39 let's move on to the test execution
tab the test execution tab is very
similar to the test tapping as layout
again there's test voters for you to
organize your test cycles based on
application modules versions or Sprint's
to be tested in this example we have a
test voter for each release followed by
a test set for each type of test such as
smoke regression and performance tests
please note you are not required to
follow this example you may organize
your test set any way you wish if you
highlight a test that you will see
detailed view on the right-hand pane
there's a header section where you fill
out tests that details then there's a
test list section where you specify
which test case is a part of this test
set finally there's a run history
section to see and track your execution
results let's go ahead and edit the test
list upon clicking on the add edit link
you will see a dialog window which
displays the list of selected tests at
the bottom pane you can reorder this
list using up/down arrows you can also
add or remove test cases from the list
using saved filters new filters or
treeview I will go ahead and add the
automated test case we created earlier
and we move some of the test cases here
now let's go ahead and execute the test
set by clicking on the execute test set
link
again there will be a test run info
dialog window that's very similar to the
one saw previously in the test tab one
thing different when you execute a test
set is that you can filter for the test
cases that you want to run so for
example if I want to run only the test
cases that are assigned to the QA
engineer I can filter out those test
cases and run them so you'll see here
that earlier all three test cases were
checked after running the filter only
click links was checked because it's
assigned to QA engineer using this
approach in the case that you have
hundreds of test cases the filter will
come in very handy let's go ahead and
run all the test cases okay so the first
test case is a manual test case let's go
ahead and populate a test step results
and hit OK the second test case is also
a manual test case but because it does
not have test steps you won't have to
populate test step results you just
enter the overall result for the second
test case the third test case is an
automated test case or an open script
script and you will see the browser
launch shortly
automating that particular test case
okay so all three test cases within the
test set have completed and you will see
that two have passed with one warning
which I manually set if you look at the
run history section you'll see that the
overall result is warning and then we
drill down further you'll see which
particular test cases have passed and
which have filled in which is a warning
if we drill down further you can
actually see the detailed results for
that particular test case moving on to
the issues tab the issues tab is where
you track your defects created as a
resolve executing the test case here you
can chase the defect back to the test
case of which the defect was created
against so let's go ahead and click on
the associated link for the test case
and you'll see that there's end-to-end
traceability here because then we can
trace this back to the Associated
requirements and so forth let's move on
to the reports tab in the reports tab
you have a public reports voter and a
mine reports voter reports under the
public report folder are accessible by
everyone within the project reports
under the my reports folder is only
accessible by you so let's go ahead and
take a look at some of the default
reports
okay
in the reports tab you can create your
own custom report and then you can save
it as either a public or a private
report let's quickly create a new test
case list report
and I will filter by priority
for reports there are text based you can
export it to excel or HTML well reports
are graphical based you can export to
jpg let's go ahead and save this as a
public report under other reports here
you'll see that the report has been
saved the dashboard tab allows you to
get an executive summary view of the
project here you will see multiple
reports in a single view when you
install the product there will be three
default dashboards that come with
installation you are welcome to modify
any of these dashboards to your liking
and save its layout you can change the
layout to one two three or four column
depending on your desire let's go ahead
and add a new report to this issue's
dashboard you do so by double clicking
on the report in the tree view and
you'll see that it will be added to the
end of the dashboard you can then save
it or you can create a new dashboard all
together let's quickly review the menu
options under the project menu you can
open another project that you have
access to let's quickly go back to the
demo project where there's data another
project option is import data and this
this option is very nice because it
allows you to quickly pre populate your
project with information so by default
when you install the product there's a
set of default import templates that are
located at the installation directory
data samples otm and import folder you
can take any of these templates and edit
them and use them as your own template
let's go ahead and enforce the manual
test cases
the first thing you want to do is select
the type your case we want to import
some manual test cases with the manual
test case template you can click on Auto
match which will automatically map the
fields from your import template in the
fields on the OU team server defined for
that module in our case since we're
importing new manual test cases we don't
want the parent ID to be mapped so we'll
remove it but in the case where you are
updating existing manual test cases you
do have to remember to map the parent ID
field okay let's go ahead and map the
name field to the test field if you have
any custom fields there's a chance that
the auto match will not automatically
match the fields so make sure you review
this list from your template and make
sure that the fields you want to map are
actually mapped prior to hitting ok ok
so we've successfully imported 25 manual
test cases the time it took was three
seconds which is fairly fast and if we
refresh this screen you'll see that the
test case is along with test steps have
been imported another option under the
project menu is export project this is
the opposite of the import feature where
the export menu allows you to select
which tabs you want to export so if you
select requirements it will export all
the data from the requirements tab you
can select more than one checkboxes you
can also export attachment there's
different types of encoding supported
for the export functionality this is
nice because you can export an entire
project to a zip file and then you can
take that zip file and import into
another o team server or project the
Tools menu has some options as well the
systems option is where you define Euro
team agent machine by default there will
be a otm server which
the server that is hosting the otm
product when you add a new agent you
need to populate with some information
in order for the OU team server to
connect to the repositories is where you
can add new script repositories and for
the case of our demo I added a share
repository that points to a network
location the options menu is where the
user can specify different information
such as user information their tree
preferences if you would like your tree
view to display more than 30 nodes this
is where you would specify it user can
also change password and reset the user
state in here ok this wraps up our demo
we encourage everyone to go ahead and
get started with Oracle test manager
thank you this is the end of the
application testing suite or go test
