it's been a long day and it's after five
so I noticed some people are walking
around with bud lights I think that's to
be encouraged we're not serving them but
we certainly don't ban them from the
room so this is an expert panel you can
see open source Identity and Access
Management the experts are gathering
around me my name is Kelly McKinney I'm
the moderator I am NOT an expert I'm an
end user the topic is a it's a big topic
it's an important topic of identity
access management and then the open
source aspect of it is interesting and
topical and new and and so Sean McKinney
is my brother and he brought the panel
together and so what he's going to try
to do is he's going to try to let these
four experts present and and then we're
going to try to have time for questions
so my role is timekeeper I was the only
one of the watch so he asked me to come
up and keep everybody on time so what
we're going to try to do is get folks to
these gentlemen to to talk to their
slides in five minutes and we'll see how
successful we are at that and then we're
going to open it up to you for questions
so hopefully you'll be thinking about
your issues and your questions as they
relate to what what is discussed here
and we can so we're really interested
we'd love to if we could after after the
presentations to have an interesting
discussion so my expert panel ludovic
poitou from forgerock matthew harden
from sinus Pascal Jacoby back here half
hidden behind the podium and Sean
McKinney from joshua tree as I said
we'll start with the presentations and
then we'll open up for questions
here are some of the sample questions
that we came up with and we may come
back to these if if we don't get a lot
of participation at the end so ludovic
wat 2 is going to lead us off thank you
great good afternoon everyone so I lead
a big part two I work for fourth rock
just a quick word about Fort Rock we're
a startup company started about three
years ago we're growing pretty fast
we're about 80 employees worldwide and
we hear the board in San Francisco but
we have offices in different countries
I'm based in France and I'll manage the
French office which is in a research and
development center and we recently
raised some money from accel partners
and we have pretty big figures as
advisors to you recognize Scott McNealy
who was this morning presenting to our
customers at a breakfast and james
gosling who is also helping us and we'll
be at a party with Frank tomorrow I'm a
software engineer at core that's my what
I've studied and what I've done for the
last 20 years I'm I used to work for Sun
and then I moved to Fort Rock I'm now
moving more into the dark side of
product management but I'll still coding
and I enjoy Java so for truck as a
vision having a complete open identity
stack and and this tag is made of free
product that I shares common services
like authentication authorization all
the logging the auditing everything is
common to all three products but each
product as its own role so we have open
IDM which
the provisioning and workflow we have
open am which does the authentication
Federation and access control and we
have a directory that is basically where
you store all your identities what is
unique is everything is open source we
share the command modules between all
the free products we have a common API
so you can access we're very consistent
API as all of the services and we will
have a common UI that will be able to
manage whatever aspect of identities
that you want throughout all the
products and everything is one hundred
percent Java so pure Java pure open
source to dive a little bit more our
product they're open source you can find
everything in the community we asked the
open source community and services at
for short lorg we use the CDL license as
you are going to see most of what we do
is enroute it from sun microsystems so
opening m is the authentication
authorization and Federation product it
is actually the continuation of San open
SSO project and it's an access manager
project open DJ is the directory server
I'll that compliant directory server
it's again a continuation of a Sun
project the open D s project that was
started to replace the Sun directory
server project so these to project our
project are still on java.net but you
don't see any changed or occurring to
them open the s open SSO they bought
that so we took over the development of
it and continued as open source we're
investing into the source code and
developing the product and we're also
selling support subscription the third
product is open IDM and that's the
identity management
solution with jazz provisioning
reconciliation and workflows it's a new
project we build it from scratch and the
intent is actually to provide a very
flexible framework for doing at aunty
provisioning and it's built by the
people who used to deploy San identity
manager at sin so we leverage one of the
project I was there the identity
connector framework and connectors the
identity connection framer is a project
where people can contribute their
specific connectors and it works with
our product it works with Sun IDM it
works with other vendors IDM product so
that's briefly another view of what we
do as for rock and from then I'm going
to let who is next is whose and that was
exactly five minutes so thank you Ludo
that was great next is Matt pardon and
we're trying to figure out how to get
that large as you can see what it is
you're talking about you need that need
to be able to see that okay if to to
advance the afternoon evening are you
all doing
alright so I'm Matt harden and I'm from
Simas I'm kind of the odd man out here
let's see I want to talk to you a little
bit about Simon's very very quickly what
we really are about and what I want to
talk to you about is really how we turn
how we turned an open source product
into from a reference platform into a
commercially accepted platform that's in
use by many of the fortune 500 companies
so this is a kind of our Simas creds one
of the interesting things about us is
that we have no debt we are completely
bootstrapped we're very small very
distributed we take advantage of all of
the internet technologies that are
available like voice over IP our data
centers down in San Diego and we have
you know staff on two continents so
that's if you if you missed anything go
look it up on the good look it up on the
web let's see about me I'm a generalist
my my philosophy is use the right tool
for the job Java's not bad c is great so
come on guys all right actually know
that I really and truly do believe in
using the right tool for the job a lot
of what we did though in Simas and this
is just my you know my credentials okay
so I've done a lot of work a lot of gray
hair a lot of lost hair and here we go
so how we got here man this is tiny how
did we get here come on I need something
to so happy
now it's not going to work anyway all
right that's really tiny see maybe he
has an old operating system here what do
you think nope okay you know what I'm
going to go for a why thanks great
suggestion looking for a job all right
okay so besides having the prettiest and
the sexiest directory server on the
market we invested very heavily since
2000 we invested in the openldap code
base and that was early days for open
source moving into the into industry and
our first I remember we got a call from
hewlett-packard one afternoon about a
month after we decided that we wanted to
to package openldap and we didn't we
didn't know what to say they became our
biggest customer our first customer we
run their global directories but we also
have a full list of you know of a-list
clients so what we brought though was
professional product discipline and we
married that to the freedom of open
source it hadn't really been heard of
except in places like red hat we didn't
know whether it was going to work or not
but what we found very very slowly over
the over a period of time is that
responsible conduct engenders confidence
because that's really what we found we
needed people didn't believe us they saw
our pricing they didn't believe us okay
because we were offering better software
for a lot less money than you could have
elsewhere so we came up with a set of
with a set of guidelines we believe in
transparency and access to personnel the
person that answers the phone when you
call support can usually solve your
problem whether it's a complex problem
or a simple problem and you know we try
really really hard to be easy to do
business with
and you know partner partnerships and
alliances are key sponsored development
I talked about HP a little bit earlier
the first six or eight major overlays
that went into openldap were
commissioned by a hewlett-packard and
they were donated and so we found that
that was really a great Avenue for for
enhancing the software it all goes into
the source space it all gets pushed
upstream and then it all gets turned out
and built as part of openldap Simas
opinel that binaries that we that we
test and ship so we have resellers and
OEMs around the globe we also are
working with organizations like joshua
tree which you'll hear about and so
openldap is becoming a component in
thinking in pieces that are higher up in
the stack and the other thing that was
really really important was persistence
reputation and gaining the trust of our
customers the biggest aspect of the
biggest thing that I can point to about
the reason that we were successful in
this in this business was that people
trust us we have impeccable references
and it's not you know is not the BS that
you get from oh yeah they came in and
they delivered its you know we actually
go the extra mile and and our customers
notice the difference our retention rate
were an annual subscription base our
retention rate is above ninety five
percent which is very very good and we
are acquiring new customers at a fairly
fairly low rate I mentioned that we were
nine people we don't ever expect to get
real big but you know we what we want is
a good solid customer base and we want a
business with lots and lots of legs
because there's an expression when I was
young when your customer gets a cold you
get pneumonia you know and by god you
know when
different we have we have customers in
all different segments of the end of
Industry and so not all of them are
going to get nailed at the same time I
hope you know 2013 is still coming why
thanks well you know open source for
security we think we really do think
that it's the best approach for
developing software security software in
particular you want extensive peer
review the security comes from the
algorithms and good design and if you're
hiding your source code you're hiding
some skeletons whether you know that
there are not you know community-driven
openldap is what it is because of the
community that is that is using it and
contributing it to it we're not the only
contributors and you know our one of the
chief benefits is the ability to use it
free of charge if you have if you have
the wherewithal the people to do it and
you're willing to commit the resources
have at it we're not you know we don't
get territorial about it and the other
key thing is that that openldap is owned
by a completely neutral entity the open
L that Foundation exists only to promote
openldap it's not not a business it's
it's only there for that for the wealth
of for the health of the software and
even though you know we fund they don't
listen to us too much so let's see
partnerships for mutual benefit and
they're not always they're not always
necessarily financial sometimes it's
just through reputation we do a lot of
work like that I think that a very
important part of getting open source
into security has to do with ubiquity
you've got to have interfaces from every
single major language environment pearl
you know perl PHP Python Java is already
there you know the sea bindings are
going to come along sometime next year
once those are in place then we can do
the other ones and I'm talking
specifically about for fortress which
we'll hear about a little bit later on
you
other thing that we see that's really
really important is education we run
ldap University which we don't run as a
profit Center it takes engineers out of
the support team for two days two dead
days and so we run it really the cover
and to educate our people our customers
because we know that if we have a
customer that knows what they're doing
and has been through our training class
that our support costs are lower and
then the other thing is it has to become
the defective standard you know when
you're going to share files among a set
of linux boxes what's the first thing
comes to mind NFS right well so we need
the same kind of the same kind of
commonality it's just got to be out
there you know say well okay you know
the our vac standard the mist are back
standard what else are you going to use
it doesn't make sense to do anything
else when and and and i'm going to brag
just a little bit when you say you want
an open source sell that product what
are you going to get you're going to go
get openldap aren't you now not to take
away from from you know ludos product
but openldap has been out there longer
and it's more stable and it's just been
more accepted and so what we need to do
is we need to push this stuff out there
you know more security products out
there in the same way and they need to
be accessible at low-cost or no-cost
that's all I have thanks for listening
I trust you with us well well good
afternoon everybody so I've been invited
by shown here as other two to
participate in that forum in order to
present the project which is which has
been started within France around under
the umbrella of object web which is an
open-source incubator which has been
doing a number of projects among the
years which are probably not well known
on these shores of the Atlantic but
which seem to have some value so I'll
try to cover a bit what has been done
already in the field of out of your
identity management within that
incubator very very quickly and then
what we are working together just to
give you a feel about what's what's
being cooked at least on on the other
side of the Atlantic this being said all
these products are probably to be seen
as an a community re open source
projects by opposition by a
company-sponsored which means that they
are generally developed around the
academia etcetera and I believe the
first achievement that should be
mentioned before where we started that
the fact that everything is being done
now under the umbrella of an open source
major initiative in Europe there are a
few which are starting and which are
less known and probably it it would it
would be worse that they are more known
around the around clam management so I
have no time to dive into details what
is certainly that within a club project
you'll find some pieces for
authorization and authentication which
are the core of identity management and
here there are very
that we do that our probably worth
noticing next please so I will not dive
into detail but the foundation for us is
that we are already a project which is
running which is serving literally tens
of thousand users around authentication
which is called lemon ldap which means
that we are probably better or software
than that marketing but this is the name
of the project and there is very little
I can do with that this being said the
product the product is much more
interesting in our opinion that its name
in terms of support of nearly everything
it's mostly you can see it as a Swiss
Army knife of authentication it as it is
now used essentially to build the
federal identity federation services
around sam'l which means identity
provider and service providers and
essentially it scares me to to thousands
of users proven as it serves all the
ministries in in in you in France at
least and in some countries in Europe
the other advantage we we find it to
that component is that being written for
all its non-core components in / is it
is extremely easily customizable
adaptable to a specific needs etcetera
etcetera and again it's architecture as
being total for massive environments
such as the ones we expect as soon as we
will be in cloud computing environments
next please so then what am i doing me
and be on the basis of that I'm
essentially a community manager starting
to implement a project within that or
other body to framework which will be an
authorization architecture so as the
picture i put here is typically a very
classical infrastructure for
authorization which is essentially a
client what they call the pet policy
enforcement point which calls the engine
which is the PDP and the PDP's
essentially controls
a security policy that would allow you
for example to say that w w dot
something dot com is not easy is only to
be accessed by people coming from a
given domain between work hours of such
things like that so it's a pretty
significant cific and significantly
sophisticated language which has been
blessed by the oasis consortium and that
we are working against the problem being
that sophisticated me means very complex
and the whole issue about that is
mystery trying to find the balance
between the two which is not a simple
which is less than a simple job next so
I'll skip this one because there is no
time so the core of it everybody in the
authorization business works with some
xacml essentially which is probably
which is probably too not to go for long
because now we are facing difficulties
with that in terms of support of xacml
version 3 which means the version which
is usable in cloud environment so there
are good reasons why we can believe that
the the end of light of that component
will happen sometime but for the moment
we are working on that and we are
working on that for a very good reason
which is that it has been it has been
proven to be extremely flexible and when
when I'm saying flexible let's imagine a
scenario where you want to control the
access we have policies where you want
to control the access of the system
based on external system such as for
example the heat of the computer or
whatever you can you can implement such
things very easily within that framework
so it has proven to have qualities even
if it has defect so we're complementing
that in a number of ways in order to
make a solution or at least a framework
that will that will provide a number of
things pretty distinctive we believe
next
and one of those things and I'll
probably stop there is the fact that we
strongly believe that any solution which
provides roles should be based now on
attribute certificates on x509 attribute
certificates which is something that
probably are very not very popular so
let me just explain this one
certificates for identifying someone are
now something common that everybody uses
since the advent of ssl on the PK eyes
and all good things what is less known
is that the standard has evolved in 204
I believe with a new flavor of
certificates which mimic a corporate
batch and not an identity card but with
what this means that those pieces of
data are telling you note that you are
John Smith but that John Smith is enable
easy as the access to the corporate
building for example so that's a
different that's a completely different
semantics which is part of the x.509
standard since very well and which
provides a very elegant means to provide
role information when I mean elegant I
mean for example that the level of
security that you get with that is by no
means comparable to putting people in
putting people in groups in the
directory as you do or things like that
thinking of delegation of roles for
example becomes extremely simple with
such a design so we are strong strong
believers of those technologies and
whims were implementing that within the
second web framework in strong core
collaboration with English team
University team which has been developed
initializing those works and I think
this is it now yes this is it thank you
thanks Pascal so my name is Sean
McKinney and I'm the designer and
creator of a product called fortress and
it's an open-source identity access
management solution implements many
standards most importantly antsy or back
and so just curious how many of you know
what the four components aren't of aunty
are back so I'll help you out with one
of them hierarchical roles that's one of
them anybody yeah and that's pretty
common so a lot of people claim next
slide please a lot of people claim to be
our back compliant you'll hear a lot of
vendors throw that around if there are
back compliant you know we've got groups
we've got access control this that's not
our back okay our back is much more than
that so I don't have time to explain
that to you right now but fortress is is
that's one of our main things is that
were you know one hundred percent are
back compliant so anyway why am i
standing here in front of you this
journey that I'm on started three years
ago and i was here at javaone 2009 and i
presented a blueprint for securing web
and Sola based applications and at that
time we didn't have anything really to
give you we didn't have anything to tie
it all together now we you know we
obviously were using matte solution
which was openldap and we were using
some other things but we didn't have one
product to kind of tie it all together
so did anybody see that session by the
way TS 42-13 three years ago good I'm
glad nobody was there because it was
awful it was 60 slides I had 60 slides
of trying to show you how to do it and
it was just far too difficult to do so
but this is something that I've been
spent I've spent probably 10-15 years in
the trenches learning how to do this and
myself an entity
with other people and so it's not really
something that is real easy to do so so
after that session I kind of went home
and had my tail between my legs I was
really disappointed because it's just
you know because what we're trying to do
is help you guys we're trying to help
you with your identity problems we're
trying to give you something that you
can use to secure your networks in your
applications and I didn't have that at
the time to give to you so I went back
to my boss and I worked for a fortune
100 or a fortune 500 company and I was
lead security architect for this company
and they called themselves the largest
financial services provider for retail
banks in the world so this is a big
company and I went back to him and I
said you know you know that product that
I've been spending 15 years on can we
open source that can we give it to the
community and it was like trying to feed
a salad to a dog okay that just wasn't
going to happen right and and that's a
problem today is that a lot of the big
companies they don't understand the
value of a releasing source code as a
you know as a public thing they don't
they don't understand the value now
they're going to consume it and they're
happy to consume it but they're not
going to release it they don't want to
support it and the reason why is because
the executives all they see is risk and
they don't see any the reward okay so i
was pretty frustrated by that and i
ended up quitting my job and i spent
three years and i designed the system we
call it fortress and next slide please
and so fortress is a standard
standards-based so everything is all
about standards and and so I already
told you about our back I wish I could
tell you more I don't have time but
that's not all it is it's got some other
things it's got this thing called a are
back which is administrative role based
access control and that's how you do
delegation that's how you that's how you
maintain users and administrative
policies over a large enterprise how do
you how do you delegate that policy
securely and how does that work and so
that's part of what's in there we've got
a ETF password policies we've got
centralized audits we we've implemented
providers for java ee security so if you
use websphere used tomcat or use jboss
we got plugins that you can use that map
back to our API and back to our
directory the other thing that we've
done is we bundle this API with
infrastructure okay because an API is
not enough okay and that's why I had
Matt up here talking to you about the
directory okay you got to have an
enterprise directory and so what we did
with fortress is that we created these
packages these binary packages that you
can pull down for many different
platforms and it has a wizard that
installs and installs openldap and it
runs regression tests and it has all
these tools and and the reason is
because we want to give you something
that you can use to secure your
applications now we're not in it because
we just you know I mean honestly we're
going to have paid support right i mean
we got to keep we got it we got to keep
the lights on but there's no strings
attached to this source code it's bsd
everything in its open source you're
free to use it you can use it
commercially there's no strings attached
so and these are some of the things that
we've got I don't have time to go
through it but next slide please so what
we're working on tomorrow is we're
getting ready to release something
called on moss which is a it's a policy
server it implements rest so that not
only do we give you a Java API that
implements these protocols that I'm
talking about but we've wrapped it with
rest so that you can use it across your
enterprise you can call it from non Java
applications and that's going to be
released at the end of this month will
be a beta release okay and then another
thing that we're working on it's called
commander and that's our web UI so we're
going to give you a web UI that you can
use so you can provision these policies
that we're talking about and then what's
in the inception phase right now is
perimeter which is an SSO server and
we're probably not going to build that
we're going to go out we're going to
find a best-of-breed solution from
somebody it might I don't know who yet
it might be lemon ldap it might be
something else but we're going to find
an ssl server we're going to bundle it
so our idea is what we're trying to do
is give you a complete one hundred
percent ready to go I'd any access
management solution so that you can use
it because because it's time that we
started to do something and and it's
time that we stopped rolling our own
solutions and have something that
is available for everybody so that's
basically what we're trying to do and
you know I'm not going to sit here and
tell you that our solution will be the
one that ends up being the ubiquitous
solution that Matt's talking about it
maybe Ludo solution it may be somebody
else's solution but we're going to
consolidate and what we're going to have
eventually is we're going to have one
open source I Dana access management
solution that competes with the
commercial guys so that's our vision
that's what we're going to do i think
the remarkable thing is how close you
guys came to actually staying on time
and the other question is any thoughts
or questions or comments criticisms
what's missing words of encouragement
what are we not talking you know what
what do you need migration path join us
show us how to do it okay one thing that
I guess did you put the slide on and how
to contact us so I mean we're probably
not going to figure out a migration path
in 15 minutes but you know the thing
about these community solutions is it
takes you have to contribute you have to
join us you have to feed us your
requirements you have to use it you have
to feed us bugs go ahead just one thing
on the migration path if you're a son
customer or you used to be a son
customer migration path for us is
straightforward we're just continuing
the product so it's easy openssl you
migrate it's an upgrade to open it open
am you want to upgrade openssl your
access manager solution to Oracle access
management you have to replace it we do
it so that's one answer the other answer
is we're working with partners that are
doing integration and they have
migration solutions they do it for for
our customers and they reuse that and
they know how to migrate project to
project I'm not saying it's easy some of
it is really entrenched especially
identity management
is really entrenched into your business
but there are solutions to migrate what
was the question
yeah so the question is more about SSO
and what our solutions to embrace
multiple protocols and even multiple
services where it's an enterprise SSO
versus webos assert that okay our
solution is is really web SSO solution
we're not focusing on the enterprise one
because the data the problems are very
different there are solutions that you
can use to do enterprises issue and that
fits within our product well we'll take
it as a requirement so enterprise SSO
that's that's what you're saying there
there are some I think there's an open
source solution at least developing
France doing enterprise excessive that
can fit also with what's called Lucien I
don't remember the name it's okay well
we'll hand out some business cards you
can get me get ahold of us later ok so
there's another question the back the
room go ahead kerberos what cameras is
one is
soon as you enter complex business
agreement
what work
I
we have time for one more question if
there's one more 11 okay we've got as he
said and there were some great questions
thank you very much we do have business
cards up here and there's been a last
question
so you're talking about maven
integration and maven is basically a
double problem it's not so yes summer
pursues project are playing with other
open source project and maven is one way
to integrate especially in the Java
world at Sun we didn't use maven faudra
we're moving everything to maven whether
that is going to be useful for you as a
developer to build on top of this
project maybe there's license issue
there are different things that you want
to look at but as a deployment for an
enterprise I don't see maven being
useful we're really focusing on building
solutions to solve problem for customers
it's open source you can play with it
you can integrate within your project
we're trying to do things to help like
moving to maven but I don't think maven
is like ultimate solution to customers
mavens a tool that helps you deliver it
but it's not the it's not the solution
thank you for that comment all right and
we got we don't said mixed
I remember as far as i remember ourself
to deja bullet doesn't provide the
single log out yet for example it which
is which is which is present in in other
solutions just to take an example we
believe that the architecture of
Shibboleth might be more unified etc so
there are plenty of discussions at least
in Europe around the usage of simulate
which are not in all ways which are
mixed would I say that's it guys thank
you very much excellent discussion thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
