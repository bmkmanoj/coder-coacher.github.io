databases on MySQL cloud service MySQL
cloud service uses MySQL Enterprise
backup to backup to cloud storage which
in turn uses Oracle storage cloud
service containers as repositories for
backups to the cloud before you can
create a container you must have an
active subscription to Oracle storage
cloud service when you create a MySQL
cloud service instance then by default
backups are stored on both the local
compute node and on an Oracle storage
cloud container you need to specify the
name of the container and the login
details in the backup and recovery
configuration section
if the container does not already exist
you can select the checkbox to create it
you
when the service is running the service
details page shows details of the backup
destination the cloud storage container
and the location of the backup volume on
the local computer note click the
administration tile and the backup tab
shows the defaults backup schedule you
can also configure backups recover from
backups or disable backups in this tab
the default backup configuration follows
a set of oracle best practice guidelines
it performs a full backup of the
contents of the database servers data
directory following by rolling
incremental backups on a seven-day cycle
the default retention period for both
cloud storage and local storage is 30
days with the 7 most recent days backups
available on local storage I'm going to
change the time of the weekly and daily
backups to 10 at 10:00 a.m. UTC
the backup executes automatically at the
specified time when it completes it
remains in the list of available backups
you can also trigger a manual backup by
clicking the backup Now button and
optionally providing a note so that you
can identify the backup later on
let's imagine something went wrong and
we need to restore from the manual
backup we created
you
we are asked to confirm that
wish to proceed which we do so will
click yes back in the list of available
backups the backup we are working with
is shown as being in the restoring state
during the restoring process the MySQL
cloud service instance shuts down the
database performs the restore and then
restarts the database instance
it also creates a new backup of the
state of the server before the restore
operation and records the restore
operation in the restore history list as
well as restoring from a specific backup
we can also restore from a specific
point in time by clicking the recovery
button and specifying the time we want
to revert to now that I have finished
with the manual backup I'll delete it
from the list of available backups to
reclaim storage space
you
note that the option to delete an
automatic backup is grayed out these are
automatically deleted after their
expiration date during a scheduled
backup
