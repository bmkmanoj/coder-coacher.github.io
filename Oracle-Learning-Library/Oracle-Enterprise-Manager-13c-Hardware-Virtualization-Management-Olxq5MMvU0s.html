functionalities have been tightly
integrated with Enterprise Manager in
this 13c release with this Enterprise
Manager can now manage the entire stack
all the way from application to desk
this provides a single pane of glass
management view for administrators this
also enables cross tier management of
the stack as an example you can do
top-down diagnostics have the ability to
drill down into any hardware issues in
the context of an application or you
could do bottom-up impact analysis by
determining which applications will be
impacted if one of the hardware targets
are patched or taken into maintenance
mode all infrastructure targets managed
by Enterprise Manager will show up in
all targets page under servers storage
and network section as shown here you
can see the list of various
infrastructure targets like host server
PDU network virtual servers and
virtualization platform if you have
engineered systems that are being
managed by Enterprise Manager those
engineered systems will show up under
engineered systems section as shown here
here you see supercluster is one of the
engine systems been managed by
Enterprise Manager
now let us look at some of the
functionalities of infrastructure
management in Enterprise Manager 13c
every infrastructure target will have
its own home page let's look at
supercluster target home page
a typical target page will have dashlets
at the top contents of the dashlets
varies based on the target types the
first three dashlets provides most
important information target details
summary of open incidents and resource
utilization every hardware target will
have a photo realistic view of the
target when you mouse over on any
component a pop-up will show details of
the component a red outline indicates
there is an issue with the specific
component with one click it will take
you to the list of incidents in the
incident manager these are the ten
incidents which are very context
specific for that component type once
you troubleshoot these incidents you can
get back to your target another key
feature in this release is target
navigation tree it's an intuitive tree
navigation to bro's and go to any
target in an engineered system targets
are logically grouped by their type like
compute nodes Ethernet switches
accelerator storage servers
InfiniBand switches videos and ZFS
storage servers you can navigate to each
folder and find out lists of all targets
under them as an example under compute
nodes folder you see 4 server target
types let's look at one of the server
target types by clicking on it it will
take you to its home page and from here
we can see the overall health of the
server target and also analyze various
metrics that are gathered for this
target type the first three dashlets
provides most important information
target details it gives you the list of
basic informations like the model of the
server the memory capacity CPU type the
IP address the firmware version the pora
health of the target and also the
locator indicates where in your data
center is this target located
the second dashlet gives you overall
summary of open incidents
it covers all three types of incidents
fatal critical and warning the third
dashlet gives you details on the
resource utilization for two
realistic view provides the actual view
of the target with details of the
component in this case it gives you the
friend view of the target and also the
rare view of the target you mouse over
on any of the component and you will get
more details of that particular
consonant if there is any issue with any
of the target there will be a red
outline you click on that and that will
take you to the list of incidents for
troubleshooting purposes in the incident
manager besides this there is something
called tabs on the right side of the
page here each of the tab gives you lot
of valuable metrics information of the
target so let's look at couple of them
if you go to logical view tab you will
see various metrics collected and
displayed there are comprehensive set of
metrics for each component CPU sub tab
lists out details of the processor
serial number part number location and
operational status of each module
similarly memory sub tab lists out
memory module specific details serial
number part number location and
operational status of the model similar
information is provided for other
components like power fan storage disk
control
network ports and PCI devices there is a
tab for energy consumption
this will let you know the inlet and
outlet temperature and fan speed it also
builds out trend lines for power
consumption and utilization now let's
look at the type of metrics we collect
for this server target under target menu
go to monitoring and choose all metrics
this shows the list of all the metrics
collected for this target it's a very
comprehensive list you can configure
each of these metrics for collection
schedule you can set up treasures that
can trigger an incident alert be it a
critical or warning type let's look at
some as some some parts of configuration
management you can view the topology of
the target this basically shows the
graphical view of the relationship
between various assets this target is
associated with so this is the topology
of the server target and various other
entities or targets that are related to
this target you can do
you'd compare of targets you can
evaluate differences between two targets
or same target at different time
intervals you can also check drift
compliance with the baseline
configuration that you would have set up
based on the policies in your data
center you can also create blackout for
this target that basically enables
suspension of monitoring capabilities so
that you can perform maintenance
operation on this target these are some
of the high-level features of
infrastructure management for various
target types in Enterprise Manager cloud
