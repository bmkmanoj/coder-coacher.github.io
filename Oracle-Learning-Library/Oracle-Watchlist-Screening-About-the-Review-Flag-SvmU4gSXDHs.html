the review flag in Oracle watch the
screening how it works and some of the
options around how it can be configured
and so on
I'm going to give you a hands-on demo of
the review flag and some associated
topics in a minute and I'll give you
quite a lot of background about watch
this screening as well in a minute or
two during that demo but for those of
you who already know watch this
screening pretty well let me just cut to
the chase now and give you the key
points so the review flag then the
review flag is set when some of the key
data in alert changes and it's telling
you that you need to scrutinize that
alert again so you made a decision about
that alerts based upon the data in it
some of that key data has changed and
therefore you need to revisit your
decision maybe it was a false positive
before this alert some of the data has
changed should it still be a false
positive or is it now possibly a true
positive that's the kind of thing you're
deciding now let's deal with one common
misconception out of the box when the
key data changes yes the review flag is
set it comes on but the alert does not
automatically reopen so out of the box
although the review flag is set when the
key data changes the alert does not
automatically reopen you can configure
watch this screening so that happens
that configuration is done in the
workflow I'll show you how during the
demo but it is not out of the box
functionality so don't expect to have
that to happen automatically because it
won't now what is good practice is to
keep track of your alerts which have the
review flag set by creating a filter
and/or a report and I'll show you again
how to do that during the demo let's
talk about the flag key this is closely
related to the review flag so the flag
key is made up of a set of attributes
from your customer data and from the
watch this data so for individuals that
would typically include attributes or
fields if you like like the individuals
name their date of birth the address
data for an entity would be the name
perhaps the city those would be typical
flat key attributes now when you install
watch the screening you get a
pre-configured flag key for both your
customer data and the various watch
lists you can change which attributes
make up the flag key if you want so you
can configure that again I'll show you
how later shouldn't do it in a Cavalier
way you need to think carefully about
what attribute should go in the flight
key but it is possible to change it so
why am I telling you about the flag key
well it's because if any of the values
in any of the flight key attributes
changes that's when the review flag is
set now let me just stress that could be
a value that's changed in a customer
data field that's part of your flaky or
it could be a value that's changed in a
watchlist record field there's part of
your flag key it doesn't matter if any
value changes of an action but there's
part of the flag key on either the
customer side or the watch this side
that's when the review flag comes on it
could be something like an amended date
of birth for example now I want to just
tell you about one specific circumstance
in which the flag key will change and
therefore the review flag will come on
and that's if an alias is added to the
watchlist record tour watch this records
and that alias matches with your
customer record and therefore affects
the alert so if you know about watch
this records you know that the people
and sometimes the entities on watch this
can have multiple aliases multiple
different names they're known by now if
a new alias is added to the watchlist
that affects the name field on the
watchlist side and if that alias
obviously matches your customer and
there's an existing look around it
effectively what that does is it changes
the flag key on the alert because the
name has changed and the review flag
comes on so that's a specific
circumstance in which the review flag
will be set
and it can also happen that the review
flag is set because an alias is removed
from the watchlist as well that's less
common but it can happen and again the
review flag is set because the flag key
changes because the name field has
changed on the watchlist side so that's
a specific example of when the the
review flag comes on it's one that it's
well worth being aware of ok so what I'm
gonna do next is give you a demo then of
the the review flag the flag key and
various other topics around this
let me start with some background about
watch the screening then so the purpose
of watch the screening is to identify
possible matches between your customers
and the individuals and entities who
appear on watch lists now those
individuals and entities will appear on
the watch lists because they're
suspected of activities such as
terrorism fraud money laundering these
kinds of things and when watched a
screening identifies a possible match it
creates what's called and alerts you can
see a list of some of the alerts here
and let me show you an alert so let's go
into one of these alerts now let's try
this one now what we do in the alert
we're presented with on the Left
information about our customer and on
the right information from the matching
watch list record and if we scroll down
a bit you can see we have things like
this is for an individual rather than an
entity things like the name so you can
see the name here is at the same
anthony.alison on our customer record
the same thing on the watch this record
they're going a little bit further down
we've got information about gender and
date of birth you can see the dates of
birth a difference in in these cases so
23rd of July 1994 for our customer and
the 26th of April 81 on the watch this
record and a little bit further down an
address and you can see the address is
not the same it's quite similar 27
Bristol Road Bar 472 Bristol Road Bartha
in the United Kingdom in both cases so
there's somewhat different address so
that's a possible match and what we have
to do as reviewers is make a decision
about this match and we would change its
state so in this case based upon the
fact that yes the name is the same but
the date of birth is different and also
the address is somewhat different we
might say for example we'll eliminate
this we'll say it's a false positive
it's not a true
and we have to give a reason and we
might say for example date of birth and
address different okay and you can see
it now against the state false positive
so that's an example of reviewing and
lurch reviewing a possible match in
watch the screening in this case we've
said based upon the information we have
it's a false positive it's not really
the same person now the question is what
happens if some of that information that
we based our decision upon what happens
if that changes and I'm going to show
you an example of that I'm just going to
change from the data in my customer
record run the watch this screening job
again and then come back and show you
the same alerts so I'll do that and then
I'll show you the same alerts in a few
moments time
so the question I asked was what happens
if some of the key data in the alert
changes some of the data we based our
decision upon now I've made a change to
the data in the source files if you like
the source system and I've run the job
again and because the data have changed
this is what we see the review flag is
set say see this green tick against the
review flag field that's telling us
there's been a change to some of the key
data in this alert and therefore we need
to look at it again and decide whether
our original decision actually is still
correct so I guess the next question
might be well what has changed now
there's a clue to that in the
relationship section of the screen we
didn't look at this when we first looked
at the alert it was there but we didn't
look at it the relationship originally
would have been something like the exact
name conflicts meaning that the name on
the customer record and the watch this
was the same but there was a conflict in
the other day too the dates of birth
were different the addresses were
different so on you can see the
relationship now says exact name city
DOB that is date of birth so what's
changed there is that the date of birth
is now the same whereas before it was
different and if we just go down to the
date of birth section below the name
there you can see that so the date of
birth for our customer record previously
was in 1984 now it's the 26th of April
1981 and that's the same as the date of
birth on the watch list side so we've
updated the date of birth on our
customer record watch the screening has
picked up there's been a change to some
of the key data is set the review flag
is saying right you now need to
scrutinize this alert again so let's go
ahead and do that well we know the the
names are the same hasn't changed
we know the dates of birth and now the
same obviously has changed look at the
location that is different but not very
different
72 Bristol Road bath as against oh
that's from the watch this site as
against 27 Bristol Road bath on
customer side all that's different is
the order of those first two digits that
could be some kind of typo so what I'm
going to do is change the state from
false positive and actually I'm going to
reopen this and say why I'm doing that
whoops so let's say alert reopened due
to significant change in data DOB for
date of birth there we go and obviously
this depends upon how your workflow is
set up might not work in exactly this
way but now I might say right well I'm
gonna send it for more information I
want to find out whether that address is
actually slightly wrong and maybe if we
get the right address for the customer
it'll be the same as the one on the
watch list please investigate customers
address okay and update if necessary all
right something like that or I might
just make it a true positive I guess if
I wanted to be really sure of this so
anyway key thing there is the review
flag is what tells us that some of the
key data has changed now in this case it
was a change to our customer data to the
date of birth in the customer record but
equally the review flag can be triggered
if there's a change to some of the key
data on the watch list side as well so
let's say that the watch list address
had changed to be the same as our
customers address but again would have
made the review flag come on now let's
just ask what doesn't happen well what
doesn't happen what didn't happen is the
alert did not reopen okay the alert was
not reopened that is not part of the
out-of-the-box functionality of watch
this screening so the review flag comes
on you saw that but the alert did not
reopen itself it actually stayed in the
same state false positive okay we
to manually reopen it now you can
configure your workflow your alert
workflow and watch the screening so that
the alert does reopen automatically when
the review flag comes on and we'll look
at how you do that a little bit later on
but it is not out-of-the-box
functionality it needs to be configured
okay so the next thing we're going to do
is we're going to have a look at a
little bit more about how the review
flag gets triggered and how the
mechanism behind the review flag works
now the review flag is based upon
something called the flag key now let me
show you how the flag key is arrived at
so we're going to get a little bit
technical now we're going to go into the
director UI and we're going to go into
the watch T screening project I'm going
to take you into one of the processes so
this is the under the hood kind of stuff
that we're looking at here we'll go into
this process
now what watch this screening does as I
mentioned is it presents you with a
number of possible matches between your
customers and the entities or
individuals on the watch lists and to do
that it basically does some matching and
in the matching we have something called
a case source now I'm not going to try
and tell you everything about the case
source that's a bit about beyond the
bounds of this particular exercise
anyway though within the case sauce we
have I'm just going to find it for you
now
we have something called the flag key
and you can see the flight key here and
the flight key is made up of a number of
fields or attributes in other words from
the data so we have things like full
name given name family name date of
birth some of the address information
here now if anything within the flight
key changes that's when the review flag
is set okay
so this is the flight key now this this
is if you like pre-configured in Oracle
watch the screening when you when you
install Oracle watch the screen you get
this pre-configured Flag key but you can
change it okay so you can change what's
in the flight key you can take things
out so I've just removed date of birth
there probably not a good idea but you
can put things in as well so you can
change the makeup of the flight key if
you wanted and that will change that
will affect when that review flag comes
up in watch this screening so when any
of the elements of the flag key change
the review flag is display this checked
in watch the screening you can you can
configure what's in the flight key
now the flight key is made up of as I
said attributes from each of your data
streams coming in to watch this
screening so what I was doing just there
is I was looking at the customer
individuals data stream but also we've
got the data streams for entities and
for each of the watchlist that you're
dealing with so for example this there's
one of them and each one of those can
contribute to the flag key as well
generally you'd set the same attributes
in the watchlist
as in your customer datum okay so that's
how the flag key is derived so by
changing the attributes you change when
that review flag will be set
okay let's go to one of the other really
important topics I said that out of the
box what happens when one of those key
attributes in the flight key changes is
that we get this review flag set in the
UI when we run the watched a screening
job there picks up as a change to an
element of the flag key we get this
review flag set but that's it
we don't see this ruler being reopened
now let's think a bit more about that on
the going to case management
administration into the workflow and
into the century alert workflow now why
is that review flag set answer because
we have a reception rule that sets it
and what this reception was saying is if
the flag key is changed so this little
bit of JavaScript here then set the
review flag okay
set the review flag to true and in the
UI what we see when that's true is this
little tick okay now if we want to as
well as setting that review flag we
could transition the state of the alert
as well so let's just create a
transition here in the reception rules
and I'm going to transition to reopened
I call this transition sorry transition
to reopened
there we go and what I can do is go into
this reception rule set review flag and
under select that transition
you
and if I kid okay and then I saved my
workflow what that means is now when
there's a change to the flag key so one
of the one of those key attributes
changes not only is the review flag set
but also the the state of the alert will
be changed to reopened so this alert
will be reopened if some of the key data
changes okay just save that so that will
mean that we reopen the alert if the key
data changes that's great but there's
another side to this too which is that
let's say we have an alert which is
reopened because the key data changes
the flag key changes once we review that
alert again and maybe we say well it's
still a false positive or now it's gone
to a true positive or whatever it is
then we want the review flag to be
cleared really and we need to take care
of that in our workflow as well and the
way we do that probably is is like this
so we'd say whenever we make a relevant
change to let's say for example we
eliminate it as a false positive let's
go into that transition as well as
making that transition we should clear
the review flag the three flags of
attribute we can set it to false so
whenever there's a transition - to
change the state of an alert from open
or actually really from reopened is what
we're interested in
then we should transition we should also
clear the review flag okay I think
that's a fairly clear and we do that for
every transition that we that could
operate on the reopened State alright we
clear the review flag
saying okay we've dealt with this we've
now moved it on basically so in our
workflow then we can configure our
workflow in order to reopen an alert
when the flag key changes and to kick to
clear that flag key once we work that
alert again and we reviewed it okay that
doesn't happen out of the box but it can
be configured relatively simply it's not
gonna take you long to do that
whether or not you decide to configure
your workflow to reopen alerts when the
review a review flag is set it's good
practice to report on alerts when the
review flag is set so let me show you
how to set up on those reports you can
go to the filter just look select alerts
and your case source which is gonna be
century and then you can in the
attributes list here I'll just make this
slightly bigger click the plus pick up
the review flag attribute and make sure
this check box is selected so in other
words we're saying show us when the
review flag is selected if I just hit
play now I'll get a filter and that will
show me that there's just a single Alert
weather review flag is selected if I
want to I can go to the reporting
section and actually make a report out
of that perhaps I can put the priority
on the report and let's look at that and
there we are with we can now have a
little report showing me I've got one
medium priority Alert weather review
flag is set we can save the filter or in
this case the report just here and we
can call it a review flag set or
something like that and as with all
reports once it's saved it's in the
browser so somewhere hopefully
are there is and if you want to you've
got the right delivering privileges is
you can move that to go up to the global
filters so that every user of your
watchlist screening implement instance
has access to it so that's good good
practice to have a report showing you
the the alerts where the review flag is
set even if you're reopening those
alerts in your workflow it's still good
practice to do this because there may be
other reasons why you reopen alerts as
well so do have a review flag report
let's think a little bit more about the
flightkey then you can see the flag key
here for customer individuals so after
the box the flag key consists of the
full name given name the family name
date of birth year of birth city and
also country codes now what happens is
that those values are somewhat
normalized and then they are hashed
together and put into a hashed value and
if that hashed value changes that's when
the review flag is triggered now the
fact that normalized means that for
example let's say you just change the
case of the family name in your source
data and your source system well because
that case is normalized that wouldn't
lead to a change in hashed value
therefore it wouldn't lead to the review
flag being triggered nevertheless the
flag key can be quite sensitive so let's
think of an example let's say that you
actually added something to the family
name maybe added a suffix the family
name that would lead to a different hash
value and therefore it would lead to the
review flag being triggered and if you
added another action beat yourself let's
say it was address one street address
and then subsequently the value in that
attribute changed so maybe you go
through a cleansing exercise and you
standardize your addresses or perhaps
your customer actually moves address
well again that would mean that the
hashed value in the flag key changed and
therefore the review flag would be
triggered so the flag key can be quite
sensitive
one of the other things you need to bear
in mind about the the review flag and
the flag keys obviously if you make a
change to the flag key that will affect
when the review flag is put on and if
you've if you've configured to your
workflow to reopened alerts it will also
affect how many reopened alerts you have
so two things there first of all
obviously it will affect the amount of
reviewing you have to do if you put more
attributes into the flag key quite
likely it's gonna be triggered more
often you'll have more reviewing if you
cut down the attributes in the flag key
the opposite effect happens this it'll
be triggered less often probably
depending upon what those attributes are
there's less reviewing to do but also
there's clearly an impact upon risk okay
on your risk profile if you like okay if
you like the greater number of
attributes you have in the flag key the
less likely likely that it is that
you'll miss a change in data okay and
that will affect your risk so obviously
if you're less likely to miss a change
in the data it's less likely that you'll
miss the fact that perhaps something
that was a false positive should now be
a true positive so there's a risk
decision there for you in terms of how
many attributes do you have in the flaky
but also which attributes do you have in
the flightkey okay you can make it more
sensitive if you want to your risk
decreases but obviously the amount of
reviewing you have to do potentially
increases so that's a risk decision that
you need to make what should go in the
flightkey
if we look inside or watch this record
we quite frequently see that it's made
up in fact of a set of Records and the
reason for that is that individuals and
sometimes entities can often go by
multiple different names they can have
different name aliases and owned by
different names and we'll get one record
for each different name then known by
and there's an example of that here this
example is from a private watch list but
you could see exactly the same thing on
governmental watch lists or commercially
available watch this and so on in this
case I'll watch this record is in fact
made up of two records are to record two
and are three record three are one by
the ways the the customer record and
let's just take a look at them they both
have the same list record ID in in other
words they're part of the same watch
this record but if we go down and we
look at the name fields there you can
see what's going on so record two in
that record we see Anthony Anderson is
the name and in record three it's
Anthony add s and with an e rather than
I and there so we've got two different
names this person is known by now there
is quite a small difference but often it
could be a mole major difference than
that we can know completely different a
surname or a completely different first
name or an extra name that someone can
be nobody and so on and so forth so you
know people on watch this and sometimes
Anthony's entities can have different
alias different own name aliases and
when that happens we see this kind of
thing but we've got two records or
perhaps three or four or whatever on the
watch this side and in fact if we take a
look at our relationships you can see
here that both of these watch dis
records have matched against our
customer record that's why we've got two
different relationships so record one
matches record two that means the
customer rap record matches one of the
records in the watch list a record one
matches record three that means the
custom record also matches the other
record in the watch list here okay so we
end up with multiple relationships
now let's think about why I'm telling
you this information
now the reason I'm telling you this is
that it's reasonably common for new
aliases to be added to watch lists and
if that happens if there's a new alias
added for this particular individual in
this case and there's a match between
that new alias and your customer then
the review flag is triggered it's
triggered because there's a change to
the name field we've obviously added
another name that changes the the name
field that's part of the flag key and
that means the review flag is triggered
so just be aware of that if a new alias
is added to a watch a set of watch this
records for an individual for an entity
that will cause the review flag to be
triggered if that new alias matches your
customer now it's also true that if an
alias is removed from a watch this
record and that alias did match your
customer that too will trigger the
review flag in the alert for exactly the
same reason that is because the flag key
is changed because the value in the name
field has changed okay now the removal
of watch this records happens less
frequently than the addition of watch
this records but it can't happen as I
said either of those two things will
cause the review flag to be triggered
so just to sum up then the review flag
is telling you that some of the key data
in either your customer record or the
watch this record has changed and it's
indicating you should look at that alert
again and review it again the review
flag is tripped
if the flag key changes and the flag key
is a configurable set of attributes you
know which attributes you you put into
the flag keys up to you
ultimately that affects your risk
profile and the matter of you have to do
as well and remember that although it's
not out of the box functionality this
fairly straightforward to configure
watch this screening so that as well as
the review flag being set when there's a
change to the flag key and alert is also
reopened if you do do that also remember
to build into your workflow that the
review flag should be cleared when that
reopened alert is reworked</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
