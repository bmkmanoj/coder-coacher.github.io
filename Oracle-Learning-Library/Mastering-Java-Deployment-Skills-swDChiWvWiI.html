deployment some of the stuff that's
happened in the last year we'll skip
that guy so the intent of the deployment
group is to help you create apps and or
deliver your apps to you to your user
now in traditionally that's being with
basically web deployment so things like
web start or embedded Java however with
there's there's a lot of changes
happening in software delivery some of
that for instance like the the app store
for OS X is a new delivery channel and
so that's some of the things we're
looking at and we've been working on to
make that a lot easier to do or possible
to do and bless there's all sorts of you
know there's new platforms ie comes out
with a new new platform windows comes
out with new platform and so are our
intent is to to make it you know a
robust easy-to-use environment for for
deploying your apps so specifically what
we're going to talk about is some of the
things that we've done in the last year
one of our themes is kind of to as
feature parity and its feature parity
across platforms so the intent there is
that to support different platforms and
have the deployment options available on
all of them and there's been a lot of
work done on that last year a lot with
Java effects plus we've got a couple new
or a new deployment option that is quite
exciting I think you should find that
fairly interesting
so I start with just kind of a the ones
where we're featured deprecation is what
we're it's sort of a similar thing any
software base that's been around for a
while and has a lot of features is going
to have features that are either old and
not used that much anymore or there's
going to be duplication for instance the
there's we have two versions of the
plug-in and so the older plugins not
used very much and is a little more
awkward and plug into is a much better
option so there's one of the things
we're doing but basically is to to
streamline our code base allow us to
develop newer features and work on bugs
and not have to spend time so much time
supporting all this code that's not used
by very many people plus some of the
time a lot of these old features don't
map well to web security and web
securities an important issue for us so
this chart just shows you what was
deprecated in jdk 7 and you can see that
when we deprecate something in one major
release and we're going to look at
removing it in the next release so those
those three are targeted it to be
removed and we're also considering a
number of other features 22 deprecated
in jdk 8 and then of course we'll look
at removing them in jdk 9 so if this is
my i suspect this isn't it that
important to many of you there's
probably some of you that have some sort
of older applications that might rely on
some of this and if you're in that group
people then it's this makes sense for
you to be aware of what we're
deprecating what we're looking at
removing see if you check out and find
out what the the recommended alternative
solutions are see if that will work for
you make plans to upgrade and especially
pay attention to what's looking to be
deprecated in jdk 8 you can talk to us
on the blogs and just make sure that if
there's something that's an issue for
you that you talk to us and we'll try to
help you with that so now we're going to
get into the newer stuff and this this
follows our feature parody kind of theme
java is on the mac but it was supplied
by apple and now as a 7 you six it's on
the mac and including the runtime
cluding javafx and it's totally
supported by and done by oracle this is
important because now we when we deliver
to all the platforms we deliver them all
at the same time they're all the same
code base when we fix bugs we fix bugs
across all of them we add features we
add features across all of them so we've
got really good feature parity now
across the various platforms there's
some things to be aware of for instance
the compatibility between JR seven and
Jay are six is what the apple one is is
pretty good so you should be able to
upgrade your your application without
too much problems one of the things to
be aware of is that in Java would be a
virgin's would be updated using them the
mac software update process and now it's
going to be our auto update process
which is the same as it is on the other
plat
arms so in that respect it makes it
easier one caveat is that we're 64bit
only and chrome is 32-bit so I've been
checking to see what's happening with
chrome to see if there's I know there's
some work being done on a 64-bit version
but it it's not obvious to me that it's
happening quickly or it may be it will
be maybe it won't but in the meantime
you've got Safari Firefox etc to to use
another another issue is that there's
there's only one run time although
there's multiple JDK and one of the nice
things is we're also looking at
packaging support for Mac apps and we'll
talk about that a bunch later so
continuing with feature parity at the
same time same 7u six which is the
current release we added JavaFX runtime
support for Linux both 32 and 64 bit so
it's and it also supports all our
deployment options so now across three
platforms you have JavaFX and you have
all the various deployment options plus
the new ones that we're going to show in
a bit now what this shows is sort of our
we have a plan of merging JavaFX to be a
core part of java and you can see from
the first column there it started out as
when we delivered javafx 20 that it was
a separate package you had to install it
separately and then you can see kind of
that there's been incremental
improvements in evolution and the seven
you six one is where its we support the
runtime is supported on all the
platforms it's a CO bundled so it's
delivered in the same package so when
your user in still has if your user has
to install
a day re it gets javafx at the same time
and then we've got a Developer Preview
out that has some more things and most
notably support for the mac store and
then what's the future for java effects
the idea is if you look at the future
role basically we want java facts to be
part of the java specification just a
first class citizen one of the core
libraries and we don't know exactly when
that's going to happen but one of the
concrete things that's going to happen
in jdk 8 is that we're going to match
the version number so Java FEX will
become javafx 80 same as jdk and a big
thing is that it'll be on the run time
will be on the class pass would be much
easier to to run and deploy your apps
and so it's just kind of in summary word
where we're trying to make we're really
working hard on javafx and one of the
things that's a nice benefit of that is
we spend a lot of time on packaging and
tools for job effects and then we sew in
76 for instance we we can package javafx
applications but in our preview least
we're actually doing that for pretty
much any java technology so if we can
use it for swing which might be maybe
more immediately relevant for some of
you okay another fairly big improvement
was to the deployment toolkit what the
so little background what the deployment
toolkit is it's a it's basically a tool
to simplify simplify browser deployment
of your java app things like embedding
it or launching from it with web start
trying to provide better feedback and a
better user experience for your for your
user we have two flavors there's an
older one which is deployed
and I get just back up a bit and another
big part of that is that it's a public
JavaScript API and we had one that we
still have one and it's deployed java
das but it's a more complicated one and
to simplify the the cross-platform goal
and feature parity we started another
one called dt dt java heats eerie music
is so as a simpler client JavaScript API
and so some of the recent developments
are we support all the deployment
scenarios across all the platforms so
that's a that's a big one there's no
auto install on mac and linux at this
point we've even even though the deploy
job is an older one we've also increased
its feature parity but it's it's harder
to do because it's a much more complex
API and I guess one of the more
interesting things is that we've added
dynamic parameter passing and I can
explain that a bit more so if you take a
typical web start application you can
see there's a basically just a link in a
web page there that will launch at your
jnlp app so there's a how this works is
there's obviously a mime type for the
J&amp;amp;L p and the browser will click that
download that and run the helper
function associated with it and this
works pretty good it it has some issues
because it can have more dialogues pok
up so that so they the user experience
isn't quite as nice as you'd like it to
be and you don't really have a lot of
control over it as as a developer
there's not much you can customize
however I've used the
the dt javed is to launch so you're
using javascript to launch your
application you can do a lot more
control because you can set parameters
and and control it from the JavaScript
and so it's a much smoother user
experience gives you much more control
it's less fragile just generally helps a
little bit them another issue is that
instead of having a to have a fixed
codebase it now can be relative which
means it's easier for you to move your
your applications around a native
plug-in is still needed but the nice
thing is that if it's not there then
it'll just revert to non dt type
behavior ok I'm going to show you a demo
of the the parameter passing
okay I have a simple simple application
here it just has a bunch of links in a
page and so if I I click on one of those
links starts a Java applet that shows a
stock quote and and don't go out and
Russian buy this because this is
historical data it's not life um so the
thing is that now we can pass parameters
so if i can i can pick another line
clicks Chevron and you'll notice that
this stock quote is updated and so
what's happening you've got a standalone
application you've got your web browser
and you're sending information from your
web browser and updating your
application you can even leave the page
entirely come back to it and continue
updating um so that's the end of that
sorry
too creepy
alright
so discuss a little how that was done so
the line of code there that's going to
be in your unclick handler or somewhere
and so if you imagine in that page there
was four or five of these lines and
basically what you're doing the unique
part here is that you're passing in name
value pair where the the key is company
and then in this case ork ork oh sounds
like something that of Lord of the Rings
but so you'd have your different ticker
stock ticker things for passing in and
so whatever one you click in you passing
on a parameter and then in the Java code
at least on the initial launch you you
just use get parameters get name and you
can read the initial one that comes in
and then so that's a new feature that
was in recent update we combine that
with an older feature called a single
instance where you just you can create a
single instance of a application and
when it gets asked to relaunch it just
it just stays with the one that it's in
and then you can pass parameters to and
it's fairly simple you just have to have
a listener and then register it and
respond to the to those events okay now
we're going to get into the the newer
stuff and new deployment i think this
parts is pretty exciting and gives a
whole new set of options for you the
idea is that is to another way of
simplifying delivering your app to your
user you have to have seven you six as
your or a later version to be able to
take advantage of this it's basically
there's a command-line tool called
javafx packager that you can use or a
set of ant tasks and a nice thing is
that if you download the latest NetBeans
it takes advantage of the aunt tess and
you can actually play with it pretty
quickly by downloading the java effect
samples and it's all pretty much set up
for you easy to build and create the
things that you'll see so basically
these tasks allow you to package in
different modes and mentioning NetBeans
again they set it up and so they'll
they'll create your your embedded
application they'll better and create a
linked web start and they can also
create these packages that we're going
to talk about so you have a nice way to
play around with it and get to
understand what the all the different
options are so what's the motivation for
this one motivation is that we have we
have other ways of delivering them but
they they all have their their
weaknesses one of the big weaknesses is
that you have to either have a JRE
installed or it has to be installed some
cases that's not possible because a user
may not have admin privileges to install
the a JRE it's also makes it a more
complicated user experience if they have
to deal with installing a JRE the other
one is the is compatibility so if you
you obviously develop your application
you have QA run tests you have your unit
tests you're doing that against probably
a very specific version of the JRE you
deliver your app and then your user gets
an updated JRE and there's a potential
there for an incompatibility that
affects your application and another big
one is just the fact that there's
changing requirements in the world and
new distribution channels and and the
mac app store is is one of the prime
drivers for that so this is kind of just
a pictorial view of what what a
self-contained application is it's
basically just a collection of all the
artifacts that you need for your to run
your application has your application
may be an icon
metadata launcher and the thing that's
unique is that it has a private copy of
the java runtime so that means that
you're not dependent on the external JRE
anymore and if you take that application
then using external tools and our ant
tasks that we supply you can now create
basically what feels like native
application so you can create on windows
exe es or MSI's if you've got the tools
on there dmg for app and the same you
can do for linux as well so I'm just
another little demo
so what this demo is is there's a javafx
application you can actually get it
online it's called Ensemble and it's a
it's an application that just
demonstrates about a hundred different
UI controls for JavaFX but the unique
thing here is that it's being packaged
by our tools to be an installable
package so I'm just going to click on it
see it's now just a normal install
experience that any Java you would
expect from any application on the mac
and of course if this was Wendell's it
would be a windows experience and the
way they do it so I'm just going to drag
the app into the app folder you can see
at the bottom it's being added into the
finder so now it's finished installing I
notice that it has its own unique icon
instead of the the Java cup so you can
create whatever icon you want for it can
launch it that's just the standard
warning dialog because it's not signed
that you got it from the internet and
there you go it's the java application
including javafx application that just
feels and looks as far as all the
install experience just like a normal
native application you can't tell that
it was started from Java and although
this isn't part of the talk this is
actually pretty if you're interested in
Java fex this is a pretty cool
application to try out it's got
different controls and you can
experiment with it you can just see what
they do one of the really nice things is
that you can click on the source code
and then you can immediately save that
to a NetBeans project and you can run
that immediately and play with it so
either for learning or maybe it's the
start of an application that you want to
do okay now go back to our talk
so some of the benefits I've I've
mentioned a little bit the big one is
that it just feels like a native
application and gives you that whole
native application experience for a user
which is something that we haven't
really had or at least you might have
been able to do it with a lot of work on
your own and now it becomes very simple
in fact if you if you experiment with
this in netbeans it's basically do a
build and a clean and build and you get
the result and that's that's about all
you have to do and then if you want to
customize it you just have to add some
custom parameters to it it's also a big
issue is that it's now uses a private jr
e so you don't you don't care what the
the JRE is on the platform and this is
actually especially important on on
Apple since there only is one JRE so but
now you can have your app with your new
JRE and you don't care about that it's
also really easy on a fresh system if
you don't have if there's no JRE
installed you've really simplified your
users experience because they just use
it just like a standard application and
that it is going to feel like just
normal to them they're not going to
realize that it's a java application
plus there's a way of making it you can
make the admin's permission so you can
install for a single user so if the
person doesn't have admin rights then
they can still install their application
and a big one is that it's it's in
preparation now for being able to put
something up on the mac app store it's
the first step at least of course it's
not perfect there's a you have to
download and run it so it's a bit
different experience if you've already
got users that use like a click and run
kind of experience with your application
it's definitely a larger install
because we've got the JRE in there and
we do our best to remove optional bits
and and bring down the size of that and
it's probably not too big an issue for
most users since most users have pretty
fast internet connections now and are
getting used to downloading stuff but
it's also a priority that we're going to
keep looking at ways of reducing that
footprint and you'll you'll see over
time that that will be reduced you do
have to it it varies i think it's a
about 40 meg yeah depends on what helmet
other stuff is being put in with it
another another issue is that you can't
just create a jar and deliver it
everywhere by itself now you have to
bundle it so if you're going to deliver
for Windows Mac and Linux you do have to
create a separate package for each so
you might want to create an msi dmg and
a de be4 for linux right the other
problem with that is that right now
you'd have to build those on that
platform so you because you're using the
tools that exist on that platform so if
you wanted to build on Windows and you
want to create an msi you'd have to get
the wix package and use that to build I
think on on if you're doing it on Apple
I don't think you have to I don't think
you need Xcode right you just yeah so
you can just sew on Windows I mean I'm
Mac it's nice and simple because you
don't actually have to have any load any
external tools it's the
yep
yeah at this point so the question is
them to do with automatic updates it's
now four for right now at least it's the
responsibility of the application
developer to to handle that whereas you
would get better support for that with
our web-based tools but it is that's one
of the things that's on our list to
address and see if we can find a
solution to that so how do you get
started well first you need seven you
six you can also get the developer
preview it has a few more features
already you optionally want to install
the the external tools that you're going
to need to build the executable or the
installable packages on the different
platforms the one way to know that it's
going to work if you can double click on
your jar and it runs then it's it's set
up so that it'll work in this
environment there's a build step you can
use the command line tool or the aunt
tess and suspect that most people would
use a tad aunt tess to their build build
process and then there's other optional
things like signing etc so this is a
sample of the the ant code that controls
the the creation what in on the first
line i'm not going to go too much in
detail about this but on the first line
you see there's native bundles equals
all and hopefully you can read that at
the back and if not the the slides will
be online and you'll be able to check us
out so that says that if if the tool is
available build it so say you're on
Windows and you've got wicks installed
but you don't have I no setup which
would create an exe it'll use the the
wicks create the msi
and then it'll ignore the other one
until you'll get your your one build a
little tip here is that if if you're
using netbeans and you're just doing
development you're not ready to package
it you're not testing your package you
probably want to make that none because
it takes time and it's going to just
lengthen your build.prop or development
cycle but then this also shows that you
can add your jars your resources you can
customize it so you can add jvm
parameters you can also set it to
install in a single user mode so that it
doesn't require admin permissions and of
course there's more options so the main
thing here is that it's currently with
seven you six it uses the JRE which has
to be seven you six or greater that too
that's the one that's going to get
bundled with our developer preview you
can now select the JRE of course you
only have two choices 27 you six or
seven to 10 but you know eventually that
will probably be useful and then this
just sort of describes what's happening
that your native launcher gets extracted
from one of our jars and then the icons
get injected into it and so you'll have
your icon and it will look like just
like a native application on whatever
platform you're on and then it just it
just runs and launches like a and just
appears like a normal application so
what's the future well there's I
mentioned there's a developer preview
the big thing about that one is that
it's got support for the Mac App Store
and I'm going to talk a bit more in
detail about that in a few minutes
mentioned it you can now select the
select the runtime of course there it us
to be 7 u 6 or higher then there's just
other tweaks and parameter passing that
you can do and future releases
we're looking at things like sighs
auto-update support that's the question
you had and so will continue and we'll
look we really appreciate feedback we've
got a blog we've got forums so if you
have you want to contact us and let us
know what use on your wish list and
we'll put it in our list and see where
it where it falls out and this is just
for you later on to decide you can use
to try to decide what you what
deployment option makes sense for you
are you going to just do you want an
executable jar there's some things
that's very simple about that web start
and I guess the really main difference
between the two on the left and then the
self-contained applications is the fact
that you're reliant on the JRE and
you're also reliant on the environment
so if as the is the mind type setup for
all these things to occur when you're
when you're doing with the basically the
web deployment and on the self-contained
application you lose the auto-update at
this point and you also have a heftier
package both you know download and
footprint although like I said we're
going to work hard on that and see what
we can do about that so that leads us
into the what you can do with the mac
app store so in our developer preview
that's wandering requirements the big
thing about the App Store is it doesn't
allow optionally installed technology
which is what the JRE is so you can't
just build an application and submit it
because they won't they won't approve it
because it relies on something external
to your package there's some other
things like you're not allowed to use
certain private api's has to run in a
sandbox and and they will Apple will run
that when you submit it I think there
might be a tool to check as well they'll
chest these things and you'll get
rejected if you don't meet all those
requirements
so the the big thing is that you're
going to be able to do now create this
this package and we actually have a real
example at the ensemble that I showed
you that's also going to be on the app
store I think it's been approved I'm not
sure exactly when it will appear but
you'll be able to download that for free
and try it out so how to go about doing
this I'm not going to get into very much
detail here there was a much more
detailed talk by one of our team members
earlier and if you didn't see it you
it'll be online and you can look at the
slides and he's also got links to more
relevant stuff and it talks about things
like what are the what are the rules you
have to do there's you I rules you have
to be reviewed by Apple you have to get
a developer ID there's certain things
you have to avoid for instance like the
J file chooser you can't use because it
doesn't understand how permissions work
in in app and that's an important issue
when you're developing for the App Store
so this is just kind of give you an idea
of what steps are involved basically you
go through our packaging tools to create
your app you don't have to create a
install a stall able package for this
just the dot app then you have to define
permissions and that means say you want
to access the internet or you want to
access a hard disk or something like
that then you have to set up your
permissions you have to code sign it
produce a build and then submit your
package and on that other talk I
mentioned there's a link that Scott
provided that points to a tool that
takes care of a whole bunch of this for
you so that it's almost like one step so
you don't really have to learn too much
he says it's really really easy and
simple to use I'd reckon
and checking that out is the first path
so the key thing that what we've
accomplished and what we're trying to do
is one of the big themes for us is this
feature Paradiso that we're really
making all our deployment features
available on all the platforms we're at
so they're being released at the same
time they're the same version you get
like javafx is there's a lot of effort
going into javafx it's a really nice
rich you I it works really well with
HTML it's it has CSS base it's a it's a
good fit for if you have to mix web and
application the new deployment options I
think are really add a nice component to
your your what you can deliver now and
create something that looks really nice
like a native app just as far as the
deprecated features probably most of you
don't care ones that do just be aware of
it and and try to make sure that you can
follow whatever recommended alternatives
and we'll we'll be blogging about all
this stuff and we'll we have some
actually really good online
documentation for deployment yours done
a number of blogs about the
self-contained package and so you should
check those out here's some links to two
just some of our our our blog or the
packaging guide deployment docks and
also just where you can get preview
releases of jdk 7 and jdk and try some
of the stuff up and that's it so we'll
answer some questions
yeah so the question was do we we have
the notion of a shade shared jari when
we bundle in at this point we don't
there is an option with the deploy to
not include a JRE but that's certainly a
good idea something we should look at
that makes sense swing so the question
is when or if swing is being deprecated
I'm I've heard nothing about that here
so what's clearly not part of his talk
and I don't think swing is deprecated
because Fingaz part of a Java
specification and you it has to go for
gcp process right so it's it's doing the
part of Java it just not evolving very
quickly at this point we investing more
resources into the javafx toolkit but
swing this still part of a java and
we'll stay there until gcp approved
application or something like well no
time soon anyways just that
no not yet
so so first of all what java facts
jfilechooser limitation is kind of
temporarily we're trying to make sure
what we doing the job lot from kind of
work in the sandbox right now it's known
that jfilechooser does not what follow
or when are varieties to other file
chooser implementations like there is a
java fax file chooser so if you're using
Java stack you can use that and you
can use a dbt file chooser which is like
through the Native youth it doesn't you
think so but I options and just to add
to what maven plugin as it was announced
earlier all this stuff javax package
will be open sourced we welcome
contributions so if you want to
contribute my own plugin we will be
happily considering that
wow I'm actually not quite familiar with
icloud sources if it is a java api to
where you can use this in your program
or you can because it's a well it's a
job application which doesn't necessary
need to be in java only you can have a
jhene aiko or any native code code
bundled with your application so you can
well I'm sure somebody already have Java
bindings to native API sofurry is no
java api any other question
I think that yes absolutely
okay well thanks very much for coming
I'll put this in Jogja will be out a
good week at javaone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
