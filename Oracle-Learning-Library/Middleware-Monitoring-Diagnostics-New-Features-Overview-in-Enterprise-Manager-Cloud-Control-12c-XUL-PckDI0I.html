the st curriculum group here at Oracle
here I'm going to give you a high-level
overview of some of the new features in
enterprise manager cloud controlled 12c
that Li you manage your middleware stack
I'll be focusing in on some of the new
monitoring and diagnostic features that
help you keep your oracle fusion
middleware and weblogic deployments up
and performing as expected so let's get
started first we'll look at some of the
new features that let you monitor the
health of your Oracle Fusion Middleware
in enterprise manager cloud control 12c
we've expanded the capabilities to look
at the routing details more deeply you
can now view performance metrics right
in the routing topology without
switching to a different view if we go
to annotations and metrics let's display
names and values now you see the metrics
relating to the weblogic servers and if
you mouse over a target you can drill
down to see more details let's close
this also if we right-click a target we
get a menu where we can go directly to
the monitoring pages let's go to the
performance summary page and look at
another feature you may be familiar with
the performance summary page from 11g
Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
expands the performance monitoring
capabilities now you can create a
baseline of this performance summary
data simply by going to this overlay
menu and clicking create baseline then
you can use these baselines as
benchmarks to compare against other
times for example let's select this load
test baseline that I created previously
to compare it against
run performance now you see here the
load test baseline and red and the
current performance and blue so you can
see that these new bass lines are very
useful for performance comparisons I
think you would agree that a crucial
middleware skill is being able to
diagnose problems you need to be able to
isolate the problem and resolve it as
quickly as possible but doing so can be
very difficult because of the complexity
of the middleware infrastructure itself
in enterprise manager cloud control 12c
there has been a great improvement in
middleware diagnostics which will help
you quickly find the cause of a problem
and even suggest ways to resolve it
whether the problem is in the
application the weblogic server or even
in the database so let's now look at
some of these new diagnostic features
here we're on a JVM live thread analysis
page if we scroll down in this JVM
threads table we can see that some of
these threads are in a database wait
state when we select a thread we can see
a lot of details on the street below to
find out more database information we
can now click this database wait state
link and we take into the database
diagnostics page where we can see a lot
of details on the database in enterprise
manager Cloud Control 12c you get this
direct contextual navigation from JVM
Diagnostics to the database diagnostics
and vice versa being able to trace from
JVM threads to database sessions and
back the other way hopes you resolve
problems faster here were on a JVM
performance Diagnostics page problems
often arise suddenly and need to be
remedied immediately with no time to
capture the details for later analysis
you can immediately capture all of these
events as they occur
into a single package diagnostic
snapshot for later analysis by clicking
on this create diagnostic snapshot
button let's look at one that's already
created here you can see a summary of
the jvm diagnostics information and you
can also see the Oracle Diagnostics
logging information in to view more
details we can click on this more
details link so this is a great tool to
let you capture problem details as they
occur without impacting your system and
diagnose them later let's look at
another new diagnostic feature which is
the new middleware diagnostics advisor
this looks at all the performance
metrics and configuration information to
generate diagnostic findings like this
one and here you see all the finding
details and you'll notice that there's a
recommendation so instead of just
providing raw metrics and configuration
details it helps you to resolve problems
and improve performance in the middle
we're tier by giving actual advice now
let's look at one last new feature that
allows you to monitor your concert
applications and diagnose any problems
that occur in that application in
complex data center environments
administrators need a single view of top
level metrics in information related to
critical business services and
applications Enterprise Manager cloud
control 12c has a brand new feature that
provides us capability it's essentially
a way for you to create your own
dashboards for your custom applications
here's a composite application dashboard
that I've already created you use a
creation wizard to group together your
application solar infrastructure and
server targets into a system on which
you can then perform integrated incident
correlation and diagnostics performance
monitoring and so on
this gives you a broad view across your
entire composite application each
logical application environment in your
enterprise can have its own composite
application dashboard and these
dashboards are fully customizable you
can personalize the region's the metrics
and so on and each cloud control user
can have their own customized dashboard
there are many other new features an
enterprise manager 12c that help you
monitor performance and diagnose
problems in your middleware tier here
I've just touched on a few to find out
more information visit the Oracle
technology Network for product
information Oracle University for
training and the Oracle Learning Library
for more training and product
demonstrations so that's it thanks for
watching this new features overview of
Enterprise Manager cloud control 12 seed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
