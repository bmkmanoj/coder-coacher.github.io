feature overview and demonstration you
already have on-premise integration but
you now have additional complexity
integrating cloud mobile and Internet of
Things resulting in slower time to
market for new bigger business
initiatives and leaving you lagging
behind your competitors let's look at
how Oracle so a suite 12c can simplify
this integration and make your company
an innovative leader capable of
simplifying integration despite the
growth of mobile cloud and Internet of
Things
one of the main differentiators of
Oracle so a suite that you will see in
this demonstration is the unified
interface across all of the major
components of integration as we look
past the on-premise only integration of
yesterday the first new requirement is
how to handle the escalating demand for
cloud integration of SAS applications
Oracle so a suite 12c offers adapter
integration to create a seamless
workflow between Sohus wheat and other
products for example see how easy it is
to implement the salesforce.com adapter
into a be pill process we simply drag
and drop the adapter into a swim lane we
can set up the adapter using our
configuration tool once the adapter is
configured we can work with it through
Oracle e-business suite and we can
further monitor the adapters use in
addition to cloud integration
requirements you have what could be even
more urgent requirements to mobile
enable your business applications here's
an example of how easy it is if we want
to rest enable a service perhaps we have
a mobile device that we want to make a
call to validate a payment in Oracle so
a suite 12c we can enable these back-end
services that are tied to our business
applications using REST API s and JSON
standards to build mobile apps in this
demo to buy
to arrest service we right-click
pipeline select rest and get rest
binding wizard interface we continue
through the wizard to create a rest
service here we have operation bindings
and the operation we have is validate we
have the standard HTTP verbs such as get
put post and delete now let's look at
the Internet of Things as yet another
integration channel that many companies
are seriously looking at you can connect
to Internet of Things using Oracle event
processing you have an explosion of data
growth that you handle with Oracle event
processing and coherence the processing
could be filtering correlation and
pattern matching if a trend is detected
it will be sent to Oracle so a suite to
process the trend could be an alert from
a heart monitor a detection of an
aircraft engine failure an e-commerce
error that needs to be corrected or a
proactive price update developer
productivity is enhanced with our
features install so a suite 12c using
the QuickStart installer the QuickStart
installation gets you up and running in
short time and you can choose the
features that you want to install reuse
use templates that are provided in the
suite or even create your own templates
it's easy to start new projects using
our pre-built templates and you decrease
your development time debug and test the
integrated debugger improves quality and
security you can set and toggle
breakpoints and do simple testing are
you tired of not being able to organize
manage and secure your file transfers
managed file transfer is a companion to
so a suite and it lets you design
monitor and administer file transfers it
helps you streamline file transfer by
using integrated FTP SSH and other
protocols for relocating your data so
you have just seen a quick snapshot of
how Oracle so a suite 12c simplifies
your cloud integration facilitates
mobile enablement connect to the
Internet of Things and presents a
unified UI that improves developer
productivity
