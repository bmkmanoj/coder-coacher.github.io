of the new exciting new features that we
have in the JD Edwards Enterprise 19.1
tools release what you're looking at
here is a 9.0 applications release
running on top of Enterprise one tools
9.1 the first thing you'll notice with
this new release is that the left-hand
navigation its components that we had in
previous releases have now been moved to
drop-down menus so any menus that you
had in previous systems of enterprise 1
are now available through a nice and
quick and simple drop down components
open applications are also available
here so I can toggle through those
applications that I have previously
opened within this session another
exciting feature that is brand new what
this releases the idea of recent reports
this is a list of the last 20 or so
reports that I have launched gives me a
visual indicator and whether it
completed successfully with a green
checkmark whether it had an error with a
red X or whether it's still in queue our
processing with a little stopwatch other
thing this provides as quick and easy
access through a single click to report
output so if I click on one line per
address it make your request off to the
server to bring down the PDF information
Firefox says hey do you want to do this
I'll say yes please and then when I hit
ok it will bring down that PDF
information and load that too directly
into the local PDF browser other area
that we've added into the drop-down is
quicker and easier access to your
favorites so you can now manage
favorites whether you want to rename
reorder or reorganize your favorites you
have a list of the favorites that you've
put into this system this is done
typically by a right-click on the
navigation menus that we saw earlier I
can have an entire menu that I favorite
it so if I do a our daily processing
every day I can have that as a favorite
or I can reorder and organize some of my
favorites into subfolders so here's some
things that I do on my daily processes
next thing I'll show you is a new
paradigm that we have within Enterprise
one for graphical navigation what we're
calling Enterprise 1 pages you can see
this user has a number of pages
associated with him so he has an order
to cache process where we have a new
business process flow here that's
graphically representing how that
business process of go so if I want to
go ahead and click on sales order within
that business process it
we'll launch an enterprise one
application we can also have those sub
flows be able to launch reports so some
examples of some of the pages that we're
providing through the enterprise one
release project execution
you saw the order to cache previously
financial planning and you'll see a
number of these probably seven to ten of
those that will be available with the
initial Enterprise one release
now don't not only can we provide these
graphical pages we can also embed
external web applications within these
pages so here's an example of an Oracle
business intelligence page that has been
embedded directly into enterprise one
showing AR information these are fully
functional as if you had launched the
enterprise of the business intelligence
via a web browser so you can drill into
and take a look at more information
where necessary other thing you can do
is just embed any generic web page so
here's a URL that we've embedded in here
to go to Oracle comm it shows you the
oracle.com page you can go ahead and
click on there if I want to take a look
at JD Edwards Enterprise one it'll go
ahead and launch that page okay last
thing I'll show you within this system
is the idea of a carousel this is a new
graphical widget that we put see down
here on the bottom of the page it
provides us with the ability to see open
applications the recent reports and the
favorites it provides a nice graphical
look at different applications I have
open so for open applications I can go
ahead and click on those it'll change
the color of the icon and open up that
instance of the application as we saw
earlier with the recent reports I can
take a look at the reports I've run and
have a single click access to launch the
report output or get additional
information through the bubbles and then
also my favorites so you can see the
favorites I had on the system before I
can go ahead and launch those easily
from here and also easily rearrange
those in the the carousel container now
not only is a carousel available and the
bottom of the page it is dockable as a
user likes to see it's on the bottom top
left or right of the screen so you can
see here a graphical representation of
that carousel so here's the open
applications I want to move those around
I can just hold it and move recent
reports or favorites
concludes the review thank you for the
time today and hope you enjoy this
release</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
