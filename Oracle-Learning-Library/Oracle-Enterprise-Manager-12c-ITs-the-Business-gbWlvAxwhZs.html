the application performance management
features of Enterprise Manager allow you
to understand transactions end-to-end
including user experience business
transaction management and JVM and
database Diagnostics please take a
moment to view our disclaimer
we begin on the business application
dashboard which is a single pane of
glass to see both the business health
and the system health of the application
we can see key performance indicators
from our real user experience in site
monitoring product we can see service
levels and we can see system views by
infrastructure status in students or
topology let's begin with looking at
what our real users are doing this is
our real user experience inside view of
the same monitored application we can
see here that a user Len has experienced
unsatisfactory performance we can also
see that our order processing page is
taking a long time let's inspect the
data in more detail it appears that Len
is the only user having problems let's
look at the session Diagnostics here we
see all of the sessions that this user
executed during a certain time frame
let's examine one of them here we can
see lens session activity we see the
order processing page is very slow at 21
seconds let's diagnose what's going on
this is the Oracle business transaction
management product the page shows a
topology of the transaction instance
that was invoked when the user clicked
on the order application JSP page we saw
earlier this is the exact same instance
that was recorded live in real time
let's look at the aggregate transactions
to see if this problem is generic this
is an aggregate view of all of the
similar transactions that took place in
the last hour we can see a delay
analysis chart here let's understand the
delay we can see there's significant
time spent on the second note in the
transaction shown here in brown as well
as on the third note shown here in blue
let's zoom in and understand what's
going on here we can see the flow our
users started with the JSP page that
invoked a submit order service which in
turn invoked to create new order service
which in turn vocht a submit order
service we can see here that the submit
order service took 16 seconds to respond
to the new order service whereas
underlying services took less than 1
millisecond so our culprit is a submit
order service let's understand what's
going on
let's look at jb m performance
diagnostics here we can see the thread
states over the last hour we can see
that most threads are in the DB wait
state since this problem is still
happening right now let's look at the
live threat analysis here we can see all
the threats that are currently active
and we can see 5 in the DB wait state we
see one thread waiting for 14 seconds
another one waiting for 24 seconds into
DB wait state so clearly we're spending
time inside our database let's
understand what's going on i'll log into
our database and now we can see all the
details about the execution of the
sequel from here we could continue to
use our database diagnostics and tuning
capabilities to analyze what is wrong
with this sequel or the database
instance in general in this
demonstration we showed you how oracle
enterprise managers application
performance management capabilities
allow you to understand transactions
end-to-end including user experience and
across infrastructure thank you for
watching this demonstration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
