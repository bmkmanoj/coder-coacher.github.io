quickly create a collection of cloud
resources with Oracle cloud stack
manager most business applications are
provisioned on Oracle cloud using a
combination of different cloud resources
like databases app servers caches and so
on
these resources have dependencies
between them and so also need to be
created in a certain order but even
after you have one development
environment ready to go what about other
developers or testing or production
environments these cloud resources their
associations and their dependencies are
captured as templates using a template
you can quickly create and manage these
resources as a single unit called a
cloud stack you can also specify
different input parameters to the
template and customize each stack
specific configuration here are some of
the Oracle cloud services that you can
create as resources within a stack refer
to the documentation for a complete list
of supported services in this
demonstration I'll create a stack that
contains a Java cloud service and its
associated database cloud service
I begin by logging into Oracle cloud
using my identity domain as well as the
name and password of a user in this
identity domain
then I access the console of any of the
platform cloud services that I'm
entitled to use for example Oracle Java
cloud service then using the cloud main
menu I navigate to the cloud stack
manager console
I launched the stack creation wizard
after giving my new stack a name and
description I can pick one of the
standard Oracle templates or a custom
template I've created the remaining
template parameters are specific to the
template I chose at a minimum I need to
provide values for the required
parameters for example in order to
administer the VMs that make up the
cloud resources in my stack I may need
to configure SSH keys to save me time
I'll let Oracle cloud generate the key
files which I'll download to my local
machine
this stack template also creates a cloud
storage container for automatic backups
of my database and Java service
instances
after a few final customizations my
stack is ready for provisioning
refresh the page periodically until the
stack is ready and all of its resources
were created successfully
you
click the new stack to view it's details
if I want to further monitor or
configure one of its resources like my
java service instance I simply select it
and I'm directed to that resources
console interface
after a quick check that my sample of
java application server is running i
returned to my stack in the stack
manager console
thanks for watching this video a
companion tutorial is also available
that documents all the steps I just
presented
welcome to the cloud</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
