an info dev Oracle communications
billing and revenue management
demonstration by Stacy Thurston
demonstration objectives create a new
product offering using pricing design
center make the new offering available
for subscription view the offering using
the billing and revenue management
customer center client this diagram
shows an end to end product subscription
scenario starts with the pricing analyst
creating product pricing data in PDC
pricing design center of web application
when complete the nude pricing data is
transferred to the BRM server step 3 the
customer service representative enters
the subscribers information into the BRM
customer center client the subscriber is
subscribed to the new product step 4 the
subscriber uses the service causing a
service event record to be generated for
example the subscriber downloads a file
from the service providers network the
service usage event is rated using data
from PDC and subscriber data from BRM
server the charge result is recorded by
the VM server as a rated event PRM
server updates the customers balance
step 5
PRM compiles the rated event balance
impacts into a bill when the payment is
received the customers accounts balance
is updated here's a description of the
demo product offering the service
provider offers access to the video
content to subscribers
there are subscription charges an
activation fee of $9.99 and a download
fee of $1 and $0.99 per video
it is the pricing analysts job to create
the offering create pricing data using
PDC this diagram shows the pricing data
component hierarchy for the
demonstration you can see that the
pricing charge offer in the bottom right
the activate
in charge in the usage charge beside
that we see in the lower level gonna
start at the bottom we were we see the
charges content subscription activation
fee and the content usage video
downloads those charges will be in the
charge offer called content charge
offers that's gonna be the first thing
created would be the charge offer with
these two charges the charge offer will
then be bundled and the bundles going to
be called the content bundle and then
that bundle will be added to a package a
new package which the package will be
called the content package then that
package will be added to a list which is
called default that default list is the
list of product offerings these are the
demonstration steps in creating a new
product offering first step being create
a charge offer to bundle the charge
offer three package to the bundle four
add the package to the transfer to BRM
server list that's the list of product
offerings
step 5 transfer the new pricing data
from PDC to BRM server based on that
list step 6
view the new product in BRM customer
center so that we do know it's been
created transferred and viewable you can
then create subscribers who can purchase
the new product offering so next I'm
going to enter the charge offer a charge
offer consists of one or more service
event charges here's two examples a
service the wireless voice so we have a
charge offer for that service which is
called wireless voice charge offer and
there are three charges one charge is an
activation fee another charge is monthly
reoccurring which includes 350 minutes
for free and then there's another charge
which is for each minute used after the
350 minutes the user the subscriber will
be charged 50 cents per minute the other
example is I'm going to demo and charge
offers going to be called content charge
offer there's going to be the activation
fee and the unit usage which is the
video download fee
all right here's my browser and the URL
is the host name and the PDC we have
application link so here we go it's
gonna log in using PDC all right so I'm
logged in and this is my pricing design
center where on the Left we can see
create charge offer
there's also create bundle package and
package lists which I'll do later so
let's just start here with charge offer
but you can see a new tab comes up I'm
gonna enter the charge offer and we can
see in the on the right where it has the
demo it's called Kent Content charge
offer so type in your content charge
offer which is a subscription and we'll
just give it a description here let's do
the same for video all right it's
applicable to we're gonna use the
service type of content now what it can
do is add charges so I'm going to add
one and this will be a one-time which is
our activation fee so we're going to
choose this it's a purchase fee one-time
and we'll give it a name of activation
why not okay
it's in u.s. dollars for this example
just click OK and we can see a tab here
for our purchase fee and in this area
here we can see it's a debt and the debt
is of the amount $9.99 u.s. we're gonna
leave the rest the same that's good now
gonna add another charge this is gonna
be the usage fee charge type is filled
in and now we're just gonna give it a
name which is content so d the content
video download
okay here's our second tab for the
activity being this one's gonna be $1.99
gonna be for is per unit so we're gonna
leave it at that and the amount used
we're not using it by megabytes or time
okay so that stays the same and we're
going to finish that's finished so we
have to save so we have a Content charge
offer our purchase fee which is the
$9.99 and we have our usage which is
$1.99 $1.99 for the amount call that
finished
that's our content offer charge offer if
we go here to workspace we could change
that so this is something that's been
changed but has not yet been hasn't been
set to be RM and EC so here it is okay
next step is to bundle the charge offer
so bundles are associated to a service
bundles contained charge offers &amp;amp;
discount offers two examples here were
staying with one is the wireless voice
so we have the wireless voice 350 bundle
and in that bundle we have the charge
offers which include the activation fee
usage price per minute and also here
added as discount offer which is the
discount for the free three hundred and
fifty minutes which are included with
the monthly reoccurring cost the other
being the demo that we're working on and
we're going to bundle the the content
charge offer into a content bundle now
we're going to create the demo content
bundle and that's going to include the
content charge offer with the browser in
the same spot this time we're going to
click create a bundle
yeah we gotta give it a name just
content bundle switch am just called the
same content bundle for videos and this
is for content next we want to add
charge offer this case we're looking at
our content charge offer so we're gonna
do a search for that you can see our
content charge offer right here that's
fine you can see it here and it's all
there is to create the bundle if we go
to our workspace we'll see we have the
content charge offer and content bundle
we have a charge offer which was bundled
now we're gonna look at his packaging
the bundle a package contains a set of
bundles one or more and the examples
here this is the wireless family
three-fitty package contains wireless
voice so we have voice SMS and data
which are the three smart phone services
the forth listed here being wireless
data shared megabytes bundle that is the
share across the family hence the name
Wireless family package going back with
the demo so the demo as is we're going
to be creating the content package which
is packaging the content bundle so here
is the browser and where we left off and
this time we're gonna create the content
package so we'll click from the Left
menu here create package then above here
we can see our workspace tab our content
charge offer our content bundle and now
we're gonna create a package and we're
just gonna call it content package
description content package for videos
next we can add a service and our
service that we're working on is content
so here's our content service and now
we're gonna add a bundle to that service
so we're gonna search our bundles and we
have our content bundle here content
service or a bundle and underneath that
we'll see our content charge offer so
we'll call that finished B workspace tab
and we'll see now we have the charge
offer of the bundle and the package the
product has been packaged so we're going
to add the package to the default
package list the default package list of
products will be made available for
subscription the default package list
pricing data is transferred from PDC to
the BRM server and the example default
package list here shows three packages
one being the Wireless family 350 the
Wireless family 500 package and the demo
that we're doing here at the content
package in the browser we can see our
order here they the content charge offer
bundle and package and what I'm gonna do
is close some of these tabs for our next
part content package do a search
we see our default package list it's
going to click that another tab comes up
and here's the default package list and
we can see there's a number of packages
already in here for for demonstration
and we can even see the wireless family
350 package what we want to do is we
want to do an edit of this default
package and we go to add another one do
a search for any package and there's our
content package ok there now it's been
added into the default package list I'm
going to save and done and if we go back
to our workspace you'll see we have
charge offer bundle package and the
default package list which contains now
the content package product offering
pricing data has been created that's
step one in the diagram now we're going
to do is transfer it from PDC to the BRM
server so here we're in the workspace
tab and we can see our change set list
here we have to successfully submitted
ones so what we're going to do now is do
a third submit so I'm going to click
here I'm first I'm going to click
validate and in the validate you can see
that there are validations successful no
errors found and that means that quick
check was done with the data compared to
getting it to the other services
services getting it to BRM server so I'm
going to click Submit submit chainset
you are submitting it yes good change
that has been submitted asking for ok
and down below here now you'll see one
pending so ok yes so we've had three
successfully submitted change sets and
the chainset detail list is now emptied
the pricing information has been
transferred to
the BRM server from PDC and we can now
log out now that the data has been
transferred to the BRM server we're
going to view the new package in the BRM
customer center client this part of the
demo we don't need in the browser what
we need is the customer center then this
in the diagram we can see the account
manager uses it to view we want to view
the pricing data that came from PDC so
we're gonna do is log in route zero zero
zero one password see the connection
info which is our host where the DRM
server and we're logged in and to view
the plan we're gonna do a new customer
that's the option we're going to choose
now we can go straight to plan and we
can see there it is our content package
at our content package for videos that's
the description we can see that that's
the bundle and there it is content
options you can see our charge content
charge offer for videos so we now have
confirmed that we've created the pricing
data and it has been transferred to be
RM server if the pricing data has been
transferred from PDC to be RM server the
charge offer bundle and package we're
gonna do is look at the mapping of the
data from PDC to your own customer
center this shows the mapping from PDC
to customer center we can see that the
package name shows up in the plan list
and the package description shows up in
the plan description PDC bundled Nicko's
into the deal the bundle name also goes
into plan options deal value as well PDC
charge offer name shows up in the
product field the charge offer
description shows up in the
description customer center this is a
summary slide showing all of the
mappings from PDC package to BRM
customer center plan the bundle to the
deal and the charge offer to the product
PRM customer center in summary creating
a new product offering required the
following six steps create a charge
offer second bundle the charge offer
third step packaged the bundle fourth
step add the package to the transfer to
be RM server list step five was transfer
the new pricing data from PDC to the BRM
server step six was viewing the new
product offering pricing data in the RM
server using the BRM customer center
client and that concludes that that
completes the creating a new product
offering video I didn't phone dev
