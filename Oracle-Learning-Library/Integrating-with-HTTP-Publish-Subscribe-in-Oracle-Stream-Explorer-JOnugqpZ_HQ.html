use the HTTP publish and subscribe
stream features of the Oracle stream
Explorer first of all we authenticate
and login to the Oracle stream Explorer
next we will use our transportation and
logistics catalog section to define an
application and artifacts for vehicle
monitoring first of all we will create a
transportation stream that will use HTTP
publish and subscribe first of all we'll
give the stream a name transport under
school stream a useful description of
this stream associated tags
transportation to make sure that this
artifact retains within the
transportation section of our catalog
and we define a source type of HTTP
subscriber next and we define the server
URL for a HTTP publish and subscribe
server we define the channel which will
we use for this application and the user
ID and password needed to access this
server we press next and now we define
the shape of the event which will come
from a HTTP subscriber once we have
defined the shape we save this or create
this dream now we have created our HTTP
publish and subscribe stream let's
create an exploration to analyze the
data from that stream
will create a new exploration provided
with a useful name we provide a
description useful tanks and the source
that will be used for this exploration
in this case it is the transport stream
we create and now we can see the
exploration canvas ready to accept the
HTTP pub/sub messages to test this
application we will go to the O club in
processing visualizer we log in and when
we use the visualizer to dynamically
create the hcv publish and subscribe
messages that will be input to our
exploration we do the view stream we
initialize the client and we publish to
the channel that we've used within the
application we will specify the HTTP
publish and subscribe message and
publish it if we take a look at our
expiration now you can see the
information provided in our exploration
we can add a filter on our exploration
in this case looking for any event
messages that indicate a vehicle
distance that is greater or equal to 5
we go back to our visualizer change the
message details and publish now we can
see on our expiration that we're
filtering out messages where the
distance is greater or equal to 5
now we have created a exploration we can
now publish expiration for use by other
business users who wish to use this as
an input stream into their own
applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
