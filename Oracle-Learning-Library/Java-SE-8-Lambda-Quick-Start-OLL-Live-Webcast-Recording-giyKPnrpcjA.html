QuickStart is presented by Mike Williams
mike is a course developer in the server
technologies curriculum development
group at Oracle at this time I would
like to turn it over to Mike thank you
here's some of the prerequisites we have
but basically you've done a little bit
of java programming probably you know
definitely a requirement for this to
understand java this a little different
from our normal job of stuff and it's
new and interesting but very cool and
today we'll be using java jdk 8 or
actually using build 111 that actually
changed I made this slide but that's all
downloadable and I'll show you that in a
minute and then we're also using
NetBeans 74 which is nice because it
supports Java 8 so if that's all the
Java 8 features that supported in 7.4
that came out yesterday actually where
you can download that and i will show
you that as well really on here in the
presentation so here's an overview of
what we're going to talk about today
first module or housekeeping i'm going
to talk about that getting your tools
and troubleshooting any issues you may
have basically how to set up NetBeans to
run two different JVMs and then then
we'll get into lambda expression that's
the main focus of our talk we're going
to talk about and where it comes from
and what it's for and then we're going
to talk about the syntax and then after
we do that then we'll go into a bunch of
examples we'll start out some basic
examples that are pretty much you know
like a one-for-one sort of thing and
then we'll go into like the more
detailed examples of application well
we'll talk about the robocall
application and we'll also talk about
applying a function interface using
lambdas and then finally we'll have a
longer sexual bitlocker section where on
using lambda with collections there's a
lot of changes to the collection API and
take advantage of the new lambda
expressions
so let's move forward here so first a
little housekeeping um I'm going to talk
about where to get this stuff so that
you can do the same things I'm doing
after after the park and then some
issues you might face downloading some
of the source code I put up your a few
months ago so let me share my desktop
there we go that is my in fact my
desktop that is always good okay so
first you probably want to get java 8
and you can find it listed here um which
is basically jdk 8 java net and then i'm
on the download page and you'll see the
current bill is listed right at the top
of the page just scroll down a little
bit you have to accept the license
agreement there's I've already done that
but it's feared but you will also see
you know we've got all the various
platforms there's two columns here if
you want to jdk make sure you get the
right column that something I awesome
often mess up i forget get the GRE and
then I can't compile anything so anyway
just be aware of that and then we're
also using NetBeans 74 that can be found
at the net means that or you can see 74
is the current version like this is that
came out yesterday and the main reason
you want that is because it has support
for java 8 and that's what we need for
this class all right now the other thing
i wanted a couple other things I want to
mention if you want to set up more than
one jdk on your system for to use with
netting I'm you do that by going to I've
got NetBeans up your enough veteran
project that but basically you just go
to tools and you'll see Java platforms
here you'll see here I've got two
platforms JDK 17 and 18 and I added 18
simply by thinking that if you see down
here there's a button add platform I'm
going to click that
and then I'm going to go up a little bit
here so you just go to your C Drive
navigate to where the JDK is loaded and
then here's 18 that's basically the root
directory of all the java stuff you get
a next button when it recognized and
paid actor that's a jdk there you click
next and then you basically would I've
already got cd18 in there so thus i get
an error message if you hadn't installed
it before you yet you have the option to
click finish to install it so basically
that's how you set up multiple jvh cbms
honor versions of Java in netbeans and
then the other thing I wanted to point
out is the projects i created we're all
done with cuts them what basically with
lambda only builds of the JDK very early
on in the development process so if you
open up if you download one of the
projects i'm going to build your file
and I'm going to open a project and I
have one here called broken and so if
you download any of the projects from
the website when you open it up you'll
get an error message like this and you
say resolve problems going to basically
in our memorizes showing you the Java
platforms it's going to say oh this
platform is not on your system and of
course not because it's a newer version
so it's certainly not named that so you
can't really resolve it here essentially
what you do is you just close out of
that you go to the project you right
click it you choose the properties then
you click on libraries and then the
library for the project here you can
select which platform java platform you
want to select one date and then that
should clear out any error messages you
get you might have to open and close the
project after you've made that change
but that should solve the problem so
that's a little housekeeping I wanted to
go over and we'll get belt will jump
back to this here in a minute so I'm
going to go back to the presentation
here
and that was a demo we just did okay so
a little background on lambda expression
and then we'll go into some more
examples so and once again i'm probably
going to save based on the timing i did
a firm might run throughs yesterday i'm
going to save questions for the very end
just to make sure i get through all the
materials so we're going to talk about
anonymous inner classes functional
interface luma lambeth effect itself so
let's do that so anonymous inner classes
are something you typically with zan
like a GUI application it's basically
for for a class that would appear only
once in an application and so you'll see
something like this so that the code
actually appears worth you so for
example I have a button here and then
I'm setting up this is a swing
application I'm setting up a button and
then i'm going to set up you know
basically when you click on the button
what to do and i set that up here and
i'm doing a new actionlistener there and
notice that i'm basically setting up a
class and there where i'm implementing
the one method so it's easier to read
here like this but it's not very elegant
and one of the problems is that it takes
quite a bit of code to put in just this
one method and so what this is one of
the features / say that lambics dressing
is trying to prove upon this to make
that a little better now this particular
case we're using an action listener and
here i have an action listener the code
source code for that picture here and
you can see it's an interface with a
single abstract method so notice the
signature there we just have the action
performed is the only method and that
they can actually went to parameter for
the purposes of lambda where this is a
common pattern throughout Java and we're
calling this a functional interface so
interface with want abstract
method and this is kind of what the
lambda expressions are built upon and
you'll see more we'll see more of this
there's some built-in functional
interface that you can use with lambdas
and we'll see a lot of examples of that
but this is a great example of one right
here that's already an existing code so
how does a lambda expression syntax work
and how does it relate back to that so
basically we address this vertical
problem by creating expressions that are
built like this we have on the Left I'm
you have an argument list then we have a
token and then we have a body and you
think of an argument list as if we go
back one my method there is going to
have some sort of argument list
typically that's going to match right
whatever that is so I've got some sort
of functional interface that's going to
match that argument list and then I'm
going to have some sort of body now that
can be an expression so here for example
we have two in so I'm going to be
returned as this expression will return
and in then I have just here I have no
so this one has two arguments this one
has no arguments but I'm going to return
and not let in if you're 42 and then
finally this third example here I have a
string argument and then I'm not
returning anything i'm just going to
print out some stuff so we'll i'll go
through some examples here that that of
some functional interface that already
exists in the language and show how they
can be replaced with lambda expressions
but that's the basic so argument arrow
token body that's basically it and we
either have an expression or we have a
block of code on the right side of our
arrow too so that's the basic setup of
what the expressions look like so let's
let's look at some actual examples so
I'm going to jump back to my desktop
again
and so I'm going to go
this project the first project you'll
find an open E and if i go to my main
message you see here i'm falling three
different quest glasses and so i'm going
to go ahead and load those up do the
listener comparator and then to runnable
so let's look at the listener and that's
just what I talked about that's where I
got the code from and back here is
though this is a swing app and I'm
setting up a accident of a listener for
when we click on that button so you can
see here quite a bit of code a little
not quite that elegant so how would I do
that as a lambda X walsall so I would do
let's see here I'm going to pull this up
your bed a little cheat sheet i'm going
to use for the web
alright so i would do something like
this we do hit the button
and add an action listener just like
they did before
and then then this is where things get
different so once i get in the
parentheses drink i'm going to go ahead
and put the semicolon there we're going
to add a lambda expression so i'm going
to do an e for events going to put in my
token and then i think i'm just going to
print something out like I did there I'm
going to put in my brackets like that
and then I'm going to let's just print
out a message so that's just a little i
just have to ask out there and hit tab
that's just a little netbeans trick i
can use to save me from having to type
that so i'm going to click detected by
lambda listener okay so if i say that so
now i just added another listener notice
we have our syntax you have a parameter
list as we stop before action perform
takes one so i'm going to help me
highlight that line X form takes one
parameter so I have one here and
basically I've got my block and
highlight that line like so and I'm not
really Richard I'm not returning
anything so let's go ahead and run that
and we're compiling and adhere probably
can hardly see it see if I can grab it
it's hard to grip I know this is a
little hard to grab last night
alright let's see if I can get to edge
well anyway I'm just going to go ahead
and click the button and you can see
here I get two messages in my output
down below here every time I click that
because it added to actual first one the
normal way and then one week a new lamp
expression that's pretty cool there's
another class that has the same pattern
as the runnable class so I'm pulling
that test up here we're just printing so
what I've done here is just a simple
program where I'm setting up runnable
switch half just once again same pattern
one abstract method run right for that
interface and so i'm going to set up the
second one here with using a lambda
expression so i have a runnable are one
up here some runnable are two and then
once again I've got an inner clot
anonymous inner class up here where I've
implemented run so right right there you
see the code there and that it ends
there and then so for this what I'm
going to do is I'm going to have I'm not
passing anything in there so that's
empty and then I'm do the same thing I'm
going to do a block and then I'm just
going to
hello world two and then with emphasis
and I noticed once again same syntax
argument list arrow token this time we
have a block so I'm going to go ahead
and run that one file will smell that
one you want to run that one and it
should just print the two messages there
we go and then finally in another
example of functional interface would be
compared a tour and we can see here that
we're doing an anonymous inner class
right here on this line to do a
comparison so I'm sorting a person list
and I'll talk about that more in the
next example but it's a you know list of
objects we're going to go through and
sort it based on surname which is the
last name less and that's basically you
know we have our little vertical problem
we going to get quite a bit of go here
to do this so let's do it lamb the style
so we're going to do too we're going to
create a lambda to do it offending and
descending so the code for that is
basically with something like this so
it's going to be a comparator of a
person i'm going to call it got my notes
there to help me out surname ascending
are ascending sort and then i'm going to
once again I've got this particular the
compare method has two arguments
if usually there it's just any object so
we're going to pass in person since
that's what we're sorting so a person
one in person too
so there's my token and then I'm going
to just call we're going to get the
surname and then we're going to compare
that to the second person
like so there's my first one so once
again I'm have passed in the the objects
here and I specified the type there but
I don't have to do that lambda
expressions have something called target
iple so I do the second example so it
can kind of infer what the types are so
that's why you see some of these
examples I don't have anything telling
you know saying what kind of type it is
so if I to my second one
there we go
so I'm sorting this one descending and
so this 1 i'm just going to do p1 and p2
and then lenses expressions are smart
enough to infer that those are persons
and so then we're going to start with p
to get that surname and we're going to
compare that to p1
like so and so basically I just have
some Lister let's try to run that
and it's just going to print us some
sort of list or food and it did always
good in a demo so it was that descending
click restoring Upsy on last name here
and then the first one is ascending
that's from our lambda expressions and
of course we have our first one up at
the top there like so so basically
that's what open you know that's what
they look like there's some examples of
how you could use it you know in some
instances that you know you typically
are used today in java programs so let
me jump back to the presentation
so just to reiterate once again it's one
of the things it does is improves upon
an anonymous inner classes it uses
functional interfaces with the building
block for the expression and functional
interface is an interface with one
abstract method and then there we see
some examples we've got arguments on the
left in our arrow token and then our
block on the right which can either be
an expression or a block of code and
then once again I've got two three
example there though let's look at a
another example and this is the robocall
application this is taken from
presentation then by stuart marks at
javaone 2012 and essentially it's an
application that that's designed to
contact a list of people and I've
expanded it so that it not only phones
you can also email you on than regular
snail mail people of whatever list is
sent to it can do any one of those three
things and we're going to contact three
different groups so in the US drivers or
anybody with 16 and / or click a passive
driving cuts but there's an age
requirement there so we're looking at
the groups are defined by age draftees
our people between eight male people
between the age of 18 and 25 we don't
actually have a draft and stuff to sign
up for it so that's that each rings
there and then finally we have pilots
which have an age range of 23 to 65 so
we're going to be working with those
three groups and we can contact them in
three different methods so we're going
to start out with a basic app and try to
improve upon it in various ways and then
see how we can improve it with the
lambda expressions okay so I think the
next one here we go to the demo and
that's it all right let's do that
okay and so we're going to look at the
robocall example and let me go ahead and
open this up and so basically I talked
about that a little bit let me pull up
the first test we have here and here's
the code and first we create a person
with so let's talk about the person quoi
I'm going to open that up and see here
it's just a class we have given name
surname AIDS gender male so you know so
it's pretty simple mostly string gender
is just an enumeration I can pull that
up real quick see there we've got
male and female that's it that's for the
drafting scrapping list and it set up
with a builder using the Builder pattern
so if i scroll down to the bottom here
you'll see that I've got a method that
gives me an instance of a list so it's a
static method and that's what we work
with throughout the apps that follow so
so that's what person is we're just just
creating a list of people with that you
know first name last name their address
phone number email address all the
things we need for our robo caller to
make calls ok and then so the first
thing I have here is robo contact method
or class excuse me not method a class
contact methods so what you see here is
for example so i have message that work
like this I have a call drivers method
and I go through my list gets a list of
people I go straight iterate through the
list of people and then I check for the
ones that are 16 and then if they're
they need to meet the criteria then they
get a call then I have another one here
for email draftees so this is an email
method notice that I do a robocall there
that the phone Rover email here if we
scroll down to the bottom of the class
then I just have these simple methods it
just prints out a message now in theory
it be connected to something that would
actually make the phone calls or do the
emails or whatever but that i also have
an email one here same thing i get ur
eight through it i check the criteria
and then i do whatever I need to do now
I've only done three sample methods here
if you think about it so I wanted this
to really work for all this stuff I
would need a separate method for each
group and then a method for each way of
communication so i'd have to have nine
total method using this approach so when
you know work with objects rated
programs we want to do the principal
called dry which is don't repeat
yourself and so if i use this man
I said I'm going to be repeating myself
a lot so let's see how we can improve
upon that so I'm going to close this and
I'm going to go to the second one so my
second example I'm going to use contact
methods to class so let's look at that
and you can see here that so my
improvement on this is instead of doing
the criteria every time I I have a
different method i've set up little
methods to test test each person so that
after that make Michael a little bit
more maintainable so that if for some
reason my business logic pain say
drivers you know in 15 year old become
drivers then I don't have to go back and
touch you to my methyl so that's an
improvement but I still if I follow
through with what I said before I still
would have nine method they still have a
lot of repetitive toad and still kind of
violates the drive principles will not a
very good normal so let's move on to the
third example so this one once again
we're getting the list and this one's
calling a nonnamous robo robo color or
anonymous class or a robo robo collar so
let's pull that up before I look at in
detail at this test class so this one I
have actually improved things so I'm
using an anonymous inner class to call
stuff so if you look at the methods I've
gone from nine to three so I've
encapsulated all the best information in
the inner class you see here when I do
my test on my yesterday i'm still
iterating through everything but at
least with my F I'm calling this inner
class and then I'm doing my test here so
I only need the three kinds of consult
so that takes care of the groups that
I'm searching for so that's taken care
of and so I only have phone email and
mail so the only the three contact
methods when a quick my I am my end
result message down below but those
don't fold so basically I've gone down
from nine to three that's better but
then as we look at how I did the test
method it's not you know we still have
kind of just changed our problems so now
even that and even though that class is
a lot cleaner
when i call it i'm still repeating a lot
of stuff so I'm still doing doing an
inner class I'm having to set up the
criteria every time like so and you know
it's an improvement but and I could of
course change these two methods but it
starts getting tricky and and stuff so
what does lamb to offer to a situation
won't wolf so let's let's pull up our
lamb to our final pet and we can see
here that I've got I've got to build
some stuff in here but let's look at and
yet we're calling and this time Robo
contact Lambeth let's pull that up and
see if that looks like okay so I've gone
to my so I've got the same so that's
1923 again and notice here that I'm
using something a predicate so look at
that call list there so we have a number
of built-in functional interfaces and
predicate is one of those and predicates
basically has one method test which
returns a boolean so it works perfectly
for this situation so I'm going to go
ahead and let's go ahead and do the
lambda expression and write those so
that we can finish off with app so I'm
going to go back here to the main method
of our test method and let's let's fill
those in
and I'm just going up my cheat sheet
here real quick ok so I'm going to
assign these all two variables like so
so I'm going to create a predicate and
if my desktop is working properly I
would actually show you the this is all
in the API so if you look at the api doc
you can see the definitions for
predicate and all the stuff that I'm
working with we're so I'm setting up a
predicate it's a type person I'm going
to do all drivers and those would be so
that's the 16 age group so I'm just
going to find that to the lambda
expression like so and so that's going
to be a person dot I'm going to get the
age and we're going to say greater than
or equal to 16 and that's it now I
notice from the earlier examples
everything I did before with a block
that's an expression there so I'm
turning a true/false there
so I'm going to do let me do the other
ones here based on my comments there so
they don't need another predicate and
so it's going to be all draft knees oops
done well carried away there with it
jeez let's see here so same thing person
use my token this one's a little more
complicated we're going to get the age
and we're going to say greater than or
equal to 18 and we're going to get the H
again we're going to stay less than or
equal to 25 and then finally we're going
to have
we're going to get the gender and that's
going to be equal to all right so that's
that lambda expression and then finally
we're going to do pilots so basically
the same thing
you
and then our adriance is
you
you
there we go make that look a little
better and you see there a netbeans
appear was actually showing an error
clear those all out and you can see here
that then this becomes a little bit
cleaner when we call this a lot better
than the the inner classes were and I'm
just going to run this one
you
and there we go so what I'm going to do
next is I'm going to jump to the
collection if you go to the ope there's
another quick example on how do you
function or the function interface and
all this is under java that util dot
function so remember that to happen we
feel about function i would show it but
i'm not sure my system can handle that
so maybe if i have time at the end so
let me go ahead and close these now and
let's go through some of the changes to
the collections a twat so that's this
example up here we definitely want to
get this in so anyway so the example i'm
skipping once again it's in the old ee
you can look that up for yourself it's
all there ok so so all the collection
api's has been changed to use lambda
expression so i have once again a person
list removing that throughout i show
that there and then the first thing i
want to point i was going have a new 40
so it's very similar to the enhanced for
loop but it takes a lambda expression as
a parameter so here what I'm doing is in
my person class I've actually set up a
lambda expression to print out the
information in a particular style and so
that's what I'm calling here so I'm
going through the for each like so and
then here's the expression you know once
again we've got our arguments that what
our arrow token our token operator and
then our arrow token excuse me it's not
not over arrow pokud and then there's
our expression so you may ask well why
Mike do we need a for each loop so
probably this situation and you know I
can pass a lambda expression that's
great but but that doesn't really you
know well that's not listed
so let's let's look at another example I
think this helps to explain it a little
better so what you can do with the new
collections API and lambda is chaining
and filtering so you can go through a
list once again we're going through a
person list you can go through that and
then filter the information so that only
the information you want printed is
processed so it's a the concept is
basically called laziness but the idea
is you don't do an operation on
something until you actually need to do
it so rather than having to like iterate
through an entire list every time first
we can filter it like so and then then
we do the iteration so I'm going to
filter it and so what i'm doing here is
remember all those lambda expressions by
pipe before so I've gone and I put this
in a class I'm going to pull this up so
this is the search criteria class and
remember how i just typed in all this
stuff well so i did that again but this
time i put it in a map when i put that
in a class as a wrapper around it and so
i can just call all drivers all that
move all pilots and then it's going to
give me that expression which I can then
pass around for when I have a plaque get
criteria notice is returning a predicate
of type person and so I've encapsulated
all that lambda stuff and I can just
pass it in there and then if we come so
I think it looks very clean here when we
get in that code I'm just kissing all
pilots through that filter then once we
filtered out just the pilot then we
iterate over that list and then we print
that list so it gives the developers a
lot more opportunity to optimize the
code and we can do a lot more flexible
than what we can do is it now one thing
I have I kind of skipped over but I
can't get over is notice that call there
to stream so what we're doing we use
what's called streams
with the collections now essentially
what that does is it takes your list
your items in your list and makes what's
called a pipeline and essentially it has
the items in there but it allows you to
do these various operations on your list
without affecting your list so
essentially by having a copy doing
whatever you need to do and then when
you're done with that particular set of
iterations or whatever then it just
throws away that pipeline and there's no
change to your list so logical question
would be okay so if i do that what if i
want to save your load what if i want to
save result what did i do all this
filtering stuff how do i save that well
you can do that with the next example
that's test three here you can get it to
open there we go and here once again but
notice this time I'm actually going to
return something so here's my person
list over here to the right once again
I'm calling stream which is taking my
lists and making a pipeline out of its
like before I move operation and before
I forget the information you can find
about stream and you definitely want to
Java util dot screen or streams I don't
remember i'll stop my head it's one of
those but you basically want to look at
that also in your api documentation to
get more information about all these
methods i'm using so anyway I'm calling
a stream then once again i'm doing a
filter for the pilots and then finally i
call with the collect method which ate a
class is argument the collectors class
and so that's what stores up all the
stuff that's been filtered and then you
with collectors you can then depending
on what kind of data type you're working
with or what kind of collection then you
can output the result to that particular
kind of list as you can see here on the
first line i've done a person list so i
can stream filter collective that's how
I save results if I want to do that
now one final example I haven't really
mentioned the stream all the streams of
new so far with meatball clear screen
that is a valley works in one thread
that's like a serial formal will just
does it's one set of items right it does
it in one threat so this last example
we're also i'm going to show you like
the old style compare this but remember
so we want to be lazy so the old style
of programming this and this is doing a
pilot once again all the pilots but i
wanted to calculate the average age of
our pilots and to do that old style what
i would have to do is set up a loop like
so I tests for the AIDS like so and then
I have two variables that have a sum to
total the ages and then that get account
to find out how many people are in the
list you know then down here we divide
some by out and then I can print out the
results and I'm printing out some and
and the average both just because i'm
calculating the number so that's the old
style way of doing so we're going to
have to go through every item in the
list every time but with lambdas once
again i can filter it and i also have
some new method that help me with
population so this first example i'm
just going to create a template an
integer value once i'm going to have my
list here i'm doing a serial stream like
so all pilots and then if you look at
the streams api you'll see what the
various methods are i'm using a map here
and so what a map does is it allows you
to get part of a an object and do
something with it so in this case i'm
getting all the ages and then in the
final statement or final call here when
i'm chaining i'm going to sum it once
again this is part of the streams glass
its built-in you can call some i'm
returning an integer string war and then
that's going to total it there so the
other thing i wanted to point out really
briefly here as we're running out of
time is that i don't have to do
everything cereal I can do it in peril
so in fact this is a really big
calculation with a lot of numbers I can
also call a parallel stream so notice
the syntax is exactly the same except
instead of calling stream I'm calling
parallel stream and I filter things the
same way I'm and I'm calling my map once
again to get the age and this time I'm
computing the average now the average
one thing that you want to nut you'll
notice when you look at the 8th 9th and
stuff will play around one of those what
kind of return value but because the
various methods have different kinds of
returns you want to make sure returning
you know what you're returning so for
example in this case average actually
returns an optional double so which is
essentially that's a class that either a
double value or empty but notice that I
don't have to iterate through all all
the people in my list I only have to go
through the pilots because I soldiered
in here and then I only have to you know
work with those particular items instead
of everything so that's the advantage of
using lambda expressions with
collections okay so i think that's it
we're almost at a time i'm going to stop
there let me jump back here once again
here as i mentioned this job you kill
that function and the job you till that
stream those are the two that you want
to look up in your api documentation
so this is a summary you know this is
what we talked about the definitions
some example went through the robocall
app we had to skip that demo because the
technical difficulty and then we went
through the collections so thanks
everybody for listening you might have
four more poles here please fill finish
those up once again that there's a lot
of java community stuff we have forums
on oracle com and java.net there's local
user groups or love from reading stay
involved with Java and Java 8 is going
to be really cool all this stuff is
really great and of course this is based
on an actual OBE or Oracle by example
which is essentially an online free web
tutorial you can get that at the Oracle
Learning Library oracle.com flash oll so
Peter any questions now in comments
thank you very much like at this time if
anyone has any questions please use the
