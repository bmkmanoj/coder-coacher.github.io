domain configurations this is the
seventh in our series of eight videos
about upgrading to Oracle BPM suite 12c
as the title suggests in this video
we'll take a look at upgrading domain
configurations with the Upgrade
Assistant this is the last of our core
upgrade tasks will use the Upgrade
Assistant to upgrade several components
including Oracle Java required files or
jrf system components infrastructure
Oracle Web Services Manager and oracle
user messaging service will run the
upgrade assistant on the host with the
admin server as we did before then later
in the process will pack the changed
files up copy them to the other host and
unpack them to ensure that the domain is
upgraded identically on both hosts will
invoke the Upgrade Assistant the same
way we did to upgrade the database
schemas on the host with the admin
server will navigate to Oracle home
Oracle common upgrade bin and run the UA
from there the welcome screen provides
an overview of the Upgrade Assistant and
some information about important pre
upgrade tasks when we use the Upgrade
Assistant to upgrade our schemas we
accepted the default schemas option this
time we want to upgrade our weblogic
component configurations so we click
that radio button we then enter the
domain directory for the 11g domain that
we are upgrading now
with those two choices made we click
Next to continue this screen provides a
list of components that will be
considered in the domain component
configuration upgrade they include
Oracle Java required files or jrf system
components infrastructure Oracle Web
Services Manager and user messaging
service there are no inputs on this
screen so we proceed as we've seen
before the prerequisite screen requires
you to acknowledge that all
prerequisites have been met before you
continue with the upgrade you must check
the boxes before you can continue I
backed up my 11g installation and
instance data I've verified my database
version is certified for this upgrade I
verified my system meets all
requirements for this upgrade to 12 see
here we specify login credentials for
our other hosts which as you may recall
has a managed server the examine screen
displays the status of the Upgrade
Assistant as it examines each component
verifying that the component is ready
for upgrade the green check marks
indicate that the examination of the
components were successful notice that
upgrade is not necessary for two of the
components the upgrade summary lets us
review a summary of what is proposed to
be upgraded review it and then click
upgrade to proceed the upgrade is
underway the upgrade progress screen
shows the status of the upgrade process
when it's complete click Next after a
successful upgrade of your weblogic
components this window will display the
list of
cessfully upgraded components and the
list of components that did not require
an upgrade if for any reason your
upgrade is not successful the window
will display upgrade failure in that
event the upgrade failed for one or more
specified components and upgrade
assistant will have to be restarted if
this happens click the view log button
at the bottom of the screen or note the
log file location before closing the
window we've updated the host with the
admin server the next steps are to pack
the changed files up copy them to the
other host and unpack them recall that
this is necessary in our case because
the domain directory is not shared we'll
use the pack script to pack the changed
files to be copied to the other hosts
the pack command creates a template
archive or jar file that contains a
snapshot of either an entire domain or a
subset of a domain in our example will
create a template that contains a subset
of a domain to create a managed server
domain directory hierarchy on a remote
machine will execute the pack script
from the new 12c Oracle home will pass
parameters to the pack script indicating
the domain we wish to pack the name of
the template and template file will also
use the managed parameter which
specifies that the template is to be
used to create managed servers on remote
machines then will copy the newly
created template file to the remote host
there are a variety of ways to do this
for example we could use the UNIX SCP or
secure copy command we would invoke the
command with the name of the file to be
copied followed by user at host name
colon destination path once we finish
copying the upgraded domain to our other
hosts we've completed the core upgrade
tasks but there are still a few things
to do before we start our new 12c
environment to ensure that our
opponents continue to function as
expected for more information about
those tasks be sure to watch the next
video in this series performing post
upgrade tasks and verifying success I'm
