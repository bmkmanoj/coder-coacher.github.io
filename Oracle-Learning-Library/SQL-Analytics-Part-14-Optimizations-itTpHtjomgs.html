podcasts on Oracle's in database equina
lithics my name's Keith Laker i'm a
senior principal product manager for
data warehousing and big data and oracle
in this session we can look at some of
the optimizations that we've included in
the database to support sequel analytics
sorting is a key process within the
world of analytics when using sequel
analytics we try to ensure that the
number of sorts are minimized through
the concept of ordering groups this
optimization takes a set of analytic
functions and groups them together so
they can evaluate it with a single sort
the optimizer is looking for a minimal
set of ordering groups to minimize the
number of sorts for example as you can
see here we have a rank some entire and
some included in our query the sorting
is split into two separate ordering
groups with the first group containing
the nth Island some which share the sort
order x y and z the second group
containing the rank and some share the
sort order X W and Z therefore rather
than sort the data for x we create to
ordering groups to minimize the number
of salts that are performed the next
level of optimization is based on the
elimination of unnecessary sorts further
sword elimination is accomplished by
scheduling execution so they're ordering
groups with salts corresponding to that
in a group by execute first and
immediately after the group by ordering
groups with sorts corresponding to that
in the order by execute last immediately
before the order by eliminating sorts
when index or joined methods such as
soft merge takes place makes sorting and
this
so we can skip those types of swords
another optimization is applied where a
rank function is used in a query and
instead of sorting all the data adding
the rank and then applying the predicate
the rank predicate is evaluated as part
of the sort this means that fewer
records are actually sorted and the net
result of all these optimizations is
much more efficient execution so let's
show you how this would work in practice
by looking at the use of a lag and lead
