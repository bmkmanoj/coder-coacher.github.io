hello and welcome to the enterprise
manager cloud controlled demo series
today we are going to talk about cloud
management more specifically we are
going to focus on enabling self-service
capability for the cloud in this demo
you will learn about setting up self
service roles and users allocating quota
and defining access control for self
service users publishing Oracle virtual
assemblies to the self-service portal
and configuring metering and chargeback
for the cloud let's go to the cloud
management homepage in a previous demo
in this demo series we learned about how
Enterprise Manager enables and automates
the setup for cloud infrastructure all
the way from setting up and discovering
servers to creating zones and pools and
setting up storage and networking let's
go ahead and enable this cloud
infrastructure for self-service now the
first thing we will do is create some
self service users and roles we go to
the enterprise manager role management
page and create a new role let's call
the self-service role as an application
developer role you go ahead and assign
it the out of box eam self-service user
role this grants the appropriate
privileges for the self-service portal
to this self-service role which is the
application developer we just leave the
defaults for target privileges and
resource privileges that come with the
self-service user role that comes out of
box so we keep all the options default
options and finish the flow what this
does is creates an application developer
role for self-service now let's go ahead
and create a self-service user with this
role
let's call this user john smith and
provide a password to login to the
self-service portal for John Smith since
John Smith is not an administrator we do
not give him any administrative
privileges he is a pure business user
who is an application developer let's
remove the default roles for this user
and add the specific app developer role
that we created earlier let's keep all
the defaults for other target and
resource privileges review and finish
this creates a new enterprise manager
user called John Smith and John Smith is
a self service user Enterprise Manager
also provides access to ldap systems for
configuring and bringing in users and
roles here we saw how you can use the
enterprise manager console itself for
creating a cloud user and raw now let's
continue with the self service set up as
a self service administrator oh my i
might want to define some quota and
access controls for self-service user so
let's go to the cloud infrastructure
setup here as a self service
administrator i can define the sizes of
machines that users can request from the
cloud let's go ahead and create a new
size let's say a very large machine
which has 10 CPUs a 19 gig memory and
let's say you know some 1250 gig storage
this machine size is now added to the
predefined list of sizes that means the
self service users when they come to the
portal to request the resources they can
only request one of these specific
machine sizes that the administrator is
defining also let's go ahead and do
request settings here the administrator
can specify how much in advance a user
can make a request through the portal
let's say the user can request two
months in advance also you can specify
once the requests are made for resources
in the cloud for how long can those
requests or those resources be kept
let's say they can you sell service
users can keep the resources for one
year at the most also you can choose as
an administrator to configure an
enterprise manager agent on to the
deployments that are done by the self
service users so we will choose to
enable a am agent on the deployments
also the administrator can set a
software library location which believe
which will be used by all self service
users to save their environments or
store their templates and assemblies so
let's go ahead and pick a predefined
folder within a software library
enterprise manager software library
which will be used to store all these
self-service portal artifacts that the
users create let's apply these settings
once the request settings are stored
let's go ahead and define some access
control and Kota for cell service users
this is the most interesting part where
enterprise manager allows administrators
to control how much self service users
can request and constrain them from
going overboard and you know and control
over provisioning of cloud resources so
here let's go ahead and define a new
role to zone mapping basically I'm
picking one of the self-service roles
that I defined earlier let's say the app
developer role that we defined earlier
and here we are saying application
developers can only request resources in
a specific zone in the cloud so I am
mapping a specific self service role to
a specific zone in the
that means all the application
deployments or machine deployments done
by this self service a user will always
get deployed in this specific zone also
let's go ahead and assign some quota for
this self service role an application
developer can request add the most five
machines they can request a total of ten
CPUs a total of twenty gig memory and a
total of 200 gig local disk if they
request additional storage through the
self-service portal they can request at
the most 200 gig of additional storage
the administrator can also choose to
allow or not allow a self-service user
to archive their deployments in the
software library if you give them the
right privilege and if the self-service
user is a power user they can choose to
save their deployments for future use
also a self-service administrator can
map a specific network profile to the
self-service user which means all the
deployments done by the app developer
here would be done in a specific Network
which is defined by a network profile in
our case we will not use any network
profile let's save this role to codes on
mapping as well as the quota settings
for the role the next step we do in the
self-service setup is to publish some
cloud services to the portal in the
enterprise manager software library we
already have created and uploaded some
virtual assemblies and oracle vm
templates that can be used by self
service users to provision application
environments let's go ahead and choose
some of the components in the software
library and publish that to the portal
here I have a database template and a
webshop assembly that I'm going to
choose and
pick and then give access to these
components in the soft library to the
app developer role that we created
earlier that means all the application
developers when they log into the portal
they can deploy this assembly and this
template on their own let's publish
these components to the portal the next
step is to set up some chargeback a
chargeback application in enterprise
manager allows administrators to define
a charge plan and assign that charge
plan to a specific zone or specific
cloud target so let's go ahead and
define a charge plan what you see here
is a base plan a default plan which has
recharges users as a based on CPU memory
and storage here we can specify or edit
this base plan to specify some values so
let's say we want to charge ten cents
per CPU per hour to the user similarly
you can edit the other values so here
i'm charging 25 cents per day per gig
for memory and one and a half dollars
per month per gig for storage a base
plan basically can be associated with
any cloud target you can also define
some extended plans that can take into
account some additional configuration
for your cloud resources so let's go
ahead and create an extended plan which
will override the base plan so let's
call the plan vm plan and basically
specify some charges for the plan so
this plan specifically acts on a virtual
machine and we are defining a condition
we are saying that if the machine size
equals small so that's the condition
then only for machines that are small
machines we want to charge
a certain amount so let's say our two
dollars per day as a base charge so what
this is doing is it's going to charge
two dollars flat rate for all the
machines requested by the user which are
small machines similarly enterprise
manager allows charged items based on
fixed cost items like power cooling or
software licenses you can also set
charged items based on configuration
properties so for example a certain
version of a weblogic or certain version
of an operating system you can charge
more or less also you can charge by
usage so you can charge more or less for
cpu utilization memory utilization other
performance metrics we have defined a
extended plan here so let's go ahead and
save it and as you can see here this
extended plan the vm plan basically says
if the machine is equal to small add a
base charge of two dollars for instance
per machine per day now let's go ahead
and assign this plan to specific cloud
target the first thing we'll do is
register some clout targets with the
chargeback application so I have the
manufacturing zone that we created
earlier we go ahead and assign the vm
plan that we created to this
manufacturing zone what this is saying
is all deployments done by self service
users in the manufacturing zone will be
charged according to the vm plan and
this basically sets up the charges for
the you know four deployments in a
specific zone administrators can also
define cost centers and they can add
users to certain cost centers they can
also get users and cost center
information from an LDAP directory and
then Enterprise Manager can track usage
in the cloud for these users and
administrators can do
morning and they can generate reports
for the usage and charge back so that
completes the set up for self-service
portion of cloud management the next
thing you'll see in the next demo is how
a self-service user can log into the
portal and make some requests thank you
