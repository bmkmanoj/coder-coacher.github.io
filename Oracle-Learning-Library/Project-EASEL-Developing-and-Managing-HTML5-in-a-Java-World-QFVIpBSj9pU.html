everyone welcome hopefully we've all had
a great lunch and kicking back a little
bit now I'll try to keep it a little
lively so you don't fall asleep after
that great lunch I know I had a good
lunch with myself
that's right try and keep it going and
moving forward my name is John Brock I
go by JB and this is David Konishi he's
one of the lead engineers that's
actually helped us put project easel
together over the last six seven months
so my intent today is really just to
cover what project easel is not first
and then tell you a little bit about
what it is I had those in reverse order
and as I started going through it a
little bit more today I thought what the
heck we'll get the bad news out of the
way first then go to the good stuff
we'll talk about client side projects
which is a new thing that we have in
NetBeans 7.3 beta which we're hoping to
see released here anytime soon
next few days a week what as soon as
it'll we can get it there we'll get it
there we'll talk about html5 what we're
doing with that in the in the new editor
what we're doing with the brand new
JavaScript editor which has a lot of
great stuff in it and some css3
capabilities and then we'll end up with
just kind of talking about some restful
web services and how we can interact
with those from the client-side so what
project kenai is not we're not a WYSIWYG
editor you're not going to come in here
and start dragging HTML tables around
and buttons and things like that we're
still down in the tech side of things
we're not the Java solution so for those
of you that have been seeing this show
up in the keynote last night or earlier
this morning and David's talk or a few
other places the question comes up and
it isn't as often as I thought it would
but it has come up how does this compare
to Java FX or JSF or something like that
it doesn't this is just another tool to
stick inside your belt and when you come
up against something that needs CSS
formatting and layout and styling and so
forth or you know a better JavaScript
debugging solution we're gonna have it
there in the NetBeans IDE for you so
that you can use what you need I mean if
we waited for trends to materialize
image
sure and then we started doing tooling
maybe six months a year behind every
time so we're we're throwing this
together and this is a v1 of it and
we're gonna see where it goes and it may
mature and go in a lot of different
directions and many people have told us
a few directions we could go but we'll
try and stay forward on it instead we're
not a web designer so this isn't you
know a competitor to Photoshop or things
like that you're not going to do a bunch
of image manipulation and and graphics
work and stuff like that but what we are
so it's a brand new client side project
called html5 application or application
l5 project html5 is used as the buzzword
to incorporate everything from real
html5 to css3 and JavaScript all kind of
mishmash together we have a brand new
WebKit internal browser based off JavaFX
webview and also external browser
synchronization with a chrome plug-in
that we've put in and will do a lot of
work with that and show a lot of that
interaction code completion for html5
elements are now built into the editor
and I'll show that as well new CSS
styling and rules and that's really
where a lot of the work has gone into
and we'll show that and then of course a
brand new JavaScript editor that's all
based on top of the noon as horn
technologies and things of that nature
with smart code completion so depending
on where you are inside your JavaScript
we know what it is we're going to give
you the result or the suggestions that
are a little bit more pertinent to where
you are that includes jQuery which is
now going to be built into the
JavaScript editor so as you start to
type a jQuery command if you hit control
space to get code completion is going to
show you jquery information and then the
debugger the debugger is actually pretty
cool and then it's based off of remote
WebKit debugging API so we're pulling
directly from the browser we know
exactly what's coming in we're not
trying to guess and process it ourselves
we're actually getting it right from the
browser so that's the extent of my
slides we're going to do live code from
here on out and we sacrificed an intern
later today so hopefully the demo gods
will be with us
and we will see what happens so this is
a just a nightly build coming off of the
NetBeans 7/3 branch and what we have is
an HTML Javascript we now have an html5
application and just going through this
dialog will throw up a new project one
of the things that we wanted to be able
to do is in a lot of cases we don't
really know where to start in this new
world of html5 and responsive design
which is a big word that's going around
out there but there are a lot of
different templates that are out there
available on the internet from html5
boilerplate to initialize a responsive
even Twitter bootstrap so what we did
was we built in that you can grab one of
these and we will pull it down live from
the internet from the most recent
version off their site and you can start
scripting from there or building out
your application based on those
templates of course if you know you're a
cowboy and you're really daring
you can go without any template and just
will give you a blank pages and away you
go for me I'm going to use a template
that I already created and this is
another thing that we've built in is
that if you create a project or your
companies put something together you can
export it as a template and so everybody
else can then just pull it up and start
from there so if you've got a company
standard or you know a group standard or
something you can set it up and away you
go
since we're dealing with JavaScript
we've built in a JavaScript library
manager this list is being pulled from
Google CDN and CDN j/s there's literally
thousands of libraries that are here you
can grab any one of them add them to
your atom to your project you can grab
all the different versions that are
available I'm just gonna grab a backbone
and add it to my list this list over
here shows all of the existing libraries
that are already in my template so I've
got quite a bit of stuff built into this
template I'm just going to add that and
away we go
it downloads that backbone.js file it
unzips the demo and it opens up my
index.html into the editor
we've created a basic structure if you
will when we put all this stuff together
so that you can you can kind of mess
around and feel for things being
compartmentalized the way we you know
you keep je s files separate from your
CSS and so forth but looking at the
project properties you know we've got
the project folder we've got a the
concept of a site root I mean most of
the time when your FTP in or
transferring or your code up to some
hosted service there sticking things
under public HTML so that's that's where
we started we go ahead and give you a
base unit testing folder in case you
want to get into your JavaScript unit
testing and David showed a little bit of
that earlier this morning so you can do
all of that again under JavaScript files
it's that JavaScript manager you can add
and mess with your files there if you
need to and then under the run side this
is where things are a little bit
different in that we have the ability to
set a default run target for the project
we have the embedded WebKit browser
which I'll show in just a second and
then we have the chrome with NetBeans
integration as well as the other
browsers that you can definitely run it
in and check it out and see how it's
going it doesn't have the integration
capabilities that we have with WebKit
right now we ought to refresh on save
you can turn that on or on if you like
and then we have a lot of
synchronization between the browser and
the IDE itself and we'll show that the
index file or the start file is
basically if I run this project using my
big green button at the top it's going
to run that that base file you can set
that to whatever you want with default
index dot HTML we also it provide a
really lightweight embedded web server
so that when we're dealing with our
JavaScript we're dealing with you know
response headers and also stuff we
needed to run it from a web server
instead of just running it off the file
system you can still run it off file
system if you want but for right now
that's what we do if you have something
on your development machine like an
Apache server that's running you know
say you've got you know rails put in it
because you're running less or sess for
CSS post process or pre-processing or
something like that you can choose
external and just provide us a URL to
where that server is expect
those files to be or they're gonna serve
up from but it has to be on the local
machine it's not we're not going to
transfer files automatically some other
remote locations right now we're gonna
stay with that embedded one so I have my
project it opened up my index.html let's
take a look at some of the the things
that we've added into this coming down
here little ways you'll see some some
different files that I've got it's this
a typical editor that's kind of you know
just like your what you do in Java if we
highlight a you know a class in this
case it highlights all the ones that are
they're equivalent to it or the same so
you can mess around with those and see
where things are at if we click on a div
it shows the clothes and the open but
one of the things that's new in here is
if I click on this div close down here
the top of that code fold is actually
off my screen but instead of having to
scroll all the way up to figure out what
it is you'll notice there's a little tip
that shows up the top tells me what that
opening div is a really simplistic thing
but boy it really helps when you're when
you're trying to get this long string of
code and I come all way down here what
was my closing div well my closing div
is for my row fluid up at the very top
there's my span 9 and so forth so I know
kind of where I am just really quickly
without scrolling so much in my code it
makes it pretty nice the other thing
when we talked about html5 is built in
now into the editor is a tag support for
all these html5 tags to say like article
or if I see an article you notice that
we've got help that talks about what the
element is tell you see how it gives you
some samples of how it's used things of
that nature so that's really where the
html5 starts to come in and I'm going to
put in a footer element here I'm just
going into the tab over on that I'm
going to add a class and I'm going to
call the class footer as well and we'll
see if we close that out and this is
another thing that we it's been in there
a while but I think it's pretty cool if
I wanted to make this a copyright notice
I have no idea how to memory
all the little ampersand things but if I
type ampersand and start to say well
it's probably a copy so I guess
searching and code completion is going
to pop up and give me with a little
graphic there as well and then okay
that's what I want and we'll make that
2012 and make it Oracle so let's see
what that actually looks like when we
run this whole thing so I'm gonna save
it I'm gonna give it a run and it's
going to pop up in a browser now bear
with me for a second while I rearrange
all of my screens here the concept that
we designed this off of is really dual
browser scenario so if you're working in
the IDE on one browser and you're in one
screen and monitor and you've got
another bra another monitor running your
browser it actually works a little bit
better
I'm also constrained down here to a 720
monitor so we're gonna we're gonna get a
little crowded as we go here in the
browser we we've brought all this up we
can see the what's showing in the
browser and I can see down here at the
very bottom I can see my footer that I
added in a minute ago this whole
application is actually built on top of
Twitter bootstrap which is a responsive
framework or styling template and what
it does is it allows me to adjust the
size of my browser and things adjust
responsively and so as I start to narrow
it down I get things they're a little
bit smaller and then if I come down even
more then they drop down really tiny so
these are using a combination of css3
fluid grids and and media queries which
if you've ever dealt with responsive
design it's actually a little complex
and that you've got to figure out where
is this image and what CSS media query
is it in and also the kind of stuff so
what we've done in the IDE is now I can
actually move around in the IDE and as I
move over my navigator it starts to
highlight things in the browser so that
I can just click on something and I can
looks as it comes up you know things are
a little crowded here where was i image
come on there we go you'll notice that
now over here in my CSS Styles it tells
me that that image is sitting at a
hundred pixels right now one hundred by
a hundred depending on what what media
query this thing happens to roll into
that's going to jump up to 150 and if I
drop it all the way down pretty small
you see then how they're down to down to
fifty so that's great I can I can
interact with it and see what's going on
a lot of times what these are what this
entire responsive design concept is
about is being able to create something
that's that works on multiple devices
depending on what the viewport is so
you'll see this little NetBeans icon
sitting in the omni bar that we've added
we've actually added the ability to
either customize and we've provided some
presets of different types of devices so
if I want to look at something in a
tablet landscape I click on it it
actually resizes it into what is a
common tablet landscaped size if I want
to drop it all the way down to a
smartphone landscape then it's going to
drop it down into here so it's really
nice that I can move around inside the
editor and I can see what's going on in
the browser but a lot of times that if
that isn't good enough you actually need
to go from the browser back into the IDE
so now I can click on something in here
and you'll see behind the scenes back
here that it's actually jumping over to
what it needs to to show and then it
highlights it over over on the other
side well now that we're actually
connected I think that that image is
actually pretty tiny so I'm going to
click into here and I'm going to start
changing that from 50 pixels to 75 and
we'll change the height as well over to
75
and it automatically adjusts you can see
it changing in the browser as I'm
changing it here now unlike doing this
in your browser tools I can Firebug or
Chrome we're actually doing this in the
source code itself you're not over there
tweaking things trying to figure out
what it is taking all the notes and then
doing cut and paste or whatever over it
back into your source code once you've
figured out what it is you're doing
we're doing it live in the in the code
itself and as we talked about the media
queries if I click on this on this
height here and I double click on it it
opens up that exact rule in the file it
happens to be in bootstrap responsive
which I you know I didn't need to know
that it just that's where it takes me to
if I bring this back out to its larger
size to where it's it's up at 150 and I
double click on it from there it opens
up style dot CSS because that's where I
have that one defined so I've got
multiple files all over the place but
the IDE knows which media query I'm in
it knows what I'm where that rule is
applied to that element at that time and
it takes you to that source code right
away some pretty nice interaction from
that that regard the other nice thing is
if I do take this and I'm going to
shrink this back down to smartphone just
because it lays out better on my on the
screen while I'm working on it if I go
back to this footer that I put in a
minute ago it highlights it down here I
can double click on it and we get back
into my right file here and as some of
you are thinking right now why didn't
that take him to the file yes I agree
with you why didn't it and we will
adjust that later
welcome to beta so I'm gonna and I'm
gonna do that over so you'll notice
right now there's a yellow line
underneath this footer well it says that
there isn't a style for class footer and
it hasn't been created yet if I move
into my gutter I see the same thing that
there's a little light bulb there if I
click on it it allows me to actually
create that rule in any of the CSS files
that I have currently associated with
this this HTML file so I'm just going to
stick it into my my areolar style dot
CSS I can see now that it's it's
actually available over here if I go
over to
and go down here to the bottom or dirt
or dirt or don't there it is so still in
the browser we have over here this this
the footer that's there I'm going to
start kind of adding things into it
because it's a footer right it's
supposed to be gray it's supposed to be
small and unobtrusive and just kind of
hidden away in the bottom so let's let's
just start typing in we're gonna say a
color I'm gonna make that kind of grey
and it immediately changes to gray I
want to move that down a little bit so
I'm gonna type in margin top you notice
now that the code completion is there
but not only does it give me the code
completion it gives me the the again the
documentation but look up here at the
top if I'm dealing with anything in the
CSS that isn't allowed in a browser that
I want to work with I'll see it grayed
out up here or it is if it isn't
available so this margin top has been
around forever every single one of these
browser supports it our intent is to
also start adding in the version number
that it was supported and so if you know
if it says it's in Firefox but it's only
Firefox 8 and above or something then
we'll try and get to that point but
right now at least with that we have we
have at least that it's available or not
so I'm going to put in a margin top I'm
gonna put in a 10 pixels and that
doesn't look like it's quite enough so
I'm going to go back over here and make
it
20 no ifs it's a little bit better yeah
that's pretty good there so I'll go
there and let's make the the font size a
little bit smaller because we don't want
it to know Vint isn't gonna work
yes make that down to 10 pixels as well
okay so we can do it live we can see
what we're doing it really makes it a
lot easier to kind of mess around with
with things while your lawyer doing it
so and and to kind of see what you're
doing a little bit more live so that's
some of the CSS work let's go and where
the heck did I get everything here now
let's close that out and go back let's
save that and close out style responsive
okay so some of you may have noticed
that this big elephant in the room it's
all in Dutch and for some of you that's
probably just fine and you never even
realized it because it just thought you
were back home I wanted that to be
English and I'm not really sure what's
going on and I somebody put this in
there and I'm sure it's supposed to be
some sort of language control or
whatever but let's go ahead and take a
look at how we figure out what's going
on so if I click on here you'll notice
that it jumped down here to this this h1
well that has a little bit different
icon on it than the others what that
means is that that's actually a
dynamically generated element that's
coming out of my JavaScript so what's
really cool about this navigator is that
we're not just showing the source code
we're actually showing what is being
displayed in the browser directly this
is coming right out of WebKit this is
the Dom that's being displayed so
anything that's generated we can still
style it I can still go in there and
mess with the styling of that generated
code which is really difficult to do if
you've got some for loop going on in the
JavaScript somewhere but in this case I
want to figure out what the language is
doing for that so I'm going to double
click on the div that's right above it
some really nice guy out at a comment in
here that said okay this this contents
actually coming from a get welcome
function on the window
load okay great so I know window.onload
is up here I can hold down the ctrl P
and just click on that function that's
there and we'll load up the JavaScript
and take you right to the Declaration of
that code now for those that just
couldn't ignore this bright orange bar
it says NetBeans IDE support plug-in is
debugging this tab yeah like we really
wanted you to all know that forever and
ever
but unfortunately that's part of chrome
and we've filed a bunch of bugs with
Google to get that removed but it has to
be there as long as you're debugging
they display this really annoying bright
orange bar and even if you click on the
X to close it instead of the cancel it
still cancels it and it disconnects your
whole interaction between the browser so
that has to stay there unfortunately but
that's where it is it does give us an
idea that we are debugging and that's
exactly what we really are doing and if
we want to see what this Lang is getting
set or is coming out as which seems to
be a good indication that might be were
the problem is I just click over there
and set a breakpoint and come back over
to the browser give it a refresh and you
notice it pauses and it actually comes
up green right over here
it's a typical at this point it's really
just a typical debugger I'm gonna step
into which is going to drop down to my
get lang I'm gonna step over that a
couple of times and I'm gonna say okay
what's what's going on here I mean it's
navigator dot user agent and it's trying
to match something inside of there I
look at the string and there's
absolutely nothing in there dealing with
a language nothing so obviously that's a
problem so for the sake of demo we will
figure out or we're gonna we're going to
go a little bit further into if if user
agent doesn't contain what we want then
maybe let's see what else is available
on navigator now I can come down to my
variables and and go through all my
variables and see what's going on there
if I want to or I can just hover over
navigator and expand directly in my my
tooltips my object and take a look at
what's going on again here's my user
agent I can see exactly what's in
there and hover over it nothing with
language but lo and behold there
actually is something called language
look at that and it's got en dot us on
so maybe that's what I want to deal with
I could go rewrite my code and and rerun
this thing but I guess a for demo
purposes we're just going to get rid of
that and we're gonna use a great little
thing in NetBeans called code templates
Wow so I just puts into a new function
that I already pre set that up and it
now uses the language it also takes into
account that some browsers use user
language and set a regular language and
from that point I save and because I
have refresh on save it just
automatically reloads it again I can
step in step over a couple of times and
now take a look at what Lang is set up
it's now en us which is what I want so
let's turn off that and run it through
and we'll behold
we're back in English like we want to so
pretty simple in dealing with the
debugger it's it's really just like a
debugger you use anywhere else but now
we can actually mess around with the
data and see what's going on in those
areas so a couple other things that are
that are pretty cool about the editor
and the the JavaScript editor I'm going
to go out of this page and bring up kind
of a little playground page that I have
I'm gonna run the individual page
instead of the project and at this point
let's load that up a little bit I've got
a few other just like say it's just a
playground so I wrote a whole bunch of
crazy things in here from a couple of
jQuery animations to just do some tips
which Shane I got a drag and drop that I
can drag the little kitten up to see the
funny
so yeah and you've got a few other
little things in here I
I added this one in and someone freaked
and said you're gonna do this live yeah
so this is this is actually a restful
call into Twitter and it's going to give
me whatever the most recent tweet is
that has the word Java 1 in it so let's
hope it's not nasty and it's not okay
okay but just you know really quick easy
thing to do this is actually coming off
of a restful service that I have running
on the machine and it's just simply
hitting a company and then pulling up
the details for it so let's take a look
at some of this restful service and how
we're messing with it and what we're
doing behind the scenes from my about
page I'm just running everything in
about Jas and again this is just the
declaration that calls it in I'm just
going to ctrl and click it's gonna open
it up I'm gonna expand this up and we'll
take a look at what's going on so this
is the this is the restful call there's
a bunch of different ways of dealing
with rest data and you're sure you've
you know if any of you have been hitting
around at the different HTML 5 and the
restful service sessions there are as
many different ways to pull data as you
know that you can imagine as long as
you're getting back a rest you know like
a JSON object or something like that
then we can style it and deal with it
I'm not going to try and show you today
how to you know be do the best rest call
or how to do security over rest and
things like that really what ezel is
about is the styling of the data once
you get it but there are some some cool
things that you can do from these
different ideas in these different
concepts I use jQuery a lot in this and
you can see that by the dollar sign
that's here in some cases people don't
quite line and the word jQuery are
synonymous in the jQuery world well
there's one of the things in the editor
that that makes it a little bit easier
to say I didn't really want to leave all
those dollar signs I can pull down the
control key again and press R and it's
going to give me in place rename so now
I can just say jQuery and
of that hit enter and every single
dollar sign just changed to jQuery and
if I it is transactional so if I hit
ctrl Z no no it'll back everything out
together as well it's nice it actually
works really well when we come down here
say to the the JSON call that I was
making out of Twitter if instead of
having data I wanted to call it you know
to be a little more descriptive again
the control are I can change this to to
tweet data and maybe that's a little
more realistic example of renaming
things within a function its scope based
so it kind of knows it'll stay on this
page for right now it doesn't do
full-blown refactoring across your
entire application yet it just stays
within the one page so it's something we
added into the editor that I found it
nice when I'm putting together some of
these demos and so forth it works really
well
obviously doesn't do anything for for
the code itself still looks and runs
exactly the same so one of the things
that that I was looking at and saying
when I was putting all this together I
had to create this little this little
tweet piece and when I did that
I'll anybody need knows Franz he's still
seeking some job along cool stuff so
make sure yeah you know where he's at
I went and stole this little pop-up as a
login from some other site I saw it on a
site I went and just grabbed their CSS
and said okay that looks really cool and
then I wanted to turn it into this this
tweet and re you know add things and so
forth because I just wanted the base
folder and in the end a little close
button and so forth so what I did was I
went out and I just looked at Twitter
API and I figured out okay here's here's
a basic call for the search and I'm
gonna search off the off the key name of
Java 1 but how am I going to know what
to get back I mean for those of you
who've dealt with soap or you know
wisdoms and wattles and all those so we
had some some form of standardization
that you knew what you were going to get
back well it doesn't work that way and
in the world of rest you're just going
to get a chunk of something and you got
to go figure out what to do with it
so by dropping in a breakpoint right
here
and then coming over and running this I
can actually stop and look at now at
that object and open it up expand it
this sometimes this may be better to do
down in the variable window because you
can keep it up a little bit longer but I
know that I'm getting my results back
they're actually the search returns 15
results and I only want the first one so
I know I'm gonna have to go into you
know an object or a result 0 so I know
that already and then now I can actually
see the real data that's being returned
out of that information and so I can
start to say okay well I know I want to
put the guy's image up so I'm gonna come
down here and okay here's that here's a
profile image URL so that's the string
that I have to get back because I can
see that's his URL I had no idea I
actually learned when I was doing it
that there was a from user and a from
username now which ones which you know
because I wanted to be able to show that
the ampersand or the @ and then the
username or whatever and well by looking
in here I can tell that from username is
the full name and from user is actually
the shortened version so now without
ever going out of my debugger I can
start writing code in here which I've
already done but I can say okay I want
to put set the text to the username I
want to set you know a little
parenthesis with an @ sign and then the
that from there that's the user and I
want to set the image up here and all of
that is just populating this table that
I created at the bottom it's really
using field sets and labels which is
some html5 stuff but those are just have
their IDs on them and I just say here's
an 8-week user and your username and
there's my tweet user and the tweet text
and so forth so I'm just filling in
those properties using jQuery but
because of that debugger I was able to
set all that stuff up with live data
instead of just trying to guess on what
was going on so I'll turn that off we'll
just run it and we'll see that if I come
back over here hey thanks John there we
go it helps to have co-workers out in
the crowd somewhere thanks
buddy track me up yeah okay so there are
obviously there's a lot of different
ways that we can pull this data in
there's a lot of different things we can
do one of the things also let's go in
data data where am I out here let's add
one other thing you see and so what I
said that within the the JavaScript
editor now we have jQuery and we have
this intelligent ability so if I type in
dollar sign and hit control space it's
just going to give me some parens but if
I do control space again it knows that
I've started a jQuery call and it's
going to give me a list should go mine
oh you demo God's finally died
imagine if you will hmm
I don't know why it's not doing that
let's try it with jQuery itself
no it's not gonna do it for us okay so
obviously that intern sucked so you
didn't help us out much when we a
sacrificed him earlier today what would
have happened is as I go in to and and
do my code completion it would pop up
and it will give me a list of all of the
available IDs coming out of out of the
the different divs and so that's what
it's supposed to look like on the first
try and I can go in and set so I'm going
to choose say the animation ID and I can
put dot and D and the control space and
it says okay well these are all jQuery
well okay so now we're into shaker thank
you and it actually gives me I'm gonna
try and do a double click on this
particular thing and it gives me all of
the jQuery again the context the the
different documentation and so forth
that we can mess around with it gives us
the version that this came from and so
forth so I'm just gonna add a double
click in there and I'll just write up a
quick function mmm there's my keyboard
and we'll throw in just a quick alert
okay so really just quick stuff adding
into double-click on to this little
purple thing that we have out here the
little animation so again I save it
refreshes on the page now my little
animation that used to do just regular
animation now if I double click on it it
brings up and says hello so you can help
you a little bit with the jQuery
especially if the code completion works
but it allows you to kind of work with
not only JavaScript but with the jQuery
as well and you can work a little bit
faster in those areas
one other thing so these is again as I
was saying you can get the data in a
bunch of different ways and this
obviously is just some really basic one
type calls out of Twitter or whatever
one of the things that we've added in
easel as well is this ability within a
new file you can create what we call a
restful JavaScript client now this will
work off of a rest service that you have
the source code to so in this particular
case in the IDE I actually have a
project called rest demo so I have the
sources to this rest service and what
this little wizard will do for us is
come back up it will ask me where I want
to add my JavaScript file to and I'm
gonna browse over to that and say that I
want to put it in with all the other
JavaScript files and then it's going to
ask me for my rest project and I can
just say well ok I have this rest
project and it will look inside of that
rest project and find the services that
are being provided which in this case is
my manufacturers and I have a choice of
either going with no UI or going with a
table sword or UI which is just this
really basic table that sorts and so
forth and we're gonna generate an MVC
backbone based MVC infrastructure for
you based off of your restful project so
I will click Next it wants to know where
to put my HTML because I'm asking it to
generate the UI
so I'll just put that in the normal
place and we'll let that run through and
it'll go out it generates the model it
generates the view because I asked it to
it generates some templates and it opens
up my JavaScript file because this is
really where I'm going to be working on
it so here's here's all my my model
views or my model environment and and
where it's being extended you come on
down in here a little further and it
talks about an extending view and if I
go over to my project itself
I'll see now that it added this new HTML
and down deep in here it started adding
in a bunch of templates and these are
just the templates that will get placed
in here's my you know address and and so
forth so if I run this another thing
that's built in so one of the things
that's built in to this is this thing
called a browser log which is just that
it's that Air Bryce that the console
that you use or you're used to seeing if
you're in browser tools so in this
particular case this template that was
built and again welcome to beta this
wizard that was generated with actually
was pulling some CSS off of some guy's
github repository well it turns out when
I went and looked at it that a couple
days ago he renamed all of his CSS files
in his repository so our wizard is
broken so I mean it tells us though that
the data worked it all shows up and it
just looks like heck so let's fix it I
mean we know where the air is we know
what's going on I did find this about an
hour and a half ago and I was just kind
of running through things so I'm gonna
go ahead and open this up and I have the
real line now and I'll just grab that
really quick and we will shoot back over
to our you know we're in our HTML so up
here at the top we can see the
where's yeah they're just blue so we're
just gonna change that out really quick
save it run it and it still looks like
heck until they go out large yeah still
looks like it mm-hmm
yeah I'm gonna look at my browser log
see what's going on did I not save what
did I do
no well and we know it's broken I'll
figure it out later but as I as I can
show you here at least that even though
it's not styled right and I could take
the time to go style it it now has
basically a crud app and if I click on
any of these it does fill in the you
know all the data here and I can delete
that I can actually create new so what
we've what that wizard does is if you
have the source code at least it sets up
an MVC framework again it's based off a
backbone for now we've had questions
about angular and those types of other
libraries out there there's lots of
different areas we can do with that but
this is where we are for right now so
that's about as far as I was going to go
on actually demoing this stuff because
I'm imagining that there are a lot of
questions about what we've done in here
and I definitely wanted to save as much
time as I could for some questions so if
you want to I'll repeat the questions so
that everybody can hear them but I'll do
my best to hear them as you yell them
out at me won't we or show of hands give
me a question out there Yeah right
so the quit he noticed at the beginning
that I started a new html5 project and
he's asking if you have to be in that
project in order for these features to
be available the answer is yes currently
that's where we're at you know in all
honesty as I said at the very beginning
we wrote this this is something that's
maturing there's there's a lot of
evolution going on and where you want to
be and we felt we needed to start
somewhere so that's where we started
obviously you know CSS styling is great
in a JSF file a PHP file or wherever
there's a lot of different capabilities
that we want to see that go into and
while that will not show up in version 1
which we hope to release here in the
next week or so that definitely is
something we're looking down the road to
try and implement is make this available
work I say NetBeans within the three
eyed e's of Oracle's world that means is
what we experiment and try meaning it's
stable and you can use it and everything
else but new features and new concepts
and new ideas this is where we get to
put them and so that's where we're
starting with and and hopefully yeah
we'll get all of this available into
other areas that will make more sense or
make as much sense if not more another
question really I shocked you on yes
that's a really good question so the
breakpoints in the in the JavaScript
they pause the browser so does the
browser ever timeout do you ever hit the
timeout in the browser no why should it
he wrote it okay not really like it can
timeout in a situation for example when
you unit testing and some unit test
engine have did sort of fall back like
if you're a unit test should deadlock
so after sending time it would timeout
so in that case we you need to sort of
prevent it or increase the time out on
the JUnit testing agent but no there's
no reason the burrows are just sits
there and waits as long as yeah I've
never had it timeout while I was writing
all this stuff and I I've played around
with it quite a bit it's the same case
like MIT Bros the tools really browser
tools would never timeout either it's
just different UI for the browser tools
yeah question in the back oh yeah yeah
yeah yeah if you broke that it would
time out like a normal browser would
yeah
yeah you got the response or you didn't
yeah after you kick it out but yeah you
gotta remember that the debugging that
we've implemented is actually using
remote WebKit debugging I mean it's
actually getting the information right
from Chrome and it's it's there they're
interconnected we're just we've wrapped
around a nice a nice you know UI on top
of what they're giving us so that's
we're actually pausing them and getting
the data from them there was another
question right in here yeah so David
actually talked a little bit about unit
testing this morning in his talk but
yeah we have we have integration with
jstestdriver which is there which is the
like an engine to run your unit test
javascript unit test and then yeah you
it's basically it's not very different
from Java you just ride your JavaScript
unit test and ID is able to run them for
you how J's test driver works is that
it's a server which is which is a which
using existing browsers as slaves and
delegates the JavaScript code to the
browsers browsers run the JavaScript
send the response back and the ID
presents it because you
usually if you have your JavaScript
application you would want to be able to
run it in an earlier browsers in
different browsers and the same thing
works that that just this driver server
can run on this box but if if that one
would be like a window station then we
can we can have like that we can have
slaves on different different operating
systems another question over here I'm
gonna go over there real quick yeah well
it's it's all yeah I mean as much as
anybody you could deploy html5 CSS and
JavaScript into anything yeah and this
is just code sitting on the file system
so it's not it's not packaged into a war
or anything like that you'd have to do
all that yourself I mean this is this is
truly client HTML coding it's not gonna
there isn't any deploy and deploy it to
you know GlassFish or web logic or
something like that no but you could oh
I'm sorry the question was once you have
this HTML project instead of that can
you deploy it out to any app server
you know WebLogic JBoss any of the ones
that are out there GlassFish make sure
you get all of ours listed in there as
well so yeah I mean you can but it's
client-side code so there's no there's
nothing stops you today for money in
that stuff in a war or something yeah
another testing question all right
okay yeah so the question is how much
mileage do you get out of none you know
like the non integrated browsers like
Firefox or ie or whatever
Oh non html5 supported so you know
that's it's interesting because there's
very little the only thing that's html5
in this entire demo is drag and drop
there and that's actually using the on
dragging on drop methods of html5
because it's in and so in that regard
all of this other than that drag and
drop runs on any any browser it's the
CSS that starts to mess you up and
that's why I showed that in the in they
the little help pop-up that you can see
which browsers support what and it's
still iffy I mean there's I didn't have
it running in here but if you like if
you take a look at if you take a look at
this about page really quick this part
here so there's a shadow around the
outside of that so that's called a box
shadow and actually even the border
radius is it was really fascinating cuz
I started writing this app a couple of
weeks ago and and my Chrome browser
updated in the middle or maybe it's
three weeks ago but man Chrome browser
updated in the middle of when I started
to when I ended well when I started this
box shadow didn't work in chrome I had
to put - WebKit - box - shadow in order
to make it work here well all of a
sudden the other day I forgot to put
WebKit and the dang thing worked you
know and it's because the browser
updated and now they support it it's so
it is tricky in certain areas and you've
got I mean that's part of being a
designer or a part of working in this
world as things are emerging and there
isn't a set standard yet that things
will adjust we're trying to keep those
those tooltips and those help panels
updated as much as possible but it you
know this is wild wild west and you're
just shooting from the hip in a lot of
cases yeah
so that's another feature that we're
hoping to see in v2 all of our usability
studies and focus groups are asking for
that exact same thing the question was
can this or is this thing is there a way
to test it to see if it's compatible
with other browsers and so forth and no
not today we would love to be able to
build right into the editor as you start
to code that that you know so it would
come up with a tool you know an air or
something or a warning saying you know
in your project properties you set that
this is my target is ie or my target is
you know Chrome or something and if it
doesn't fall within your target it airs
out on it on some sort of an analyzer
you know or analysis types our audit
audit tools but no that's not in there
today you would still have to do that
testing on your own there are tools out
there that do that testing correct it
does so he's talking about that when I
was doing code completion there were
little browser icons at the top that's
what I mentioned there was that was in
the CSS portion of it and yes that's
what we're trying to keep is up-to-date
as possible is that when you're typing
something in in CSS because that's the
most fragile area right now we you will
see if it's grayed out that what you're
typing if that if your browser of choice
is grayed out find something different
because it's not gonna work yeah I mean
those are pretty much the majority
you've got Firefox Chrome Safari Opera
oh and often yeah IE oh don't let us all
forget IE sorry yeah so I mean those are
pretty much industry standards and if
you go anywhere else I mean I you know
my personal one I'm using a couple of
social browsers that are but they're all
based off of chrome you know so they're
most of them are derivatives of that
somewhere in there now if you're using
you said a Netscape Browser
I feel for you if you're still using
that skate browser but yeah I don't we
won't add those in we're gonna stay with
you know just those those up there and
you'll have to know where your
compatibilities are in those areas yeah
any questions back in the back before
these go back there I'll come back to
you yes
yeah so for existing projects PHP JSP
and here anybody say ASP or asp.net
sorry but yeah you need those yeah
you're kind of out of luck for right now
but you could still I mean in by the way
so if you have is somebody you know how
many of us by show of hands how many
your consultants out here actually do
consult more so quite a few of you right
and you walk into that job and someone
goes through I need html5 I don't know
what it is but I need it so you know
you're gonna you've got this job of
knowledge you got the IDE you've got all
this stuff that you want to work with
but now you've got to put it into html5
well okay if they give you some
templates or something you notice that
below that you could actually start a
new html5 project from source and and
you could stick your CSS and your
JavaScript in there and just look and
you point to that directory and we'll
put it all together for you in a project
and you could work with it and we're not
doing anything magic I mean we're not
taking files and separating them and
doing a bunch of weird templates it's
straight JavaScript and CSS so when
you're done take your CSS and move it
back into your your PHP project or
wherever you need it to be in a way you
go I mean we really do want to make this
stuff go and work in other projects
we're not you know ignorant you know
ignorant or or you know pie-in-the-sky
type of thing is saying hey you're all
Java programmers come to the world of
JavaScript and client Hey no we just
know that this is where we needed to
start and eventually we'll get it all
back to where it gets used the most and
where it gets used the most still hasn't
been defined yet there's still a lot of
people that are really really happy to
see this stuff in client-side the way it
is
so right to a right job right just grab
another tool and put it in the belt
question up here
is it tied to the NetBeans IDE yes in
what no you can't use it in rad or any
like no it is it is it is NetBeans
believe it we're actually looking so
again I mentioned all the IDE s that
Oracle supports right from from eclipse
with o p2j developer to NetBeans I
happen to be sorry I happen to be the
product manager for easel but I'm also
the product manager for the core of
JDeveloper so you know the editor of the
compiler and all the menu in systems of
JDeveloper or mine as well this will go
to J developer and from JDeveloper it
will show up probably in OPI I don't
know for a fact but that may very well
where it goes it definitely will go to
jail Jayda but we're already working on
that but whether or not it shows up in
OPI over in eclipse i don't know that
but we definitely are sharing a lot of
things between our IDE s and this is one
that we're working very heavily with
yeah
Wow yeah so the question is in another
talk she heard that in order to use
JavaFX into one of these you have to
have some sort of a plugin and and
working there I don't know the answer to
that to be perfectly honest with you I
imagine that the answer that was given
is simply with any web-based
HTML type of you can put a JavaFX you
know everybody will shudder when I say
this but an applet into a web page and
it will run your JavaFX ok well I'm not
familiar enough with JavaFX to be honest
with you I I don't know but if that if
there's a way to do that we'll be
figuring it out pretty quick I know you
know within the IDE I didn't show it
within the IDE and oh I got like 5
minutes so I can change my target to
this embedded web kit here and if I run
it so what we did was for those that
don't have multiple monitors and the
ability to run you know side by side
Wars this is a Java FX enabled this is a
webview so this is WebKit running in an
internal browser and everything that I
showed you over here you can do in this
as well so all of the you know click on
something in it and it highlights in the
file and so forth so all of that
interactivity that we show before the
you know the ability to choose a tablets
size or a smartphone it'll it'll resize
into what we want it to to look like and
so forth and it it uses the restful
interfaces and all that stuff so so
that's all available internally as well
that happens to be using JavaFX that's
using java fixes webview so if you ever
look at their browser component that
you'll see in the FX samples that's what
we put in here into into the IDE and it
doesn't answer your question about
putting Java effects into a web page
which I don't know the answer to I'm
sorry
any other questions I got one more there
yes
you know unfortunately not yeah we
really rely on whatever is available in
public CDMS
and I think that information as far as I
know is not there in the city and in
Google CDN or cDNAs so it makes would be
nice it makes lots of sense to me
because lots of libraries has lots of
dependencies but in this era we just
rely on what other people doing we yeah
we're just trying to yeah make it
available a tidy but this information is
not in CDN so we don't realize yeah okay
so I am going to so legal read quickly
thank you and done okay so how you learn
more well other presentations again it's
the idea is get the data over to this so
that you can style it and mess with it
and so are so learn about rest will
learn about WebSockets learn about SSD
or server sent events those types of
things so that you can get that data out
to your front ends and then from your
client side you can mess around and see
what you can do with it on the styling
side and make it all pretty NetBeans 7-3
beta this is where this will exist you
can actually download it today if you go
and get the dev builds it's there and
and then on the NetBeans org site we
have a mailing list and also the forum
there's a forum called web client users
and we will be actively answering and
interacting with whomever posts up
questions when I checked this morning
there was one spam question nothing else
so hopefully others will put in more
questions for us so thank you very much
for attending I really appreciate you
coming out and I hope you find the
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
