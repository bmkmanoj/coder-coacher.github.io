presentation so today I'm going to talk
on how we can write web-based code HTML
Javascript and CSS and create
platform-agnostic hybrid applications
essentially write your code once and
deploy it as a single web page
application a mobile app supporting
Windows Android and iOS and even taking
that code and creating a desktop based
application for Mac Linux and Windows so
if you guys and so a little bit about me
at 17 years experience with product
development and user experience as well
as working on innovative new ideas and
solutions
you're finally presenting our Oracle
OpenWorld and the Aug vents in the US
and amir the general topics are around
responsive and adaptive design
innovation of how to hook up to new
gadgets like beacons chat BOTS goo
glasses and even Microsoft Kinect I also
specialize around mobile design and
innovation with integration of Cordova
based applications on the cloud I work
for fishbowl solutions headquartered in
Minneapolis and I work out of the UK
office working on innovation and product
development for the Oracle cloud
I'm also an Oracle ace so come and check
out my blog posts and articles on the
corporate blog over at fishbowl
solutions com
so today I'm going to present a few
slides on technology used to create
platform-agnostic
applications and then jump right into a
live demo well write a single web page
based application that I'll put from a
web page to a desktop app and then
finally to a mobile device and show you
how easy is to write your code once and
deploy to be separate platforms so
fictional solutions we also have
software services and support for
article Google mindbreeze
and PTC horrible cloud we primarily
focus on past with content experience
portal and mobile cloud service
providing integration layers to SAS and
providing that value layer that
customers today demand providing a
branded user experience as a service
essentially pass obsess on the Google
side we offer cloud support and
migration for the Google Search
Appliance
and at minder ease we offer connectives
for web Center for indexing content on
Prem
and then finally service offerings for
PTC windchill
so why develop platform agnostic hybrid
applications a lot of you that are
watching this for web developers and
hybrid development has come a long long
way in the past five years enabling us
now not only to create web based
applications but providing web and app
developers to reuse web based skills to
create highly performant desktop and
mobile applications using the frameworks
and technologies we love like angular
react jQuery bjs and oracle jet saving
us time and money to build key core
applications that can be hooked up to
the cloud right so what are we going to
build okay so over the last six months
I've been working with a team of
fishbowl to create Atlas are intelligent
chat BOTS essentially our personal
assistant on the cloud for self-service
&amp;amp; Veatch lecture delivery
created with Oracle HCM and Oracle
document cloud now we hook them up to
slack Facebook and also Alexa but we
don't currently have is a separate
library where we can deploy into a
web-based interface that will run
standalone on a mobile app or as a
standalone desktop application or even a
website or internet so what I'm hoping
we can achieve in the demo today is to
create that interface where we can
interact with Atlas outside of Facebook
and the like then Alexa and slack right
so what tools am I going to use so to
make things really easy for us I'm going
to use Oracle jet as it provides a great
set of grunt and yeoman scripts for
building single page application and
mobile apps on top of Cordova and I'm
going to use electron to build my
desktop apps now all of this will
require no GS and NPM package management
and also to make things easy instead of
typing a specific JavaScript framework
like angular or react I'm just going to
use jQuery and show some of the cool
features of Oracle's Java extension
toolkit
I finally require das is going to be my
base as my JavaScript module loader to
import any libraries or additional
components that I need okay so just a
quick overview on jet as I'm going to be
using it to build out my mobile and
web-based application framework so
Oracle jet javascript extension toolkit
is an open source set of JavaScript
tools that provide a modular front-end
framework on top of tried-and-tested
javascript libraries
so although described as a toolkit for
me it's more of a framework built on top
of a set of popular open-source
libraries like jQuery and it's flexible
doesn't force you into one direction of
coding style will actually have with
react and angular and you can pull it in
an Instagram with other popular
open-source libraries very very easily
now one thing that we really love about
yet is its suite of interactive reusable
components and make developing web apps
and applications very very fast
similar to bootstrap or semantic UI but
for me a lot more powerful with a very
clean user interface and ability to
customize and create dynamic themes
quickly and easily now here our self
core libraries that are used behind the
scenes with jet so we've got Jack jQuery
and we all know jQuery right and they
also have jQuery UI and I feel that that
is no longer used and they've actually
removed jQuery UI cuz very heavily and
bloated which is great and I'm just
keeping on this slide as I know it was
used in version 2 of the jet release but
I haven't seen any use of it in version
3 so it still might be out there but
with the components that I'm developing
and using and I haven't seen it then
we've got knockout for the blinding
layer between the data and view and then
require Jeff as our motive leader to
bring in only the components that are
required for our application keeping it
lightweight and then finally hammer for
adding touching securities eventing
right so if you've not used a required
dress
it's my JavaScript module later if you
right now Jas you'll be familiar with
using require to employ your JavaScript
libraries
I'll give you a quick crash course
during our demo as I'll use it to load
in required modules such as my Atlas
chatbot library they interacts with the
cloud okay so as this is a live demo
expect things to go wrong almost always
it's a typo but please bear meat with me
here
I'm sure I'll be able to fix it and will
be able to create a really cool
interactive UI where that this so let's
go ahead and actually get into the guts
and start building our apps right okay
let's get started so I'm looking at this
screen I've currently got my chatbot
library in my code and source all over
on this side here I'm looking at this
side here I'm just looking at my notes
or reference on to the steps that keep
track of the flow and all my development
what you're going to see is right in
front of me okay so let's just jump in
and get started so I'm just going to
straight into the Oracle code online
folder that I've created and what we'll
do is we will create three separate
folders will create one for single page
web application and another one for
desktop based app and then finally we'll
create a more folder for our mobile apps
so let's go into the web and what we'll
do is we'll create an Oracle jet single
page application from the ground up okay
here we go so I've got the jet page
already up and running
so you can go to your catalog or Oracle
jet org alternatively if you search an
Oracle you can go straight to the get
started page so all we need to do and to
get up and running is I am just going to
start off
come on top and
just mode you don't need to run it in
admin mode
it's just I'm running yet because when I
reach the desktop part of this demo I
know that I need when I need to package
them I need some admin curvatures but
for the rest of this you don't need any
ads and privileges okay so let's go into
this folder and running there we go it's
always the last one okay so what we'll
do is we'll just CD into that directory
going to our web area now we'll run
through this quick guide that article
have provided so first of all I'm going
to go ahead and set up my grunt to do
too and please note you don't know about
grunt I just go to the cross - and grant
here it's the better JavaScript task
runner yeah soul automatically if I have
a set of tasks in a script it'll just
lost not any process plays one after the
other it's really useful okay so there
you can see things are happening and in
sound check that done okay now we'll set
up Oracle jet generator which will say
opti oh man and other funds and fancy
scripts so looks right enter for those
who don't know what ye o man is if we
just go into euro man site here we go
it's basically a scaffolding tool so
it'll go ahead create folder structure
these files into different areas set up
up dependencies with NPM etc etc okay so
let's see yep that's created okay so now
what we need to do is I'm going to
create a chapel exercise right so let's
going to here we will go out so
running to your man for the Aquajet
project and we are going to create a
single page application and I'm just
going to call it Chapel from now ten
floats this is one of the default
templates can help you're right they've
got the set but for now I'm just going
to use the the basic template okay so
I'd run this now what's going to happen
it's going to use yo man set up the
scaffolding self folders at the scripts
and everything there we go
processing templates doing the npm
install so I don't have to do it which
is great takes a little bit of time
Oh whilst that's doing its thing let's
just go across to over to here so and if
you don't I get an ID mended you follow
him especially if you're doing Oracle
jet he has loads and loads of useful
resources as phenomenal blog posts and
presentations and here's one of the blog
posts which he wrote into the gift is it
defines what templates you've got
available and the structure that yeoman
actually creates behind the scenes so
you see it's a blank template basic the
navbar after etc so I am just using the
base one better Kwan I could use blank
but I want to do to show you some of the
features of our content
okay so let's just check great I've
created so now if I go into application
which is our chat box holder and I'm
just gonna look in there right so what
you can see here is this is the what
it's actually pulled together and
created and we've got a source folder
here now that's where you can do all
your development work and that what I'd
like to do first is just do an initial
build all right so that's going to take
that source and everything compile it
and it's going to create a build
directory which I think it calls web
we'll see in a minute copying some files
across
there we go that's done so I just do the
directory game although it's also
created that themes folder so it seems
and web so when is essentially your
output where it'll generate your source
so the next thing I want to use is grunt
serve right so let's start up our web
server and everything else
oh okay we will get you concert there we
go seventeen point thousand using the
altar theme using thousand three of jet
building the app and copying those files
across from the source file into the web
location okay put the BAM there we go
and it's automatically starting up my
jet project now this is just the basic
one here you can see this is a using the
senate oracle template and i can click
on some components and you see this
functions here if i really minimize down
you'll see it's also responsive so all
these components that oracle is created
with jet I may respond to click on that
and just you'll see those tools appear
down here and as I expand down in
towards manually up here so I can
support my part again if I go to the
mobile view just like this
and click on there you'll see that's
what happens okay so what I'm going to
do now is I want to create my interface
for Atlas so what we're going to do is
we're going to go to that source folder
so chatbot and source and we'll edit the
HTML file and I'm using atom here for my
editor right now what I don't need I
don't need all this comments on that we
will set the title here to Atlas for the
Shepherd again it's using the altar
theme and other things if I use the the
components that you provide and you can
see this is a structure for the basic
template yeah but what I'm going to do
is I'm going to rip out all of this
because I don't really need that and
I'll keep the body there and we'll just
clean up some of this code that had it
tagging
click and you see down the bottom here
I've got a crow Jas this is my module
loader and within main jf and I've got
my required s configuration and I'll go
into that in a minute
and if I just see if I just back here so
you can see I've got this basic template
here now if I press save within a 10 and
you should see is it'll automatically
refresh and obviously I deleted
everything there's no content but if I
go at the ends are certain tests you'll
see it look slightly updated on the fly
so they only need to refresh the browser
to take those changes table browser
tools mainly update using run surf and
if I open up the component here you'll
see that and I've got page reload
resuming once so anytime I do an
interaction hit save and they'll
automatically reload this page which is
really good because I can develop sooo
fast right okay so let's go on now I
once what I'd like to do is because I'm
doing chat I need to have an inter or
text area field on the page so what I've
done here is and we've got our input
field and this is where I'm gonna types
of messages and then above that this is
where I want my message is to go into
into this chapter chat area so I'm also
just delete this bit we're going to here
and we'll go into the applications you
can see if I my standard input I type
nothing's going to happen
and Kate because I've removed that jet
component completes just standard input
being skinned with it all to the UI
there so what I'm going to do now is if
I go to back to the code right what I
want to do is set an event on this so so
jQuery let's just use the Uncle Jack to
do it and I'm not going to instead of
defining it on the Dom I'm going to do
the other way now which is is get
JavaScript apply it ultimately to the to
the Dom on the fly so what I need is and
then a copy this actually make an easier
okay so I'm targeting the ID of the
input called listening spaced it with CB
here
Java Message input so you'll see on the
HTML
I've got chat bot message input right
and what I've got there is I've just
said specify the an object value called
option change so anytime I interact with
that message input it's going to put the
push the event across into this function
and any specific UI interactions into
there as well so I'm setting a standard
in which so defining when you do a key
press which key you depressing and 13 is
the spamming press Enter so if the user
presses das key then what's going to
happen is it's going to pull out the UI
value so the value that's being assigned
to this input and it's going to add a
message onto that and so I haven't
defined this method yet so why don't I
just go ahead and define add message
here okay so now it's going to pass this
across and I will call it some text or
the other you want bullet and we'll just
just if I just left now it's being
initialized
and let's just output the value so we
know what's being passed across so now I
go back to here I don't need to refresh
should just be able to hit test hit
enter and you can see it ordinary
initializing that method call and
passing value of test across great so
what we need to do to get that text
actually appear within the message area
above it so let's add that functionality
now so what I'm going to do is you can
see here I'm targeting the message
window above it and I'm going to append
the strata with a message inside and I'm
just going to copy this method out for
now I haven't created that yet so let's
just see what happens if I go back to
web page here we go and type in hello
world there we go great so let's try
something else
great its automatic being impended below
perfect and we'll still get that appear
that then I want to give that clear down
and I also want to sell out the styling
on this so let's create another effort
and when we'll call it let's tie this
thing up there
Colet message box and it's just like
function and we're passing across the
text to is message bar and again what we
want to do is let's just say so that we
notice this methods being initialized so
we want a message Atlas on chat bot okay
so what I'm going to have that is first
of all I want to clear out Barry
so let's just get that value cleared out
so target the input field and as one of
the options I'm just resetting the value
to blank and I also want to do is I want
it to automatic eight if you imagine
you've got scroll by and stuff and as
you pan to school bus over the top I
want it to actually scroll down as you
messaging and we'll do that in a minute
but let's let's just give this a quick
test run go back here okay great so you
can see it's automatically clearing that
so I can give test one whatever and
you'll see it automatically added great
now what I want to do is let's bring the
UI of the scratch right so I've created
a set of style which I'm just going to
cooking paste make things easy because
this isn't a CSS course this is a crash
course in
platform agnostic applications so let me
just done my Styles into here let's get
back and immediately you can see UI has
been transformed so the reason my font
I'll come you back but you can see we've
got the chat window here we've got the
ability our input field here so hello
and you can see the message is coming
and just have a quick let's see why do
sponsored invited
okay
let's just try let's just reset of this
Oh
okay
feeding on time
Oh let's go copy okay really
hello
oh it's sick look at a known location
here let's go back and let's just have a
quick look at oh there it is I can see
you know you ever write a success let me
just copy across the images and fonts
and all the fun stuff
there we go and it's refreshing you see
I funk to clear it up and let's just a
message hello and you can see hello
disappearing up of that
and then you just check oh quit then you
just copy after images okay there you go
 better everything's working no
errors initializing I type in the
message hello you can see there we go
I'll just starve it to add an image that
of as a person I'm typing okay so next
it's going down to here and what I'd
like to do is let's just add a loading
thing because as you see when i refresh
we have this horrible sticker
interaction so I'm just going to a
loading screen in there and we'll just
loading this into here right now let's
go back to our app and you see you've
got this loading animation once it's
done loading mid loading things from
here so it's just going to keep loading
there so let's go to your controller and
what I want to do is get rid of that
loading class okay so and this will do
it so we'll just add this into here so
what I'm doing is I'm targeting the
global body which is this and I'm just
going to move that class which you
automatically hide that loader and then
I've got a few other fancy things we're
adding a message button
and needling scroll ahead so these two
things are being used but let me just
say this down and showing you so in
theory there we go
animation finishes and we call this
clean transition we just refresh the
game perfect now let's add a header to
describe what the app does and I also
want to do to make it easier for mobile
is I'm just going to add a button here
on the right and side so let's skip it
in code and that's okay so let's add the
button first so there we go so we having
a message button and what I'd also like
to do is as part of this chat message
window and it's going to replace that
I'd like a header just describing the
application so we're going to have this
header saying welcome to at listen just
say go ahead and ask me any questions
and let's just refresh to see everything
working
Lana Mason loading clear transition
button appears headaches rolls down and
we can see our Atlas spot up here in top
left so let's start typing this test two
three four five six so one thing that's
now happening is I'm not scrolling pages
and scrolling down so let's get that up
and running quickly and clean that clean
up so let's scroll down so you see the
map where we turn to mess about with
emptying out of that and so what I'd
like to do is
this water tastes cone here okay so what
we've got here is we've got the ability
to automatic scroll down so using other
jQuery code taught in an area push the
pace down and then what I've done here
is added to a slight delay to make the
chat boxing more interesting sort of
it'd be an ordinary message straight
away it's just a little bit of delay
show a loading screen to say that he's
thinking about the message and
interacting and then he's also got a
little bit that will move the page down
so he'll their missions great down a bit
so hey Alice and you can see we've got
this Atlas response now with a loading
animation now actually nothing can
happen buying syncs well not any getting
messages throughout this yes so let's
get that up and running
okay so what I'd like to do is I want to
send this message to Atlas and I just
created a simple library that's the main
space we've got this Atlas library and
when we have send a message and I pass
that message across and actually call
this text there we go
right so now what I need to do is
include a library
so let's include a chapel memory and
we'll go down here
twelve and now one thing I need to do is
I just got an initialization method so
let's just put that in here so we can
initialize our chat bot and its global
methods and set up a connection to the
cloud okay then what else do I want to
do oh yeah
so one of the other things I want to do
is I want to add a balance I want to say
with a blue going that pops up in the
right is quickly going create an
ascended events thing here okay tell
events right so let's put this in here
so so essentially when this thing
initializes and energy loads another set
an event so that the Bolling you see on
screen has a click event just sanity
query here and and it's going to watch
value to the value and as long as
there's text there's not now empty then
it's going to send that value across to
the add message and it's going to use
that same Slovo we saw earlier yes so
what's that mean Eric Sharpe I'll need
to buy it up control on six eight
let me so one thing that's happening
here is I haven't pulled across my
chatot script so let's do that
right so let's go into here and then in
chat box or transcript and this topic
I'm in there so now this will initialize
and then that should be set as long as
that is pushed great so that is
initializing everything's happening that
I would expect happen
and now let's ask out this question
let's see if this works
so hello you atlas oh we got a response
great how are you good
so we're talking to the cloud now and
it's coming back as a response and our
interface is ready so you can see this
is how we're going to have mobile view
or desktop app or even a browser app all
there ready to go
and let's just let's just well that's it
so that's a code ready as a single page
application now let's go to the next
step and let's create the the e when I
go create next let's create a disk on
that so we'll take this code and quickly
create that desktop app so let's go back
in here let's go into desktop folder you
see it's all empty and we will close
this and plant and I'm CD into this
desktop folders too sexy at the moment
right so if we go into the electron
build his electron
and what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to clone out an existing starter
we click that was quick and you see it's
already putting the lecture in quick
starts let's just CD into that and see
that's it's skeptically scaffoldings all
set up we're just going to install the
dependencies and then start application
okay so let's just do the NPM install
and so this electron app and we'll
create our desktop apps for the next
back windows just do an install now one
point six point eight
come on taking this time so again yes
and here's our sample application so
this is the electron QuickStart just
here okay so let's go into that folder
thank you on QuickStart and you can see
I've got this mangy ass so let's edit
this one open with atom and so this is a
running no GS kind of a hybrid model but
what I want to do is let's get our dev
tools open so now when I run this just
under snow what you should see because
electronic is running within chromium
I can have my standard web tools are
going to debug and see what issues
what's going on behind the scenes but
it's all working so what are we going to
do is we are going to take the code that
we wrote for a single page application
so if I go to web tap up I'll take all
of this
into desktop I can click start and we
will just paste it into here
okay let's replace the file okay now one
of the things I want to do is I want to
set the width and height of the
application application I thought I had
this
it's happening
come out and see
okay here here and what I want to do
quickly and it is so I quickly copying
graph what I had here because what I
want to do is I don't want to I don't
want no to initiate because I'm not
using any know libraries behind things
so what I'm going to do and what reason
I'm going to disable it is because it it
and conflicts of required yes and I see
you've set up some other settings so
and we can replace water right here here
it is so if what I just need to be here
on this main window let's set the width
and height 360 and then what I wanted to
do is actually disable that node
integration and what I also want to do
here also this prototype is I just want
to make sure that and you see the hello
world app I can I get rid of this mini
but I'm using it for this chap up okay
that looks cool it's geared let's and
try it I had yep oops
and on that want and NPM there we go so
you see our lighting screen and that's
it we've got our desktop app or not so
let's just message Atlas hey Alice oh
you having trouble on the sink wishing
season hello oh there we go
I checked so Atlas is they're up and
running
find me a file and you see integrated
doc clouds so what's the name of dr. min
you're searching for good and you see
it's automatic scrolling down page okay
so that's our let's go back now what I
want to do next is I want to actually
build this out as an application and
good at the moment it's just cell
libraries and after an it from empty and
so on create an exe essentially when
they so let's close up that and we can
obviously get rid of our dev tools that
I need those open and what I want to do
is
I will use an electron package manager
service public can package manager let's
go back looking I'm prompt and will to
quickly paste that here so I'm call the
electron package manager then install
the source directory is my current
folder the app name let's call it
chopped up that's what it is and the
platform once test by all so I want to
generate the next Windows and Mac okay
hopefully so now package all of what was
created and create an exe for us on this
line and now we can see that within the
foulness I didn't want this
okay let's go back into here and I we
like an electron it's just building
those apps there some of that does its
thing what we will be looking at next is
Cordova so creating a mobile app and
with a Cordova framework which is now
part of Apache open-source skin there so
one of the builds so just packaging the
app for Linux is really it's a lot
faster than this although yet so it's
done Darwin and on Linux and I went out
doing the Sierra and Mac there we go
that's too little bit better
and now one should do when they shortly
see Sierra de 13 for Windows
so what can I do so why don't we assess
packaging and dearest thing let's hope
it's done perfect so if I'm going to
chat here you can see that the XE so if
I double click that exe got our loading
screen boom comes up nicely now we've
got our desktop app you can even
maximize if you wanted to minimize
whatever hey Alice let's see if they'll
respond this time to egg well
something's gone on that so well so this
one is wonderful good so desktop app
does now let's go on to mobile I want to
do is go to the little area okay mobile
it is and what we want to do there is
we'll go back to article checked and see
someone our scripts so let's go and do
install could do called over this okay
so think global and still have installed
it already but let's just do install
their game to show the process
once that's installed what we're going
to do is we're going to run here mail
I'm going to create a hybrid application
and putting project name is chat bot and
then I'm going to target Android just
check and see if my son's here I have
any cables okay alright I guess so what
I will do now is go back to here still
installed in Cordoba but essentially we
will build up a framework using year man
and then just copy and paste the code we
created with a web-based application and
dump it in so let's build it so you can
see here a man on create a hybrid
application say we called zip chapel
template again using that basic template
I could use blank or whatever and then
I'm just going to say the platform's
Android you can choose iOS or Windows if
you wanted to all offer it so there we
go
you man targeting Android yep and a
templates basic screen equals a project
syllables capable link and everything
for Android in the meantime order I just
copy the source
okay you can see that soul being built
eat are seeing under 25 okay
and what I'm going to do after I've done
this I'm just going to build it just
using the same commands at the top gun
bills concert well and now I'm bill we
finished right so they don't hang up
there let's see a grunt serve now and
now what should happen is this will and
set the application straight across to
my emulator so emulator is now loading
up user this is the hell of a stoner
once kind of so it might sound sexually
today I'm gonna blame the recording and
you can see Android they're loading up
and it's gone Nexus p.m. okay and it
should just allow me initialize
and so that is basic template you can
see in my mobile app now let's copy
across our code and we're going to the
mobile chat bot source let's just paste
it all into there so you'll play for a
little valve and solve that and it's
credible this person's closing that
emulator down and it's Matt let's just
run it again grunts ow oh the emulator
is just building up very now so you'll
see hopefully we'll have our chat bot
interface on a mobile device that we
developed without on a single page apps
as a web-based as an apk navigation
which you can put onto the Android
Marketplace and fingers crossed
got loading screen and we gather just so
this on how the spot let's say hello and
the enter and
there we go hard tag that can respond
but you can see these wonderful annoys
so here we have a command for us to
create a Jaffa Cajon using the basic
oracle jet template here we go yo Oracle
jet bring your project name and then
point to the template there's a number
of different templates you can use and
once your project has been created we
can then go into the project name
whatever you've called it so into the
folder and then we can type in grimes
build to build it out and then graham
serve where we can serve it out to the
web server and as we do this updates
you'll see those updates coming through
on the fly next they come for desktop
development so we just clone the give
repack so here we can see us cleaning
the electron quick starter app and we'll
CD into the repo and then what we lose
you will just use NPM to install that
and execute the desktop application all
we need to do then is move across the
code that we've created as a web base
code into our electron app and then just
package and build it so here's how we
compact it and build it so I'm using the
electron package up just makes things a
whole lot easier and and we just append
the all for packaging it and it'll go
ahead and package for Windows Linux and
Mac with is using sierra or the other
distribution and now there is a bug just
to be aware of here and if you do this
all command on Windows machine Madcaps
even though they're built and there's no
errors when you send them across to an
actual Mac or allow someone to download
and some zip
and they won't come so what do you have
the best thing to do is actually use an
election package manager you're
developing for a Mac you can run it on
Mac or Linux and you won't have any
problems and if you go to the git repo
electron package manager you'll see it's
a known bug that they're currently
working on but still it's been open for
a year or two now and they still haven't
fixed it okay so finally build and
deploy for mobile so with Oracle jet
what we can do is first of all install
the Cordova framework behind the scenes
so the NPN - Jeanne's phulka that
Cordova once that's downloaded all
libraries and everything and setup we
can use yeoman the Oracle jet provides
to create our hybrid application and we
can specify the project name just like I
did earlier with a chatbot and then we
can specify a platform so any targeted
Android but if you wanted you could also
target iOS and Windows and then we can
do GaN build and grunts s to build a
platform and so this up serve it up to
the mobile device that's it
so go forth and create those platform
agnostic JavaScript applications for web
mobile and desktop providing the cross
platform for Windows Linux Mac iOS
Android and Windows right so also here
are some key resources you should go and
check out I remember merrily around yet
because it's a really good set of tools
and scripts allow you to develop
applications really really fast it's not
marketed as well as I think it should be
so go check it out not forcing you to
use it but there's lots of useful
components interfaces to build
applications and then also go check out
Cordova for building your mobile apps
electron for your desktop apps then
finally if you want to reach out again
