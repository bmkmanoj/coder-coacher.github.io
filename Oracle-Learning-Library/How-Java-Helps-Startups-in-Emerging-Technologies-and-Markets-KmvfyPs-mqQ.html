global scale technologies I'm here with
the Henry chew vp of sales for global
scale and today we're going to talk
about Java and how it helps startups and
for the great enabler and emerging
technologies so this presentation we're
going to do a be a little more
interactive we'll have a little if you
have a smartphone there's little
interactive but and a demonstration of
actual case study so kind of briefly
summarize the last 10 years you know
we've seen a great advance you know the
embedded hardware and solution of
smaller and more powerful efficient CPUs
have brought technology and previously
out of reach from these you know to the
billions of people we see a big
advancements in the shooting no
telemedicine networking you've seen the
whole you know the whole gimmick but
we've been lacking in some ways in a
software you know having the right tools
and the right tool kits and development
kits and with the Java that's something
you believe we have here introduction
I'm sure you've all seen this before but
this is kind of like where the Java fits
in and the overall scheme of things and
kind of where we fit in in the Great
Pyramid here you have Jeff java apps in
this case study we'll talk hey we're
going over a company called proximus
mobility and how they developed their
application with the environment with
the osgi bundle on top of an open-source
operating system in this case Davion and
on top of a hardware platform which we
at global scale provide here is a kind
of example you know we have we are a
hardware provider I don't know if you
guys are at the keynote but we provide
certain small embedded devices and micro
computers and servers here's a couple
examples
the benefits of Java ecosystem with
you've all heard it before scalability
the largest numbers of concurrent users
and support and the great advantages
reduction development time and time to
market here a global scale we sell
hardware development kits and Henry will
kind of go over our overall business
model okay thanks everybody for coming
and Oracle for giving us the chance to
give this presentation the business
model in at global scale is we've always
been a hardware provider we partner with
semiconductor manufacturers and we
provide we do a reference design and
then we work with the software
developers so it's a three-way
partnership and we've always worked on
that basis our biggest emphasis is to
saw the hardware and to saw the hardware
we need to work with the system
providers so that's our business model
it's as simple as that we want to ship
hardware so we have to work with the
systems integrators the software
developers in order for them to create
an application and what we do is create
an appliance for them as simple as that
Penna okay within the hour hardware
offerings we have several we recently
started with the shiva plaque which was
the first one which was a marvel
processor and it has one ethernet one
USB SD card and jtag internally and this
had a open source linux operating system
in it so basically it was just a
computer
which had a blank canvas that you can
put applications on and quickly go to
market we had several customers doing
this right away one of them was the
original tenido plug we had the pogoplug
ednita then we progressed to the guru
plug which we offered with Wi-Fi
internally in there and from there from
the Guru plague we started with other
ones like the Guru display and the d2
plug which had hdmi outputs in them okay
just listen all right like I'll compare
to Brian so kind of today what wouldn't
go over is a kind of a case study you
know it's all sounds great on paper but
how does it work you know what is the
advantage of leveraging Java on this
hardware platforms kind of a case study
we're going to go talk about a customer
called proximus mobility and they are a
company involved in location-based
advertising and geofencing that's a very
big field active field here of a lot of
investment a lot of potential there so
we'll talk about how they start up from
very humble beginnings basically an
enthusiast who he really was an
enthusiast who had an idea and how he
came from a real quick in 2009 he was
just an enthusiast for an idea and he
had no funding nothing but within a
short span of one and a half years he
developed a complete solution on board
one of our hardware platforms here
you'll see it right behind here blinking
an orange and he was able to go from an
idea to establish funding headquarters
around what 50 people I think he has now
people yeah and and he's acquired series
of a funding multi over what 9 million
dollars in his first round and now he's
a I don't comment on his profitability
but he you know it's a very mature and
and a stable company right now so
and kind of just to go over it their
business model I'm not sure how familiar
with you are with the geofencing but
will I'll play a short little video here
just to explain and bear with me it
might sound like propaganda here but it
should be okay go back so location based
software company merging consumer retail
experiences along with product
promotions and brand loyalty these
solutions allow a retailer venue or
their marketing agency to offer relevant
location-based content to their
customers create locate deliver redeem
here's how it works just plug in the
proximus proximity unit and start
broadcasting potential customers are in
the proximity of your business every day
proximus allows you to access these
customers by broadcasting content via
bluetooth and Wi-Fi signal in the
immediate area of your business the
proximity network then allows you to
send the relevant content and offers all
without a nap and regardless of phone
type carrier or platform when they have
optioned the system once the Proxima
solution can cater offers to them again
anytime they enter the same location in
the future this in turn develops repeat
and loyal customers proximus reaches
mobile consumers in the places they are
integrating a little deer on the power
point but kind of example you know there
are a small company at the beginning
with you know no expertise in hardware
but they're able to leverage the
platforms here this wouldn't buy Marvel
very easily so I'm example if you are if
you guys have smartphones I assume maybe
at least half of you guys have one here
if you turn on your Wi-Fi let's just say
for a case example I was a you are at
home depot or at a baseball game and a
customer wants to you know ship you in
relevant ads and deals that you guys
could have attained if you open your
Wi-Fi there's no need for apps download
you'll see a client says New York New
York offers you guys see that just click
it connect it open a web browser
we should see this was an ad that we
program we help them with for MGM Grand
Hotel's and they deployed these in large
numbers over in all over Las Vegas so
and they're able to generate you know
good revenue they're able to more
importantly track the revenues the users
how many return visits and what
percentage of their viewers bought
product or use the add so this is a
really powerful tool for them and you
couldn't have been done without you know
the partnership here with with Oracle
using their java SE 7 and they used
glassfish for their enterprise cloud
based servers and web services yeah ok
originally promised cockpit contacted me
in middle of 2009 they had seen our
original shiva plaque and they're
looking for a wife I design around about
the same size of the Shiva plug and
Michael the CEO spoke to me regarding
that asking us to do a design for them a
plug design with Wi-Fi with all the
certifications and he was going to try
and raise round about a hundred 125,000
250,000 and what I said to him was that
we've got exactly what you need that was
our original guru plague and he said how
much was the entry level I said $99 he
just about fell off a seat basically is
it $99 everything there I don't have to
raise this 125,000 150,000 I said you
can go to market straightaway and he
said what do you have on on this black
computer I said it has linux and you can
put Java on top of it as you want and
then you can go directly to market so he
did that so he doesn't have to raise
the initial finance to do a hardware
design or anything like that he went
straight to market and he went to MGM
grand and his markets philosophy was it
was small and portable they could do
what he wanted to do he said he went to
the eve marketing people at MGM grand
and he said take out your iPhone it's
the same sized footprint as your iPhone
but slightly thicker and they said yes
go ahead and do it then he wanted more
within the plug computer so we said
let's go to the the dream plague and
what this is the one that hit the
standardized on at the moment the dream
plug but within a very short amount of
time he was able to bring it to market
and then raise more finance because he
could show the solution the thing about
our plug confused that are that it's
everything has all the compliances have
been done on it and it's ready to go all
you need to do is put your application
software on top of that put your java
application software on top of it and
it's ready to run so from this example
and I spoke to Michael a lot about this
and I spoken of the air CTO and there
are other software developers and what
they said to us was that hey it'd be
great to have a product not just with
linux on it but have something else on
that like the java an osgi on top of
that and this is what we've done and
this is how we're partnered with oracle
and both hitachi and we've produced the
mirror box which is this one here so
this is what the with the Oracle Java
and the osgi on top of this it's roughly
the cost probably a couple of hours
you're paying for a software developer
to on this for the licensing so there's
a very cheap entry level to get into and
you know we're really thankful that we
have Itachi as a partner to help us with
this new product
and the attempted to go to further delve
into their products their product here
the Java implementations they use they
used OpenJDK java SE 7 on the individual
plug units like you see right there
actually they used a couple different
leave before they use that platform we
had an earlier iteration and and this
one has a lot more value so then they
had two ethernet ports and it was a
better product for what they wanted but
one of the advantages was that he was
able to transfer very quickly his
application software from the original
guru plug product which we had to this
dream plug a minimal of time and and he
said he favored java SE and environment
was one of the big causes one of the big
factors that saved him time in
developing that platform also use java
ee on their web and cloud based
management tool so it was a good good
good project for him and a good example
of how java was shy and the plug
computer products can be very successful
for these startups it's pretty quick
presentation so some references and open
up to questions there's no it was kind
of he said to research um we found out
that you know some people definitely
favor the plug concept but a lot of
people I would say was eighty percent I
think it prepared it is tall and and you
know we listen to our customers bicycle
I prefer that they stop so we produce
the basic model basically and we're not
abandoning the plug concept I mean that
one you know we're still going to make
plug computers but we wanted to have
that flexibility and there's that
advantages of not having a plug you can
swap power supplies easily you can
customize it for each location so
problem
original shape up like if you can take
this off let's really know that was
that's a pro time you can take that up
awesome product I know nobody you can
take this off and plug a power cable and
put it on the war and becomes a desktop
right all of our plug computers have
that flexibility and we found that round
about eighty percent of the people we're
using it like this so for example the
tall ones we could still have that
flexibility I mean this is a power
supply you plug into the wall but you
can still remove this go DC to DC so
there's that flexibility but the new
products here it allows you to be a
little bit more sleeker a little bit
smaller form factor without power supply
so that's good that's correct no this
there's two ways um this particular
customer uh proximus he does have like a
local like a local application he runs
on here there's flash memory for that
but I mean he manages everything through
his own cloud-based through his network
so there's two Ethernet switches so
there's connectivity to his his server
hosted and somewhere in Georgia if
somewhere I'm not sure where area
everything below it and actually so and
we do primarily open source so we had
will provide operating system you boot a
standard kernel and they you know we
give them the freedom to to manipulate
and change it how are they like because
that's kind of the one of the benefits
of open source and the flexibility of it
so
good what are your top
hmm
you know one of the nice things about
the open sources we don't have any we do
have targeted markets for each appliance
but we can we service every industry
telemedicine is a big field networking
security nos local storage home
automation is probably almost our
biggest market right now we pair these
with and we customize these for zigbee
z-wave modules for you know controlling
homes we work with the one of the
biggest telcos in Europe on projects and
in Russia actually so we kind of address
all those markets really so there's no
one we go after we just try to we have
we try to focus each product for
individual markets this what we call it
a blank canvas basically you can do it
can be anything you want it to be things
on your application oh yeah oh yeah
course ahead
foggy brain that's correct actually when
we call this the dream plug right but
then as you know they all have stickers
in the front and back we've actually
customized this for probably over 20
different customers with their own color
schemes we make stickers for them we go
to mass production for them to deploy in
the thousands and tens of thousands so I
think it was the cheapest why are you
including a other people who screen
printed on you can have a screen for the
wrong or just a sec oh this is just an
actual likes to stick around home early
and then when you get to truly higher
production values usually the customer
can justify the expense of creating his
own custom tooling assume custom
enclosure like that but this is a an
enabler for for for enthusiasts or small
businesses to to to grow quickly without
having to invest hundred thousand
dollars for certifications half million
for tooling and all this so most of the
developers we've spoken to you know hate
during the UL FCC cee they hate in there
and it's all done were already on the
supply so this is one of the major
hurdles when they go out to market they
don't have to worry about that yet
all right thank you very much then I
