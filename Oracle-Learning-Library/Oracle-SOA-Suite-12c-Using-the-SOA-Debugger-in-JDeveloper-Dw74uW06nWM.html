this is the third video in our
three-part series so a suite 12c
developer productivity we will show you
how to debug a soul composite
application by setting breakpoints in
the composite editor b-bill process and
service bus pipeline using oracle
jdeveloper this video is a brief
overview of the so ado bugger and
JDeveloper see the developing Sowa
applications with oracle so a suite
document at the URL listed for more
information and note that debugging is
limited to the design view in Oracle
JDeveloper to get started we have a
deployed project open to set breakpoints
in the composite right-click an
interface and select create breakpoint
pair the breakpoints appear as little
red icons with an arrow pointing in the
direction of the flow the breakpoint
pair is useful for scenarios in which
both the request and reply are important
now let's expand the befell process in a
people process right click an activity
and select toggle breakpoint this will
set a breakpoint if there is none and
remove if there is already a breakpoint
these breakpoints are red dots only
without an arrow as the flow is always
in one direction set as many breakpoints
as you want now start the debugger for
your project you can either click the
red debugger icon to start the debugger
or right-click the project and select
debug you can debug local or remote
actions when the debugger is started a
window pops up asking which server you
want to use for debugging choose your
host and leave the defaults click OK the
debugger is ready when you see this
message every web service endpoint now
shows a message so that you can use the
context menu to initialize web service
debugging right-click the web service
interface
and select initiate web service
debugging this opens the HTTP analyzer
fill in all fields or choose age to DP
content at the bottom to be able to copy
and paste an XML file instead you can
test HTTP requests and responses in the
so acum posit application with the HTTP
analyzer in Oracle JDeveloper
the HTTP analyzer enables you to examine
the content of HTTP request/response
package pairs you can edit the content
of a request package resend it and
observe the response packet returned
click send request if everything goes
well you should now see the debugger
stop at your first breakpoint the active
breakpoint turns blue and starts pulsing
go to the data tab at the bottom of
JDeveloper and look at your variable
values step over or use f8 to start your
BL process step through the people
process one activity at a time using f8
and see how the variable values change
if you step through and assign activity
you will see the debugger step through
the copy rules that are included in that
assign if you set a breakpoint at the
database adapter it will jump out of B
pole and back to the composite note the
values that come back from the adapter
after the calculate payment activity the
payment status has been set see what
happens when you modify a value on the
left hand side you also see the stack
trace finish the debugger by stepping to
the end of your befell process back in
the HTTP analyzer you can see the result
of the request response activity make
sure to terminate the debugger before
you continue with the implementation as
long as the debugger is running you will
not be able to edit to stop the debugger
click the big red icon in the tool
section and select your project then
click terminate this concludes our
three-part developer productivity series
