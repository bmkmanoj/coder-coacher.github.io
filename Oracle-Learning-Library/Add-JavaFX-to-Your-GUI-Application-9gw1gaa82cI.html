start thank you for coming to the
session just to double check you at the
right home the name of the session is
adding Java weeks to your reapplication
my name is exists milk I'm engineer from
from Java fix group just a few words to
introduce myself i joined the
development team not quite a long time
ago or less than one year recently doing
bug fixes key and then mostly in the
area that allows use of java fix with
swing applications and also some other
stuff so and prayer that i worked for
several years in javelin Bay so just to
give you an idea of what I'm going to
speak today the session is about the way
you can use gel fix with other you are
to get like swing and s WT so i will
explain in general how how this is
supposed to be then say couple words
about the architecture how it's designed
the source code that's all this vision
Joey fix then give review of how its
implemented show you the most of what we
already have in official releases and
show you them of what we haven't yet
released but plan to do in the nearest
future and then we'll be ready to answer
your questions if you get some so few
words to say about Joey fix itself I
guess that everybody of you most of all
know that Joey fix is supposed to be the
next generation UI toolkit for
development of business applications
sophisticated business of
occasions as its stated at our website
so basically this is the toolkit to
develop all the job applications with
greg's it's fishes high-performance
rendering and rich multimedia support
and also has a feature that we supposed
to be important its supports
interoperability interoperability with
other UI to kids so what does this mean
this means that you can use Java fix and
other UI to kids in your application
simultaneously so you can make mixed
content developed with these two kids in
the same application in the same window
so why do you think that
interoperability matters for Joey fix
first of all as long as the software
industries has quite a long history
already and there is a bunch of legacy
applications that need to be supported
that need to be updated to meet the
present requirements for you I
experienced people need to to invest
some efforts updating their presentation
but migration from other two kids to
java fix we might be difficult so it's
my vehicle to make this integration in
one step so jeal fix proposes provides
features to make these immigration in
steps so that you can still use your old
UI toolkit and add some pieces of
content developed with Joey fix in it so
this is kind of off to migrate from old
you I to accuse to Joe eggs another
reason why we suppose interoperability
is important is that for new
applications that you want to develop
with your fix from the very beginning
you might still want to use your
favorite third-party components
graphical or
well you want to immigrate to Joey figs
but still want to use all the components
and in this case that Joey fix also
gives you some it's to achieve this goal
and another point is when you still want
to use your favorite you at low key but
you want to add features to it
application from Joey fix like recently
edit geisha support support for multi
touch inputs and feature that was
supposed to be added to screen but right
now available only in Joey fix this is
like HTML rendering your application so
all these reasons we supposed to be
important or support of interfere
ability injera fix so what do what's the
go for for us in order to support this
video's first of all we want to provide
a public API to ello Jallow fix content
to be embedded in third-party you had
two kids and also API to embed Joe
ethics content in those two kids without
any hidden stuff without any secrets so
it should be public API then this API
should should L application developers
develop your duel with Joey fix so let
not to care about the environment where
this content is about to be used so it
should be no difference publication the
variables whenever this content will be
used in embedded Joey fix mod or in
standalone cha fix application and we
also want to minister minimize their
performance penalty for embedded Java
fix content so this is this is a go go
go we're behind the interpretability
future in geography so this which was
initially introduced about one year ago
the previous gel one
we announced support with support to
embed Joey fix content in swinging
applications and also the time announced
the support for embedding Java fix in
application developed with SWT a you I
took it so this is what we have now so
we ll embedding gel fix in swing and swg
applications so the year he has passed
and since that announcement we get some
updates to this to this component so
right now we've fully supports drag and
drop feature for embedded Joey fix that
was not previously available it was
tricky to implement that with that's why
we didn't have it from the very
beginning also with its work on problems
or improve the performance for embedding
javafx and resolved some fredon issues
as java fix leaves knowledge for info
it's it's own fret there are multi
Fred's multiple threads and Parks lived
here and the end there is also always
what to fix in this area so we support
embarrass away fix on all platforms
where we have the Java fix itself
running so it's windows mac so six and
linux and also did some some
improvements and bug fixes in this area
just to demonstrate what i'm talking
about i'm going to show you a small demo
so this is a swing interrupt Emma it's
it's not you it's it's available for
download already so here we have the
swing application with Joey fix chop and
swing table so
we can change can change values wheel
table and the chat will be updated and
on the second tab you can see the web
page is straight it's it runs inside of
webnode Joey fix control which leaves
inside of javax panel this is a swing
controls that trance they're embedded
shall we fix inside of it so and right
now so the this has been already
available for one year but recently as
we edit the dragon drop support for in
paddy Geographics you can now drag
something in just to demonstrate it to
you sure no the gfx panel runs the they
charge only so it's yeah yeah just to
show you the drag and drop feature
here it goes so this is what we have in
javafx student to and a few words about
the architecture how it's howhow
embedding is designed so when thinking
about how to implement this we had
basically two of it unities lightweight
invariant heavyweight embedding anyway
embedding is when you have the
placeholder for embedded objects control
managed by the platform so when the
placeholder control has corresponding
platform-specific handler and not
managed by the UI toolkit where you run
they're embedded Joey fix stuff and
lightweight embedding it's little bit
opposite it's when the placeholder is
managed by their specific UI toolkit so
the only benefit of heavyweight is from
the implementation point of view or as
it's it is requires less less cordon and
simpler to implement and the drawbacks
is that it's hard to use such hey wait
placeholder and with this approach we
have a limited set of interoperability
features so we don't have that trans
decency support we don't have the flashy
efforts all that good stuff that javax
prize and we have chosen the lightweight
approach we have it or J fix panel now
it required little boy efforts from the
implementation point of view though it's
easier for application developers to use
it and we have better interpro bility
features with this approach so we have a
translucent supports better skolian and
effects so the reason why I'm basically
talking about how it's designed
I was implemented is because as Joey fix
itself is going to be open sourced and
right now we are in the middle of open
sourcing so maybe you might would like
to to provide your own bridges of Java
fix to a little kids so I guess that
this information may be interesting for
you from this point of view here is the
mmm the picture of how it's how it's
designed so how how Java fix embedding
happens so if we have the swing or SWT
as the hospital kid and Java fix as I
posted we have flow flows of events and
graphical content going between them and
this flows pass through the abstraction
layer so this is a piece which which
requires more coordinated set for
lightweight approach so when the event
go from the host toolkit take the dive
into abstraction layer where they
convert it into the form that is
recognized right Joe a fix and in reply
java fix generates the graphical
representation of the stem and passes
read through the abstraction layer back
to the hostel kid so having the
abstraction layer it's possible to embed
Joey fix in almost any anywhere cook
heat of Europe and in case of reverse
embedding where we have the Java fix the
host hosting two kids things things look
similar but in fact the things a little
bit more complicated because in this
case it's not always possible to provide
a embedding of content developed with
other UI toolkit Sanjaya fix it depends
on whenever this tool kits provides API
for putting their stuff enters into
environment provided by Joey fix so
when they run standalone they depend on
the platform and when these two kids
from right inside of Java fix it's
necessary to provide a relative relevant
environment and whenever it's possible
to provide such environment depends on
those two kids so that's basically all
about the architecture and just a few of
about implementation I will speak a
little bit more about GFX panel because
I'm working on this component and I'm
kind of more familiar with it so this is
as I said in entry point for embedding
Joey figs in swing it is a lightweight J
component and are basically all it does
is all the rights that event handlers
where it catches the events from swing
and awt and possibly them to abstraction
layer where the whole all the rest of
magic happens right now we support the
gfx panels multiple jeff expense
involved in the application so you can
have many of them also you can run
embedded graphics we stand alone so we
suppose that current state of Joey fix
JJ fix panel allows to cover all the
possible cases of the use of Americans
stand the launcher fixing your vacation
so Freddie this is interesting modesta
java fix itself it it runs in multiple
threads we have Fred where we have the
event queue and we have the rendering
threat and we swing it's it's also
similar we have their friend that
consumes events from the platform and we
have Fred where all their swing objects
leave and event queue so this stuff
needs coexist and it's necessary to obey
the rules that swing objects can be
accessed only from the swing fret
javafx object can be accessed on from
Java fix application fret so the Jeff
Jeff expel itself is not Fred safe and
if you want to access access swing
objects from Joey fix content from say
event handlers of embedded Java fix
intent you need to use specific API this
is you need to use involve in orch later
method from utility swing each ladies
class and at the same way if you want to
assess Java fix embedded java fix from
swing say you write some event handler
of jeff expand oh and want to control
java fixin from that event elma you need
to use run later method from the
platform class so this is these are
interesting thing to note to notice and
to remember on the case when you use the
embedded ja graphics so here is this
picture how how the input events go in
case of embedded and traffic so here we
have their AWG to get Fred Fred that
obtains events from the platform aw and
dispatch Fred and Java fix application
Fred so when the AWG looky Fred obtains
event it's it's constructs Java object
with the data and I synchronously
scandals it into the event queue running
on aw and dispatch read where this
object when this event object is
dispatched to GFX panel and in one of
its seven endless days subjects is
unpacked and sent an assassin Tron ously
to Java fix application fret so and
finally this object going through the
abstraction layer reach the scene graph
where it it is processed so a little bit
complicated and in case of drag and drop
things are even a little bit more
complicated because in drag and drop
it's necessary to to send replies to the
system on on events that is sense to to
Jerry fix so in case of drag and drop we
we also send replies from Joey fix
application Fred to a devotee when
dispatch Fred and for drag and drop we
and break the rule of Swing not to block
the aw and this much crap with this is
this is what we have to do so blow the
threat and wait for advice from Java fix
application Fred this is true only in
case of drag and drop so he'll painting
happens well with lightweight approach
homayon that we choose for jxj fix panel
we need to render the whole Java fix n
into back buffer and them send this back
buffer from Joey fix Fred to AWG vent
dispatch Fred way it's get rendered on
the screen so this is this kind of
payment we made for for LOL all the all
the benefits of lightweight embedding
when we have this fast scrolling where
we have effects and healed and ease of
use for vacation developments actually
this this results in some performance
but not Eve not very high from the frame
per second point of view they embedded
Joe a fixed runs about 10 or 15
thousands
slow of adam standalone one so that's
basically all about the jerry hicks
panel if you wats about FX canvas so
this is component for embedding java fix
in swt a applications it has the similar
design to javax panel it's also force
the mouse keyboard events like in jet
like jeff expand to embed to fix and
that's the same stuff the only
difference but very important is that
there is no need to synchronously
communicate with embedded Joey fix so in
order to call run late method of the
platform class in order to communicate
with Joey fix objects from SPT
application this is because they all run
in the same fret so this and thus we
note is is a new thing that we don't yet
have in religious this this is an entry
point for embedding forever symbol for
embedding swing content in Java fix
application so this feature is not yet
publicly available it exists as a
prototype so we are still evaluating the
design and trying to understand whenever
we can we can do anything everything we
want from it so right now we support
only the symbol input events mouse key
but not drag and drop no sophisticated
stuff and we support rendering so it's
that's not little already and just to
show you how how it works
so here is the standard Java fix and
sample application slightly modified you
can see a swing content running in it
this is swing set to almost standard
their applications that shows the
features of Joe a fix so this is not
this is not a picture this is not a
video it actually works so this is what
this is what we have as a prototype and
what we plan to put in one of our
following releases so a few words about
our plans are interoperability feature
in general and some details so we plan
to focus on interoperability with swing
this is our priority as the javax panel
itself seems to be finalized we don't
expect to add new features to it we plan
to put more efforts on swing no
development we would like to move it
from the stage of elder prototype to
release candidate as soon as possible we
also will maintain and improve javax
panel itself we don't give up
maintaining of SWT Joe eggs and Joey fix
interoperability with a working on this
in this area we thinking about providing
support for embedding swg content in
java fix Oh SWT node and as a set
already we are thinking about open
sourcing they called for interpretive
fish in Java fix so once again if if you
think that adding java fix to your
application is good idea
antifuse do you want to use your
favorite UI toolkit which is not as
sweet as SWT even I don't know any any
kind of you I took it you may think
about providing your own bridge for java
figs and that took it so as for our
glands horse we note we still not yet
settled with the design that's why I
don't don't speak too much about it just
showing you the demo so as we are not
sure how it will look like videos when
it saw the prototype it's one thing and
when it's coming to release things may
be totally different so like with Jeff
expand or one year ago we still need a
lot of features to be implemented by
Craig and raw input methods and modality
support currently swing not runs only on
windows so we need to make it functional
on mac OS x and linux platforms where
java fix leaves and definitely
performance optimizations currently it's
it doesn't satisfies so what we have mmm
well that's that's basically all here
are some general Joey fix links that may
be found they've with me I find
interesting and think that I will keep
this slide on and now I am ready to
answer your questions if you have some
delicious
if you need for example to run HTML in
the application well swing swing is not
going to ever support for multi-touch
and enjoy a fix we have support for
multi-touch so if you want to develop or
hardware that supports multi-touch you
might you might be interesting to move
into Java fix or at least you might be
interested in swing mode feature that
will allow you to still use Joe a fix
and as long as swing note is a first
laughs Joe a fixed object that supports
multi-touch you can provide not touch
report for your swing application but
this little bit strange when you when
you have all of the case with
application wrapped inside of Java fix
and use only multi-touch feature from
Java x yeah
yeah we have a sin builder an
application that helps you to to design
their graphics practical part which you
don't have in swim em I know I think
that well I really know when when we are
ready with the release of this feature
is working right now but you know from
the time when it's when I start working
till the moment when we can release it
it might us some time
