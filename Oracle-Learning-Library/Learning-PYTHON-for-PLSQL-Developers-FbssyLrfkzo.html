afternoon wherever you are
welcome to the Oracle code edition of
learning Python for PL sequel developers
my name is Erik Nanda and I have been an
Oracle as director for quite some time I
have my own database analytics company
and high-end consulting company called
provisions today's session I will talk
about how to learn Python from a very
very easy and quick way for PL sequel
developers but before we go further
let's just start with a few things I
think this is totally redundant slides
but I still have to go to them safe
harbor statement that means that need to
not cross what I'd say you have to test
it you for it to anything else the
agenda for Oracle code event in San
Francisco announced in results and
running etc again this is probably not
relevant to today's discussion what does
that we have to show you this and if you
happen to be in San Francisco or good
code event there's a 300 all credit
signups so you should take advantage of
that for Oracle cloud and it certainly
what it will be coffee machines CNC
cutters 3d printer etcetera for you to
try out a few things including Internet
of Things walks up and some lab so it's
a very very great way to spend a day if
you want interest in this one so without
further ado let's jump into today's
topic first of all why on earth would
you be interested to learn Python so if
you have any doubt in mind I hope this
is going to clear it out number one is
that Python is the language of big data
if you have to write MapReduce code and
if you want to look up what MapReduce is
just to search at that you'll be able to
find out a lot of information on that
reduce if you have to write MapReduce
code you have to use maybe a language
like Java what is also possible to write
the July would language like Python and
which will be input to spark and then
that Duncan does the processing as well
if you are not interested in the big
data ingestion process but more
interested in the output which is like
reporting or analysis of the big data
systems or you creating a machine
learning algorithm etc well Python has
plenty of packages available I always
a plenty of packages are available
written in Python which you can use to
create your own application now that's a
very very useful feature in order to
rewrite the entire wheel all the time
you can have reusable components already
available and what sort eventually open
source you can actually use them to your
own benefit and continue processing and
the third one is probably probably the
most beneficial of of all is that it's a
general-purpose language it's not a very
strict statistical language for example
R etc its general general purpose
language it has the same if their nails
condition loops etc all those things we
can typically found the general purpose
language it's a native language of
Raspberry Pi device if you are ever
interested in in doing some programming
for Raspberry Pi but if you're not if
you let's say want to write some
database tools some kind of delivers
monitoring tool or some database tool
outside of database itself which is
something you probably cannot do in PL
sequel nothing is better than Python
again I should write there as well
Oracle has even has a few packages that
allows Python to interact with Oracle
directly it has even a graphical
interface if you want to create some
graphical applications you can even
create a website with Python so there
are plenty of reasons why by tony is
important for you to learn and thing but
the next question is that how much
effort you have to put your loans by
that well first of all it's a
general-purpose language it's not a very
specific tied to a specific job
description role so as a result of that
it's easy to learn easy to understand it
is a procedure all this is simple syntax
and syntactically it is actually close
to PL sequel for example it has things
like if-then-else condition while loops
for loops etc is a break condition to
break from the loops exception logic etc
I'm saying similar but is not exactly
safe of course not so that brings to the
next one is that I'm assuming you
already saw PL sequel very well so you
don't know you're not unfamiliar with
the whole concept of the programming
etcetera
what I'm going to do is that I'm going
to explain what are the syntactically
close things two pills equal in Python
and also who is things are different
hopefully we're doing so you can learn
that language very quickly and very fast
instead of going through a whole
rigamarole of going through the language
from scratch I have a whole series of
five videos on this topic you can see
the whole video series at this URL
HTTP bit that Weekly slash bite on four
PL sequel is it remember remember wiggly
Python for PL sequel and you can get all
the series so let's just very quickly go
through some of the few things that I
want to show you one particular one
which is the collections in Python
afterwards let's start first one what is
the first thing we should do well
install Python the levels of that Python
is free well if I didn't I must have
missed it so on it is actually
completely free you can download Python
from python.org check check for your own
ways and then install that Python has
two installations one is the command
prompt and is going we interface call
idle see there's two primary differences
so in this example let's see what I have
done so far and jump on to that one I
already downloaded and already install
everything so let me just go back to so
you in this command prompt I'm assuming
I assume that I've already put the path
variable I put the Python when I
installed it and I simply type Python
this is the most important thing look at
that angle three angle brackets that is
called a Python prompt that's a typical
thing imagine cycle plus prompt so this
is a Python prompt so they like that so
here you put a Python prompt so the
first thing should want to do is
probably do say I want to display hello
world like you typically do with a low
in Londinium language in Python I would
do print that's a function hello
sorry hello world hello world exact Fred
function so this is a print function
visual display which is similar to dbms
output.put line in PL sequel before I
start anything
I generally want to find out a few
things number one is that how do you put
a comment in Python the comment is
simply this this is a is a comic there
you go and say that this porn thing is a
comment it's gonna ignore the comment
second thing I always find out is that
how do I get help on something
it's Python I used to help let's say I
want to find out the help on print we go
I'll print this is for me all the help
on print conditions if I just see only
help it's going to show me a help prompt
at this point I can type what print I
what help what topic I want help on so
let's say I want top on come pick on
three that's what this really is a he'll
come and let me quit help by going to
Python prompt this is a Python command
line interpreter
there's also another verse kind of thing
I've kind of the pide interface of
Python called idle I mentioned that you
it gets installed when you install the
Python installation file this is how the
pipe idle looks like I invoke idle by
going here I said I don't see the idle
Python three point six point for 64-bit
Dexter path so that's what I brought it
up on it can sail in this if the big
difference is that is the same thing I
have the same three angle brackets
Python prompt as you saw before so the
difference is that and here you can see
on it types it makes the color coding
off so the syntax it might be helpful
for some people I don't find it very
helpful I generally do not do this but
what are the quick quick ticks things
that little bit what I do when I do type
print
when I put that parentheses idle
automatically prompts me to all the
possible arguments and the print
functions which might be very useful for
some people just to remember that so
again it's up to you I generally don't
use this I am going to use this Python
command line interpreter here okay so so
far so good this is the first one I want
to define a variable typically it's BL
sequel you do you need define a variable
first you declare a variable with a
declare section say declare b1 then you
have a begin section within that you
have say v1 as sign is assigned a value
let's say two in Python there is no such
thing called declaring declaring it
variable a variable is created when you
assign a value to it suppose I put this
one v1 equal to by the way this is the
assignment operator in my Python equal
to sign remember in PL sequel it is :
equal to Python it is simply equal to so
we want equal to two so you go that's it
at that time the variable V one is
created so if I want to type what v1 is
I can do this
burek this was like the value of v1 see
that I don't have to buy even put a
print statement there again just put
everyone - that's it what if I have a
variable type v2 here it says no because
remember if variable is created with a
religious sign I didn't sign anything to
v2 yet so I can adjust the veto is not
created as a result of that I can
reference it I can circle to this v2
equal to v1 plus two well at that time
v2 is created now if I do a V - yep that
I got v2 so that's how the important
thing about variables what kind of
variables can I create so there are
several things I just mentioned here one
- those are called integers I can define
say v3 another variable called it's a
10.0 when I put 10.0 it creates a float
variable here I can also create a
boolean variables so lexical v1 equal to
true so we will go to see that big
difference here true that is the upper
caste and lower caste ru e Python is
case-sensitive
unlike pl/sql which is not Quezon City
at all so for example v4 is a variable
here if I put v4 is going to say true
before uppercase will get an error
because we do not have a variable called
v4 yet so there's a big difference in
remember the case acitivity in Python
unlike pl/sql alright so one thing is
that occurs here v4 is true that's a
boolean variable but it is not fixed to
a boolean variable for example I can say
v4 equal to 10 that's like at that time
before becomes an integer variable
that's why python is called a loosely
cast or loosely typed language the
variables are not typed specifically or
formally they simply keep on changing
generally variables in Python are called
objects so an object is simply takes the
data type of whatever is assigned to it
and that's it there is no specific
declaration of an object with a specific
type whatever is assigned a runtime
that's the sub desolated epic text which
is very important to remember now I'm
confused
I got V for equal to true earlier that
there was a boolean variable but now I
assigned 1024 and now it becomes integer
variable if I have to know at some point
of a program what kind of data type is
variable is how do I know that in pure
sickle that sort of problem because I
must have to find the variable earlier
in the class section so I know exactly
whatever time it is in case of Python I
don't have any class section I don't I
don't declare a variable that's why I
won't know how do I know this is very
simple thing you simply type the
function type before class it there so
your integer because we use so what if
we assign V for equal to true if I do
the same thing here class type equal to
V for now is called both boolean
or type LLL tell you what kind of what
variable it is what kind of return type
it is so that's a talk about variables
let's jump into something that you'll
know is about some of the variables
particularly for collections which will
be in slightly afterwards but before we
do that let's jump into something more
than that which is how do I two
conditions like if conditions etc all
right in PL sequel is a if some
expression then begin you get our oven
as it is I'm sorry if expression then
bunch of statements which will be
executed as a part of the if statement
and if that will mark the end of the
statements to be executed in case of
Python
there is no end if or there is no damn
condition so how does it know where to
start and where to end first of all this
is sin taxes so say let's say if v1
equal to equal to whether there's an
equality operator is equal to two
instead of eight in then we put a colon
that marks the end of the if expression
or the condition that is being evaluated
under the if condition then we have to
say execute all these operations all the
statements but how does it know where to
stop execution in the if block it gives
appears equal end if would have solve
the problem in case of this is there is
no end if how does a Python know you
have to put them indentation so here to
put indentation here print print B 2 is
to something like that so let's see we
go reach equal to two
this is how the indentation helps in
telling or Python way to stop the
execution of the if conditions so let's
say else condition suppose we do this
something here if V 2 equal to 2 we
print V 2 equal to 2 else again under
the colon you can say print B 2 is not
two very simple thing P 2 is 2 now let's
try V 2 equal to set 3 so if you execute
the same code again each equal to 2 well
V 2 equal to 2 what is V 2 again V 2
equal to 3 what it is if it equal to 2
well let's see
so let us say if V 2 equal to 2 print 3
2 equal to 2 else
P 2 is not - oh this is weird this is
something else I gotta figure out what
is going on here ok so next we go to if
condition looping and probably very
important thing looping in case of
pl/sql we have very simple looking
condition for i in 1.10 loop and then
you say end loop in case of Python is
the same thing for but what you see in
pl/sql which is for i in one dot dot for
say 10 suppose loop this is the pl/sql
condition of course is not the bison
condition for Phii in 1.2 loop this one
in the one dot dot one 10 that is up to
1 to 10 in case of python is called a
range function
so range so range ten will show you
range zero to ten so what we do in this
case is for I in range tens : color ends
which the marking from this point
onwards executes for the for loop so
once again what switch statements are
part of the for loop again indentation
comes into picture so we have to indent
it print I that's a variable let's say
it prints from zero to nine it didn't
print from one to ten it printed from
zero to nine which is a very important
concerns to have to understand that when
python range ten winds up to but not
including tents and standing with 0
because 0 is the count of start from
many things in python including arrays
and indexes and anything which is some
different from pl/sql PL sequel starts
with one all the time so if we want from
say sub to say a proteome attend
including 10 then here to put range 11
they would have said that were calling
so for i in range 10 i just print i the
other loop is called while loops so you
can say while say i less than 11 look
there's oak an old word called loop so
you put :
to mark the connect end of the condition
and say an indentation to make sure that
is part of the while loop great print i
is less than 11 and and then is a
to be part of the while loop I equal to
I plus one which is very similar to what
you see also do in else equal now you
can see here this is PI equal to one and
so what happened here is that I already
assigned I before if you my previous one
and at this time the I value was or to
start with was nine as a result of that
it didn't take this effect so what I
will do is that I equal to 0 this set it
and I'm going to do this while loop one
more time we go icicle is 1111 it did it
few times on iOS less than 11 when it
becomes 11 at the time though the while
the loop through the loop just broke and
a delegate of the loop talking about
breaking we can also do a break
statement here as well so you can see
here for power I so is my loop for I in
range 1 to 10 as a 0 to 9 which is a 10
if I I equal to say 5 break which is
very similar
break condition in PL sequel simple
thing so I equal to if I equal to 5 is
just break in this case is broke what we
didn't actually print anything yet so
I'm going to do this one more time so
I'm going to say so I say I just print I
so that way we know we are doing
something here then I'm going to say if
I equal to 5 break you can see that 0 1
2 3 4 5 and at that time it had it broke
and it did not execute the rest of the
false statement so this is that what you
see in the break condition so these are
a few things just mention to you the
word for loop and and while loop etc I
can see that they but since my tone is a
detail-oriented language you probably am
more interested in in the week a lot of
data manipulation and that's why
collections and arrays are probably more
important because you've been probably
importing a lot of data from somewhere
into Python to do this analysis so it's
very important to do collections and and
and material and lists and tuples and
arrays etc in Python and that's the
topic of the next video so hang on tight
until we go to the next one
now let's run this program in the pl/sql
program and see how it really works
vl6 sorry pl6
alright so you can see here foster it
prints out all the weekdays Sunday
Monday Tuesday etc then the work week
Monday Tuesday etcetera first half is
their second half is this middle because
this when I do a union you can see
Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
and Friday let me see what they were the
union is you can see the difference out
that the union is how the union is done
so here's the Union so first half
multi-set Union second half there is no
intersection between the first half and
the senescence second half as why it
gave you everything but in the second
one you with is a union of all three
which is first half middle and second
half there are overlaps in between all
those three sets when we do this what
happens Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday
Thursday Friday Saturday Tuesday one
more time Wednesday and Thursday it does
union of three does is like Union all in
Oracle this now it doesn't do a distinct
only if you want only distinct you can
do something all Union distinct you can
see their multi set Union distinct the
second half understandable distinct of
the middle rate etc that gives you the
distinct values let's see how we can do
all these things in Python in Python
actually is really simple we'll do this
way here is how I think first week we do
a week weekdays a Sunday to Monday
Tuesday Wednesday etc here is Monday
Tuesday etcetera first half is their
second half is days my trick is this and
all that time here is one thing I want
to show you that this one is in a curly
brace if you remember from first half
when the curly brace is used either use
it for dictionary or is it for set
operation there isn't the difference in
state operation and this is how I do it
first half union second half you simply
use this operator Union operator which
is the pipe operator you can also use
the Union function to put the first step
to second half let's see how that
actually works right one thing here
alright let me go here Python
six dot txt here is the first one I do a
union on what time let me show you the
exact rally you can see that so print
first half Union operator second half or
first AB dot Union operator second half
both of the time we get this which is a
very very important thing to do is that
you can do a union in both ways by
character or dot Union you can do these
things in many ways as well so let's see
some few things and I can show that in
so writing a program I can so that in
the Python command prompt lets the
pattern command prompt first let me
define all these variables I'm just
going to copy and paste to serve me some
typing there you go so let's just make
sure that we have all the variables here
yep what week is this Thursday Wednesday
Thursday Friday Monday Tuesday those so
five days just not gun probably what is
suddenly their work week and then work
week and work week then weekdays week
days which is this gives your Sunday all
those things we got seven days and when
in addition to everything else then the
first half first half i define Tuesdays
Monday and Sunday second half is this
and middle week middle week is this this
is exactly everything so we just saw one
example of first half first half Union
second second half we got this thing so
it's the union of two we can also do
something call let's say you see all
three of them let's see what happens may
trick you see there's a big difference
between plz : here right union of all
the three you didn't know overlaps did
not appear again remember first half is
Tuesday Monday and Sunday I know that
from here
among the Sunday second half is here
Thursday Wednesday Saturday so there's
overlap but the middle week is Thursday
Wednesday and Tuesday
so there's overlap from both sides so
but but Python if I Union all three it
didn't do that
so it's behaved almost like the PLC
equals Union distinct as opposed to the
simple Union that's a big difference
let's see some more things one is called
middle Rick and it's called intersection
the intersection is this operator
so let's it intersection middle Rick and
this give it to still stays overlapping
between the two of them our middle half
and second half to Thursday and
Wednesdays intersection of what of them
yeah of course just like the first one
you can also put this way first half dot
intersection within paranthesis middle
week you can do that as well this is the
same thing as the intersection operator
because it's the state you can also
subtract as well so let's say we
subtract it by first half - middle Rick
when you do that it takes away what's in
the middle week and and there are leaves
what's in the first half only those
persons which is Sunday and Monday which
is exactly what you wanted or that is
also different functionality you can
also use the another function called
difference to do the same thing
difference as well exact same thing if
you want to have a symmetric difference
which is it's a is there in a cab ie Q
which is present in either set one or
said - but not in port so in that case
let's say middle week that's this
operator that carrot operator who is my
carrot operator
there you go six which you can see here
which is either in the first half or in
the middle we have a set but not in both
of them not intersection so it's
basically this is first half Union
middle week - intersection of
both of them so that kinda gives you the
same thing so like five staff middle
week and then - first half an
intersection of middle week same thing
something so this is a varieties
operators for you to do that and I just
showed you before is my because it's
just said you can also find out if first
half is greater than middle Rick is it
greater than equal to middle Rick no
it's not is week days greater than me -
Rick of course it is more than equal to
middle Rick etcetera so this is
something you can do it greater than
equal to there's a difference between
greater than equal to and simply greater
than simply greater than operator is
actually called proper superset that
means s1 is actually more greater than s
2 and s 1 is not equal to s 2 that's the
thing so it is true but if we do let's
say weekdays is greater than equal to
middle week and sorry week days what do
you think will happen it will be true
because week days is greater than or
equal to weekdays same thing but if I
want to do this it will be false because
it's not a proper superset it's not not
a superset of weekday so that you can
see that the difference of this one
similarly is subset is just opposite of
this one this is a proper subset of this
now is the middle week middle week
proper subset of course it is of a
subset we got that is work so if you if
you want to find out if they're exactly
same you just saw that before which is
equal to operator for that is well and
middle week is equal to week this no
it's not but let's say we assign another
variable here
middle week call mid week and we
assignee here middle week I'm sorry
naughty good my fault we will break is
assignment operator at this point middle
week and mid week at the same variables
but the same we do this yeah please true
so you can see that I can see the state
operation as well so this is how we can
do a lot of things in Python in set
operations and using collections as you
can solve as you saw in this case Python
our collections are much more powerful
compared to PL sequel not only you can
don't have to define them you can create
and simple operators that should make
you very very useful to the things like
state operations and collection which is
which makes write on a very good data
manipulation language alright one thing
we do see here but it last one we see we
saw two things associative array and the
nested the tables the third one in PL
sequel is called a very V array or
variable array so it's just like a PLC
code tables they're ordered so there is
no index so because just one value but
the difference is that the maximum
number of elements is fixed at the
declared time so for example this is an
example it says here type we saw framed
as a pointer so type dy weekdays list is
the type is a dry-erase seven seven is
the maximum amount of elements I have I
can define in this I can extend it
afterwards what is I have to fix it one
the time of declare declaration of
element and of halqa three and the way I
address it is using the same thing as I
use nested tables which is the pls
integer index to go to specific one I
haven't seen much use of Vieira's in the
real life and python doesn't have an
equivalent of that but if you think
about Python list and Topo they're
exactly like Harry don't need different
is that Python doesn't force you to
restrict the number of elements of the
design time one time because first of
all there is no declare peridot to begin
with you just simply assign the value so
there is nothing called
defining the maximum
amount of elements the declared time so
that's not even important so python
materia doesn't have it just for the
sake of completeness let's just see how
that actually looks like so you can just
see that the difference let me just see
Python here PL sequel 7 and this is
diary you can see that type of a there's
three weekdays number list we do with
this I define it here Sunday Monday
Tuesday cetera count and I use a word
count - so how many things are there
well in this case I know it's seven but
it doesn't have to be seven this is the
maximum number of elements like may have
less than seven over here and this is
how I do it so you can see here there's
very very close to nested loops nothing
much difference here and we saw that
earlier in how we saw in Python using
the other commands like this which is
this one so weekdays sun-diamond etc we
can do that we're here I use the word
set I can use a list
remember how to read waiting lists so
instead of doing this let's say just
like a heavier V weekdays here if I want
to use the exact same variable name in
Python I will simply use V week days
equal to remember how ry do a list by
square brackets and I put here Sunday
Monday and all the thing I'm just going
to copy it here so to save myself some
time and actually it's going to edit out
for a reason because I have two single
quotes or remove it there you go big
league days so if you have the V
weekdays as opposed to weekdays you can
see here week this year I have a curly
brace which is the set as opposed to
lists which is not a set which is a list
operation and how do I get these things
very very simple thing how do I get all
the variables here well first I can
simply put the week underscore days I
can do get this one but if I want to do
something like what I have done
here like visible I'm gay I'm getting
out each element and then printing out
each element one by one if I want to do
that then clear in Python I will simply
do this for I in just like this you know
what I have to do one dot dot the end
how many elements I have here but of
course I don't have that one dot dot as
notation in Python in Python I have
another function called range once a
number in range I have to go from zero
which is the beginning of the array to
the end of the array to the count so I
don't know the count yet because this is
something dynamic Lee created so to do
the count I have to use this function
call Len within parentheses V underscore
with underscore days and I do a
semicolon
I'm sorry : to mark the end of if and
then print I had to do an indentation
because that's a mark of the he blocked
I comma P week days within square
brackets I and bracket that's it and
then nothing else after that I won't
pursue it it just prints out everything
this is how I make the difference
between the two few things are seen at
zero and it starts with zero and ends
with six and that's why I give here a
length arrange length few weeks by the
way if I do length V weeks what do I get
I should get let's see I should get
seven why but I have seven elements in
this array so I got seven
so in that case is it 10.7 yes it is 0.7
but the difference is that the last 11
last at the in the in the range in
python the highest high number which you
have in the range it is never executed
it never reaches that is up to that but
not including that so if it is range
seven it means zero one two three four
five six not seven so that's that's why
I could go to seven
shootings you might be wondering at this
point is that okay let's just say this
is V week this let me define another
variable called let's say V weekdays
let's say V weekends weekends and in
that weekend I'm just going to remove
everything except the weekends all right
this is the thing now I have two
variables week days this and the
weekends you know what I did this set
operation before so let me try what
happens in this set operation over here
if I do this so it is V week days a
superset of V weekend's weekends is
false the set up Russian does work what
about Union operation intersect
operation you can see that here this is
not supported this intersection
operation a union operation cetera is
not supported for lists this is
something is only your set operation so
we put that in mind that this set
operation over here which is done by a
set is defined by curly braces and not
by square brackets as we saw here so
that's the difference between set
approached
emiliya sets and lists in Python okay
so that's kind of concludes our
definition about the different
collection types in peel sequels and how
they relate to in Python let's go
through a quick summary to find out what
we understood is correct and then very
quick summary here is the first one
nested tables in PL sequel you define
the destructable using this step type
week this is a table of a cat 3 the
simplest collection just one element in
h1 them
and you simply address them by using
this position which is 0m say 1 2 3 4
etc you go to the position and you get
that out of here very simple thing in
Python the covalent e1 is kudrat 3
equality is the 3 types of thing it's
called a list you can do the swim topo
you can do this
only difference is that in tupple you
cannot change anything after I define it
list you can of course change it and
this is how use a reference L value
there using the app I I start with zero
and goes up to on the end last one so
you can instead of PL sequel which is
from 1 and goes up in there is not
equivalent of set in PL sequel PL sequel
is the same collection is collection
this is a PL sequel table nondestructive
was nothing different the second one is
called associative array which is also
called PL cycle table and this is how we
define it so instead of saying in is in
a position of the element in the array
determines the value is that you
actually have a named index in this case
so for example let's say I want to
define a very simple array the
abbreviation of the days and the full
description of the days Sun for Sunday
fry for Friday etcetera if I want to do
them this way and to display them we can
do this way so here you can see we
weekdays Sun this is the key and this is
the value if you will actually in PLC
code is called index this is the value
in case of Python you do the curly
braces you do the the key colon value
comma key colon value comma etc and if
you find it that's impulsively defines a
collection variable and there is no
limit to how much you do it out so you
can keep on extending it you can I keep
on adding to that
you can change a specific one etc and it
is very very useful for defining
something that list of books and authors
we saw before an example of that that's
something you would get in any
collection variables by using think of
this as a table in Oracle so this is a
table just 2 columns the primary key
column and the subscribe description
column for example the primary key will
be key and the value will be the
description column I said and the table
simply keeps on growing this is how we
do in Python
ok so this is the word summary let's
make sure that you understood everything
correctly we just have a quiz just like
anything else
so please everything I will pause our
cravaack each question I
q to pause it get the answer the dancer
we displayed right after that first
question is this following valid you can
see here is this is the list because
it's the square brackets on both sides
if it is that if it is not valid tell me
why it's not valid pause the screen and
when you're ready to see the answer
unpause it is valid remember in Python
lists are very list of variables there
is no restriction as to they have to be
the same data type unlike in PL sequel
so here we have 100 200 300 numbers and
there is a characteristic try which is
perfectly fine there is not certain or
no nothing wrong with this one is this
valid this is an interesting thing not
it's not even data type is actually
different things I put it together like
different types of parentheses etc no
it's completely valid the last two
elements are merely an empty couple so
this one is a couple this is a list
remember tuple is nothing but a list
which is read-only you cannot change it
unlist is nothing but a bunch of lists
of things it is perfectly okay to have
an online list and a null taboo and it
is part of a malice remember in
collections in Python don't have to have
the same data type so you can have this
thing in fact you can even write this
way because you can write even a list
within a list we can certainly put it as
well so you can have nested nested lists
and all the thing just perfectly fine
question 3 this couldn't be valid they
got to be something wrong with this one
particularly look at this one none I
don't have any single quotes around it
will this cause a syntax error and if so
at what point pause the question pause
the screen and unpause when you're ready
to see the answer
it is perfectly valid none is similar to
null in PL sequel in Python it just
simply means that is a placeholder if
you print
to mine list for you will not see any
output for that particular one which is
important none is actually a keyword
which is very similar to know what point
this will throw a syntaxerror in this
thing pause the screen and and unpause
when you're ready to see the answer
nowhere
this is a perfectly valid syntax the
trailing comma will simply be ignored
it's actually very trail in comma has
another usage in in Python you'll see
actually afterwards but the trailing
comma will simply be ignored is not
wrong so there it's completely valid
syntax which is not the same thing in PL
sequel because the spelling comma will
not be a will ignore it it has to either
removed or tomorrow is written okay here
is another interesting twist I put a
square bracket from the left side and
the parentheses on the right side will
this work pause the screen and unpause
when you're ready for the answer
now this Swizz not actually valid syntax
you might have seen seeing all the
square brackets and parentheses or this
kind of a flexible language you can do
anything you want not not really
you can cannot do this one this the left
side square brackets means is a list but
it has to end the square bracket to make
it a list you didn't you may put a
parentheses which is the ending for a
couple so you can't do that you can can
mix the two parentheses or two brackets
you got to be of the same type either it
is a list or a tuple not both at the
same time question six tell me what will
be the result or the output when you
enter all this commands one by one pause
the screen and we're ready for the
answer unpause it will fail so what
happens here is because I have put
parentheses which makes it a couple
remember couple is nothing but a list
but a read-only list when I do append a
tuple does not allow
alterations nobody's read-only as a
result this will fail at this point to
fail so my list well simply but uh it'll
simply saw what it's already there and
one hundred two hundred three hundred
cetera so it's not going to be any of
any use this is a syntax error it will
be thrown out of line number two so if
you wanted to make it an dependable or
modifiable collection you have to make
it a list by using square brackets
question 7 what was the output of the
following if you put it one by one see
that very carefully my list has two
fives okay pause the screen and unpause
when you're ready for the answer if you
have answered seven you would be wrong
yes there are seven elements I have
defined here but remember we might
remember how I put this good the
parentheses at the bed but we couldn't
close them this is a curly brace curly
brace mint this is set is set in Python
means is an ordered collection and no
duplicates it does allow duplicates to
be entered but it ignores them so when I
put two fives in there is going to throw
out every one five as a result of that
the length of this collection will be
six although you have passed seven items
extra five will be dropped this is a
very important property it's not throw a
syntaxerror it will accept it but will
simply get put only six elements and not
seven elements very important property
keep it mind
otherwise you may deduce few bugs
question number eight what will be the
output of the following my list is this
and then my list pause the screen and
ready unpause when you're ready for the
answer
it will print one two three four five
six
why because remember I put curly braces
which means they fit if set is an
ordered collection so even though I
entered six five four three two one is
going to display it and store it as one
two three four five six
and even though interred if I want to
restore it in a reverse manner I have to
do integral dot reverse to store it in
reverse manner this is a very important
thing just because I entered an eunuch
and ordered set of collections python is
going to interpret it and store it also
ordered collection but in a ascending
order not descending order in the
previous question you declared a sect
called my list you want to reference the
third element of the collection how do
you address it my list or my list three
just to so it refers a memory I'm going
to show you this thing so my list I just
put in sort of does
curly braces I just put square brackets
to make it a list and I don't add the
third element of the collection I'll
decline a set called my list here is the
thing I can't do it the moment they put
a leg expect one's going to go back here
let me see curly braces said the moment
I define something as a curly brace I
cannot reference the columns in two
three etc I have to address this as a
third element I have to address it as
using complete set or as a specific key
value pair and that otherwise it will
throw an error if you want to reference
my index you use a list or a tuple so
this list is not for everything is this
an important to have as well as also as
I said I said is for good for said
operations but if you want to reference
by specific element in there it's not
when it goes useful is used in this
operation you want to declare a couple
which is only one string value that is
Saturday so this is how you like it
remember only one string value Saturday
will it work pause the screen and
unpause when you're ready for the answer
it will not it will merely create the
character string call variable call
Saturday not a couple variable to create
a couple variable you have to use this
funny syntax I would say just one
variable comma
and then lived on anything I live in
nothing after that so this is how you
could do it the way you create a couple
variable use just one element question
number 11 you want to create a
collection of week days since you the
weekdays don't change they will remain
the same you create a couple which is
nothing but I read only right you know
that so this is how we create thematic
topologies on below so you can create
interesting days Sunday Monday Tuesday
Wednesday Thursday and Friday etcetera
then you suddenly discover that your
poops I forgot to include Thursday I'm
sorry include 4 for Saturday here since
it's the tupple I can use a pen right in
this case what's going to happen so that
I must drop and recreate that variable
is nothing called drop variable I have
to redefine the variable or I can have
used it a lot of places I don't want to
just do not drop and recreate it all
really quick grab recreate that at all I
won't believe it I like that this is how
you do it just because a couple is not a
place not updatable doesn't mean that
you can find something to the tupple so
here is an example I created another
tuple called Saturday like here with
just one value then I added that sad day
to this couple so even though you cannot
modify a couple you can add or subtract
velop one double from another trouble
you can do that that's the advantage of
using double so at this point if you
display the topple you will get dusting
at example we have that Sunday Monday
Tuesday and you can get that Saturday as
well so that's it that's just a quiz
hopefully we'll answer all the questions
correctly and that's the end of the
discussion on collections in Python hope
you enjoyed it
next we talk about something very
interesting called creating exceptions
in PL sequel how do you create
exceptions in Python and how to create
functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
