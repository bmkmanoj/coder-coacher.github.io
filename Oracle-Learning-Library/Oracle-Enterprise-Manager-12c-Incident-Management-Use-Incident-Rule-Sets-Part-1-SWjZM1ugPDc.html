two-part demonstration showing how to
create incident rule sets in Enterprise
Manager cloud control 12c incident rule
sets replace notification rules and they
are ways to automate actions related to
events incidents and problems some of
the common things you can do with
incident rule sets are you can automate
the creation of an incident based on
important events you can have Enterprise
Manager perform notification actions
such as sending emails or opening
trouble tickets and you can also do
operations to manage your incident
workflow lifecycle such as setting
ownership of an incident setting the
priority setting the escalation level
etc let's begin to get to the incident
rule sets functionality and Enterprise
Manager go to setup then click incidents
and select incident rules here we have
an overview of all the incident rules
defined in our Enterprise Manager
environment as you can see we have two
out of box rules they are designated by
this padlock and that means that these
rules are read-only they are provided
for you to use to get you started if you
don't want to use them you can disable
them as you can see I have already
disabled the first rule set listed
incident rule sets contain one or more
instant rules and the incident rule sets
themselves are executed in the order
that you see them listed so that means
if you have a series of incident rule
sets with each rule set containing one
or more incident rules the first
incident rule set would be executed
followed by the second incident rule set
followed by the third etc etc you can
change the order of the incident rule
sets by clicking reorder rule sets now
let's go through the workflow of
creating an incident rule set click on
create rule set
first we need to enter a name for the
incident rule set for our example let's
create a rule set that will operate on
all the targets in our production group
so let's call this incident rule set
rule set for prod group we will enter a
brief description the next field asked
us to specify the objects on which the
rules will apply there are four
different options targets jobs metric
extension and self update in our example
we are going to have the rules operate
on all the targets of our prod so let's
keep the default of targets you can also
specify whether the rule set should be
enabled or disabled when you first
create it this gives you the option of
defining the rule set now and enabling
it sometime in the future we will leave
it as enabled for our example the owner
is the user who created the rule set and
you also have a type choice of
enterprise or private enterprise rule
sets are meant to contain all the
operation practices that you have for
managing your events incidents rules and
problems the private type of rule set is
meant to enable the administrator to do
things such as send an email to himself
for certain events that he is interested
in for our example let's keep enterprise
as the selected type and move on to the
next section of the page
since we specified our rule set applies
to targets we need to specify the target
on which the rule set will apply we
wanted to operate on our production
group so let's choose the specific
targets option and then choose our
production group we'll click Add
then select the desired group in this
case prod group and click select
so we have selected our production group
note there is an option to exclude
targets if you want to but we will not
be doing that in our example now let's
click the rules tab this is where we
will start defining the rules that are
in our rule set click create then the
next thing we need to specify is the
type of rule we want to create we choose
whether we want it to operate on events
incidents or problems for our first rule
we are creating an incident rule based
on certain events we care about for this
we keep the default incoming events and
updates to events options selected and
click continue for this first rule we
want it to auto create incidents based
on a selected subset of events that are
important to our enterprise so the first
thing we need to do is to select the
type of events we want to select the
events based on type so we'll select
type from the drop down list you see
that there are different types of events
that Enterprise Manager raises we are
interested in metric alert events so we
will select metric alert from the list
you can see there is an option to have
it operate on all metric alert events
for my group or I can choose specific
metric alert events for our example
let's choose the specific metric alert
events options now we choose the metric
alerts for which we want incidents to be
raised we click Add
and let's add a few metric events the
first ones we want are metric alert
events for our host target so we will
choose host for the target type
and now let's look for CPU alerts so
we'll just type in CPU and click search
utilization is the metric we are looking
for so let's select that then under
severity will select critical and
warning
we'll click okay
and let's add a few more
click Add again this will be another
host metric so we will leave the target
type as host this time we'll look for
filesystem metrics we want the
filesystem space available metric and
for severity we again want critical and
warning click OK
let's add one last metric this time it
will be a database metric so we'll
change the target type to database
instance
and we are looking for tablespace
metrics
tablespace used is the one we want and
again we will select critical and
warning for our severity
we'll click OK
and now we have all of our selected
metrics we'll click Next to go to the
next page now we are going to add the
actions we want Enterprise Manager to
perform on the events we created earlier
one or more actions can be added and
these actions will be executed in the
order specified let's click Add to add
an action remember this rule is about
creating incidents whenever any of our
specified metric events occur so in the
conditions part we will leave the
default of always executing the actions
whenever the metric events occur then in
the incident section we select create
incident notice when we select create
incident that we also see the option to
set the assignment indicating the
ownership of this incident as well if we
wanted to we could set the priority to a
different level for our demonstration we
will just leave these as is and click
continue for our example we just want
the one action so click Next
now we specify a name and description
for our rule set we'll call our rule set
create incidents for metric alerts and
for demonstrative purposes we will use
this name in the description as well and
click Next
on the review page we'll click continue
this is the end of part 1 of this
demonstration thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
