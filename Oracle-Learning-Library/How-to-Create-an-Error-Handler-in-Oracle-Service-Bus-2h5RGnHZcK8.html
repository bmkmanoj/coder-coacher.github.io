curriculum developer here at Oracle in
this demonstration I'll show you how to
create an air handler in Oracle service
bus an error handler specifies what
actions should be taken if an error
occurs these actions could be logging
transformation or publishing to handle
errors appropriately you can configure
error handling at the proxy service
pipeline route node and stage level an
Oracle service bus in this demonstration
will add a route node error handler to
an order management proxy service the
error handler will check that the order
is for a valid customer and if it's not
it will log a message to the server
console so let's get started here we are
in the oracle service bus console and
project explorer and first we'll create
a new session to keep track of our
changes in this proxy services folder
there's an order management proxy
service we'll edit the message flow for
this service by clicking this edit
message flow icon you can see that this
proxy service has an operational branch
with two operations in a default branch
we're going to edit this get orders for
customer branch and here you see one
route node which simply routes to the
order management business service this
is where we'll add the error handler by
selecting this add route error handler
now we'll add a stage node to the error
handler and then edit the stage note and
this is where we add the action we want
to perform in the case of an error for
this error handler we're going to write
a message to the log so we'll add an
action
and select reporting log now we
construct the message to be logged the
expression is the message context to be
locked and will enter the fault variable
this contains the error code as well as
details on the error we'll click Save
next we'll enter the text that would
like to be logged in this annotation
field and we'll select the severity of
the log message in this case we'll make
it warning
lastly we'll click this log icon and add
an action to the flow control and select
reply and we'll set that reply to with
failure so that's it
now we'll save everything and will
activate the session and the change
Center enter a description then submit
the changes now let's run a test to make
sure the error handler is working
correctly we'll return to the proxy
services folder and will bring up the
test console for the order management
proxy service and from the available
options we'll select get orders for
customer for this service the only valid
customer IDs are 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 so we'll
enter an invalid one say 8 and execute
it the response document correctly
indicates an error and that the customer
was not found so to view our log message
that should have been created let's
close the test console and this browser
window and here we see the terminal
window that was used to start the
service bus and here's our logged error
so the error handler we created is
working correctly
so that's it for creating an error
handler in Oracle service bus thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
