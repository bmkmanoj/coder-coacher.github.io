Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series this demonstration shows you
how to monitor your database using the
new ash analytics graphics that enhance
what was called top activities in
previous releases
okay so from here let's go to the target
menus and select databases then select
the database you want to monitor and
from there click performance and ash
analytics with the new ash analytics
page you can see two things essentially
the graphic at the top is a high-level
overview of your monitoring period by
default it shows the last hour but you
can change this to the last day for
example there is also a time slider you
can move along the timeline to zoom on
that particular period which refreshes
the second graphic on that page let's go
back to the last hour and let's scroll
the slider to this period you can also
extend the slider window to match better
what you want to look at the second
graphic shows you the corresponding
activity in terms of weight classes but
you can change that so for example let's
look at the activity in terms of
services here when you pass your mouse
over the graphic you can highlight a
service here and when you click a filter
is created to show you the activity in
terms of weight classes but for that
particular service let's now look at the
activity in terms of modules here again
you can pass your mouse over the graphic
to highlight a particular module and
create a filter for it finally let's
view the activity using actions
scrolling down the page you can see more
details for your analyzed period here
you have the details by sequel
statements as well as user sessions you
can again customize this last part of
the page for example let's view details
about weight classes and then weight
events you can remove your filters if
you want last part of the demo shows a
different view of your activity called
load map view in load map view mode you
see boxes representing values tuning
dimensions weight classes and weight
events here you
Rio and corresponding weight events like
db5 parallel reads you can now change
the representation to use up to three
dimensions service module and sequel ID
in the example
however the graphic still use only the
first two dimensions you can look at the
third one by moving the dimension slider
the Advanced Mode allows you to fully
customize your viewed dimension on this
graphic here we keep the first and
second one and we select user session
for the third one
this is the end of the demonstration
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
