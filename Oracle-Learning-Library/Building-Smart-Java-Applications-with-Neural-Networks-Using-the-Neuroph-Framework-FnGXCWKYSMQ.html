to our session about neural networks I'm
very very glad to see that there are so
many people interested actually about
your networks
my name is Zoran Schwarz and I come from
the University of Belgrade I work for
the artificial intelligence lab and
together with me is a gauge and we Langa
he works for oracle his principal
NetBeans director right ok so just
before we start can you please give me
some feedback about what are your
previous experience what what is your
background
so please raise your hand all of you who
have been using neural networks with at
all ok great
and how many of you are there who have
some haven't been using your lettuce but
here some theoretical background about
your networks ok wait so then I will
make this introductory story very brief
just to don't know it what we are
talking about and get to the demos and
the neural frame to show some real-world
examples so neural networks are machine
learning technique that is able to learn
from the data and create a sort of
input/output mapping so the idea is to
take some data set and to define what
outputs do we want to get for that data
set and neural network provided the data
can learn and provide that mapping well
when we say it like that that means that
we don't need to program at all right we
just use your own network and create
some with some kind of a magic it learns
what we need to what we need to have the
created a functionality that we need but
it's not that way at all it requires lot
of experimenting tweaking
the programming to get them work right
so the basic idea behind the neural
networks are that they are a model very
rough model of what we know about the
brain how the brain works and we have a
set of neurons that I that are
interconnected with the neural
connections and while they interact they
modify the connections right and this is
how they learn so the key for learning
is modification of these connections
what's very interesting about them is
that actually their main feature is that
learning capability and the thing that
they are able to generalize from the
data they have learned
that means that they can successfully
solve problems also with the data they
haven't been learning so with the data
they haven't seen and very nice thing
also is that they are resistant for
noise too noisy and incomplete data that
makes them very suitable for practical
practical applications which are very
difficult or impossible to solve any
other way the typical problems that
neural networks are used include
problems like classification that's one
of the most typical applications then
recognition problems which include image
face fingerprint sound recognition or
any kind of signal processing processing
in recognition then approximation so if
we have some amount of data about some
system that we don't know how it works
but we have data that describes its
behavior which can be represented as
input/output pairs we can use that data
to train the network and to get the
approximation
the system behavior even if we don't
know anything about it also on typical
application is prediction so very
popular is time series prediction which
can be used for stock market prediction
or weather prediction network traffic
prediction application load prediction
and all sort kind of things and at last
but this is not extensive list of
applications but the one are the most as
let me say popular is the optimization
problem so when we have many parameters
that control the behavior of the system
and it's very hard to tweak them by any
meaningful way because we don't know
much or enough about the system then we
can use neural network to model the
system and figure out the optimal
parameters for its operation so how do
you use all of this in practice how do
you use this for java application well
there are several frameworks for neural
network and two of the most popular at
the moment our new off and ankle today
we will talk about neuro framework which
is the project that was originally
developed at the artificial intelligence
lab at the University of Belgrade and it
was a project that I started as a
student and then continued to develop
through my career so neuro is an open
source java framework for creating your
own networks that can be easily used in
java applications so you we have a java
library right and be here can you do
something with the sound into i don't
know looks like it's fine it means it's
fit yeah feedback right feedback
okay the neuro framework provides Java
library which is a simple small jar file
and also a development environment which
is a based on NetBeans platform for
creating this neural networks the
developer environment is a very is
integrated with NetBeans IDE so it's
very simple to create a neural network
in Europe studio and then use that
neural network in your java application
when you create neural network you can
save it as a it saved as a serialized
Java object so it's very easy to load
that Network into your plain Java
program and use very simple and
convenient API to the tomato that will
do what it is intended for so one of the
also one of the very important features
is that neuro v is very easy to extend
and customize do is designed its design
is very clear and logical object
oriented and it has a very clear
extension point and it has a plug-in
system so that's plugin systems provides
separation or the neural network design
and the specific application so if you
want image recognition you create plugin
for image recognition if you want stock
market prediction you create plugin for
stock market protection and so on so the
basic classes that are used within
framework are they stay clean from
application specific code so out of the
box and Europe provides some examples
like I only said for image recognition
OCR optical character recognition and
time series prediction these features
are not the production already I must
say they are very basic ones but you get
the idea how to use them
create stuff on your own current
applications of the neuro framework
include the education it's been using at
our University for teaching neural
networks and it's a very nice because
it's clear thanks to it's clear design
students can easily with the basic Java
noise you get the idea what is going on
and they are ready to use it and also
using that application Europe studio and
insulator application secured or also
research applications there are many
applications for voice recognition for
estimation of effort in software testing
and so on and of course there are
real-world applications that were that
are using neuro for sure at the moment
we have about 600 of downloads per week
which is a pretty good number for the
this specific application type of
framework the whole framework and
documentation is available on the frame
oxide which is Junior of dot
sourceforge.net so I will just summarize
a few most important features of the
neural framework is that and who are the
main which are the main reason why it
have became so popular it is at first
point clear design it is easy to follow
because usually when you start doing
your own stuff you figure out that you
want something something's done
different and you want to change anyone
to experiment and if you are not able to
tweak code and behavior which is a
common requirement then you are not able
to use a framework efficiently which is
the case for many other frameworks for
encode for example it is based on it has
array based implementation and it is
very hard to figure out what is going on
in all the for loops and arrays while in
Europe you have a clear object design
then you have a very
documentation and support we have formed
and ticketing system and our community
do its best to answer all the questions
then is the rich user interface which is
based the NetBeans platform
it's called neuro Studio and it was the
big step for the new off when it's
ported to NetBeans platform and it's why
is Gretchen also today with us to tell
you to give your ideas about your
project so what it can do I will show
you the download statistics and then it
will be clear to you what I'm talking
about and less may be the most important
is that it is very easy to use in other
application in other words in your own
application so that was the primary idea
to bring the neural network power into
the hands of regular Java developers who
maybe are not familiar with neural
networks and they don't have to know the
details of the algorithms they just
should be able that's a long long term
vision which we are getting close to
using a drag-and-drop interface to put
the network for image recognition to put
the prediction network in their
application and drop it and use it as a
Java Bean for example so just to show
you some projects thoghte istic s--
since the version 2.1 you see that we
had the average 30 downloads per day and
at the moment we have with version 2.5
we had 90 80 80 and then 65 we the
actual version 2.6 but since we have not
released the newer version it is not
listed here so what I would like to show
you here is that data for the version
2.5 it is outlined with blue and you can
see that release lifetime of 2.4 was 240
days that's because the development of
2.5 was take to take long time and
that's when we were porting to NetBeans
platform but if you take a look at the
average daily downloads you can see
that we have jumped from 36 to 90
downloads per day which is a really big
thing for our framework because suddenly
it became very easy to use and intuitive
to users and it could do more powerful
stuff so this is the the screenshot how
the neural studio application looks like
and this is a wizard it is visual based
so you can say new neural network next
next next and set the parameters and
create new neural network so the reasons
why we decided to port to NetBeans
platform is it we realized from the
beginning that people well actually we
needed I needed some nice user interface
that would be easy to create neural
networks and to just to play with them
and at the moment there were no such a
tool that would satisfy my preferences
so I started working on it and I think
we have developed three different
versions of the user interface and at
some point each of them started to
become very buggy and it took a lot of
effort took a lot of time to add new
features and then we find out about
NetBeans platform and then we move
decided to move it and get the project
system and get that navigator and get
with the visual tool you have a palette
and just drop neural networks components
to create neural networks but when we
ported then we here we realized that
there is much more to gain from porting
like reusing a lot of stuff that there
is already created in on NetBeans
platform and integrate with existing
things like that real time graph drawing
that you are going to see later and
there is a great opportunity to
integrate with other NetBeans platform
applications like for example NetBeans
IDE itself so we have one application
you can we can do the neural network
development at Java development so we
don't have to jump from the neural
network application to develop to java
application some ID
it's much easier to do work with and
many other things like update system
which is not implemented yet but is one
of the first enough to-do list
easier design which improved design
which made application easier to extend
in and maintain with the system of
plugins because that means platform
provides that plug-in system and in
general we have improved overall quality
and ensured some future development of
the application so here is a little list
about who is using Europe well here are
some links you can see more at the new
off site at the application link here
this is geogebra it is the mathematic
software for teaching it uses a new of
OCR support then thanks to data Rio
there is a set of engineering
application that makes a Nerf available
from the Amazon Cloud then recently a
group at of at our University have
created a planner of plug-in for data
miner which is a well known data mining
application and the results some tests
showed that the neuro four provided the
better performance than the existing
rapid minor plateau in your networks
about oh well just the second we hear
about to lose the power stop sorry for
this down on the wheels via the pedals
ok so here this then I there are two
research applications to research papers
you can find it's a test effort
estimation using your own network
published in Journal of software
engineering in application and the
framework for integrated The Voice
environment which is published on the
conference
listed below then there are many game
applications one of them is tic-tac-toe
with the new of neural networks which is
available also on SourceForge so these
are just some of them on this liking you
have more and I'm sure that there are
many of them more just I don't I'm not
aware of so if you create something
interesting please let me know so I can
list you there
so I'm going to show you few demos to
get the idea how it works here first I
will show you a sample which I'm showing
to my students usually to give them idea
what is all about with your sample sorry
samples Douglas we have this nice
research system is recently won in
Europe sample let's discuss off' ocation
sample which is probably very familiar
to the people who have already broken or
actually but enjoy it's very nice and to
see so let's create some classification
problem by clicking on this say data
space we have two features and we have
red dots and blue dots which represents
features of some object that we have
transform into the American miracle form
right and now we want to make the
network to learn this problem so in the
sample we can set the parameters like
save a number of neurons let's say 8
hidden neurons number of input neurons
is known we have two input neurons it
since we have two dimensions and the
number of output neurons is a one and it
distinguishes between two classes a red
and blue and we just get this which can
set these parameters for learning let's
say learn with your points - that's my
favorite one and momentum 0.78 not
really in the for the most application
it works it's amazing
and now when we put it to train you see
what we see seongjo p.m. yeah yeah for
visually on this component here this is
we took that component from the visual
VM it is the only way you can draw
real-time charts as far as I know in
Java right because we have created a one
component but it is very hard when you
want the real-time charting because you
have to scroll at some point and it was
very buggy and blinking the way when we
were doing so you see this is how it
looks doing the visualization of the
problem how the neural network you learn
the problem so in order to make a things
little bit difficult for this poor
Network right we're going to do things
like this and show you how it works
right let's say we got some more data
and we say come on it'll prolong this
and here we can observe observe what it
is going on how it is adjusting its
right and here is the network we can
also take a look at the graph but as you
can see it has issues to learn this
right because it doesn't help but it's
not it's not bad at all see there are
some of them which are not covered but
it's good and you see you cannot do
things like this with some algorithm
know that you are going to code well
maybe in some case you can but when you
have new data coming during the system
operation and you want to adapt the
behavior of your application to that new
data you want to create adaptive
controller then you can use neural
network so so we can play with this you
know we can fully Network add some
things more and let's make it really
difficult to put some things here
let's see I won't mess with this example
but well now it is very confused right
come on a trip but so having my keep in
mind that this is a network with only
eight neurons right let's try to put
more neurons let's try to put 12 neurons
and put another layer of neurons let's
say eight we put two two layers of
neurons and then hit let's see what it
is going to it is not here it is for
some time we to try try try while it's
trying yeah so it's just the thing of
trying different parameters like the
setting the writer heat textured the
right number of neurons and what's nice
with this I think this is the network
point
yes it's turn and we can we can take a
look at the network you see here right
these are the Neuros for example you can
see this is the first version of the
visualization of that network but ok I
can shut down something suddenly these
windows and we can observe the network
error look like how smooth the scrolling
is and I will oops then nothing is
flickering and yeah see it is a very
difficult problem for network to learn
and it takes time sometimes change may
take four hours ok I can stop it now
to show you this part application so
what does maybe you want to try
different number of neurons to increase
to create less and then you can go to
this design view of a neural net so this
is the visual editor created with the
lip visual library from the NetBeans
platform as
you see this is network architecture so
we can see we have a LED here we can
drag and drop more neurons here and we
can connect them to this right put two
more neurons or we can remove some
neurons from this layer right or we can
add add new layer to network and add
more neurons right and can easily
connect in neurons so you can create a
custom architectural and it's something
what I always it's a kind of a brain
builder right something everyone needs
and here is the training sets right you
can take a look how the training data
looks like the dots that we were
clicking on the screen this is them that
date so let me see how we are which time
okay I will you can download the
software and play with this examples in
detail a help system ok and now this was
just a sample to show you how it works
now we are going to do some like real
world application like image recognition
so we create so the task is the
following assume that it is here we have
the set of the following images right a
joke or gurchin Java logo Java 1 logo
NetBeans NetBeans Dream Team Oracle and
Zorin and we want to create neural
network it will distinguish that will
recognize these images so it's very
simple we create the new Europe project
like in
reclamation right and then we say create
new image recognition network and then
this is a wizard we say it says select
image that we you want to recognize so
we go to a folder and just select the
folder with images and week here we can
see all of these images that should be
recognized right and then we hit next
and on the next screen we are asked to
select images that we don't want to be
recognized so this is a kind of a trick
to help the network to learn the better
easier we use all blue or green and all
red because the image information which
is extracted is converted to RGB data
and normalize so if you want to avoid
whitespace background whatever is in
background we don't want to network to
learn the background we want to network
to ignore the background which is this
case the white and now we create
training set label say image data and
image resolution sampling which will we
use 20 by 10 so we are going to scale
these images in order to create smaller
Network and do the faster learning
because this network will have a lot of
new input neurons for every pixel of the
network we have three new neurons for
every component of the color so we have
20 times 10 it's 200 a M times 3 it's
600 neurons
input neurons so we say we lose image
net and we let's say we use 12 neurons
hidden neurons and say next and here we
get a neural network and the training
date so you see you have a visit you
provide your problem right images you
want to learn and the application
creates the network that you need we say
trainer Network right select this tree
set up on the network hit train button
then we can set the training parameters
again my favorite ones your point ten
points and try it it really works it's a
magic number and here is the network
learn graph okay it is very fast just
one hundred nearly two hundred
iterations done but now let's see how it
works here we have a test window we can
select images right and let's say we
select
gurchin right so the probability that
this image is virtual is 0.9 while the
all other you see is zero point zero one
zero point zero so the neuron with the
highest activation corresponds to the
image that it is recognized let's say
select Duke so this is joke
we have zero point nine for Duke and
less for all others so let's say if you
want to recognize Oracle this is or 0.8
and everything less is nearly zero you
know because your networks are not very
precise they are very rough approximated
but they give you idea what's going on
so you can usually you use your network
in combination with some other approach
not just your net and it can help deal
with the parts that are difficult to do
some other way so wait can you show you
how you include these results in an
actual application so once you have this
yes I can show you
sorry err clay yeah testing almost
acoustic almost the same set as the
that's what you fed it in yeah yeah well
then you have to pare prepare prepare a
little bit disturbed test training set
for example include some disturbing
images disturbed variation of images for
each image that you want to recognize
well I have not prepared either but it's
a good idea we can try and publish it
down website maybe you could try and
contribute to your afraid so these are a
few lines of code - code the shows how
to use this so when we hit save okay so
when we have created Network we hit save
and it is save this here in the new york
project okay this is that neural network
and - in order to load that network in
your application is here used this
static allowed method saying neural
network load and you specify the file
name that contains train network then
you get the image recognition plug-in
from that network with the simply get
plug-in here method and then you call
recognize image method from that plug-in
so you have only three lines of code to
use that image to use that neural
network so this is the thing we have an
application-specific plug-in that
provides interface that is required for
your application so it's a very clean
approach that is easy to use by the end
the others one
oh yeah sorry
so okay this is was the imagery it can
be produced also from the Java code you
have neural network save method right
which says the current instance of the
yes yes
so another typical application that I
will show oh how much time here okay
since it's a stock market prediction
well I must say that this is not a
production ready support but we have
some basic report will show how it can
be done and in just a matter of playing
with it a bit so to make it work again
we are creating the neural project right
so as to home soon okay and we starts
this wizard for stock prediction so
before I get started visit I will show
you how we are explaining bit how we are
going to do it so we have this is this
world you know okay this is the one this
is the file that contains the price of
the chicken alright
on the market so we want to predict
where the price of your chicken is going
to go up or down and to decide whether
we are going to sell or buy chickens
yeah this is contributed by one of our
community members so this is a very
basic support for stock prediction it is
based on time series prediction and it
is it is using the windowing technique I
guess that you are quite familiar know
what I'm talking about which basically
means that you are using that data about
the chicken price to create a data set
to predict and you for example you're
using a price for the three days to
predict price for the fourth day and you
go through the whole data set and use
first three days as an input and the
fourth date as up then use next three
days as an input and fourth day as an
out so this is how you do it again we
have a Wizards to do this start stock
market prediction wizard and you choose
the file that contains chicken price
data then you say specified the limiter
in that file it will be a white space
let's say name for the data set it will
be chickens data and when you input data
it has to be normalized it has to be
scaled to the interval between 0 and 1
in order to so it can be used by a
neural net so since our chicken data is
between 0 and 100 the decimal scaled
normalization factor will be 100 so we
will make sure that they are all less
than 1 next we set the parameters that
we use for time series prediction
the first one is memory it means how
many days we are looking behind so we
can say we will look three days or four
days or five days or how much you want
let's say we will be looking for four
days
next parameter is frequency which is
basic assembling rate it means are we
going to look at each day or we are
going to look at every second day or
every third day so these are parameters
which are very tricky to adjust and the
prediction depends on them very much and
the steps are head is a parameter that
decides how many days are here we are
trying to predict usually we use the one
because more using more steps ahead is
error-prone then we set the neural
network parameters okay
put for example nine neurons and hit
finish again we get the neural network
we get the training data and we hit
train but since this we have to lower
the error since this date is okay so the
troop is training button you can see it
nice on this graph because it is too low
this is very small error because the
data is normalized but to see the
network is going down but it will
probably take some time we can say it is
one point two and it should be this form
so since we don't have much time to wait
until the schedule gets trained I'll
just show you how they do you use
predictions so we will assume that it
has been trained so you select the
neural network this is the window for
testing network normalization scale
we'll say the chicken price some input
let's say this was this was the data
used let's say I enter a prices for the
chicken for the four days and I try to
predict see and it says it would be 86
and actually it should be 81 but we have
not trained we have not finished
finished training what's important that
the price grows right so the prediction
no not really
it is there are two time types of time
series prediction one when you're trying
to predict exact value and the other
type when you just try to predict a
trend is it going to grow or is the one
to fall so if it grows then keep your
chickens and wait to sell you when it's
the network predicts that the price is
going to fall right so let's that was it
and the last thing that I've promised at
the abstract session abstract is that
something that I'm planning to do and I
to be honest I haven't made some
experiments with it but I'm preparing
and well the idea is to use a neural
network to approximate the behavior of a
java application of the java virtual
machine of the garbage collector and
then to try to optimize the parameters
and so you can optimize for example size
of the heap or the all those parameters
that determine the behavior of garbage
collector there are I know if we take a
look at the list there are dozens of
them so you can use and it is very hard
to tweak them all and it is very
nonlinear behavior and there is no way
someone can give you rules for doing it
so people have actually done this and
this is I borrowed these slides from the
folks you can place it here on the
Georgia Tech company and from Intel and
they have been using for tuning the
workload for the
and this is see this problem this red
dots look familiar to you right but not
it's not two dimensional space it's a
three dimensional space which is
perfectly right and can be used for
Europe right away and we have a
different layers like Hardware operating
system setting Java the machine job
application server and your application
so if you want to get the idea what is
going on how your application behaves on
a different workload or how it behaves
with the different settings for the GBM
you can sample get the sample about your
application how it performs determine
the configuration parameters for input
and the value that you are going to
check for an output so what they have
done they took a thread pool size and
JVM heap size and check the response
time of their application right and
there is a way you can validate the
model so you can make sure that it
behaves well so I will try to do it and
if any one of you do it before me please
let me know so this is what
configuration parameters they have been
using thread count assigned to different
and serrated so I think you have seen
how it looks the best bathroom
application and the gurchin is here
today to tell you okay what are the
benefits for if you are creating some
application desktop application you have
some framework you want to improve the
UI here are some yeah just just very
quickly the framework underneath this
application is called the NetBeans
platform and it enables Zorin and the
team working on this project to
immediately begin working on the domain
level they don't need to worry about the
architecture they don't need to worry
about the window system that don't need
to worry about the action system the
menu bar the tool bar all of
are provided out of the box by the
NetBeans platform it's an open source
and free application framework that you
can use as the basis of your own
software and you might recognize this
partially if you've used Nicktoons ide
but also Getty also the NATO system that
has run the Jukes Choice Award and this
year the Agora sells for our management
system that is also in a Duke's Choice
Award and a refugee management system
used by the UNHCR which is also an
induced choice award so there's a lot of
development going on on top of this
framework and enabling this kind of
application to be developed much faster
than it would otherwise have done I've
got a whole bunch of cheat sheets and
introductory cards about this framework
right here so if anyone's interested you
can stop by here afterwards and pick it
up and it provides all the information
all the links to tutorials and books and
everything that you might need okay
