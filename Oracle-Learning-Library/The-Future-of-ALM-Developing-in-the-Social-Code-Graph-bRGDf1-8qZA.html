the CEO at co and of Tesla technologies
and I created in leave the Eclipse my
own project and I'll explain this
visualization bit more later but what's
happening here is that we've run some of
our tools over the entire history of the
the Milan project on Eclipse and what
we're seeing actually is the evolution
of the social relationships in that
project The Closer that people are that
actually the more they've worked
together I see actually whenever i watch
this at the start of the talk I've done
this a couple times now I see something
new Act you can see the startup task of
technologies at one point in the history
and the people kind of clustering
together people who now work very
closely and work on the same teams
within our company some other are some
other companies and projects forming
around as well so I'll get back to how
this works a little bit later and show
you this actual tool in action but to
start I just want to frame the thing
that you usually used to hearing these
conferences which is that there's we've
got a lot of software out there and this
software you know you're hearing about
platform as a service and all these feel
modularity technologies new languages
like Scala for helping us deal with that
but the amount of code that we've got is
not shrinking right if you look at
what's in cars now you've got around 100
million lines of code right this bizarre
thing has happened on the tob
programming indexed in the past I think
it was like five months ago or so which
is that C overtook Java because of just
how much embedded code there's out there
now javis number 2 c's number one even
though you know most of the programming
that we think of is Java there's just
there are a lot of devices out there the
and you know that might change again is
more enterprise applications are
developed and there probably will but
either way there's just this
proliferation of code across the mobile
devices not just enterprise applications
anymore the cars themselves are going to
end up with 300 million lines of code in
the near future there's a really good i
triple e article called this this car
runs on code that speaks to this and the
interesting thing is that the way that
the software is being built is getting
pretty complex so with some of the
automotive manufacturers that we work
with they will have dozens of software
suppliers
write the code is not being built just
within your own organization anymore in
your own applications you'd probably
have a pretty complex supply chain
because you're building if you're
building absolutely Java you'll have
some open source projects that you
consume you host it on Apache I'm hosted
on java.net or elsewhere so we're
getting this interesting software supply
chain the set of interdependencies in
the way that are at you know basically
what's going through applications both
from the sort of you know library
composition point of view the SDKs that
you build on and now also from this you
know it's more cloud based consumption
where you've got services just rest
services that you're using and that
really make up the user experience in
your application it's not just you know
a database that's connecting to anymore
so we're hearing a lot about those
technologies that help us deal with this
but the code is the amount of code that
we're dealing with as developers and I
did they work as not getting smaller
it's getting larger and the
interdependencies are getting larger and
those interdependencies actually get
very interesting because they will span
your company boundaries boundaries
within your company within the
organization when you've got different
teams that dependencies and also again
this thing that's becoming a software
ecosystem this complex supply chain of
software so I I gave this talk I should
Eclipse Con this year and this this
really interesting thing has happened
because Eclipse as a leading Java IDE
and I should mention on the eclipse
board of directors as well so these are
this is where I got these statistics in
January of 2011 was seeing 1.5 million
downloads then and the green part of the
circle was down as downs from Asia a
year later that's the downloads from
Asia right in this period of time Asia
actually exceeded some Vietnam exceeded
Germany number of Eclipse downloads so
that's again the Android tools are built
on Eclipse so those kinds of factors
play in we've got a lot just the volume
is growing in terms of the other thing I
should mention to you is that Eclipse
has been flatlined in downloads for a
few years as well before that so there's
been the spike there's been something of
a discontinuity as we get into mobile
and then the cloud infrastructures to
support it
so this whole thing that Marc Andreessen
was saying that software is eating the
world is is you know it seems quite real
at this stage we've got a software
ecosystem and what feels like this
crisis if you look at San Francisco
rental prices with a number of
developers they have to be moved into
the city now to support this but a
fundamentally constrained workforce
because you can't grow workforces in an
exponential way even though the code is
going to exponential way and these
annoying things are happening is a side
effect right as the volume of software
grows you know software maintenance
costs are now seventy percent we're
spending so much of our time not even
building interesting business value in
these applications but doing these kinds
of maintenance tasks coordinating things
as the software gets more and more
complex so whenever there's been this
kind of crisis in production there's
always been a question we have sort of
with every one of these revolutions
there's been a question of you know how
do you scale production and if you look
back at factories when you had these
algorithms factories basically there was
taylorism and this approach to specking
out these manual tasks of having people
put widgets together so you could get
some predictability into Factory and you
could scale the production of widgets
and this really helps support the
Industrial Revolution and the sort of
the first factories by just scaling
people when you had this Taylor wrist
approach this this thing happened with
to those people which is that they were
pretty unhappy because they were
basically being treated like cogs in the
machine you know we've got examples
right now and in the supply chain of the
devices that we use of people in exactly
this environment and with software the
interesting thing is that you can't
really do this right you actually
companies in the bay I know they have to
keep your developers happy so this kind
of scaling purely on throwing people at
projects doesn't work in software it
didn't what happened in the with Henry
Ford so at the turn of the century you
think 1914 he realized and that's
similar in the car he realized that all
of his competition was using the same
approach basically treating people in
the manufacturing process as
you know dumb cogs in the machine and he
did this really interesting thing he
doubled the salaries of his workers they
were twice as high as his competition in
1914 link was the day and he saw some
interesting results from that because he
immediately got to got ahead of his
competition so what he did is he
actually put more emphasis okie doubled
the salaries he also provided training
programs so there was some empowerment
of the work of the individual worker at
that point they were not being just
treat he was investing in the worker
both in terms of their salary and in
terms of need them to be skilled so not
just stealing out but scaling on on the
individual worker it was purely
centralized decision-making though you
know they were still in terms of the
managerial structure the organizational
structure they were still treated very
much like a cog and that thing then so
that was for them that generation of
cars and you know cars are some the most
interesting things we manufacture or we
were manufacturing at scale now it's
becoming software had another
interesting transformation around you
know between 1950 1975 with the Toyota
Production system so the Toyota
Production system took this it did some
of the things that were very familiar
with it with you're just in time it
coined that before our virtual machines
did it had just in time production and
inventory and the fact that you you this
is just the foundation of lean so lean
manufacturing which you know translates
directly to the concepts of agile and
the whole principles of the Toyota
Production system is what you hear
non-stop if you do end up going to the
agile conference and or to some of those
other conferences so we've got these
lean principles which I'll come back to
and this other interesting thing which
is they called autonomy shin and this
was the basically empowerment of the
worker and the management's change the
fact that every worker had the ability
to make decisions about production for
example about quality at any point you
know you could ring the bell and and one
individual worker could stop the entire
production line so they were now no
longer even the cog you know as this
works or you know got more creative got
more sophisticated they actually had
power within the management chain there
was this reporting and traceability this
principle con-con bond that went
throughout
the production line and this interesting
trend so one of my favorite authors
Peter Drucker observed this phenomenon
and as this work was involving more and
more skill these people were becoming
knowledge workers and the knowledge
workers the key thing with knowledge
workers is you know what to drive their
productivity is that's what is their
task and for their task to give them the
responsibility the tools and the
training everything else needed to
complete that pass to do it themselves
so the other key thing is that knowledge
workers and again this is obviously I'm
going to you know relating back to
software but Peter Drucker's talking
with us in general they have to manage
themselves they have to have this kind
of autonomy in any production process
and we've seen some just very
interesting changes in the way software
delivered over the last 10 years going
from something that's much more sort of
tailoress than a Ford Ian like
clearquest and the rational unified
process to the way that we build
software day with tools like get and and
with something lightweight frameworks
and tools that we use which I'll touch
on soon so in this talk I'm going to
relate these two things you know the
fact that how much things have
transformed DevOps borat will be used
for color commentary saying things like
you know and DevOps we are communicate
with coworkers only using JIRA tickets
the fact that there's been this
fundamental shift and this shift has to
do with i'll show you task becoming very
explicit and empowerment and the social
fabric becoming the thing that drives
the way that we write code and that
actually connects you know with explicit
links the way that we code so just three
concepts for this talk this idea of
autonomy it's key in the way that ALM
evolves because then again the stock is
going to relate back to the way that ALM
is becoming was social so you've got
your application development tools where
you care about your past your vm 0
language the and that those determine
how your applications running where I've
been focused in in my work and research
has been on the application lifecycle
management tools so ALM tools the tools
for agile like issue trackers as source
code management tools and so on the
things that define how your application
evolves over
time and in those tools this big shift
has to do with autonomy with
transparency which is being driven by
open sores and then with collaboration
these tools becoming very collaborative
so the whole idea is that you know it's
one thing if you can if you got your own
github project you're contributing to
another Forge or something like that
you're working with these things day
today but the key thing that we need to
do now is to drive these things into the
firewall to drive these things into your
ganization because in the organization's
if you've got that small projects or for
motivated people it's very different
you're just communicating with each
other using these lightweight tools if
you're building large-scale software
you've got these organizational styles
that are necessary you actually you're
not going to throw out your testers that
way within a small pro small project
although yes I did hear an interesting
story by someone who came down came to a
booth saying that their testers weren't
adopting JIRA fast enough this is from
like a fortune 50 company so they
started firing them because you know
they want to move them off quality
center into JIRA and then a few months
later they realized that was a big
mistake so we've got these people who
are siloed in these tools the testers
have their quality center and they live
and breathe it let's say project
managers have the agile to liquor stores
like rally version 1 mingle or rational
team concert developers have the tools
that they love and there's been a ton of
change in those developer tools some the
biggest innovation these basically
rebellions of agile and the open source
tools which you know sort of like blew
up that whole rigid world of the
rational unified process business
analysts can't go away they need the
requires management tools and
storyboarding those sorts of things and
we've got a new breed of DevOps tools as
well for you know whether it's for the
help desk or actually keeping the you
know the apps running in production so
promise we've got these silos and as he
says you know those are pretty
fundamental and the whole thing here is
to start looking at those just quickly
from a cultural dimension and then from
I you know I think is key here is from a
tool dimension so the cultural gaps are
real people completely you know view
themselves differently we know that
developers see themselves as you know
it's basically rocket scientists and
designers see themselves the applicant
in the business analyst you can put
business down
and what's in the middle there project
managers think of developers as slaves
and so on right these are some of the
stereotypes we actually do have
ingrained in organization life yeah I
find this graphic hilarious so you know
agile is trying to drive some of these
these cultural things but as you can see
here you know in traditional project
management you can think of scrum
masters that or DevOps will think of a
scrum masters a tooth fairy so we've got
you know just because there's this new
fashion in one part of the life cycle in
one set of stakeholders doesn't mean
that translates the interesting thread
across the companies we work with though
is that developers are
disproportionately powerful in its
transformation because in the end their
output you know this delivers on that
business value that everyone else wants
and that now is the key thing is now
differentiating companies in the market
FedEx thinks of itself as a software
company describes itself as a software
company because the way differentiates
itself is through its software so when
this fails when you basically fail to
connect those silos and both again
within the organization so those silos i
showed you were within the organization
those Silas will also be in your
software supply chain very bad things
happen when you don't have them
connected so first of all you know
you're just your delivery process grinds
to a halt that's sort of velocity that
you have when you work in a small
project it just doesn't scale out right
your teams are not you know you're if
you're testing is the bottleneck or your
bas are the bottleneck on communicating
what's going on you're not getting far
this interesting story i read in um this
was in 2011 when the 787 got delayed
again you know that plane it's flying
now which is great it's a beautiful
plane but i read this article where the
general manager of the project said it's
not that the brakes don't work which is
good it's the traceability of the
software and they delayed it multiple
months for this without explaining what
that meant so I looked into a little bit
more they had outsourced the brake
system so is G during the break software
they outsource that to a French company
the French company used a different ALM
stack
because that's what you know other
companies do just like if you outsource
any of your QA they're using other tools
and sending you spreadsheets or
something like that at the end of the
day so the stuff of the living is not
connected right the life cycle is not
connected so yeah they sent them the
brake system everything worked at pastel
specs the subvert either could the code
was had been I think in their subversion
and the there were no links between the
requirements that they were sent and the
source code so there was no traceability
right that those links that you need a
cross those silos because those silos
tend to use different tools was you know
would probably would have been with a
more traditional requirements management
tools or clearquest type tools and where
the requirements were stored they were
just no links and boeing has to maintain
its software for 70 years because 35
years at approximately about 35 years
for the active span of that plane and
then 35 which being actively produced in
35 years maintenance so just like in the
mile and open source project we do not
accept any patches without task contexts
and links between the SCM system and
issues because we just don't have the
resources on this open source project to
maintain that we know that over time
boeing's actually formalized this for us
which resource constraints like many
popular open source projects has have
where the number of users and
contributors just orders of magnitude
higher than the number of core commuters
for them it's just this long maintenance
timeframe so they threw out the whole
brake system would read it from scratch
and the way I started looking at this
thing with these notions of lena's
through this idea of batch sizes so if
you look at the way that software is
built and sort of more waterfalls ways
which you want to move away from you've
got bas doing the requirements then
developers do their development these
are kind of spikes in the number of
works basically the number of tasks they
create because all the requirements
tasks when they turn into you know Giro
bugzilla or track issues you've got a
number they grow even more development
task from requirements you might make
them to epics and user stories and tasks
and defects and so on testing will do
something and you've basically got these
very big discrete disconnects because
you're batching up huge numbers of tasks
so with all our think you know both when
the milan project what we do a test of
all our thinking is how we help you
manage these time
and what the tasks are so you've got
this very this very big batch sizes the
whole principle of lean manufacturing is
that you shrink down your batch sizes
but we tend to think of bad sizes as in
software and I think a lot of yeah all
thinking with we tend to think of the
bad sides of this code not as task right
the you don't think one of the popular
stories about the lean movement is you
know if next time you're sending your
Christmas cards and your with your
significant other we tend to think that
it's better you know to have us I don't
I don't help enough of this process and
i'm going to try more this year but you
know let's say theoretically let's say i
actually wrote all the cards then my
wife would seal the envelopes and stamps
them that turns out to be much slower in
practice then if we just took half the
cards and did the whole process
ourselves so we never bashed up the work
because we always underestimate the work
it takes to coordinate and sort things
so we like to batch things up then
divide labor it's slower and that's
that's lean manufacturing also if
there's any errors at any stage it's not
only slower but wait risk you're right
if I got our address wrong which is not
impossible then it's I'm going to have
every card messed up where she might
have noted you know she only have half
the cards messed up otherwise so a big
thing about this is to reduce down these
tasks batch sizes when we're breaking
down the bat size does occur because of
the silos whether they're again there in
our supply chain because you don't
communicate enough with the open source
project that you're consuming and you
don't find out about the security
defects that they just learned about
till you've after you've shipped your
application and expose them to your
users or because you know you've got a
problem like this within your own supply
chain so with all this I think a key
principles that we think about reducing
these task bad sizes I'll give you a
quick example of how we've done this
other clips and basically the stack the
open-source alm stack at eclipse so
we've got the source codes now almost
all and gets CVS is that with the
classical or the previous SCM at Eclipse
about 60 million lines of code so
the Eclipse builds that ship
year-on-year they're about the same size
number of lines of source code as I
think Vista was 60 million lines I don't
know what Windows 8 is bugzilla there's
now over just under 400,000 tasks so
those tasks define the evolution of
eclipse I'll get back to why they're so
interesting in a moment that's where all
the collaborations anchored there's code
and tasks there's a bunch of builds
actually they've been pruned down
there's now two hundred Hudson build
plans or jobs Garrett is on the rise of
the clips there's a lot of usage of
Garrett and what's interesting thing is
all of these tools have been created by
these people and you know the operations
people are interesting as well because
they're serving all of this they're
keeping up all this infrastructure
they've been created by these people
who've basically made it possible for
themselves to communicate with their
team members they've not been created by
someone who's trying to impose his
managerial discipline or process on the
delivery process so individuals
generally you know there were teams but
it was really the ideas of these
individuals like Linus Torvalds the
maxim Alexander took over bugzilla while
back that kind of drove the the model of
JIRA you know the bugzilla that
lightweight comment based ability to
watch things easily mental model that
was created by the light weight issue
trackers the most popular which was
bugzilla all of that this you know just
these tools support the reliable
production of 60 million lines of code a
year and it grew like everything else it
grows year and year what we've done to
help this to help the Eclipse developers
do this is to create this new
abstraction in it and the whole reason
Milan got popular is because it makes me
tasks explicit so just like files have
been this really useful abstraction for
you know going to things on the internet
and sending them around and putting your
source code somewhere and checking it in
we've made tasks tasks be an explicit
abstraction that ties together the
lifecycle so this version has these
things like workflow some kind of
activities going on and the context and
the workflow can be you know can be
rigid
process where you break down
requirements the non-functional
requirements and so on they can be this
very agile and lean and user story
different process and these are just
basic attributes on the task their
profiles of the open source task model
that we have in Eclipse Milan activity
is really key and this is sort of that
social element you know it was in
bugzilla was not called social in
Mozilla when Eclipse adopted bugzilla
but the fact that every task has this
feed and some of the most popular task
feeds such as you know right now people
raising the concerns about eclipse you
know some slowness on eclipse for that
the community is addressing and the
developers are dressing their hundreds
of comments on those bugs the whole
interaction all of the you know patches
which are now eight getting changed in
the pull request and so on every of one
of these tasks as it has this activity
feed I think it's got a context so
context is actually the linking to the
doc it's looking to the code or you know
to binary libraries or to those sorts of
things to content that's online so
that's the way that we look at tasks
what we've done now is increasingly tied
together there in the Milan project
became a top-level Eclipse project
because it's our time together the way
that tasks occurred at different places
in the life cycle both and so the kinds
of task like you know that we start out
just by supporting bugzilla and JIRA
than the track and so on then we moved
into tasks that actually weren't was
like quality center on some of the more
traditional ALM tools also in the way
that tasks go across the life cycle
because their code reviews just another
kind of task that and a change in your
SCM system actually has to correspond to
a task if you're going to have this kind
of traceability what we did when we had
CBS is we automated this through patches
a really cool thing has happened now
that we're moving to get because we're
actually able to make that automation
correlate you correlate the task
information in the sort of project and
test manager level with your SCM system
so for example you know you've got at
the level of your then where you're
managing your product you've got a
product in the user story that breaks
down the tasks and so on through this
task based automation and integration
understand in the IDE tools the task
focus interface we're actually able to
automate that right into your SCM system
so at the moment you activate a task
you've got you
all the commits on that go to a topic
branch those automatically created for a
task and the structure in the SCM system
and this is the really cool thing about
this revision control and about getting
why we've moved to it is because that
exact structure gets reflected in your
SCM system that can get picked up by
your Hudson or Jenkins build job and
understood and then we can get the
traceability all across so when this is
not there we know how difficult things
get when this kind of information is not
explicit if you've ever tried to you
know contribute to an open source
project that you not worked on that
doesn't have some of these things to be
explicit it's just impossible right
incorporating another piece of software
into your own stack can be very
difficult again if you've tried to build
something from source and build it in
when the structures not explicit knowing
how your impacted when that security
defect is raised and which parts of your
application that might then affect
involves huge investigations when we
don't have these kinds of things be
explicit so anything that we've been
working on we presented this there's
some videos of it online it's this there
was the get geared and hudson pin is the
talks called pimp your productivity it's
it's it's on youtube as well is to
automate these things both within your
stack and in within the tools that we
have as developers so the new
contribution process at Eclipse look
something like this when though the
worse that we're still setting pieces of
this up most of this is in place already
you want to make a change to Milan
because you don't like one of the icons
or you need something added to make it
work with your particular ALM tool you
basically push something to gare it we
then so Hudson pulls that build it for
you because we never trust you to run
all the unit tests and they take a long
time and people never set them up
properly so it's actually there's a
build created just for that post request
without you ever talked into a committer
a seventh I should mention here a 7th of
the work that a Milan has been done by
non commuters by people just wanting to
extend the tools make them work for
themselves get those knees sdks it was
taking us so long to review people's
patches that were broken that we
actually put this in place so we
connected you know Hudson's would build
this for you without you ever having to
talk to a committer if it were
you get a plus one and then two other
committees would look at your work
actually review to see if it made sense
and it was a interesting contribution as
soon as they get give it plus to that
then gets pushed out so that gets pushed
into master and a pull request oops a
pull request then causes it to get into
the nightly builds and then you're going
to tens of thousands of developers the
next morning the request that you made
so what used to be these separate
systems with separate reviews is now all
connected and automated in the way that
we've set up these ALM pieces what you
actually saw if you saw Thomas Koreans
keynote this morning than the Oracle
developer cloud service is actually
using some of these pieces that we've
created in both Milan and and in this
other project called coat the cloud and
this is exactly where alm stacks are
going today so the interesting thing
here is that you've got these new tools
have the expressiveness to do this ah
the less interesting thing is that or
the other interesting thing is that you
know in 1995 you could fit all of the
technology work within your brain today
you I can't even forget in your brain
because of how complex it is and how you
know the way that it's evolved not
capturing any of the best practice that
that we're used to so what we actually
have to do here is you know transition
from these things being technologies to
transition these things that just
support our workflow as developers and
add these automations on top of it right
so that we start connecting the silos
through these tools and in these
workflows that you know that we need is
develop that we use as developers so the
fact that we can collaborate with the
project managers on stories with testers
on defect with business analysts on
requirements and so on with you know I
RIT helped us on Ted on cases those are
all tasks in some cases if you you know
you're collaborating with it with a
community within with another developer
project you actually are doing code
reviews in other cases you're getting
your sending patches out to the field
but the key thing now is that we just
connect all of these tools so I'll now
hop into another demo and show you how
we've done this in two or with some of
our tools so we've got again violence
through the underpinning the open-source
platform for this we have this
commercial tool called task top sync
which uses the Milan model to connect to
a number of these do any any of the ALM
tools that we support so here what we've
done just says to illustrate to you the
information that's there is connected it
to a jira instance that's out in the
open so it's connected to the spring
open source JIRA it's connected to the
spring close to zero which is also out
in the open so the first ones the spring
framework stuff and connect it to your
Clips bugzilla and instead of doing the
usual thing I've shown previously like
you know running gorse over an STM
history we're just going to look at this
stuff so we're just going to look at how
the tasks between these things are
linked and this visualization is going
to just show you all these task links
and i'll tell you what it's showing and
the interesting thing is they're going
to go across those repositories so where
is that thing
so this is a tool called butterflies ER
and the out so task top sink basically
dad stop saying everything you open so
everything it connects to it creates an
instant index over and you've basically
got all your ALM servers index so we've
indexed all these you know bugzilla and
and JIRA repositories and now let's open
the output of that and then this is just
a visualization tool so what it's doing
right now is it's crawling over the
entire the basically the graph structure
in those tasks how the tasks are
interrelated and actually how the people
are communicating so while it's doing is
it's taking every people all the people
who comment on tasks the more that
people comment on on the tasks the
closer they are together that's it and
the circles are actually groupings of
tasks and you know again think of task
says work items as defect as user
stories and all of these sorts of tools
there's some commercial what's
interesting here so there's some
commercial tool development that's going
on as well the bigger the people are the
more prolific they are non their commits
but in their comments again you know
tools like Ola we always buy us
everything to to the source code I think
the key thing is that we need to start
looking at what's in that task
information because these you know what
we've seen is it even more telling so I
know a bunch of these people Christian
dupuis he and I so launch the spring
source tool suite together that project
and all the people that he works with so
there's some people here like ever had
wolf it was at spring source you know
previously VMware there they're
basically all of these people are the
collaborators on the spring source tool
suite we've got some of the people
Martin lipids actually the pic that
picked up swimsuit more recently he took
over the leadership of that project as
traditional got promoted Stefan Pingel
is the person that I gave they get here
and Hudson talked with yesterday and the
layout of these relationships is very
interesting because these people tend to
be spring source people but they're
interacting through these Leo dos Santos
is a task top and there's some open
source people i connect to start
breaking some of this down to show you
the relationships across the two across
the actual projects and show you what it
looks like but I'll get back to why this
actual layout is so interesting so this
is the DM server project it's very
simple smaller project with normington
the students the Guru does all the
server side of SGI stuff this is the
spring open source tools project and
serve a similar structure before Virgo
tooling is the Eclipse tooling for osgi
stuff so it's playing itself out and
when you start putting these tool to do
things together so the open source on
the closed source you'll actually notice
that people are the things that span the
company boundaries and one thing that
I've seen happen is people even you
migrate from company to company the
relationships in this graph a more
closely representing for people ended up
working then of the organizational
structure in those companies so this
whole notion of self organizing team
these people have had autonomy because
they working on these open source
components so they have you know this
has evolved over time to you know both
define the modularity of these tools
like which things are extensible and the
spring ide tools which things are not
because the way that these people have
worked together has formed the
organization boundaries of the software
it's kind of like Conway's law but in
Reverse so Conway's law is that you know
you open up PC which don't the
old-school pcs that you can open up that
weren't made like phones these days you
will actually see the organizational
structure of IBM right the way that
alternate was created this is the
reverse because these people had the
autonomy to work that the way that they
work they migrated within companies to
create this awesome software and they've
actually formed both organizational
structure and the modular structure of
these projects
so that was just a quick walk through
the social code graph of those
components and just a little
visualizations kind of like a toy
example of what you can do with this the
key thing that enabled is that all these
people did have autonomy they were a
bunch of those people were hiding the
way I actually found Christian dupli was
he made the Milan integration with
spring ide right it was purely through
open source a bunch of those other
people Stefan tingle he was hired on
google Summer of Code and now is when
the principal software engineers had
passed up so that kind of autonomy and
transparency the fact that you can
collaborate with anybody when this graph
is open in that way has been what's
enabled this it's been what you know
what's fuel the growth of some of these
companies and I think it's opening this
up further is you know will actually
help transform the software developer
those organizations of larger companies
as well there's some interesting Network
laws so you know the sort of network
laws that we see is Metcalfe's law said
that a network is the value of network
is proportional to its square reads law
says it's a lot more than that because
all these interesting groups form within
networks and you can see that in that
social call graph example because you
can see teams forming across all this
and you know that's probably an
exaggeration it's 2-2 the number of
nodes in the network the value because
you know teams of two people are not
that valuable for those teams of five
people are very valuable valuable so
it's it's basically the number in
between but the interesting thing there
is that this network was opened up to
the commercial development of one of
these tools to the open source
components and two it's open source
dependencies and this information is
getting out there now and there's a way
of getting this information into your
tools and this is another interesting
Network lot which I think applies just
as even more accurately than those other
do so I think the really important thing
here is that as this is happening it's
not just in open source that this
happens right it can't be just github or
this transparency and these benefits
come because in the end the software
that we deliver in organizations has to
get some these benefits as well and I
think you know the worst thing that
could happen right now
is if we ended up with the same thing as
we have with a social networks when you
know that the public network of Facebook
and Google+ who do not talk to each
other over anything and they're
completely separate from Yammer this is
what happened to our software delivery
because we're going to use different
tools we have different special-purpose
tools chances are if you do net you're
kind of not getting you know you do more
TFS then then you do too like rational
team concert if you're doing enterprise
Java development because the tools are
special purpose and they're tied into
the stacks that we use and we use
different stats so we basically need to
look at this this graph needs to stay it
needs to be opened up I think the data
models need to be open which is why
Milan has been really important the
protocols need to be opened up as well
so efforts such as the open services for
lifecycle collaboration and then a core
component of that the link data
specification that's coming out of
that's being partly driven by OSLC will
help identify some of these boundaries
this by the way is the web two point 0
points of control map from the web 20
summit I think it's really neat because
they are they updated every year and
they basically make these territories of
social networks and and mobile devices
and so on where you actually get to see
the fact that these api boundaries are
defining our digital world on the public
cloud we've got that same kind of thing
happening and we have to basically open
up those boundaries between the
commercial tools that we use and the ALM
tools that we use and this new breed of
open source tools with those concerts
mind the transparency the autonomy for
the people because the tools that are
give you autonomy that allow you to you
know request the pull of a piece of
source code contributes patches and so
on are the tools are defining software
delivery for the next decade as
developers you know I think the
important thing is you know to be
looking at with this is to actually
think about your social code graph
within your company you know you some of
you may be contributing to some of those
projects or just trying it out what it's
like to work with an open source project
would get so you can bring that
experience into your company but do
think about your you know basically your
code network both within the
organization without because it's it's
the evolution of that
you know the best and most successful
teams managers I think it's just really
important to take some of what's worked
and open source and apply that now Peter
Drucker said in the 60s in the age of
knowledge work you have to treat
everyone as a volunteer the rent is
expensive for a reason right software
developers are in very high demand and
that mindset actually will drive some of
the you know benefits that you get from
these self-organizing teams and so on
because you try you know you tend to
look at what you know people if there's
some of that transparency with the
organization people tend to find their
best fit and and grow more quickly so
that self-organization autonomy it just
the point is it works and open source an
example of that and then the tool
vendors and I think you know the key
thing is to acknowledge we're just stuck
with these complex ecosystems and
there's not going to be one tool to rule
them all there's not going to be one
hosted ALM solution that works for
everything because these things are very
special purpose we have different stats
that we work with and we have different
stakeholders who need a different tool
so with that I'll wrap up and take some
questions so any questions thank you
yeah
yeah so the question is hot you don't
you've got this how do you take some
information like this and actually use
it to sort of like to have a feedback
cycle with improving your team I mean I
think it's a really good question I just
I wonder I on I'm not sure we're there
yet like we we first have to start
captions information right like for most
of the you know for most organizations
their issue tracker is separate from the
agile tool which is separate from the
quality management tool which is
separate from microsoft word where the
requirements are right and all the
source could commit don't talk to any of
that so I think there's this there will
be some kind of you know maturity model
on this right where first make sure the
stuffs linked up or sink nut or
synchronized up right that's those are
the sorts of tools that we work on you
know the link data without CTools that's
making sure it's easy for these robust
links to happen across tools when data
needs to move around we have this our
commercial offering desktop sync to do
that so the first thing is and you know
the first thing is to just make sure
that these two these things are linked
out that the data is connected so
basically there's a graph and then once
the graph is there you can start running
tools like this but that really was just
a toy example we made that visualization
using this tool on one of our miles
Parker created butterflies er we just we
just run ran it on sinks data set and
add a simple rule these tools are just
just not there yet so I think there's
just as soon as that data is linked up
you've got the potential to do it and
then you know you can you know you can
look at again like we've got
organizations basically streaming some
this data to things like you know data
warehouses where they can run some of
these analytics and look at trends but
it's not other than some of you know
some of the core really core statistics
we've seen from to like olo that
Blackbaud and so on where they're giving
source statistics we're just not there
yet so link it up and then these tools
will come it's kind of where I see it
yeah it wasn't it's it's making a branch
automatically Garrett was not pushing to
master yeah and that's that's basically
that's it that's the thing about that
process is it's always someone who has
that makes a task like they want to add
this this feature to the tool a branch
is created for them automatically and
that branch is built so the unit tests
that they break which they often do
because they didn't contribute a unit
test or change it well they'll get as a
failure when they submit the review so
that those are the automation features
that you could you know you can
basically start to create and yeah none
of those things are in the box and I
think a lot of the what you're seeing
with a bunch of the the commercial ALM
tools is there something to capture some
of that as these workflows these common
workflows whereas we've an eclipse just
an wire that yeah
yeah yeah well exactly then that gets
back to the general its first question
right like if you've got this data
connected you know if you've actually
you know you've got the data there you
can run some of these analytics things
on it that that we know and I think
again those those reports have not those
have yet to be defined but you know some
of them are obvious for example like if
your requirements are never making it
you know I know a eighty percent of the
defects that are raised or something
that's not even the requirement right it
was never meant to go out with this
version of the software just a bit of
legacy that's being supported if the
requirements are connected all the way
you know from end to end we're like you
know from the business value to like to
the stuff that's causing problems when
it's running those things that you know
then become connected you find those
kinds of the bottlenecks so I kind of
think it as bottlenecks you know across
the lifecycle you know sort of more
traditional phase of the life cycle that
we looked at in the test batch sizes
even as they're getting lean it's the
same thing lean just gives you a faster
iteration to the customer but if your
customer if the point to your custom
means you know going through a
production process you're not going to
get it to week iteration into you know a
deployed public service solution right
you actually have to integrate with an
ops 2 at that point so bottlenecks
across that you know then interesting
things interesting analysis vertically
right like which you know it say which
components are causing the most defects
that develop your developers have to
solve which we actually run these nuts
OH the funny thing is back to your
question we do run that tool internally
now I just realized this for I have
asked that for a monthly management
meeting we get the social code graph of
our teams because basically we make sure
that the team's own patterns and
self-organizing are reflected in how we
reorganize our teams as they grow and
where we put developers so we are doing
that and that's kind of vertically with
in development but again just with these
hack together tools any other questions
wait yep yeah this one doesn't show it
it actually knows the difference between
an eclipse a requirement is a plan it's
a it's a in eclipse.org it just happens
to be in the same repository right which
is not at you know that common but yeah
it's a it's a bugzilla bug with a plan
keyword same in the mozilla repositories
same kind of convention so yeah you
could show that from this but the
interesting thing is yeah you can get
this data set now from you know multiple
repositories because we've got this
common mall that we can show it's gonna
be a requirement from to like rational
requirements composer with you know
defects from like your own customized
instance of the track or something so
yeah yeah so that's the thing I I think
those things are super interesting and I
we're not really working on them all
we're working on a task that been with
Milan and with is just getting that
stuff linked up and getting the data
into the right places so that people who
you know understand requirements whether
people who do analytics and reports can
start building on on a comprehensive
data set that has this graph and the key
thing is that has the activity
information right if one requirement has
80 comments it's different then then the
one that has to write because people are
arguing so that I think that's social
you know software is a conversation in
the end and that conversation has to
show up in those analytics and the
interesting thing about the visual
attention I showed this all it was was
the conversation there was no other
structure in that just how many people
the proximity of people is how much they
commented with each other that was it
and that's it was a spring layout based
on that so all right thank you very much
and then yeah there's more information
and recordings on such over there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
