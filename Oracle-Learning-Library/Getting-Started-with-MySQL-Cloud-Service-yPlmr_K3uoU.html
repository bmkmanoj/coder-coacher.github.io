MySQL cloud service instance before we
start there are some prerequisites first
you'll need an account on Oracle public
cloud this can be a trial account or an
account that you or your company has
purchased and you must know the name of
an identity domain associated with that
account and the data center associated
with the identity domain the identity
domain must have the MySQL cloud service
activated you'll need the service
administrator role so that you can
create and administer instances this is
associated with your Oracle single
sign-on login tied to your email address
it's also helpful if you've already got
an SSH key pair so that you can upload
your public key to the service instance
if you don't already have such a key
pair you can create and download when
during the service creation wizard with
the prerequisites met you can now sign
in at cloud.oracle.com and select your
data center and enter your identity
domain
then you can log in using your single
sign-on credentials to get access to the
Oracle public cloud dashboard
from here I can see what services are
activated for this identity domain I'm
going to create a MySQL cloud service
instance so I'll select MySQL from the
cloud services menu
I haven't yet created any instances so
I'm prompted to create one by clicking
the create service button and launching
the wizard the wizard is quite simple
there are three pages the service page
for the high-level information the
details page for configuration specifics
and options and a confirm page that
shows a summary of my choices the
service name is a short name of up to 50
characters that appears in dashboards
and on other lists and screens to
identify this service the service
description is more flexible and gives
you a place to describe the purpose
lifecycle or other information for this
service this text appears when you drill
into the service you'll need an SSH key
pair to log onto the instance host
machine as usual you keep the private
key on your local machine and place the
public key on the remote host in this
case the virtual machine that hosts
MySQL cloud service instances if you've
already got a key pair you can browse to
the file that contains your public key
on your local machine and upload it to
the wizard you could also copy the
public key text to your clipboard and
paste it into the key value box for the
purpose of this tutorial I'll create a
new key in the wizard and download the
key pair to my local machine the new
public key is automatically associated
with this virtual machine
the downloaded key pair consists of a
public key and a private key in a zip
file there are a few ways to make these
keys available to the ssh client on my
local machine but for now i'll just copy
them to my ssh directory so that i can
use them to connect in a later tutorial
the compute shape specifies the resource
profile for this instance each shape
specifies the number of OCP use and the
amount of RAM dedicated to the instance
a no cpu is an Oracle computer unit
equivalent to one physical core with
hyper-threading
corresponding to two hardware execution
threads for this tutorial I'll use the
default compute shape that uses the
least resources but as my application
demand grows I can change the compute
shape by scaling of the instance the
second page of the wizard is where I
choose specific configuration details
these include the usable database
storage in gigabytes the root user
credentials MySQL Enterprise monitor
configuration and automated backup
configuration I'll go at the default 25
gigabytes and MySQL's root user is the
default administration user I enter and
confirm the administration password I'll
change the default database schema name
to one of my choosing and within the
wizard I can choose to configure MySQL
Enterprise Monitor on this instance for
simplicity in this tutorial and as best
practice I won't install MySQL
Enterprise Monitor on the same machine
as the instance that it monitors because
this is an instance of MySQL Enterprise
Edition it also includes MySQL
Enterprise backup which I can use to
perform automated and on-demand backups
to the hosts disk and also to cloud
storage containers to enable this you
can provide the name of the cloud
storage container and its credentials
but for simplicity I'll disable that in
this wizard the confirm screen provides
a summary of my choices from the
previous screens in the wizard and when
I verified the settings I click the
Create button to complete the wizard and
create the instance back at the services
overview I can see that the instance
creation request was accepted and the
status of my first service is creating
service
when the service has been created I can
click the refresh button to see that the
service has been created and I can click
on the service name to view it's details
these details include the public IP of
the virtual machine on which the service
is hosted and it is from this screen
that you can perform much of the
administration patching and scaling of
the instance
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
