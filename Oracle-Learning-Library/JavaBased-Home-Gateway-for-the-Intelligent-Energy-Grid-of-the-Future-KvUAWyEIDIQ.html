of Oracle Java embedded group you
probably have seen part of the demo
ground so that you have a demo for
dedicated to embedded technology so I'm
part of that group I'm a solution
consultant and my focus for last year so
was machine-to-machine application of
Java technology so what I'm going to be
talking about today is one of those
applications specific to the energy
smart grid but also in general will talk
about m2m applications of Java
technology and well first of all thank
you for coming here I know that the end
of the day and I've been to enough of
those conferences to know that you're
dead tired by now so I do appreciate
your coming here and this session this
is not a session by the way this is buff
right so I don't know if you guys been
at Java ones in previous years and I
mean like number gel ones you probably
know the buff was designed not to be a
session it it's buffers created for
people to have a conversation people to
discuss specific topics i have seen
number of bulbs recently and they have
nothing they have none they're nothing
like that they're just another session
so i have a slide deck i go through the
slide deck you listen and you go home so
i do have a slide deck and if you're not
going to engage in conversation i go and
i ran through entire slide deck and bore
you to death but i guess points and i'm
trying to make is that I welcome your
participation if you I don't mind if I
won't be able to cover all the slides
that I have in the deck that's fine with
me if we can go home from here
understanding each other views and
understanding where we are in m2m space
where java is an empty space where do
you see java
going in m2m space is there's a space
for Java in m2m your experiences I'll be
the happiest person disturb so
java-based home getaway for intelligence
Margaret of the future I regional title
was much sorts shorter but i was told
that we need to make it a lot more fancy
so somebody come up with that title okay
so if I will make you go through entire
slide deck here we will talk about some
basic concepts of energy grid of energy
grief in transition to from traditional
Greek to smart grid we'll talk a bit
about evolution of a smartphone where it
is today where it is going in the future
we'll switch then on to talk about a
proof of concept of smart energy gateway
I don't have the demo here I was
thinking about bringing them here but
it's not in my experience showing them
where the session is not working out
that well we have the demo at the ground
at the javed emigrants you're welcome to
if you haven't seen it yet you're
welcome to come come by and take a look
and we'll run you through all the gory
details of the demo step by step and you
can you can you can see the actor I'm
going to be having some screenshots and
explanation of all the components but I
welcome you to see actual damage the
graph ground demography so we'll cover
couple of different technology aspects
of the demo more specifically de menthe
expensed demanded demand response
principles and technologies a virtually
we'll talk about ZB and how we
implemented a zigbee component is a part
of the demo we'll look at the
architecture high level architecture of
the demo an event flow and i also have a
few screenshots of source snippets of
the codes that we used to implement this
demo I also personally found a little
limited benefit to see scott snippets as
a at the sessions but i have it in never
US and in last part of the discussion
and this is where I really hope you will
die participate is you know where are we
going with all of this why are we
talking about smart grid Java wat how's
it relates to machine to machine in
emergence of machine-to-machine
applications ok any any questions or by
the way feel free interrupt any time ok
well energy greed is basically if you go
and you ask a utility guy in the past
even now probably ask if so give me
about 20 seconds explanation what the
utility grid is and they'll tell you you
know its electrical station where
electricity generated there is a
transmission high voltage transmission
lines as I take it to the substation
then there is a distribution system
where I take it from substation to the
homes and that's where it's ms you know
this agility will tell you that our
business ads as a meter with the
emergence of the smart grid it really
changes because it involves
participation of the consumer in a in a
in his oldest ecosystem of a smart grid
there is a notion of smart appliances
there is a notion of on-site energy
generation there is a notion of on-site
energy storage and number of other
different concepts of influence you know
technology event flow involve miss mart
energy so
I'm sure czar the people from different
context here but in the US the
electricity grid was created as it is
today pretty much about 90 years ago in
like 1920s and it beauty beauty there
really hasn't changed that much in more
than 90 years electricity flows in one
direction it's all centralized meaning
that generate electricity is generated
on one side and flows to the consumer
and everything data collection is pretty
much done manually now in California for
years it's changing now but for years we
had person who come to your home take a
manual reading of the meter every
quarter or every six months that's
basically what it was it was completely
on in the non automated so transition to
the smart grid in this is where our
interest is a is a technology guys are
coming is is major improvement in of
injection of technology in energy
distribution grid and I mean injection
of technology in all the components of
the smart grid from generation to
distribution to transmission in more
important at this point inclusion of the
consumer technologies and this is you
know what we're going to be spending
hopefully most of the time talking about
how does applications and devices on a
consumer site whether it's a wizard see
you know a homes or businesses are
affecting a evolution of the smart grid
on next slide oh it's very busy slide
but what I'm trying to say here is it
there's three stages at least icing we
see three stages in evolution of smart
grid and the first stage is interactive
is deployment of the Harvard devices on
a grid so in California if you if
anybody's is for
local PG&amp;amp;E or Northern California PG&amp;amp;E
have deployed our PG knees Lara local
utility provider already deployed close
to nine million smart meters na reality
is none of them really function I mean
other than do with whatever the standard
meter does they do nothing else well
they have a zigbee chip in it it's not
activated in some areas e is the only
things Eric enable is the remote meter
reading when they read meter data over
the network so the first stages is
basically enabling putting devices in
place to them enable other technology or
other application over those devices the
second stage is is is start using it
start collecting data start analyzing
this data and start using this data to
improve reliability of the greed start
implementing a cost savings it smart
grid promise to deliver oh that's that's
that's the next stage that's not
happening yet and it's really too large
extent to the high technology too high
tech guys to into the high-tech industry
to come up with a solution application
to make it happen so zoom in a little
bit on on the smart home services
because you know historically our group
java a better group was very focused on
consumer devices you might probably hurt
many times about the Java and blue
blu-ray players in Java in you know a
smart pants and Java in various other
hidden smartphones we were focused on
the consumer technologies and in its
naturally sort of leads us to look at
what a smart grid evolution brings into
the consumer homes so what we see are it
now is going on is transition from a
standalone connected devices and you can
sink of your cable TV box receiver
right it connects to the cable service
provider directly if you use any of the
medical devices they most likely
directly connected to your service
provider if you have security to your
home if you have a security camera it's
connected to a service provider security
service provider set devices that I
directly connected to a service provider
for this particular application we
gradually we see transition from that to
what we called a connected Silas it is
where we first time seeing the reduction
of the gateway device gateway device is
something that has a upstream
connectivity in downstream connectivity
upstream connectivity to the service
provider and downstream connectivity
creating local home area networks that
enabled them to talk to different
devices on a local network so you can
think of in a smart energy space you can
think of a smart energy gateway
connecting upstream over plc for
instance we know is that it's a network
over power line technology or connecting
over wireless technology gsm or using
available broadband in consumer homes
connecting upstream to the saucer
utility service provider and downstream
talking to various sensors and devices
within home together sensor data and
control devices and appliances within
home area network just going to get my
now is you can imagine that or was it
easy to imagine over time it will just
composer a lot of control right you
might end up having three four five six
different conflicting networks in your
home if you have a service if you're
you're if you have your a home Wi-Fi and
you hope you have your smart energy
gateway and you have your health care
device The Oval creating local network
be just not efficient it's not effective
and it it creates a barrier silos where
different services unable to communicate
with each other so what we see is going
to happen in the boot you know what we
hope is in your future we have some
indications that is already happening
with some of the larger carriers is is
emergence of what some call it master
gateway device so it's a
multi-application higher end device with
a higher end operating system with a a
clearly defined horizontal services
whether it's a security application
management application lifecycle
management something that would be
delivered by the platform in all the
vertical applications same applications
that we talked about healthcare media a
utility security will be running on the
same platform it would enable not only a
lot more efficiency in the home but it
will also enable that platform to be
used by multiple different service
providers you can imagine that that if
you have such a platform running in your
home the service priority priority could
simply push another application onto the
device and enable new services in
consumer homes you can you can think of
you going to the Sears and buying new
give me appliance a refrigerator
dishwasher
dishwasher installed in your home and
then ver pool orgy you however you
bought it from simply pushes another
application this mark their gateway and
now you have a control over your
dishwasher yes today it's a service
providers I think that carriers are
interested in doing it problems carriers
is that they are looking for the new
streams of revenue especially in a in a
Guinea Europe in North America where is
a sort of exhausting the customer base
and new customers are coming by you know
trying to trying to attract them from
competitors they are looking for new
ways of monetizing if you are in you
know if you're living in Indian in North
America you probably know that it over
the last few years or last decade that
went through double service triple
service you know quadruple service
meaning you know they bundling trying to
add values they give you TV and cable
and then TV cable and phone and then TV
cable phone home security or something
else so they trying to bundle services
to give you more volume they're running
out of that option two because everybody
offers three people playing for the
ripple play nowadays so what's it
looking for is new services and this is
just one second let me just finish I I
see so and this offers them a way to use
the same networks they essentially don't
have to build up new infrastructure to
deliver new type of services make more
money on it so we see on verizon's and
an AT&amp;amp;T and Deutsche Telekom and nges
are really carefully looking into that
yes
your security company you want to say
Anders my way
yeah yeah the absolute this is going to
be war yes yeah well yeah yeah seriously
there's a business aspirin there's a
diff knowledge ass but right on the
technology aspect it makes sense and
everybody will start pushing it in
everything yes this is like buying your
own cable box
so I can tell you that is the
interesting interesting a scene that
happens in this space I know that I
talked to you before and and a lot of
carriers who are pioneering this who are
first the deploy that type of gateways
it's a see the multiplication gateways
are actually using the same technology
right they're using Java noi GI they are
osgi for those who are not familiar the
open services geetha initiative it's
something isn't been around from late
80s i'm in late 90s 98 this thing is
over 97 at first was announced and at
the time it was targeted it was it's a
specification by the way that was
created by number of maine major
carriers including guys like AT&amp;amp;T and
italia telecom there was a a dozen or so
of major carriers huku pioneers this
technology so the specification
yeah absolutely again if you start
looking at the area of the
specifications and standards that's that
that's a terrible too but think about
this rate I have a slide or I need to
verse my let me fast-forward because I
want to show you something that I found
interesting and we can go back to rest
of that here right if you if any of you
did a enterprise development application
server development right look at those
five can be around long enough to see
how application server evolved over the
years in what why it was created in the
first place that should look familiar to
you those five points I remember
enterprise space when everything was
proprietary yeah when there was a
mainframe in each mainframe had its own
operating system in the word completely
there was no interrupting whatsoever
they probably still running somewhere in
the back rooms of Bank of America hey
everything become ip-based create an
enterprise everything is ip-based
horizontal platforms how many
application server technology exists
today I mean not talking about
implementation there's dotnet as a j2ee
pretty much a thread each platform
provided standard security standard
application deployment standard
application development of technologies
so what we see here is a transition in
the enterprise space for highly from
highly fragmented highly proprietary
technology to very standard open
technologies it happened all right i
mean it wasn't easier it because there
was a you know
those are you major players in the
market were competing to become a
providers on that standard and providers
of that technology but it did come to
that may take time but I think the same
thing would happen any on the only
device on the in m2m space as well and
similarly it will have to provide us
array of services that would give a
common platform to those applications i
already mentioned security nobody if you
talk to if you talk to either carrier
large carrier or a small company for
providing a point application same time-
want to worry about how do they
implement technology they don't want to
implement their own way of developed or
deploying application and monitoring
application on device they want to focus
on what's a really good at and creating
an applications that there are specific
vertical of vertical requirements if
it's a smart energy it's a smart energy
application if it is a health care its
healthcare they don't want to do
securities they don't want to do
application management so you tell me
all right and i am i'm preaching this
because I want this to be Java you're
the one who is going to be consuming it
does it make sense and I see the hand
over there
yes yeah well the the web services are
becoming one of the standard as far as
the communication protocols we see
transition to IP based communication
right good example is zigbee if you're
at all familiar with zigbee zigbee
something that was created its
proprietary specification right it's
controlled it's not open so there's a
problem there but it was created by the
zigbee alliance and was based on RF
technology are already a frequency
communication now they start gradually
moving to IP so so again I will more
move backwards to illustrate what I'm
talking about because I don't have a
slide for that
yeah so this zig bispak are mandating
specific transport protocol right and
it's not ip-based what what happens is
in the so-called smart energy profile to
the zero they drop this requirement they
basically say that our zigbee stock and
this is basically the networking
structure is a security the
implementation of different profiles
rode around on any IP compliant
communication protocol whether it's
Bluetooth all levels whether it's a
Wi-Fi PLC whatever right so so this to
me is indication that at least in this
area there is a movement toward more
standard platforms or basis for
implementation of communication
protocols as far as others again maybe
it's a wishful thinking but if we can
get to the point when we will start
coming up with a more standard platform
the community will rally and start
developing plugins right because you're
talking about you're talking about a you
know m2m as you I'm sure all know is
concept right m2m but on its own is
nothing m2m is only takes a tangible
physical including a form when you start
talking about specific industries
transportation logistics smart energy no
no no no no and each of those areas
there's very specific requirements for
communication for device
interoperability standards for security
rate security in health care in data
retention policies and all this is
completely different than maybe in
transportation but but my hope that is
over time the horizontal platform would
allow people who know how things work in
healthcare to start developing plugins
that would work on
of general platform just like an
enterprise you know people developing
jdbc drivers right application server
doesn't need to know how the specific
database works right if database
provides its own JDBC driver
applications are rental knows how to
pull data from the data source its
Adsense that's what I'm hoping is going
to eventually it's going to take time
but would eventually happen in a in the
m2m space on devices okay yes
yeah yeah I agree ok any other questions
I don't know how I'm doing on time
okay oh yeah somebody going to let me
know when I'm running out of time I'll
five thank you okay so let me go back so
I are going to switch to and talk about
demand response demo and just couple of
different concepts the cover for this
might not be thin lip familiar with that
so demand response is a concept that was
in existence for it was here in north
California in California in the US for
over 20 years its basic notion is that
utilities have way of influencing
consumers behavior by manipulating
manipulating bay by using variable
thinking by using a variable price for
electricity in other words when I
electricity supply or your L tricity
demand outpaces supplies they have a way
of raising prices of electricity real
time communicating it to consumers so
that that will force a reduction of
energy usage that's a basic concept the
way is if it's a wait it existed pretty
much so far was the utility guy picks up
the phone and calls Oracle this is
Oracle your part of our demand response
program and price for electricity Ellen
we're just raising price for electricity
or demand outpaces the supply we want
you to according to our agreement to
reduce your usage of usage by twenty
percent and some building manager
however just goes and well not manually
turns off lights but use whatever
building automation systems will be
implemented a company to reduce
electricity usage so it was very manual
so automated demand response is the st.
you automate that process and
there is a notion of demand response
automation server or diras it has a
general it has two different sets of API
there's API that exposed for utilities
to integrate in their own processes and
services so that it communicate with a
dr appt elemental response server so
called shadow man's shadow Anthony in
the in the utilities indicates in
utility world indicated that they
require consumers to share the elders to
use it's called Shetty lamp so the API
is that can be used to communicate with
demand response server in indicates that
the event happens and downstream API
client API is it used by those who
develop appliances or devices are
capable of responding to the mint expand
server to consume to receive that signal
in accordingly just adjust its it's fun
you know its functionality to reduce
electricity so that's basic concept of
demand response and Zeke we've already
talked about again for those who might
not be very thick these one of the the
m2m communication protocols low power
lobe and wheeze mesh networking based
communication protocols it is built as
highly reliable a protocol used in
various m2m applications that i
mentioned every PG&amp;amp;E meter has a zigbee
chicken as it is meant to be a center of
the home area network home energy home
energy management network was in homes
eventually someday
so we'll really cover that I guess but
so zigbee Alliance defines all right now
with the caveat that they start moving
in latest specification to to IP based
communication but they they rely on a
standard are based transport layer it's
I i triple e 8 0 to 15 dot for and they
defined a bunch of specification on API
security networking layer to basically
define house a zigbee Network going to
look like what's the security standards
are in the defined number of different
circle profiles are used in various
different type of applications home
automation smart energy remote control
health care there's problem nowadays
almost like a thousand of them and you
know you can get read it it's it's very
low bandwidth is 20 to about 200 kilobit
kilobytes per second range is 30 to 20
meters there's two versions there is a
XP XP pro and slightly vary in its range
and in the bandwidth and its reliability
comes from the fact that ZB network and
support upward of 6,000 nodes I think
it's like 6500 nodes at maximum can
support which means it's a more notes on
network because it's mesh networking
protocols meaning data can go from any
node to another node from one node to
another node so number of different
routes so the more nodes in the network
is more reliable it is and its reach
could be quite big because of the
potential sighs so damage against the
some things that you guys can see em at
the demo floor today or probably not too
late tomorrow it's closed today if we
build the demo on the Kyle cortex m3
board for those who do hardware it is a
SD micro board with
arriving at I think it's hundred twenty
two megahertz processor was 124
kilobytes onboard memory two megabytes
flash so we we use a as the xB zigbee
coordinator coordinator is a center or
or initiator of zigbee network which
communicates with a board over serial
port right here and we are using at the
demo we're using couple of zigbee
modules connected to lamp and a fan so
what you will see on the demo floor and
it communicates with a demand response
server and we're using real deal and the
response server by it's a cop yes
so let's say
okay well it does is you saw in a
previous previous slide it does have a
standard security mechanism I'm not sick
the expert so so I probably know about
zigbee maybe a little bit more than some
of you but certainly not not enough to
give you inside details I don't know see
if do you know is the what's this you
know specifics about the zigbee standard
security oh do you wanna okay so the
process of is it's a way the way the
coordinator in the module are sync up
with each other is he's done so the way
you configure your zigbee coordinator to
accept a specific type of devices so
there's a way usually it is done by
manufacturer or by service provider or
whoever deploys digby solutions they
they configure the zigbee coordinator to
expect specific type of devices and use
a specific type of security just like
you know in a when you configure your
wife I've network we decide what
security protocol you're going to use
right when you are syncing up devices
you have to enable the sinc function and
zigbee devices or in this case this
network of plugs network enables igby
plugs have a you know you you press
couple of buttons simultaneously and
it's looking for thee it's looking for
the network's it matches its
with a specific credential so it syncs
up with the local network if it matches
credentials and in odds other parameters
it's kind of the same except that you
don't since there is no interactions
there is no UI per se you have to prick
it has to be pre-configured in the
firmware of the devices yes I understand
what you're saying we are not you know
I'm not a big proponent Ziggy per se I I
aware of its limitations at least you
know to the extent that I I am I
understand zigbee I also don't
particularly like the way that it's
closed specification hey you only give
access to the members and you have to
pay like a boatload of money to get into
that so as it is a developer you can't
really work with Athena you have to
either shell out tons of money to get a
start developing or work for company who
do the desert for you all right so I
don't particularly like that either we
just pick that for our demo right we
pick that just because for whatever
reason it sees a adoption in a smart
energy space you know and PG&amp;amp;E is not
the only example there's other providers
who are using zigbee for this smart
energy networks yes
one of the guys from the DB Eliza he
basically told me they did they get this
on purpose because they don't want
developers to you know get into ZB you
know give because because of the
security problems company they have
approached LG Samsung all the vendors do
you know to integrate TV but they don't
want the bloggers to basically get their
handling well it's certainly it's
certainly no we're here Joe one
conference and developer conference I
certainly understand what you're saying
well I guess zigbee zigzag going after
big bucks that's what is it okay they
figure that the exist way for them to
them you know to promise lamp this is to
work with large companies um yeah I'm
sort of a business guy you know my my 11
food is in the business and others in
the technology so from business
perspective and something you guys might
not like it but in from business
perspective it could make sense it guess
again if we're going back to you know
somebody who can push specific platform
it could influence adoption of a
specific platform it's usually happens
but you know it happens when large
corporations put money in it that's a
reality if you look today who'd who has
a application server the most use
application servers even a red hat you
know Jay bows you know you is probably
one of the most open ones there's a
steel business model behind the time
Oracle IBM holds you know Microsoft
that's that it's will come to that so
cv can be would please apply I device
because sparkfun they are saying I like
that I i I'm unreleased but they didn't
send me anything yet even even though
their local i say i don't know they
ignore local guys yeah do I believe that
ZB could be replace yes right it could
be i think that mesh networking has a
benefit yeah we talked about it I heard
the z-wave which is also proprietary it
seems to have a lot you know from the
mouths of our partners who are using
different communication protocols I have
heard multiple times it is it from
reliability point of view they like
z-wave a lot more jiggly butt butt
z-wave is controlled by one company and
I think it's a sigma or z-wave chips are
done by one company so it's even more
proprietary than the way I mean zigbee
if probable take was seen else it was a
developer some very smart guys to come
up with a communication protocols it
going to be appealing enough to be get
adopted in the bigger companies yes
Absalom Absalom Absalom a quack yeah
absolutely absolutely well who knows you
know you can have a power outlet is it
charges your electrical weekly might as
well yeah right absolutely so so low
power reliability is a crucial
components yes yeah now
company
yeah this seriously i agree but they
think about that the m2m applications
involved in millions and millions of
deployed devices are at smart meters I
mentioned nine million devices can you
imagine the cost for PG&amp;amp;E to replace
that right so it's you know if in the
enterprise space is probably easy to
well relatively easy to go and openly
you know a open open bay on your server
insert another in a ethernet module raid
or lawyer you know if somebody will come
up with something next generations that
works on the same boss the computer just
in solitary and you have a thousand
servers in your email in a data center
and i will do the thousand times so it's
not going to be easy for PG need to
