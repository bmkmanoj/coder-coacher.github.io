to perform host administration tasks our
sample host is a Linux operating system
but it could also be any other operating
system that is supported and for which
you are set up so we will have a look at
the view system services we review the
default system run level review network
cards host lookup table and NFS client
then we also access the oil's users and
groups and view the met services
administration for most of these tasks
to access the hosts remotely and execute
host commands directly
you must have installed yast which we
have covered in another demonstration to
perform host administration tasks select
host then administration and we look at
all these different screens or restart
reverses the first time when you login
you will not directly get this screen
but be provided with the possibility to
enter credentials unless you have setup
default credentials so to continue our
example we'll look at servicing so here
we provide the credentials unless you
have default credentials setup in our
example we use named credentials NC
Oracle and click OK
the processing screen might appear on
this page you can perform administrative
actions for services of course you do
need to have the right privilege level
setup to do so for example just to show
you an example we are selecting cups and
then click Edit as you see cups the
current system run level is 3 and if we
needed to change that we could do so by
going to this screen since this is just
a demo to show you navigation we will
not do any
thing here and just cancel out of the
screen and return for the previous one
so what we just showed you was the
possibility to edit a service you can
also start stop or restart them from
this screen clicking done brings you
back to the previous screen while you
always have the possibility to click
this icon if you want to return to the
main host home page the next example the
default system level shows you the same
information then we just saw or that we
have the default system run level of
three again this is just again a
navigation demo so we cancel out of this
we have a separated demo on installing
just which is prerequisite for you to
access directly the host next we look at
the network cards so you can also
perform Network administration tasks
from here on in this page you can view
the network cards and the IP address is
available on our Linux machine you can
configure enable or disable the network
cards using a routing table at the
bottom of the screen is only possible
when you have more than one network card
and you can also see the globally in is
the main memed server settings from here
so let's navigate to the next element
which is the host lookup table here you
see a number of hosts of course in your
environment that will be different if
you perform an edit here what you're
editing is the e.t.c hosts file in Linux
the local hosts file is used to
translate a host name into its IP
address and this page displays the
mapping of the IP address to a host name
and its aliases
so with this page you could perform
tasks like editing the hostname and the
aliases to delete a lookup table entry
for the hosts or to add one we click
done to return to previous page so next
we navigate to the NFS client just to
show you the screen if your organization
uses the NFS client then you can see
information about the remote file system
the mount point when it was mounted and
if it's persistent over reboot and other
options another host related
administration tasks is the users and
group administration on this page you
can view a list of all user accounts
that are available on the linux host you
can add delete and edit them the
information is played here includes the
login name and the user's flow name the
UAD the group's information you can also
use this page instead of users to view
group information which shows you the
group name the group ID and the group
members when you are done reviewing the
OS users and groups click done so what
we covered in this demonstration so far
our operations related in our example to
the Linux operating system we want to
show you one more element and that is we
go hosts net services administration and
here you see that you can administer the
listener from here or the directory
naming local naming network profile file
location and you could use the group
copy of network config files from this
interface thanks for watching this
