infrastructure block volumes the future
of storage architecture is clearly nvm
II the shift from steady serial
connectivity to the exponential
performance of parallel communication is
an imperative Oracle cloud
infrastructure block volumes offers the
best-in-class storage platform using
industry-leading nvme SSDs
hi please tell me about the Oracle cloud
infrastructure block volumes sure to
understand the service let's begin by
understanding what block volume is
block volume is a type of expansive data
storage block volumes use the I scuzzy
Ethernet protocol to deliver features
and performance similar to on-premises
storage area networks or sans and are
designed for the security and durability
of the data lifecycle using the service
you can create block volumes and attach
them to your compute instance Oracle
cloud infrastructure block volumes
delivers a simple scalable single volume
type that meets all your workload
performance needs the service lets you
dynamically provision and manage block
storage volumes you can create attach
create backups and move volumes as
needed to meet your storage and
application requirements once attached
and connected to an instance you can use
the volume like a regular hard drive the
service also lets you store data on
block volumes manage your block volumes
control your data and achieve the
storage configuration your application
requires there is no reason to worry
about storage performance anymore just
provision the capacity needed
what happens to the data when the
instance terminates if the compute
instance terminates you can attach the
volume to another compute instance and
regain access to the persistent data in
that volume by using Oracle cloud
infrastructure block volumes you can
extend your data protection plan to
include integrated backups
what are the scenarios where the service
will be most useful the typical use case
scenarios are when you want to expand an
instance of storage and when you are
looking for persistent and durable
storage
after you have launched an instance and
set up your cloud network you can create
a block storage volume through the
console or API once created you attach
the volume to an instance using a volume
attachment then you connect to the
volume from your instances guest OS
using ice Guzzi the volume can then be
mounted and used by your instance
a block storage volume can be detached
from an instance without loss of data
ensuring that your data is safely stored
even when it's not connected to an
instance any data will remain intact
until you reformat or delete the volume
the detached volume can be moved to a
different instance without loss of data
this data persistence allows you to
easily migrate data between instances
additionally block storage volumes offer
a high level of data durability compared
to standard attached drives all volumes
are automatically replicated for you
helping to protect against data loss
how secure is the data stored on Oracle
cloud infrastructure block volumes
using the service be assured that your
data is encrypted at rest backups you
create are also encrypted for increased
security block volumes and their backups
are only accessible from within your
tenant or compartment boundary and only
authenticated users who have been
granted permission by you to the tenant
or compartment can access them
can you tell me more about he integrated
backups please a backup is a complete
point in time snapshot copy of all data
on your block volume when the backup was
initiated immediately after a backup is
completed it is available to be restored
to a block volume backups are encrypted
and copied to your account in Oracle
cloud infrastructure object storage you
can restore a volume in less than a
minute regardless of the volume size how
many such volumes and backups can I
create using the service volumes can be
created in sizes ranging from 50
gigabytes to 2 terabytes in one gigabyte
increments by default the volumes are 1
terabyte you can create 32 volumes per
instance
what are the performance characteristics
of block volume service note that the I
ops and bandwidth scale linearly per
gigabyte volume size up to the service
maximums take a look at the table to
view performance characteristics I ops
throughput
at the performance you observe for a
block volume may be bound by the network
bandwidth of your compute instance on
the whole the service delivers a simple
yet sophisticated and feature-rich block
storage platform that meets all workload
performance needs and addresses key
enterprise challenges
flexibility configurable 50 gigabytes to
2 terabytes in one gigabyte increments
all nvme SSD based performance I ops per
unit volume 60 I ops per gigabyte up to
25 ki ops performance throughput per
unit volume 480 kilobytes per second per
gigabyte up to 320 megabytes per second
performance latency per unit volume
sub-millisecond latency x' performance
for instance limits 32 attachments or
instance up to 64 terabytes up to 200 K
or more I ops near line rate throughput
great can you demonstrate how to create
a block volume from the console sure
login to the Oracle cloud infrastructure
portal in the console click block
volumes under storage
you will be routed to your default
compartment click the create' block
volume button to get started
enter the blog volume name for
identification
select the availability domain this must
be the same as that of the instance the
size that you select must be between 50
gigabytes and 2 terabytes you can choose
in one gigabyte increments within this
range the default is 1024 gigabytes if
you choose a size outside of your
service limit you may be prompted to
request an increase click create' block
volume
the volume will be ready to attach once
its icon no longer listed as
provisioning in the volume list the
volume is now available
you can now attach the volume to an
instance in the same compartment click
attach block volumes
select the volume to be attached
you can see the details of the attached
volume on the instance page
you can choose to see the block volume
details view I scuzzy commands and
information or detach the volume from
this page
when you successfully attach a volume to
an instance the block volume service
provides a list of ice Guzzi cremation
you use the ice Guzzi protocol to
connect a block volume to an instance
once the volume is attached you log on
to the instance and use the ice cozy ADM
command-line tool to configure the ice
Guzzi connection
you need the following information from
the list when you connect the instance
to the volume IP address port IQ n chap
username and password if enabled after
you configure the volume you can mount
it and use it like a normal hard drive
to enhance security Oracle enforces I
scuzzy security protocol called chap
that provides authentication between the
instance and volume
log into the instance and run the I
scuzzy commands to connect your block
volume to the instance
you
after you have run the I scuzzy commands
and configured the block volume
you will be able to see the drive as one
of your active storage devices creating
a backup is just as easy on the block
volume details page click the create
backup button at the bottom
give your backup a name and then click
the create backup button
click backups listed under resources to
view details
you can view the details of the backup
you created
thanks for sharing all this information
now there is no need to worry about
complex storage tiers managing a wide
array of media types and diverse pricing
options exactly with Oracle's block
volume service there is no reason to
compromise you can easily improve the
availability performance and security of
your tier one applications
