cloud control 12c demo series focusing
on the best practices for simple
application management this screen watch
is a complication management for Siebel
application the purpose of the screen
watch is to highlight the our low pass
capabilities and benefits of Ian cloud
control 12c for configuration management
for civil applications the task of
managing configuration parameters in a
dynamic multi target environments can be
very much challenging a large production
scale environment can have a dozens of
unit targets and each target can have a
several hundred different configuration
parameters given the number of possible
permutations the task of managing the
latest or quark value is beyond the work
of human capabilities iam Topsy with a
simple plug-in provides advanced
out-of-the-box tools to manage the
complexity of simple configuration
management
yem Topsy has advanced configuration
capturing change detection and
comparison reporting capabilities they
can dramatically reduce the amount of
time the system atom spent on
configuration management through the
screen watch we will provide the
instructions on Arrakis best practices
for amazing simple configuration also we
have a technical white paper that
discuss all zebra target configuration
template and multiple use cases
foreseeable configuration comparison
please refer to this link in Oracle
technology Network to download this
white paper if user wants to explore
more advanced topics in configuration
management please refer to lifecycle
management part 8 of configuration
management in Docs the Oracle comm in
this screen watch will start showing how
to create a simple server configuration
comparison template after we create a
template will demonstrate how to run the
zebra server configuration comparison
once the configuration comparison is
done then we will analyze the comparison
result finally we will talk about the
benefit of using configuration
management in conclusion a comparison
template enables users to fine tuning
paracin of light configuration a
template is associated with a specific
target type which it determines the
configuration item types items and
properties to be compared using
Enterprise Manager clock control user
can create templates for all Siebel
related targets such as civil component
component group civil service simple
workflow and Sybil Enterprise and run
the configuration comparison tasks this
template enable users to establish these
specific settings to take into account
when comparing configuration of the
given target type if you jur creates the
system template such as observer the
NIST members including civil component
and component group need to be created
first one of the benefit of using
configuration template for running
configuration comparison testing is that
template will take care of mapping force
members configuration management will
align the component groups and
components from server one with the
server two in this demo I'll show you
how to create siebel server comparison
template after you log into the
enterprise menu carpenter CA go to
enterprise drop-down menu and go to
configuration and click comparison
template once you get to the comparison
template look for a target I equal to
zero server and click create and name
the target name the template that you
wanted to create it in this example
let's create siebel server template and
click the target type and choose super
server as your target type
and you can put the description on the
template and click ok so once you create
the server server template click Edit
button zebra server has a two-member
which is a civil component and compound
group we need to edit these members so
highlight the civil component first and
click Edit member settings prior to
creating server server template I have a
create a template foreseeable component
and component group so for member
template I will select a civil component
template as the template for my civil
component and for target properly format
G I'll select civil component click OK
for now how did the civil component
group and click the Edit member setting
similarly select the member template for
component girl which I have created
before so I will select my civil
component group template for target
properly format G click the civil
internal name please note that there's
no civil component girl in the list so
you have to select a simple internal
name as the target proper for matching
for a single component group and click
OK after you have added the member you
can click Save this concludes the demo
of creating the super server template
now that you have a simple server
configuration template we'll show you
how to run the simple server
configuration compare in this table we
have two use cases one is to use the
save configuration and the other is to
use the latest configuration purpose of
using save configuration is that if you
have a system that is used as a cold
image and you want to run the
configuration comparison against your
cold image then select the protocol
server server and save this
configuration and run the comparison
against their particular server server
in that way you can do some analysis of
confucian changes you know historical
basis on other siebel server against
your code image on the other hand using
the latest configuration is for you to
compare one server server to the other
server server or multiple server servers
a
latest configuration and one some
analysis on configuration differences
among the different civil servers let's
start with the server configuration
compare so we'll start configuration
comparing the forseeable server so go to
enterprise configuration and click
compare will compare the configuration
parameter of two different super servers
these servers can be in the same civil
enterprise or indifferent and the price
setting up a comparison involves six
steps and the first step is to select
the first configuration on the confusion
tile you can choose either the latest
configuration or the save the
configuration so for the for this
example we select the latest
configuration and click the target type
looking for a serial server and click
search it will list the number of a
serial servers in my systems for our
demo I'll choose the server number 1 and
click Next if you want to have run the
configuration for your old image you can
click the save configuration and click
the search and it'll show you the slave
the configuration from your serial
server and the rest of step is the same
as this one if I go to next steps second
step is to select the zebra server that
you wanted to compare against the first
one you can have one or multiple zebra
servers so click Add button and target
type in stable server and click search
and I choose the second super server in
the same enterprise and click OK
of course you can have a different
serial server from the different
enterprise or you can have a multiple
serial servers to add for the second
configuration and go to next third step
is to select the comparison template
that you have created so in our example
we have a simple server template so I
will select a simple server template
that has been
right in the previous steps and once you
select a template that it'll show is
member template and member type has been
all configured click Next
first step is showing the mapping so
highlight the serial server which was
the my second configuration or second
super server and click view mapping and
it will show the mapping between the
first configuration and second
configuration since we select a sibrel
server template for our configuration
all the mapping has been lined up as you
can see in this screen now the mapping
shows correctly we can go to next step
next step is to schedule and set the
notification so put the meaningful job
name as a stable server configuration
comparison and you can specify job
schedule as to start right away
or you can schedule to run it later time
or you can make it as a recurring basis
and also you can set the notification
settings to notify if there's any
differences that you wanted to find that
you can put the email address that you
want to be notified or you can put the
comparison option as a save only or save
all for best practice I select the save
all and click Next launch step is to
review all your settings before you run
the job and make sure everything is
correct and if you're satisfied with
your setting click Submit once you
submit a job the comparison in progress
window will open following is a summary
of Siebel server configuration
comparison report the tree view shows
the comparison at the zebra server level
component group level and civil
component level please note that the
parent level shows are different when
it's children members has a different
configuration you can click the differ
hyperlink to see the detail information
select the configuration specification
on the lab panel to display tables on
the right this screen shows the
differences in target properties between
two zebra servers if you want to know
the value of this property then you can
click the configuration properties watch
your show that value down below if you
click the silver server configuration on
the left side you will see the value
difference between first configuration
and second configuration also if you
click the zebra server general
configuration it will also show the
differences in first configuration and
second configuration you can use the
breadcrumb link at the top of the
details page to return to the previous
menu or the system comparison result
pages and if you wanna see the
difference result in the component
Google component you can just click the
hyperlink to drill down to that level so
let's choose the one of the stable
component and what the differences are
so the target properties are different
from the first configuration to second
configuration and you want to know the
detailed differences on the component
configuration you can click the simple
component configurations here you will
see the two is highlighted and one is
empty that means there's no value on the
first configuration but there is a value
on the second configuration likewise if
what is highlighted and two is empty
that means there is a barrier on the
first configuration but there is no
value on the second configuration and if
have a not equal sign on the result that
means first configuration value is
different from the second configuration
value this concludes our demo of zebra
server configuration comparison we have
seen most of iti rotations go through
constant system changes through either
system a gray patchy Connie and during
this process system admin Chris
different lifecycle stages such as tasks
Deb or prod environments
with the automated process you can
reduce your IT operational time as well
as eliminated dependencies on human
resources to mange the scripts utilizing
configuration management will prevent
any job failure due to system changes by
setting orders you can be notified
automatically when the system changes
occur
therefore major your system proactively
rather than reactively act on when the
system behaves differently than you
expected this concludes our demo of

configuration management thank you for
