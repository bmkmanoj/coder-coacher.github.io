ability to upload and view documents
such as presentations and images this
enables me and my co-workers to discuss
documents right in the context of a
conversation or wall in addition to
uploading a document from my computer I
can also upload a document from a cloud
document store such as Oracle documents
Google Drive or Dropbox all I need to do
is authorize Oracle social network to
access my cloud documents to our account
then I can see my folders and documents
in the cloud and upload what I want to
share when I open a document I see a
preview of the document as well as any
annotations an annotation is a comment
or question added to a document and
Oracle social network in addition to the
annotations being displayed in the
document they're also displayed as
messages in the conversation I can go
directly from the message to the
location in the document where the
annotation was placed I can use
annotation filters to limit my view to
just the annotations I want to see there
are several tools available for
annotating a document such as the
pushpin to pinpoint a location and the
rectangle to draw attention to an area
within the document when i'm finished i
publish my annotations which makes them
viewable to others in the document and
adds them as messages to the
conversation thank you for watching for
more information be sure to visit us
online
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
