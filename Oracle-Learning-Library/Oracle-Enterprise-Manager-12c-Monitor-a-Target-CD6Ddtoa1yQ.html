I'm administrator the health of a target
is measured with metrics so I our
demonstration on the basics of
monitoring includes or takes the example
of monitoring hosts target review
metrics thresholds and the collection
settings and then very conveniently we
can note the context-sensitive help for
editing metrics there are different ways
to view metrics we take the example of
the host via the metadata the OMS are
located so we navigate targets hosts
here we select EMT of example comm on
the right you see some examples of what
Enterprise Manager is monitoring by
default for example here in the area CPU
and memory you see graphs you see that
the values are monitored in percentage
in general the units of measure depend
on the group of metrics so there could
be time values like seconds or
milliseconds or by it's gigabytes for
storage or such things Enterprise
Manager creates percentage values when
it compares one set of metric values
with another set of metric values such
as the CPU utilization in user system or
i/o wait time as you see here so let's
look behind the scenes where this
information is coming from we navigate
to host monitoring and choose metric and
collection settings on the metric and
collection settings page you see some
examples of metrics that have threshold
values
threshold values are values that
indicate whether a warning or a critical
alert should be initiated so the current
value of a metric is compared against
these thresholds to see if an alert is
needed on this page you also see the
frequency the collection schedule how
often values are being collected and
finally you see an edit button
let's click for example the Edit for CPU
utilization and you see the details
about the CPU utilization percentage you
see that thresholds are being set with a
warning and critical let's scroll down
this page the chart at the bottom is
designed to help you to specify the
right level of data collection so
historical data are provided and on you
can also choose a time period and
specify the information as as often as
you needed so for example we could view
the data by the last seven days 31 days
or just the last day scrolling up this
page I would like to point out one more
detail where we can ensure that our
specific settings are always in effect
and if you are interested we have
another demonstration on the monitoring
templates next let's have a look at all
metrics that is at the current system
values for your own host so we navigate
host monitoring all metrics note that
you see right away any open metrics so
for example if you wanted to check out
the memory utilization you can do so by
clicking on this link
and cloud control moves to the specific
page let's scroll down to see the
historic values what you see here is
interesting you see that the memory
utilization has crossed a warning
threshold and then dropped it down again
if you have any questions about the
meaning of this or what you need to do
you can go click on help and then select
Enterprise Manager help here in the help
system scroll down and read the
information and look at the data source
it explains to you by operating system
or which statistics have been gathered
and also note at the bottom the user
action in this case it says that in the
Linux OS this value might always be
close to a hundred but you should really
refer to the free logical memory
percentage for the actual free memory
that is available for the users so users
should not take any actions based on
this value so you can say all right I'll
close that I don't have to worry about
that one let's exit out of this window
and just to look at one more value will
select the CPU I all wait the current
system values are displayed again if you
don't quite understand what this means
navigate to help enterprise manager help
and again review the information scroll
down to see again the data source for
the particular hosts which you may have
and towards the end of the information
there is the user action feel free to
stop this demonstration if you want to
read the recommendations at your own
speed and
when you are finished with it exit out
of this window thanks for watching this
demonstration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
