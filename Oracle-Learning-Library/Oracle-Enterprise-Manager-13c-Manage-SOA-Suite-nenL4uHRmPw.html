Enterprise Manager 13c video series
today I am going to talk about new
features introduced in 30.1 release in
soil management so let's get started I
am on so infrastructural period of so
our domain before I discuss all features
in detail let me talk about target set
of verification utility here this
utility is introduced for current owners
to quickly ensure that their targets are
set up with the features they choose to
utilize diverse set of purification is
one-stop set up page for all credentials
and connections you can perform a series
of tests that can help diagnose and
repair set of problems required for
target monitoring it is a best practice
to run target set of verification for
every so I in flood target
many of our of fmw customers talk about
so are dehydration store performance
issues so in thirteen point one we have
introduced few major features that will
help administrator resolve such
performance issues quickly also our
infrastructure on home page click on
dehydration store performance tab here
exam in different areas of the page we
show the session usage of dehydration
store top sql's row growth tablespace
growth and specific metrics on important
tables if a particular statement is
taking large amount of database time
compared to all other statements click
on the sequel ID to analyze the
performance of the statement on the
statement performance page we can see
various performance tics of the
statement in this particular case we
have artificially created the bottleneck
using a recurring database table that
locks cube instance table for fifty five
out of every 60 seconds this is why we
see multiple active sessions here which
are closed as soon as table is unlocked
we can also access JVM Diagnostics for
particular sequel to access JVM
diagnostic feature again go back to top
so a sequel table and click on JVM
diagnostic button this will open JVM
would performance Diagnostics page here
administrator can examine the active
threads by state this JVM CP utilization
JVM heap utilization and screwed on to
top activities areas as well with 13c
release p.m. cloud control extends the
capability built into space so us with
platform to allow customers to handle
the increased scale of industrial-grade
so applications our error hospital
functionality is improved substantially
to view the error at so enthral
structure level where system-wide for
data is aggregated there are many
advantages of error hospital it acts as
quick view of fault count for admin to
determine the error trains it generates
the consolidated reports with all an
aggregated error count on a single page
user can perform bulk recovery on a
selected group of similar faults in a
single operation as well click on the
error hospital tab from soin
infrastructure page to go to error
hospital page here by default search is
pre-populated for last 24 hours
so extend it to include longer periods
once you see the list of faults
highlight the
credit for under fault main and click on
bulk recover tab the parameters of the
fort you clicked on are carried over to
create bulk recovery screen look at a
different options you have for selecting
batching and recovering files your
resubmissions are based by batching time
slices you can select the size of each
time slice that is submitted these above
settings will slice the faults in to 10
minutes lines and submit each slides
that contain nonzero number of faults
300 seconds apart you can control the
duration of this lines with a batch time
period parameter you can leave all the
settings at the default value and click
on the submit button on the top to
submit in a bulk in currency also helps
administrator to analyze issues during
instance thrashing and delay analysis to
find any bottleneck or slow performance
true trace instance on the soy
infrastructure homepage click on soil
flow structure drop down and from
Diagnostics menu choose trace instance
again by default
search is pre-populated with 24 hours
extend the search to include the
instance to be traced once
tracing job is completed click on status
to see the complete trace delay analysis
stabbed also shows time spent at each
component in this composite execution so
this will help to understand bottlenecks
and to identify the performance issues
in the composite admins can also run so
our diagnostic report for detailed
analysis and find out trends for failure
to generate so our diagnostic report go
to so infrastructure homepage click on
sawa infrastructure drop down menu and
select diagnostic scheduled diagnostic
job option the ZOA diagnostic report can
generate information about instance
growth system backlog paper report
mediator report hidden report and human
workflow report as well
also you can setup the email
notification for the report to be
delivered to your inbox was the job is
completed thank you for listening this
