welcome everybody again this is the
second of four live events about Oracle
data integrator and today we're going to
be discussing how to make a project and
a mapping if you're familiar with the
old ODI interface it used to be the old
OD ID program that used to be called
interfaces so we're going to be taking a
flat file to a relational table the flat
file will be just an ASCII file and the
relational table will be an Oracle
database table in HR sample schema so
that's what we're going to do your
mileage may vary there's a lot of
different ways to do this this will be
an example of one way to manage the
importing of a file into a table there's
other ways as well
so the idea is that your should be
familiar with some database we happen to
be using
we haven't be using Oracle Database 12c
but it works perfectly well under 11g
work perfectly well under other
databases like my sequel sequel server
IBM db2 800 di requires WebLogic server
out there somewhere if you have it
installed it will use it if you don't
have it installed it will Oh di install
will install WebLogic server for you
this presumes if you have some basic
knowledge of how to create tables and
fee equal and how to do select star from
table all right so as I mentioned we
happen to be using database 12c but it
works perfectly well under older
versions and we're using data integrator
12 1.2 is the current version and the
demonstration we're going to be going to
is based on the Oracle by example at
this following web location which is on
the start page the splash page of ODI so
when you start up ODI it says welcome
Dodi I here are for tutorials and these
are the four that we're doing so
after this presentation you can go back
and do them again on your own nice to be
able to to do so as we mentioned we're
going to be using the Oracle data
integrator studio which is a graphical
user interface and it accesses the
backend repositories that are built in a
database as well so we'll be using all
we'll be using the first three of these
we'll be using
first we'll start with topology
navigator to create some physical and
logical schemas then we'll be using
designer to create some mappings and
then when we run them will use operator
to make sure that they actually work so
that's what we're going to do the last
presentation we did on Thursday we
discussed creating the repositories we
made a master repository which has the
physical schemas of things out there and
then today we're going to be continuing
to work in the work repository which has
the actual mappings so what we're going
to be using is sources and targets so
the legacy source will be a flat file
and then the target is going to be an
Oracle database you could just as easily
go from database to database but it will
be a little bit more interesting to see
a different kind of source and party so
that's what we're going to do we're
going to use the studio to do it and as
I mentioned we'll be using quality first
followed by designer and then from
designer will run the mappings which
creates unfreezing to opera right so
that's what we're going to do and now
we'll switch to a live demonstration so
I want to share the application that I'm
running which happens to be a virtual
machine okay and hopefully everybody can
see that it's a virtual machine running
Linux and it happens to be Oracle
Enterprise - but it could just as easily
be Microsoft Windows it could be any
number of different platforms what we
happen to be using and this presumes
that we've already got everything
installed so let's take a quick peek and
what we have installed in uo1 app Oracle
we have the database which is underneath
products the databases out there ignore
the fact that it says 11 - it's actually
12 and then underneath middleware
underneath Oracle home we installed ODI
which is what we're going to be writing
and it installs a WebLogic server
underneath that and so that's where all
of the pieces parts live eventually
underneath ODI we are going to make some
demo files and so we're going to work
with a text file of war it's going to
come from our home directory
ok so that's all that's what we're going
to do that's all the basic pieces I'm
also going to be working with sequel
developer as access to sequel so you can
just as easily use sequel plus or you
could use toad where you could use any
of your favorite tools for accessing
sequel I'm the last piece that I want to
mention is I have a couple of
environment variables which will be
handy if I do environment and look for
home we defined a Fusion Middleware home
underneath that we defined ODI home
there's also an oracle home the Fusion
Middleware home in the ODI home through
the word we use ok so now that we've got
all of that let's go
and start up the system so I've already
got myself located in this is ODI home
and then underneath ODI home I got
studio and then underneath that we're
going to run the shell script which
launches ODI
so this is a splash screen
and once that fires up you'll see we're
running 12 1/2
and here we go as I mentioned the start
page shows the tutorials last Thursday
we did this one ODI master and work
repositories today we're doing this one
ODI project and mapping and then on
Wednesday we'll book an agent and then
on Friday we'll create a procedure so
you can come back and do these at your
leisure as we mention the first thing we
want to do of course is connect to a
repository this is the one that we
created last Thursday and to make life
easier we stored our password in a
wallet which is a fairly new piece of
ODI and then in the wallet we have the
user IDs that we will work with
supervisor is the name and the
repository we're working with the ouvea
puzzle where we could have multiple ones
but this ability one happen alright so
we'll log in and as soon as we do that
it will populate the designer with a
bunch of stuff
okay so the designer got populated you
notice the projects is empty the models
is empty if we go to topology we have
quite a few technologies at our disposal
we're going to work with file which is
empty and we're going to work with
goal which is empty so I wanted you to
see all the pieces that we go
okay so we got studio up and running and
the next thing we want to do is to
create the source file that we want to
play with well let's go back to the OS
prompt here and see what we've got at
Agrabah go we've got a file called
continents and it is an ASCII file that
is just simply a column based and I can
edit it you see that his column basement
the inside more I do want to point out
something interesting though if I go in
and look at the file using VI I want to
point out that it is a dass oriented
file and that is the determination of
the line ending characters line endings
and das are different line endings Linux
and I wanted to see so that's a simple
file it happens to have headings you
could make headings or not you can make
it delimited by tabs commas there's a
lot of ways to do this but if it happens
to be a fairly simple flat file this
could have been the output from
spreadsheet any number of ways to create
this file so the file already exists
what we want to do to make sure about
the line editing is we want to do a UNIX
to das of the continent's file and what
that does is it makes sure that the line
endings are I never remember one of them
is parrot return line feed and the other
one is parrot return only and I never
remember which one is which but the
point is we made it into the baske
format if we left it in the UNIX format
we can deal with that too I just wanted
you to be aware of the fact that there
are two different formats and you need
to be conscious of which format it will
okay so it exists the next thing we want
to do hang on
second year oh the next thing we want to
do is we want to copy it to a directory
that we can play with so I want to copy
copy countenance to ODI home a demo file
and then I want to go there demo file
and there's our file ok now that we've
got it placed we could operate on it it
turns out that there's actually quite a
few demo files that you can get from otm
or technical network and if you go out
there you can find a zip that has other
sample ODI demo files but we're just
going to locate it a little thing
directly ok the next thing we're going
to do is create some physical topology
so let's go back to our studio and under
topology we're going to create a
physical architecture for the file and a
physical architecture for Oracle this is
gonna seem like there's a lot of steps
and there are however once you go
through all of this initial effort then
subsequent modeling becomes really
really simple so ODI is very upfront
loaded in terms of effort and then in
the backend it becomes very simple so
the first we want to look at is a file
that we want to open it and this says we
want to file generic where so we want to
specify the host you probably should use
a real IP address or a DNS name but
we're going to simply say localhost and
at that point that's really all that you
need um however you optionally can add
the username
and the password but it is optional and
it is ignored so whether you put it in
or not doesn't matter but it's just you
can do that just for fun so in fact
let's take it out and we'll do test
connection it saves it first it will
always ask you about an agent we're
going to talk more about agents on
Friday it comes with the local agent
which is in fact knowing so we will test
that and you see it works so I'm going
to put this in any way just for
documentation purposes and then we're
going to save that by the way every time
that you see this in italics and you see
the single diskette show up that means
it needs to be saved when I click on the
diskette watch the pet the pet here when
I click on the diskette this becomes non
italic that diskettes goes away and it
has been saved
all right so that's all we need to do
for the file generic you notice that
there's nothing underneath it clicked on
the plus and there's nothing underneath
it yet so what we want to do is we want
to make a new physical schema underneath
a file generic on my local of so I click
new physical schema and on the local
host who wants to know where it is
so the Directory schema unfortunately
you can't browse from here so we have to
type it in let me type you or one app or
coal
little aware or a goal home and of
course it's case sensitive ODI demo file
that's where we put this and since I
don't like typing I'm going to copy and
paste over here and you notice it
appended that to the file name up in top
so that is the Directory schema and the
work schema the temporary files all of
these temporary files down here are
going to be located in the same
directory as the source files and you
can decide whether you like that ideal
you could locate them elsewhere
maybe I could put it in pump but anyway
this becomes italic the single diskette
shows up and so I hit save
if says no context is specified we're
going to look at context in a minute so
it says make sure you come back and
specify a context later we will so we
simply acknowledge the message and
that's good to go now this showed up
underneath BIOS generic under that
particular subdirectory okay so we've
got a physical location for this file
next thing we want to do is want to make
logical location so let's temporarily
close this up the context that I was
talking about the current context we
have are simply global we can pick more
context later we'll ignore that for the
moment logical architecture we go back
to technologies we go back to file and
we see there's already one out there for
sa P and we need to make a new one so we
go file new logical schema which matches
up to the physical schema we get freely
so this new logical schema is going to
be called and you can pick any name walk
open up an app in my flat files this is
that context we just looked at over here
the context the only one we have to
choose from with global and the physical
scheme is that we just picked this is
the physical scheme as that exists so
what we're going to do is we're going to
say that my flat files logically points
to this subdirectory and that way at the
subdirectory or whoo we could have the
mapping this point to the logical school
and we isolate or insulates the changes
from one layers of X ok so keep your eye
on over here when I save this file
it says showed up so now it exists if I
look at it there's nothing underneath it
so it's it's there but it's not in use
by all right so now it exists and we're
done with the logical architecture ok
next thing we want to do is we want to
start going to design so we've done all
of the physical and logical things this
is the the bulk of the work that happens
up front and the designers where we get
to do the fun stuff so currently you see
there's no projects and mill models we
want to organize our models using a
scheme that's convenient for us so we're
going to make a folder which is going to
simply contain the models so we'll make
the folder and again the name doesn't
have to match anything this is going to
be for the HR schema so you put in some
sort of a description and then as always
we save our work okay so now it shows up
as a model if I look there's nothing
underneath it
this is just a this is just a folder I'm
sorry not a model it's a folder
underneath models and so what we want to
do in that folder is we want to make a
new model in the folder so we'll click
on new model and again the names can be
whatever's convenient for you so I want
to name this flat file to HR now notice
that in the upper case I in the upper
example I used a hyphen in the code is
translated to an underscore similarly if
I did a lower case it gets wrapped to
upper case I just want this see the
sorts of changes between name and code
the technology that I'm going to use for
this model is file
and the logical schema that is going to
come from is my flat files okay so we
now have a model that we can use to pull
from the model points to the logical
schema a logical schema points to the
physical school so if that three layers
here model logical physical and
eventually down in there is the file in
question so we're going to save that
I just got a plus or four and now we can
see that the flat file to a chart that
showed up and underneath uses nobody
uses it yet and it doesn't use it so it
simply exists with nothing very
interesting in it next thing we want to
do is we want to go to
hang on just a second try to keep myself
in sync
yeah okay the next thing I want to do is
us close some tabs it got way too many
pads over so we're going to close this
you're all saved so we don't need to
worry about this close bunch of tabs
okay underneath flat file HR we want to
make a data store a data store is a
generic term that refers to any well
it's a data stores spending the storage
data so a flat file storage data or
relational table storage data there are
various kinds of things of store tables
a store data most of the time it'll be a
relational table so we'll say we have a
new data store for flat files the name
in this data store is confidence
notice when I type in the name it picks
up the resource down here however I need
to flesh out the resource a little bit
more so I click on the magnifying glass
of the resource and it says that the
choices I have as it knows the directory
to look in is the countenance that text
file so I want to open that the name
changes under the resource and now we're
good to go
further described this file so
underneath files I indicate that the
file format is fixed meaning columnar as
opposed to tab delimited or comma
delimited or some other delimiter so
it's fixed and as you recall I had one
header room there and here's where you
indicate with the record separator works
now we went out of our way to do units
two dots so we can pick the default
record separator event stylus or we
could have done those two UNIX in this
case we can pick the record separate
reviews so this is where you get to
specify you can also indicate something
other than a paratrooper for instance
I've seen files that have a vertical bar
as a record separator if instead of
fixed it becomes delimited you could say
I'm delimited by a have a space comma
some hex value etc so lots of options
what we're doing is matching the ASCII
file that we created okay then lastly we
go to the attributes tab and what we're
going to do is describe this countenance
file by clicking on reverse-engineer so
when I click reverse-engineer it will
read in the file and of course it says
you want to say that you go let me say
yes always want to say it now the next
prompt is something we talked about last
Thursday in a multi-user environment I
would like to secure the object I'm
working on so that nobody else changes
it while I'm working normal in a single
user environment it doesn't matter so it
is probably not a bad habit to
automatically lock the object within our
usual form using it and so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to say yes
don't bother me the next time just
simply go ahead and lock it and if you
watch you'll see a lock symbol show up
next to the object in question
okay so the lock symbol just showed up
so it reads the file it reads the header
row for some goofy reason it ignores the
values of the header row it just simply
knows that there's a header row and so
these are the text the text but it read
in and what we're going to do is we're
going to mark out where the columns are
visually so as I hover over here you can
see a line that indicates where I am and
I can I can say the first column ends
here here or here I can indicate where I
want the first column go so I'll
arbitrarily say column two but I could
have just as easily said column 3 or 4
and then I'm going to click on column 1
and I'm going to change the name of
column
so column 1 if you remember the heading
was the abbreviation of the continent
and the datatype you can indicate a
number of different data types here I'll
let you just browse through the list I'm
going to indicate that it's a string
actually it could be a fix than fiddles
else a fixed spoon and I can optionally
make a heading the reason I might want
to make a heading is if the attribute
name in let's say a relational table but
something like X 7-5 Daegu and you
wanted to make it say something more
significant like last name then you
could have a heading which kind of
corresponds to an alias that way the
column names are preserved and the
headings become human readable so that's
what I did for column one and then I can
do the same thing for column two pounds
to two ends well you told me you could
end here then here then here you can
kind of beside where then let's say that
it ends here
all right and so then I click on column
two and I change its
heading to be named the name of evidence
and the first column was a fixed string
and this is a variable string you don't
actually say variable you simply text
written and then that is now the second
home the third column is whatever's left
so I don't have to put a red dot apart
simply click on the third column and the
third column contains the area in
kilometers and that is a numeric value
so I click on numeric there's lots of
choices things there and so I've defined
the three columns and I can go back and
look at and I can click a column one is
what we've made from column two is name
on three is area in kilometers and then
when I click on OK it renders all of
that numerically now you can fiddle with
it here if you want the physical length
and the logical length people pain for
instance the the area in kilometers I
could actually whittle that down is
physically 10 characters long I could
watch if we make it 8 because I'm not
using all the characters if there were
decimals I could indicate that here I
could change the order around 1 2 3 I
think water I could do some formatting
quite dollar signs with commas that kind
of formatting a lot of options I can do
all right so now we need to save all of
our work 9 it's saved if I want to make
sure that it works what I can do is
close this and now it's asking me the
opposite question you see that padlock
there I'm done editing it do you want to
unlock it so other people can edit and
in a multi environment multi-user
environment that would be a definite yes
in this case we'll say sure why not and
then the padlock goes away to make sure
that it works
I can save you data and sure enough
here's the data and what I can do is I
can sort by name I can reverse sort by
name I can sort by area I can sort by
area so I can manipulate the text file
in this way ok so now that we've defined
that we're ready to operate on it if I
was curious I could go back in here and
under attributes I could see the three
columns that I testify so if I want to
look at name for instance you can see
that it's the second column
it starts at column three is that a
length is that beam it's a string as
opposed to other stuff and you could
further modify it at this point okay so
this is the source files all set up now
we're done with this now we need to
prepare the target file so what we're
going to do is leave this for the moment
and flip over to sequel developer and we
want to work with the HR user so the
first thing we want to do is as a DBA as
a DBA we want to make sure that HR can
do with it too so I don't know what
privileges they have so let's give them
any privileges as I could possibly want
in real life you probably do something a
little bit less than that so HR is now
ready to operate
then the next thing we want to do is
sign on as HR and just to prepare a
clean environment we want to drop table
confidence
great it doesn't exist or we're in good
shape that's okay and we want to create
the table so I will now type very fast
and we will create the table using
abbreviation name land and kilometers
varchar' varchar' interestingly this is
actually a slightly different size than
the ASCII file that's okay we can map
from here to there we set up a primary
key based on greevey Asian there's
strength against it is the table
countenance primary key to bevel so we
create this file create this table the
table is now created and if I select
from that it should be empty
it is especially affecting tight
okay so we picked up the column headings
but it is ample so hold that thought
because we're going to come back and
populate that file remember the goal of
this whole OBE is to map the flat file
into the relational table okay so let's
leave this and go back to ODI - okay
back in ODI if you remember what we did
for the flat file we did a physical
architecture a logical architecture and
then a model we're going to do the exact
same thing so physically we go to the
polity under physical we've already done
file so now we're going to do a physical
for Oracle so we want to make a new
data server for Oracle we're going to
name it database HR rather clever name
the instance on that database is orful
the user is HR and the password is HR
this is the sample schema and how are we
going to connect that database we're
going to connect to it via data PC so we
pick the JDBC driver we have a choice of
exactly one and we pick the JDBC URL
which is how do we find that database
and its host port and SID so the host is
localhost now if you look very carefully
there's a colon in between local host
and port make sure you leave the colon
in there
the core does the default port of the
listener is 1521 there's another call in
there make sure you leave the colon and
the SID is oral and at this point
we're ready to test so we hit test
connection your data will be saved
keep your eye on the italic and the
diskette it reminds us that after we do
a data server which was what we just did
we need to make a physical schema on the
natal server so okay we'll do that next
we're going to use the local agent with
no agent at all and we hit test and it
worked
okay now this became non italic this
went away and DB HR showed up and if we
look underneath it it's empty so what we
want to do underneath it is what it just
told us to do it to make a physical
scheme so this is the data server and
underneath the data server
why make physical school one the exact
same steps we went through for but and
the schema it's smart enough to read
what's out there so we're going to pick
the HR schema the work schema again you
could locate it under temp if you want
but we're going to put it under HR as
well so it's going to make a bunch of
work tables called eval or C dollar etc
you want to make sure that you don't
have anything new a dollar etc in the HR
schema and that's all we could do with a
moment so we're going to save this keep
your eye on DB HR so
it reminds us that we need a context
remember the context over here was
global okay so now DB HR shows up
underneath deviate our that's right and
that's all we need to do for physical
do a similar thing remember the context
we have is global we could have other
contexts like development or production
underneath logical architecture we made
a logical architecture for the flat bowl
we need to make another one for Oracle
so currently there's nothing there so we
want to make a logical schema that
points for the physical school and we'll
name it something very clever like DBH
our database human resources the context
we only have one choice physical schema
we've only got one choice so the
physical schema is related to the
logical schema and then we need to make
a model that is related to it so keep
your eye on Oracle when I get saved so
DB HR shows up and there's nothing
underneath it yet so we can close this
you can close this so we created a
physical architecture Oracle a logical
architect of Oracle and that's all we
need to do with the polity so we can
close up the policy and the rest of the
operations now is resolved so we go
ahead signer and underneath models
you see that we have a model for in flat
bottles and we want to make a model for
HR so let's just close this up for the
moment and we want to make a new model
not the flat file model but we want to
make
a database model so this model is going
to be called DB HR you don't have to use
those same names and you have that flat
file HR and median car then it can equal
the technology for the other one was
file technology for this one is going to
be Oracle you see there's lots of
choices of different technologies so
that's all I need to do this then what I
need to do is read all of the DBA HR
schema stuff to populate this model so I
go to reverse engineer the last time we
did this it gave us the column reward in
this case we're going to just say a
reverse engineer from here and it's
going to save always wants the save stub
okay
and it goes very quickly interesting
anything that's about at that so if I
look under deep vhr now
I mean my pointer back you see that it
picked up not only the continence table
but it picked up all of these picked up
all of these tables so if I wanted to
make sure that it actually worked
I can go to continence and under
attributes I can see that the column
headings are there from the DDL that
described the object one is created if I
want to view the data it should be empty
right the table should be empty
so the relational table exists there's
got no date which is what we expect okay
we've done a huge amount of work and
this is all the upfront work we don't
have to do any more heavy lifting ever
again so now what I've got is I've got a
database model on a flat file mobile and
the flat pile models got one flat pile
and at the the continents
where's next at the continents table and
then I've got these continents as well
as the other things in the schema as
well so now all of that is done we are
ready to do the map I'm going to skip
section three two in the OBE about
knowledge modules depending on the kind
of server that you use there are
different knowledge modules that
describe how to do imports and exports
and operations but there's quite a few
knowledge modules that are built into
the system so we're going to simply use
the built in one and skip the importing
of knowledge levels if you're curious
how to do that you can look on the OBE
and it describes in detail how to do
that
if you're following along in the OBE
we're now going to pick up on stuff
three deaf three three which is creating
the mapping so if I look in my projects
I see that I haven't got any so what I
want to do is I want to use sewing on a
second
okay I want to create a project this is
similar to the folders that we put
models in so I want to make a new
project and the new project I'm going to
name it export flat file to relational
table notice the lower case gets wrapped
to upper case the dashes get wrapped two
underscores and that's all I need to do
for that and the project then creates a
whole bunch of things underneath it
which are currently empty
what I want to do
is look under mappings under the first
folder he'll under mappings I have no
mappings so what I want to do is create
a mapping this is what used to be called
interfaces so I'm going to do a new
mountain and I'm going to call this new
mapping map flat file to relational
table four continents map flat files to
relational tables for continents and you
can put in whatever other description
you want now this is very very important
create empty data set by default this is
going to be checked and in this case we
want to uncheck an empty data set is
used to create a combination source so
suppose I wanted to join three tables
together that would require a data set
suppose I wanted to Union food tables
together that would require a data set
an empty data set in this case I've only
got one people the continent's table so
I do not want to create an empty data
set if you left this checked which is
the default to to be checked you will
get very strange results so again the
data sets are only used if I have multi
data stores to create a data set for the
source or Target and in this case we say
no so I'm going to create this new
mapping and then it's going to open up a
cool graphical editor here and in the
cool graphical editor we want to drag
the source and target together drag the
objects together so I want to drag the
continents table which is the source the
flat file and
drag the continents table which is the
target over here so if you remember the
continents flat file add a column name
of area kilometer and the other one a
column name of land so that's kind of
how you can eyeball the difference
between all so this one's got a primary
key you can see it's a relational table
the continent's does not have a primary
key because it's a flat part so in order
to connect these two I click on the
connector over here hold down the mouse
and drag the square box until the square
about falls on this handle and then when
I let go I now have the ability to match
columns when you see the word attribute
think columns so I'm matching columns
from the flat table with flat file to
the relational table by name ignore case
and if you can do it make an automatic
mapping so notice here these are kind of
blank and these are kind of blank when I
hit OK I get grey arrows here and gray
out arrows here so it was able to men up
the abbreviation to abbreviation he was
able to map name to name it was not able
to map area kilometer to land kilometer
so I need to do that manually so I pick
up this column and drop it over here
and now I have a second Grail so this
this column maps to this column this
icon up here is the krita phi and so
when I click it it makes everything
pretty
if I take the properties window which is
kind of small and move it over to here
you
oops that's not what I want to do oh
dear
you
you
there we go okay so now that I've got is
I've got a properties window and the
graphical side by side so if I click on
the land kilometer you can see that land
kilometer is mapped from con area
kilometer and if I wanted to I could put
in some additional math here you know I
could do whatever math I wanted to
operate on the column suppose I want to
change it from kilometer if the hectare
example you can do that and I can also
click on the let's say law it'll work
you can also click on the table itself
and it will give you properties about
the table itself if you click on catch
up here second
okay if you click on the table itself
and you look at the integration pipe
you'll notice that this is a control a
pen append assumes that the continence
table is empty which it happens to be
however you have the option of doing a
methyl update which does not assume that
it's empty so you need to decide the
expected behavior going into this as to
whether the continent's should or could
not be empty and you can change that at
this point so we'll leave it the way it
is and then lastly what I can do is I
can click on physical and this will show
a slightly different view of how things
get from here to there
so the con source goes to an access
point and if I click on that access
point we can see that is one of the
built in knowledge models if a loading
knowledge module sequel the sequel built
in global and the access point runs on
the target which happens to be the same
host typical source and that's where the
transformation would happen before
loading into the Cotten's table alright
so we've done all of this we've saved it
let's put it away and the last thing I
want to do is actually executables so we
go back to our mapping which we just
created and there's about four different
ways to execute by clicking on this I
can click on the green arrow to execute
it or I can click on run or I could
right click and click on run there's a
lot of different ways to do it so we're
going to run this mapping the goal is to
map the flat file into the relational
table we have the context of global vs.
development or production the
deployments
the agents which is no agents at all
we'll talk more about agents on Friday
log level let's see there's various ways
you can various amounts of debugging you
can be do let's leave with that and so
we say okay
and off it goes as probably done by now
so what I do to check the status of it
is both to operator and underneath
operator under date
underneath dates underneath today is the
thing that we just ran the highest-level
has a check mark which is good and
there's further check marks down below
indicating that everything is good so
let's look ooh something's curious here
something happened in the math begin so
if I keep expanding it if we go to drop
staging and click on that what it tells
us is a table of you does not exist so
we attempted to drop the staging table
see dollar and since this is the first
time we ran this the staging table does
not exist with this correct and
therefore it warned us about that
however we expected that happen and so
we said ignore Eretz and so it went on
its merry way if I want to see how well
we did I can go to the main section and
in the main section is in the DBH
argument which is the loading of the
table side i see that i had seven rows
that were inserted and they all worked
correctly so I get quite a bit of useful
information coming through the the
operator if something were wrong it
would stop and the high level would be
an error instead of check and I could
figure out in the error message exactly
what about okay so this claims that we
got seven rows imported let's go and
check if we go back to designer and go
back to model and we look at the
continents here
we can view the data of the continence
table and sure enough it's been loaded
just to prove it to ourselves let's go
to sequel developer we ran this once
before and got no results we run it
again and we get results so what we've
done in summary is we created let's go
back and look at the studio for a second
we created a topology we created a
physical architecture for flat file and
relational we created a logical
architecture for flat file and
relational then underneath designer we
created a model for flat file and
relational and then underneath projects
we created a folder and a mapping for
flat files relational so let's just make
sure we touched everything we're
supposed to do
okay let me ask you some questions about
what we've just seen in this particular
case
in this particular case we were going
from a source of flat file to a target
of relational tables I'm curious from
you all what is your most common source
for ODI so Rebecca if you can put up the
pole what's the most common source that
you use when you go to up and obviously
you may use several different for that I
want the most common source and we'll
let that run for a second
and seed in the meantime there are a
couple questions in the Q&amp;amp;A panel okay
let me take a look-see yeah Alice and I
get Q&amp;amp;A to be something a little bit
more visible
Oh Phooey
trying to get expand the column years I
forgot how do I undock the Q&amp;amp;A panel
Stan panel
you can
QA
I can't I can't get the panel big enough
to read it oh you know what I can get in
close poem there we go okay Brian this
looks very similar to OD identity are
there any obvious different than that
the major difference is how the GUI
works and the terminology they paint the
terminology from interface to mapping
they change the terminology from column
to attribute and many of the knowledge
modules are built in other than that is
basically the same idea there are more
sources and more possible targets but
other than that it is pretty simple what
are the options for the integration
model 1200 that's probably 50
integration knowledge module options and
if those 50 aren't good enough you can
write your own so the knowledge module
is a very big long discussion Laurie let
me point you to the manuals in question
and I'll send you a separate email so I
want to thank you all very much for
rounding over with me for a couple of
minutes over this was a session 2 of 4
and we're going to pick up and do agents
and scenarios on Wednesday and bright so
hopefully I'll see you all then and
stick around for a couple minutes and
see if I can answer questions on all
right otherwise thank you all very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
