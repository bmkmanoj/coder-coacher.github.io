Oracle's DTrace technology for Oracle
Linux dtrace is a comprehensive dynamic
tracing facility originally developed
for Oracle Solaris but is now available
with Oracle Linux you can use DTrace to
explore your system and to understand
how it works to track down performance
problems or to locate the cause of
abnormal behavior problems the tort that
this tutorial covers installing the
DTrace packages from the unbreakable
linux network the uln loading DTrace
kernel modules and listing dtrace probes
some simple command line based examples
dtrace scripts and where to get more
information that is the DTrace guide and
the DTrace tutorial for this tutorial
I'll be using a virtual machine in
Oracle VM VirtualBox
I have Oracle Linux 7.1 installed on
this VM the Yui k r3 is loaded version
308 13-90 801 and the system is
registered with uln and I am currently
subscribed to three channels on you Ln
the o l7 dtrace user space channel the o
l7 ue k r3 channel and the o l7 latest
channel i'm going to open up a browser
and show that i'm already logged in to
you ln the system name is o ln g trace
I'll click on my system name to manage
my subscriptions I'll scroll down and
you'll see that I am subscribed to these
three channels the user space dtrace
user space tools - ue k r3 in the o7
latest channel i'll click on the
channels tab then I'm going to click on
the release drop-down list and select
Oracle Linux 7 and scroll down to the
DTrace user space channel and you'll see
that there are two packages so I'll
click on the link to those packages and
notice the de três utils package this
package contains all the details
utilities and needs to be installed on
our system I go back to a command line
window and run an RPM - QA and grep for
DTrace you'll see that the D trace utils
package is already installed and once
you're subscribed to you Ln you can just
run yum update or yum install to install
that package
I'm going to go back to you up to the
uln web interface and select another
channel select the Yui kr3 channel and
you'll see that it has 44 packages
associated with it so I'll click on the
44 link and here you can see all the
DTrace module packages for the different
kernel versions you can also scroll down
at the bottom and you'll see some
additional packages on the list there's
a DTrace module shared headers and a
live DTrace etf package and these are
installed already as you can see in the
terminal window from the output of the
RPM command and if I run your name - are
it shows me the kernel version and then
I need to have the dtrace modules for
that particular kernel version installed
at which I do and if you if you if it's
not installed if you run addy trace
command it will download the package and
install it automatically or you can use
the UM install and just install it
directly I'm gonna go back to the
command line here and do a list of
directory slash live slash modules slash
whatever the kernel version is slash
kernel slash drivers slice DTrace and
you can see the kernel modules are
installed in this directory there are
seven of those you don't need to install
the dtrace I'm sorry the DT kernel
modules those are for internal testing
but you do need to install the
fast-track fast-track module using the
modprobe command and install the profile
module and the SDK and the systrace the
dtrace module gets installed
automatically by installing one of these
other four kernel modules if I do an LS
mod command and grep for dtrace you'll
see that dtrace module is installed
I'm going to list some DTrace probes for
all the providers and to do that use the
de tres - L command for list and it
shows all the providers all the probes
for all the providers probes are tracing
points or instrumentation points that
enable you to record data at various
points of interest each probe has four
fields a provider a module a function in
a name and when you reference these
probes you have to use colons to
separate those four fields if you want
to see the probes for specific provider
use the - capital P and give it the
provider name so here's the DTrace
probes and here's the syscall probes and
there are a lot of syscall probes by
pipe that to work out - L you'll see the
number of Cisco probes and if I count
the total number of probes you'll see
that the majority of the total number
are Cisco probes I can also show you the
just a list of all the proc probes and
the profile' probes and the skid probes
and finally the IO probes now I'll run
some de três commands to enable these
probes to enable all the pros for a
specific provider all you need to do is
remove the - L the list option so that
command there enables all the probes for
the de três provider and it shows the
begin probe and then I do a ctrl C and
it shows the end probe it shows you the
CPU that the probe was where the probe
fire the unique identifier the function
name and the probe name the function
name is nothing in this case I can use
the minus in option and give a
particular or a specific probe name and
the name I gave it in this example is D
strace colon colon colon begin remember
you need a colon to separate each of the
four fields the provider the module the
function and the probe name
I can add an action I can specify an
action the action in this example is
Trace and what I'm going to do is
display hello world traces the most
basic action where just takes an
expression as an argument and traces a
real result to a directed buffer notice
the trace you'll notice the action is
surrounded by curly brackets and
terminated with a semicolon and then
quoted around the whole string if I add
another trace which is exit
I'm sorry another action with just exit
then it exits without me having to hit
control-c I can add a - cue for quiet
and then it suppresses all that all that
CPU and ID and function and name
information and just gives you the
output of the of the action of the trace
come in the next D trace command traces
the time of entry for each system call
the provider is sis call there's no
module name no function name the probe
name is entry the action is trace and
the argument is timestamp timestamp is a
built in D variable that gives the
current value of a nanosecond timestamp
counter
Oh issue the command I hit ctrl C to
exit and the output shows the function
name the probe name and the timestamp
and I'll repeat the command so that you
can see it now I'm going to open up a
second window where I can run some Linux
commands which will generate output for
the remaining dtrace examples in this
video the next dtrace command displays
commands that are executing on your
system the provider is proc is no module
name no function name the probe name is
exec the action is trace and the
argument is string of arc 0 the string
of operator is a d keyword which
converts the operand to a string all
these keywords are again are described
in the de três guide which I'll
reference at the end of the video so
I'll initiate the command I'll go to the
second window and run a man LS to
generate some output quit out of that
come back to the first window and you'll
see the output the function name the
function the name and then the command
that is executing on the system I'll
repeat the command so that you can see
again what I ran
the next dtrace command displays new
processes with timestamps and
command-line arguments the provider is
proc no module name no function name the
probe name is exec - success the action
in this example is printf printf allows
for formatting the parameters consist of
a format string followed by arguments
the arguments are timestamp and a
pointer to the struct PS info which
again is described in the DTrace guide
that I'll reference at the end of the
lesson
the second argument provides the initial
command-line arguments so initially to
command I will run man LS in the second
window to generate some output quit out
of that and then ctrl C to quit and
you'll see the the timestamp is shown
the probe the function name the probe
name the timestamp the process and the
command-line arguments the next DTrace
command displays files opened by each
process the provider is syscall there's
no module name most specify open star is
the function name and this will include
all functions to begin with the with ope
n and the probe name is entry the action
again is printf the arguments are exact
name and copy in string arc 0 exact name
is the name of the current processes X
executable file and copy in string is a
D subroutine which is described in the D
trace guide reference at the end of the
video so initiate the command after I
get all my changes made
then I'll go to the second window and
run man s to generate some output hit Q
the output go back to the first window
again here we show the output the
function or the probe fired the probe
name the process and the files opened by
each process and there's the command
again the next DTrace command displays
the number of system calls by system
call using aggregations the provider is
sis call no module name no function name
the probe name is entry the action in
this example is a num aggregator
aggregation all aggregations num in this
example are prefixed with a an @ sign
probe func is a D built-in variable
which provides the function field of the
current probe count is a function name
whose result is the number of times
called I'll run man s quit out when you
use aggregations no output is shown
until you press ctrl C and then the
output is shown which in this case is
the number of system calls by each
system call the next D trace command
counts the number of write system calls
in the number of reads system calls this
example uses two probes the first
provider is sis call no middle name I'm
sorry no module name the function name
is write the probe name is entry then I
use a comma to separate the two probes
the second provider assists call no func
no module name function name is read
probe name is entry this command also
uses aggregation as indicated by the at
sign string joined is addy subroutine
which is described in the D trace
reference got reference at the end of
this video I'll run man s again in the
second window to generate some output
now I'll quit out of man s and I'll come
back and show the output which is the
number of right system calls invoked by
processes and the number of reads system
calls in book by processes this last D
trace command aggregates the number of
reads system calls but uses a predicate
to exclude the read system calls
initiated by the d-trix process process
predicates are expressions that are
enclosed in a pair of slashes that are
evaluated at probe firing time to
determine whether the Associated actions
should be executed the predicate in this
example is that the current processes
executable file is not equal to D trace
FDS is files that that the current
process has opened in a file info
underscore t array file info underscore
t is described in the de três guide and
fi underscore path name is the full path
name so all these arrays and predicates
and aggregates and variables and
subroutines and all these type of things
that I'm using are described in the D
trace guide that I'll point out at the
end of the video I'll go I'll go to the
second window and run man now now man LS
again with aggregation you don't get in
the output until you hit the ctrl C and
my output here is the process name the
full path name of the file that the
process process had open and then number
of reads system calls invoked by
processes I'm gonna run some dtrace
scripts each script ends with the dot d
suffix I have some scripts already
created this first script shows quanta
sized results for buffer sizes used in
read sis calls it gives a statistical
breakdown of the sizes passed in the
read says call this can be useful to see
what buffer sizes are commonly used
quant sizes addy aggregating function
that is described in the D trace guide
use the D trace minus s option to run
this because the script uses aggregation
no output is displayed until I terminate
it and this shows the
2:56 is the most common buffer size used
reading system calls with 37 instances
the next script counts system calls over
a 10 second period the script name is
sis call D the script increments a
counter and then exits after a count of
10 seconds
use the D trace - s command to run this
because the script contains the exit
action I don't need to press ctrl C I
just need to wait 10 seconds the output
will show the number of system calls by
system call and there you go and I'll
show the contents of the script again
before continuing the next script
records the time that process is spent
invoking recalls reads system calls the
script name in this example is our time
dot d this script stores the value of a
timestamp to a thread local variable
when it enters the read system call and
then subtracts that value from the time
step when returning from that read
system call thread-local variables are
described in the D trace guide that the
script uses the printf action to format
the output and you can see there the
executable file name the time spent in
each read system call in nanoseconds is
is is the result of this script and the
last script is shows the details of
block IO events and this script uses
enumeration which Associates a set of
integers with a set of identifiers
called enumerators that the compiler
recognizes and replaces with the
corresponding integer value I'm going to
run some fdisk commands in the second
window so I can generate some block I
output and you can see there it's
already starting to generate some output
just by listing the devices I'll go
ahead and format or I'm sorry partition
the device and more generate more output
as being generated in the background
accept all the defaults and write it
come back and see the output again the
output includes the CPU where the probe
fired
the uniqprobe ID the probe name the
device name the probe name with a
timestamp the executable file name the
block size sector number so forth this
concludes the DTrace video demo visit
the URL referenced on the page here and
the DTrace guide describes the D
programming language aggregation
subroutines built-in variables and
functions pretty much everything you
ever wanted to know about using d trace
the tutorial gives examples about
tracing operating system behavior
tracing process call process creation
tracing system calls tracing user space
applications and many other examples
