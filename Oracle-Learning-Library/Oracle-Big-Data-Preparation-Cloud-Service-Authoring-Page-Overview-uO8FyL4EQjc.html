service allows me to quickly create a
transform once created transforms are
viewed on their authoring page the
components of this page are a script
panel a recommendations panel a view of
sample data or metadata and a profile
drawer that can be opened or closed at
any time the transform script panel
contains all the actions I perform to
repair and enrich my data initially this
panel is populated with actions that the
recommendations engine has automatically
applied to the data set I can review
these actions and remove any I don't
want in my transform script as I apply
further recommendations and perform
tasks to prepare data this panel gets
populated with those actions and the
update is displayed in the sample data
instantly I can remove an action at any
point in time the recommendations panel
contains all the actions suggested by
the recommendation engine initially all
recommendations for the entire data set
are listed when I select a particular
column from the data sheet the
recommendations panel lists suggestions
only for that specific column I can also
view recommendations from the toolbar in
the sample data panel I select the
recommendation I want to review and
apply it if required metadata is the
default view for a transform the column
names and their type are listed as
columns along with some sample values
for the column the status identifies the
columns that have been modified or added
and alerts me of columns with private or
sensitive data each column has a context
menu that allows me to perform various
tasks on that column to repair or enrich
it using the tool bar I can change the
view of the sample data to a spreadsheet
view and back to the metadata view undo
or redo my actions delete a column or
perform a duplicate analysis to identify
records that have the same value for a
particular column or search for a
specific column name in the profile
drawer the first page shows a complete
analysis of my entire data set and in
the next page I see statistics for a
single column this helps me analyze the
data and prepare the information
accordingly if I perform a duplicate
analysis the results are displayed in
the last page of the profile drawer I
can add multiple data files to this
transform by performing a blend after I
finish editing the transform script I
save the transform and return to the
catalog page to learn more visit us
