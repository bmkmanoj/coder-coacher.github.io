create we are going to create a view
that shows all incidents and problems
raised against a pre created group
called prod group in the search section
let's keep incidents and problems in the
type field you could filter by incident
problems or events we want to show a
longer time period though for example
last 31 days as for the target name
let's put prod - group under target type
let's choose group in the include
members select the target and all
members as for the status
let's leave the default that shows all
open incidents that have not been
suppressed now click get results to view
the result of the search
you can scroll through the result able
to see if you get what you wanted now
that you are happy with the result you
want to create a view for that so click
create view let's give it a name and
click OK now you can see that this view
was added on the left so anytime you
want to look at incidents and problems
raised on your production group you can
simply look at this view this concludes
