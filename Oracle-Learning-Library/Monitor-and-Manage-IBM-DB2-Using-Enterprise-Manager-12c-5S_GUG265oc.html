hello and welcome to the screen watch
for IBM db2 plugin for Oracle Enterprise
Manager 12c today we will be reviewing
the updated 12 10 30 plugin including
its new features and monitoring
capabilities throughout this video we'll
see how the Oracle Enterprise Manager
IBM db2 plug-in is such a great
individual solution for monitoring your
IBM db2 environment its integration with
Oracle Enterprise Manager makes it an
ideal solution for any heterogeneous
database environment before we get
started I want to quickly review what we
will be covering in this video we'll be
going over the plug-in support
capabilities its core features some of
which are new to this release and
finally the plugins integration with OEM
the IBM db2 plugin is compatible with
the current OEM release of 12c are for
it has been updated to include support
for IBM db2 10 1 and 10 dot five other
supported versions include 9 dot 195 and
97 getting started you can see I have
already logged in to an Oracle
Enterprise Manager 12c cloud control web
console and navigated to the enterprise
summary page from here or any other page
in cloud control you can navigate to the
all targets page by selecting targets
all targets once at the all targets page
we can find and view our IBM db2 targets
to refine your search select the IBM db2
database target type from the left
navigation pane this will filter the
list of targets to only targets relating
to this plug-in clicking on the deployed
target will bring us to the plugins home
page the first thing we'll look at on
the plug-in homepage is a summary
overview the summary overview provides
details of the database name and status
uptime db2 version and host also in this
overview administrators are given the
ability to run jobs to start up or shut
down their IBM db2 instance these jobs
can be run by clicking the specific
buttons next to the database or instant
status confirming the job will start an
OEM job in the background at the bottom
of this view is a link to the analysis
page clicking this link will bring us to
the analysis page will visit this in a
moment
next the summary view is the
applications table in this table each
application utilizing this monitored IBM
db2 database will be listed as a row
these rows contain metrics on the cpu
utilization rose read and written and
sequel statements committed against the
database if you click on a column header
the table will sort by that metric type
more detailed data about the db2
database is displayed in the second row
this data includes the cash ratio in the
line graph format table space
utilization in a bar graph and the
database health indicators in a table
hovering over the line graphs and bar
graphs will display call-outs with
details of the specific data points at
the bottom of the home page you can find
the standard OEM incidents and problems
and job activity views here you can
quickly view any incidents that have
occurred from metric threshold and other
problems mousing over the incident will
give the full description while clicking
it will bring you to the incident
manager next we'll navigate to the all
new analysis page by clicking the link
we looked at earlier in the summary
panel this analysis page is broken into
two main sections the top 5 sequel
statements and the top 5 lock weights
the top 5 sequel statements can be
organized by cpu time or execution count
while the top 5 lock weights can be
organized by blocking application
blocked application table or to show all
weights
after selecting the metric to view each
graph can then be filtered to show
different sections in time by day week
and month hovering over different points
in the graph will display detailed
information on that metric point the
table below the graph offers detailed
information about the top 5 sequel
statements for that given graph
selectors mousing over the query in the
table will give a more complete view of
the query moving down to the top 5 lock
Wade's table we are again able to hover
over the table cells to display the
complete metric if it is not fully
viewable the two pages we have just
covered display some of the most
critical IBM db2 information however to
view all of the metrics collected by the
plugin we will navigate to the all
metrics view here the metrics are
collected and organized into metric
groupings the most recent data collected
can be viewed as well as some historic
values that are stored by the plug in
these metric explore the breadth of the
plugins ability to collect data from the
IBM db2 environments to explore metric
further expand the metric group in the
left column and then select one of the
specific metrics you wish to view the
values collective for the metric are
then displayed in the table to the right
as you can see the right portion of this
page is split horizontally into two
sections the top section shows all
collected values and the bottom section
graphs the historical values of the
selected row over time the time frame
for the graph can be changed by
selecting the view data drop down menu
above the table
now that we have a good understanding of
all of the metrics that are collected by
the plug-in let's review the available
incident thresholds that we can utilize
to alert us in the case of a failure or
problem setting incident thresholds and
collecting historic data on these
metrics can prove to be a very
beneficial aid in alerting
administrators of potential issues to do
this we'll navigate to the metric and
collection settings page
the metric and collection settings page
is already predefined without of the Box
thresholds for some of the configurable
metrics
if desired you can fine tune these
thresholds for each of the metrics in
this list to a desired value
you
the last thing we'll look at are the
information publisher reports the IBM
db2 plugin is shipped with over 28 out
of the box reports for easy and quick
reporting of key metrics for an example
let's take a look at the report for the
IBM db2 database table space statistics
as a report loads you'll see that the
data is logically organized for quick
viewing and easy printability the IBM
db2 information published reports are
also great for analyzing trends in data
and finding stress points in your db2
environment before they occur
and that concludes the screen watch for
the IBM db2 plugin thank you for taking
the time to watch the brief
demonstration hopefully you have found
this demo to provide good insight into
the updated IBM db2 plug-in and how we
can add value to your infrastructure
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
