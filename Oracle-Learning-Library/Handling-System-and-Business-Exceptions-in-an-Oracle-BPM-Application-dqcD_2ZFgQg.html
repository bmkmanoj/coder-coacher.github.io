curriculum developer at Oracle I'm going
to demonstrate how to use an event sub
process to handle errors in an Oracle
Business Process Management application
let's get started
here you see the process model for the
process that we'll be using for this
demonstration in it we have two roles a
customer role and an admin role in this
process new customer data is received
and routed to a validate customer
service assuming that the validation was
successful the process then sends the
customer data to an insert customer
service that will insert it into a
database finally the process notifies
the customer that he's been added there
are two types of exceptions that might
be thrown here a validation exception
which is a business exception and a
database error which would be a system
exception we'll use an event sub process
to handle both types of exceptions the
event sub process is particularly useful
since it can be triggered by any task in
the process and can be configured to
catch multiple types of exceptions let's
start them by adding an event sub
process activity to the admin swimlane I
click the activity toolbar item and
select event sub process and then click
it where I want it to go I'll also need
to resize it a little bit
and I need to make room on the exception
flow to add another activity that we'll
do later now we can open the properties
window for the start event within the
sub process we need to change the
implementation type from the default
message start to an error start let's
set the event to listen for both
business and system exceptions by
selecting these checkboxes then we can
just click OK to close the properties
window
notice that the icon change to an
exception icon now we need to add an
interactive activity to the exception
flow to enable the admin user to handle
the exception we'll make it a simple FYI
interaction when I click this on the
exception flow the properties window
opens up to allow us to configure the
implementation so I'll select the
implementation tab and we need to assign
a human task as the implementation for
this activity so I'm going to click the
Browse button because I have a human
task already defined called notify admin
we also need to map the customer data
object from the process into the notify
admin human task we do that from the
associations editor I'm going to select
the customer data object from the
process node on the left and I'll also
select the customer argument within the
notify admin human task and then I'll
drag a connection line between the two
then we can just click OK to save the
changes and we can also close the
properties window as well now there's
just one more thing we need to do we
want the process to end immediately at
the end of this exception flow so we
need to change the type of
implementation for the end event to
terminate so let's open the properties
window for the end event I'll click the
implementation tab and we'll change it
from a none end to a terminate end and
click OK now if the validation is
rejected throwing a validation exception
or if a database error is thrown when
trying to insert the new customer data
in either case the exception will be
caught by the event sub process and the
admin user will be notified with the
specific customer information and then
the process will end this has been a
demonstration of exception handling for
an Oracle BPM process using an event sub
process I'm Jill Moretz thanks for
watching
