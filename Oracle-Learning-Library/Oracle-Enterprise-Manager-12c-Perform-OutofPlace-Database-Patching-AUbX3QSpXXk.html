Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series this demo work you through
the new methodology of patching and
Oracle database we call this method out
of place patching
out of place batching is the recommended
approach from Oracle because it will use
less downtime and keep your old home
available for recovery finally it
provides flexibility by selectively
patch only the databases in an Oracle
home which has approved downtime without
disturbing the others the rest of the
databases can be patched at a letter
maintenance time window out of place
patching will copy the existing Oracle
home apply the patches to these new
Oracle home to stage everything with no
downtime and then switch databases to
run from the newly clone Oracle home you
can choose to then switch from one to
own databases in the patched Oracle home
from the summary page go to the
enterprise menu then choose provisioning
and patching and then patches and
updates with Enterprise Manager 12c
patch automation is integrated with my
Oracle support however even if you do
not have connectivity to my Oracle
support you can still use patch
automation from the patches and updates
page you can see the patch
recommendations section which gives you
a comprehensive view of the Oracle
recommended patches included CPU and psu
patches patches are classified into two
categories security and other
recommendations the psu patches are in
the other recommendations category so
let's click on that one to look at the
applicable PS use for your targets on
the patch recommendations page
enterprise manager calculated the
patches that could potentially be a
why to your targets here let's select
deuce two rows one selected you have to
add them to what is called a patching
plan so select add to new give it a name
and then click create plan from here
click on View plan to look at your plan
matching is done in five steps you can
see them on the left here as you can see
we are now at step two well the new plan
was created with two database instance
that need to be patched now let's go to
the next step which is where you specify
the various options about how to apply
those patches because we want to apply a
patch that update which is pretty
important oracle recommends to do that
using out of place mode that is why it
is already selected by default here on
the customization page you can also
choose what to patch and here our two
database instances are already
pre-selected now you need to specify a
new Oracle home location so let's create
a new one give it a name and then a
location you can then validate your new
location so this one is validated and
you can click create this new Oracle
home location will be used to clone the
existing one and the patch will be
applied to that new location you now
need to specify the right credentials
for your selected targets here the
correct credentials are already
pre-selected and we are good to go click
Next to go to the next step in the
patching flow that is to validate the
patch validating the patch means that
for example we will check if the patch
we want to
white is compatible with patches that
were already applied to your targets and
if your Oracle home is in good enough
state to be patched click the analyze
button to start this validation process
during that analysis Enterprise Manager
connects directly to my Oracle support
and check to see if there are any
incompatibilities in addition the
analysis also looks at the states of
your Oracle home to make sure we can
reliably apply the new patch for example
it will check the inventory location to
make sure it is valid it will check
there is enough disk space on the target
the database and sequel plus are running
fine and in case of RAC for example it
will verify cluster where it's
functioning properly
searching analyses can take 15 minutes
or more to complete so for demo purposes
let's use another plan containing the
same and that has already been analyzed
so let's go back to patches and update
select the successfully analyzed plan
and click view in an out-of-place
patching once your plan was analyzed you
are ready for the next step that is cold
prepare these step clones the Oracle
home and applies the patch to that home
without incurring any downtime on the
existing Oracle home however for demo
purposes we will not do the prepare step
instead we will use another plan that is
already in prepare state so let's go
back to patches and updates and from
there select the plan that is already
prepared and view it after a plan has
been prepared you are good to go with
deployment the deployment action happens
during the maintenance window where the
database instance is switched from the
old Oracle home to the new Oracle home
and if there are any sequel scripts that
need to be applied like in the case of
psus
they will
biron during deployment if you click
deploy the deployment process can be
tracked at a step by step level while
the deployment is in progress click on
here during this operation
it runs the prerequisite checks one more
time to ensure the database is elf
enough since the cloning operation has
already happened in the patch was
already applied it will skip the prepare
operation and will enter the migrate
phase by starting the blackout's on the
source oracle home stop the database
instance and migrate the database
instance from the old to the new Oracle
home once the database is migrated all
sequel scripts that needs to be applied
are executed at the end of this process
the listener is migrated to the new
Oracle home and the target properties of
both database and listeners are buried
in Enterprise Manager The Blackout is
then cleared as well as the temporary
file finally it collects the
configuration and batch information for
the Oracle home and the listener to be
able to generate reports if need be for
demo purposes we will stop here thanks
