developer for Oracle I'm going to show
you how to create an i/o domain in
Oracle Enterprise Manager op center
let's create an i/o domain on the t2a o1
virtualization server begin by expanding
the plan management pain then profiles
and policies
select logical domain and then in the
actions pane click create profile the
create profile logical domain wizard is
displayed in the identify profile panel
enter a name for the profile leave the
checkbox selected to create a deployment
plan and select the physical i/o domain
subtype and then click the next button
in the specified domain identity panel
enter a name for your logical domain and
then click the next button
in the configure logical domain panel
specify the CPU and memory settings and
then click the next button
in the specified pcie endpoint devices
panel take a look at the types of
endpoint devices that you can attach and
then select Ethernet device leave the
number set to one and click the next
button in the specify storage and disks
panel click next we'll specify storage
later when we apply the plan in the
specify networks panel at the network to
be connected to the i/o domain and the
number of connections for that network
click the next button to continue
review the summary panel and then click
the finish button the profile is created
and listed under logical domain in the
plan management pane
your next step is to apply the plan
that's associated with your i/o domain
profile
you
in the Select target assets window ad
virtualization server to the target list
this is the server on which you want to
create your IO domain click the next
button to continue
in the specified domain identity panel
leave the default name as is and click
the next button in the PCIe endpoint
devices assignment panel select a device
and click Next
in the storage resource assignments
panel leave the name of the virtual disc
server as is in the table at a storage
resource for the i/o domains operating
system in this example we'll select a
lung
you
take a moment and review the
multipathing settings
click the next button to continue in the
specify network connection settings
panel leave the settings as is we want
the connection to be created using a
virtual network device otherwise known
as a V net the tagging mode doesn't
apply in this case because the network
is not a VLAN click the next button to
continue in the networks resource
assignments panel select a service
domain for each network the service
domain contains the virtual switch for
the network click Next
scheduled the job now and click Next
finally in the summary panel review all
the settings for your i/o domain make
sure they're what you want and then
click the apply button
expand the assets pane and take a look
at the virtualization server
notice that your i/o domain is listed
now and it has a lock next to it while
it's being created
when the job is finished and the i/o
domain is created
notice that the lock is no longer
displayed only the arrow now it's ready
for an operating system and that is how
you create an i/o domain in Oracle
