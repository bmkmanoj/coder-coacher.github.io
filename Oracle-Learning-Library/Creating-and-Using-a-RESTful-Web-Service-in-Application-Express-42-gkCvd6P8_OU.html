to create a restful web service
declaratively using application Express
sequel workshop with the application
Express listener and then consume that
same service using Oracle application
Express is support for declarative
creating clients based on restful Web
Services
from the application builder homepage
you start by going to sequel workshop
pulldown menu and selecting restful
services from here you're going to click
the Create button you're going to
provide a name a URI template which will
be part of the URI used to access this
resource you're going to include a
handler with the get method and specify
a query that will return as a JSON to
the invoker of the service and then you
can go ahead and click create module you
want to make a small change to this
resource handler by changing requires
secure access to know which allows you
to access the service of HTTP instead of
HTTP now you want to go ahead and test
the service by clicking the test button
to ensure it works properly you receive
the JSON result and you want to make
note of the URI which is used later when
we create a client to consume the
service so at this point we want to make
things a little more interesting and
we're going to change the format of the
resource handler to a CSV and you also
want to add a where clause to the query
which references the bind variable DEP
for Department you can go ahead and
click apply changes and finally what
we're going to do is add a parameter to
this handler which is an input to this
service as an HTTP header that will map
to the bind variable that you supply in
the modified query so we're going to go
ahead and give the parameter a name DEP
and then go ahead and create that
parameter
now that you have defined the restful
service you can consume it in any client
that can interact with restful web
services and connect to the URI in this
video you are simply going to consume
the service with the same application
Express instance used to create the
service so we're going to go ahead and
create a new application and give it a
name
and we're just going to go ahead and
create the application with just a
homepage
next you're going to go into shared
components and select the web service
references option and we want to go
ahead and create a new one so we'll
click the Create button and we want to
choose the rest option as the reference
type and click Next and then supply a
descriptive name along with the URI to
the service that you tested previously
and add the HTTP header dep as the input
into the service and then click Next
there are no additional inputs to the
service so you can delete the parameter
and then click Next in the next step you
want to describe the response expected
from the restful service you change the
output of this restful service to be CSV
so you can choose text for the output
format and that is going to make the
parameter delimiter and new record
delimiter will default to comma then you
want to go ahead and enter in the names
for the parameters that you expect to be
returned and the path to them in the
response and so that in this case the
position they are in the comma separated
list when finished click the create
button
you
if the webservice reference is created
you can navigate to the create form and
report on web service reference wizard
and choose the reference that you just
created your going to select the
defaults for the page and region
attributes and then click Next this is
step allows you to choose which
parameters the wizard will create items
for and so you're just going to accept
the default and then change the item
label to Department and click Next and
then here is where you want to select
all of the parameters from the response
that you want to report on and then you
can click Next and you're just going to
take the tab default options and then
click create you want to go ahead and
run the page and log in using your
credentials
at this point you can go ahead and put
in a number for department and click
Submit and it's going to run the restful
web service to produce the results note
that the report contains results of
employees for department 10 we want to
go ahead and change that to Department
20 to verify that you receive different
results that in the report this
