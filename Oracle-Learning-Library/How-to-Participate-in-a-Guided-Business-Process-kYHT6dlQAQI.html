curriculum developer at Oracle in this
demo I'd like to show you how to
participate in a guided business process
in oracle business process workspace
let's start by logging into business
process workspace by default your home
page is the tasks my tasks page this
page shows all of your current tasks you
can't tell just by looking at the list
but two of these tasks are part of a
process that has been configured as a
guided business process they belong to
an onboarding process namely a process
to bring a new hire on board and get him
or her up to speed you could perform the
tasks from this page if you wanted to by
opening the task and doing whatever is
required in the details pane notice
however that there is no context for
these tasks you can't tell how far along
the current task is in the process nor
what came before or will come after
since the process to which these two
tasks belong has been configured as a
guided business process you can see much
more context on the activity guides page
there are two instances waiting for your
attention if you select an instance you
are presented with the current task as
in the my tasks page the task details
appear in the lower right pane notice
however that the left pane provides more
context for the current task you can see
how many interactive tasks there are all
together and what percent of the tasks
are complete you can see that this is
the first task in the process you can
expand the other folders
to see what tasks remain and you can
perform the current task in the right
pane if you select the other process
instance you see that for this instance
you have completed the first two
interactive tasks and are on the third
only interactive tasks are listed here
and they are grouped into logical
milestones the process may include
automated steps before and after some of
these activities but these are not
relevant to the process participant so
they are not shown here your
administrator could arrange for the
activity guides page to be your home
page so it is displayed automatically
when you login note that if you
participate in processes that have not
been configured as guided business
processes you would need to go to the
tasks my tasks page to see them so
that's all there is to it just navigate
to the activity guides page select a
process instance and perform the task
from there you'll see the context for
the current task how far along you are
what tasks came before and what tasks
will follow because guided business
processes clearly indicate the set of
tasks to be performed end users report a
better user experience and typically
require less training to complete their
tasks I'm Rosie pillar and I hope you've
enjoyed this demo thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
