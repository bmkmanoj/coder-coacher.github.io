the next hour tripping over wires here
and trying to keep you guys awake
despite this being the last session
before lunch by talking about how you
can make your data centers more quieter
by using no squeal databases so no
squealing actually the space of no
sequel started out a while ago and was
Julie revolutionary because at that time
who would not use a relational database
for everything I mean I'd use relational
databases for storing encryption tables
we call a long way since then and
they're not it's not as strange as it
used to be to to use a non-relational
database but I still believe there's
there might be some confusion left on
who's who and what's what and what are
the different options and how they work
and what are the models and what's the
difference really and what's the same
and really it's in a way it's all the
same as it as it's always been in to
quote some famous singer somewhere once
said it's all the same only the names
will change so it's really all the same
as it was in the 70s it's just different
vendors different new buzzwords few the
databases a different kind of names to
them but really the the ideas have been
around for a long while but still I
believe there might be some confusion I
don't know if this still funny for
example it Mike or if it's still true
but this was a lot of fun a few years
ago two guys wearing suits and mustaches
in the office talking to one another
about so how do i query this new
database it's not a database it's a it's
a key value store okay it's not a
database still how do i query it
well obviously you write a distributed
MapReduce function in our line did you
just tell me to go fuck myself believe I
did Bob believe I did and if you don't
think it's funny that I put words on
this on the screen at least it's funny
that they wear suits and have moustaches
because they both look like Joe
Armstrong the guy who wrote who created
our line and I think that's funny yeah
and I stole this picture so I'm going to
be as I said the things that these
things has been around for a while
things have changed and not and stay the
same in various waste breath or history
or databases and actually the the
categories of no sequel databases are
pretty much the same as when the no
sequel movement started as they are
today but the vendors of course are very
different or many of them have changed
since then and the products have changed
quite a bit as well so rapidly evolving
um space so I'll be going through that
and it will take another 55 minutes so
it starts from the beginning there used
to be a lot of databases back way back
when I should have my nose so
non-relational databases is nothing new
in fact many of these databases predates
the relational model for example as who
I could have said something about myself
at the first light I'm also while trying
to keep you guys awake i'm going to try
to keep myself unbiased because I
actually work for one of these vendors
I'd see how that goes even though one
database it's obviously superior to all
the others I'll try to do not say that
alright so there were lots of different
databases back in the day many of them
were tightly integrated with specific
query language they all or had their own
prayer languages I don't know how many
of you use mumps but it's a very
interesting query language and old there
was a database called pick I was
essentially like what we call what we
categorize this column databases today
so those aren't new and it was
integrated with with with a programming
language called basic basic I know I
have then lots of them were of course
integrated with COBOL Costa was the big
language it's still fairly big actually
Network databases of the days
outperformed sequel databases buts the
but really the relational model still
beat them and why was this well first of
all because back when this happened in
nine in the 1980s everyone looked the
same everyone was the same everyone
looked like this and where is my hover
skateboard everyone had one job one
salary and one wife because women didn't
work and and everyone was the same so we
had lots and lots of data it was all the
same and we wanted to do queries on lots
of lots of similar data I wanted to do
AG get some those theta we wanted to
find out what's the average salary on
everyone on payroll what's the highest
what's the lowest how much less can we
pay them and still still not be sued and
whatnot so having a database model that
was really good at dealing with sets of
uniform data was what everyone wanted
and that's where what the table model of
operational database is really good at
and also even though every database
vendor at
time and this was started in the 60s
actually tried to come up with their own
query language for for separating the
breaking away from from their
implementation language and allowing you
to query the database outside of of
Kobol from some different language
squared from C which was a new radical
language at the time for example sequel
was the first successful query language
for a database it was clear I've had a
well-defined semantics and so we were
really was the first one that you could
use from from any programming language
and would work the same regards away it
was a single interface between your
program in the database and it was and
relational databases where the first to
have that so in the in the 80s they they
just took over although recently we've
had trends moving away from from this
uniformity we now have data is more of a
mix and less uniform data today is
largely well not necessarily
unstructured but but rather semi
structured so wild atta has some
structure there might be a few similar
items to a few similar properties to all
to all data items there are also a lot
of differences between the between the
data items wendys such as you might have
for jobs you might work without getting
paid you might do volunteer work you
might not be married you might be
married to multiple people even though
that's not legal in this country so data
is not as uniform as it used to be and
trying to model that in a relational
database
it's going to lead to either one of
these two weird cases which are neither
of which are good for good match for a
relational database the first top not
one being there one big very very wide
relational table I'm sure you've seen
this at some point where most of the
fields are null all of them are not able
most of them have null values or a very
small table with the few required values
combined with a a table with which has
extra key value additions to the two
these entities so an extra attribute
table as shown here extra attribute
table both of these cases lead to slow
query performance awkwardness in
modeling weird queries and just mmm I
wish we could do this better which is
one of the reasons in no sequel movement
happened another reason is this data is
growing exponentially this is an
exponential curve what exponential means
that given a certain fixed time slot
within that fixed time period we we
create more data than in all of the time
preceding that time period I don't know
what the exact time is I think it's
something like two years currently so in
two years we create more data than we
did throughout all history before those
two years so we need to be able to
handle more data now then we need that
we needed to handle navies obviously
this data grows exponentially so we need
databases that can handle more data
because not only are more people storing
data but we're also storing more data in
in each place restoring data about more
people restoring more data about people
and about other things restoring data
about data so we need a databases that
can handle larger volumes of data and
larger amounts of modifications to data
so a larger right load larger read load
and just larger data sets so that's the
other another thread trend for why the
no sequel movement happened and also
data change changes not only this is
becoming more and more diverge and less
structured but it's also becoming more
and more connected over time I mean if
data started out the first data
management systems that we had were
simply the file systems we could manage
files on a file system simple on simple
unconnected data elements then we had
this is tree structure slightly more
connected could have been modeled by one
of the early a network databases for
example such as codicil could be modeled
through hyperlinks for example slightly
more connected than a than a simple
plain single unit file system modern
database schemas are a lot more
connected even I mean if you look at the
typical schema of of an enterprise
application you be happy if it look like
this most often they would be tiny tiny
boxes like this but filling the whole
screen I've seen a lot of those or even
more connected social data today
Facebook it's all about connections the
connections are the things that are
important so data is becoming more and
more connected and that's another trend
that made us move away from relational
databases or at least come up with
alternatives relational databases still
have their use cases but alternatives
are viable
so I said I was going to talk about a
few different of these databases and
let's start with start with a simple
ones a key value stores key value
databases they're named from the obvious
fact that they store data as keys and
values and there are a few examples of
these for example amazon simple DB
probably one of the more one of the
bigger names today memcached is
definitely a widely used one it wasn't
even called database memcache wasn't
called a database when when it started
around it was called it was a cash I
mean even says cash in the name but then
the notes equal moon would happen and
and suddenly everyone was allowed to
call themselves database even if they
didn't persist data even this big
database company Oracle launched around
the year ago a product call oracle no
sequel database which is actually a key
value store i bleep Redis is another one
of these so there are a bunch of
different names and then when I last
gave a presentation on this topic this
one didn't exist or did but it wasn't
same as it is today this one didn't
exist at all this one was fairly new and
not very popular yet so as I said the
names have changed still category
remains so one way of thinking of a key
value store is that and this is what
makes them interesting is that you get a
scale really well too lots and lots of
machines so data is just single opaque
data objects just blobs of data the
database doesn't really care about what
the data is all the cares about is that
you identify it with a key it's a key
and some value so you can have many
machines and it's really easy
or the database system to distribute
those values and redistribute them
across multiple machines so if I insert
some oops that's I didn't have they're
connected by insert some value is really
easy for the database to figure out well
you had a key that said Apple some so
it's going to go into the this bucket
and I'm also going to replicate it with
a factor of three and those three
replicas are going to be these ones and
when I then insert a fish it's going to
be equally easy for pretty database to
figure out where a fish should go the
database doesn't really care about what
the values are doesn't care about the
fact that an apple and a fish or really
very different things all like the care
about is that I had a key it was fish I
had a key it was apple and it made it
somewhere into the database and when I
have when I come I come looking for key
for apples and fishes the data bills
will know where it is even if I've
changed the number of machines I've
added more machines taking machines away
change the topology in other ways it
will know where that data should be now
and migrated it to that position or
nowhere where it was before and know how
to get it for me and that's because data
is really simple it's just these keys
and values so even it can be migrated at
will so when where they use one of these
well for example if I have something
like like a media sharing or content
sharing platform where I don't wear what
I care about is I have these binary
objects don't really care about what the
content of them is but I care about
being able to upload them quickly have
many many users upload them at the same
time because they're cute and have cute
filters on them so people love them
and I wanted so I wanted to be fast
handle massive loads massive load so I
want to be able to do as my user base
grows I want to be able to just add more
machines to it and we just handle more
load will scale virtually linearly with
the number of machines and the 22 to the
low that I need so platforms that do
this benefit a lot from from using key
value stores because their data is
fairly simple one step up the ladder of
data complexity we find document
databases document databases are really
still data identified by by a key in
each data element is still one single
contained unit just that database knows
more about what's in that unit now and
we have a few examples of these one
early example that I kind of how popular
this is now but lotus notes is actually
a document database and some claim that
all document databases are still just
lotus notes in a different packaging one
of the more popular ones today is Mongo
DB and react and radius are also quite
popular some claim that these two are
better than Mongo but mainly I think
Mongo is just getting a lot of shit
because they're they're the most popular
one the moment couch used to be really
popular but then they change their names
every month and they're probably not
even called CouchDB anymore they're
probably cow called mem couchbase or
something and it's largely forgotten
sadly
because they were really early in the no
sequel movement then introduced a lot of
other concepts that are still quite
quite interesting in those vehicles such
as using restful interfaces for
accessing data was largely pioneered by
couch so document database is store data
as the documents so we have a document
still identify by a key an ID so all
documents have an I have an ID most of
these databases assign these keys for
you but many allow you to to sign Keys
yourself some of them have a duplicate
by over if you don't psyche assign a key
yourself you one will be assigned for
you it's kind of like a Miranda thing
then then a document contains simple key
value pairs so have a first name and
last name in this document and what's
interesting with document database is
this that I can also nest documents so I
can have a key value pair in here where
the value is another document note
however that this document is completely
contained within the top-level document
so it's actually from the database point
of view this is actually one big
document it just happens that the
structure of this document is such that
it contains the sub document then I can
have multiple other documents in the
database and it don't have to be all the
same as I said one of the trends is that
data is less and less uniform so while
these have have some keys in common they
don't have to this is just because my
application happens to to create data
that always has the first name and last
name fields bar while while this one
owns a clock this one has an occupation
this guy is apparently unemployed
and the nice thing is that the database
will be able to in an ad hoc fashion
query the documents that happen to have
the same fields so even if even if I
haven't defined in a schema or anything
I thought that there is such a thing as
first name I'll still be able to run
queries that but ask for a particular
first name and the database will will
only consider the records that have or
the documents that have first names but
as I said documents here are completely
isolated if I want to relate between two
different documents I would have to do
that on the on in my application on the
application level database itself
doesn't doesn't know how to deal with
relationships between between entities
so if if we have a another I guess these
are persons another person in in this
database still has the same first name
last name that happens to be in love
with with this person the database
wouldn't know anything about the fact
that that these two have some sort of
relationship you would just know that
yeah there's a field here it has a value
so what I don't care it's in my
application I would I would make sense
of that which also means that things
such as things that are related
relational database handle for us such
as foreign fields and making sure that I
cannot remove this document without
while there are relationships to it the
database doesn't care about that if you
remove this document you when you
traverse that link you get nothing 404
it's scaling the same way the internet
does the internet is also lots of HTML
documents and that's largely how they
talk about it and sometimes as well
about being web scale
one of those cool bus words building a
blogging platform might be a use case
where I would employ a document database
why do I pick that example why do I
spilled water all over the place those
are questions and humanity will never
know the answer to no it's because it's
so intuitive blog blog posts are
obviously documents so i will model my
post as just a simple document contains
a short value that is the title longer
bigger value that's the text it doesn't
matter it's just values and i contain a
list of values that I call tags and I
can search for proposed to contain
certain tags and then I would model my
comments as as nested as a list of
nested documents and I would scale this
up to have documents representing the
actual blogs and refer to to the post in
the blogs so it's simple and nice
because the model that I implement in my
database reflects the model that I
reflects the domain that our modeling I
have a very close relationship between
the data modeling in the way I model
with the next category then I'll talk
about is the one where we're all try to
be unbiased because this is one of the
where I work so graph databases is is
definitely not treating data as single
isolated elements anymore with graph
databases it's all about how things are
connected to one another
that's the main the most important thing
about theta in a graph database in some
way graph database is even more
relational than relational databases so
while key value stores and document
database are very much non-relational
graph database can be considered more
relational because the relationships are
our really first class in a graph
database whereas there inferred by by
set operations and joins in in a
relational database so one example of
such database is neo4j which is the
product of the company I work for and
the Emperor jay is a graph database and
in a graph database our model things as
nodes and relationships between nodes so
here I have neo4j as a node graph
database as a node and new pj is a graph
database so I have a relationship that's
labeled with the label it's a between
Nia Jay and I grand the graph database
notes I have again I have these diverged
set of nodes where where this node
clearly represents a different kind of
thing than this does then I have
relationships between them we're not
alone in this space we have a few
competitors we are modestly i would say
that we r the leading graph database at
the moment but there are big names in
the space search objectivity they're
been around for a long time doing object
databases and they decided hey really
what we should be focusing on is graph
databases and they're creating one of
those called infinite graph another one
that's been doing graph databases longer
than we have is friends and they have a
product called allegro graph and while
while we have
forge a sort of implying for java and in
our name they're stealthily hiding the
fact that therefore lisp so i guess
that's why we don't see much competition
from them there's also hypergraph DB or
an infrared which are not making much
noise at the moment one thing that I
think one of the competitors that I
think is quite interesting as dicks
which is a database created at a
research center a university in
Barcelona but leave Barcelona Spain
somewhere at least there the rate
research is quite good their product
packaging not so much but but their
research is really solid so it's an
interesting database for sure virtus DB
and flock TV verdicts have they launched
have enough launch I don't know flock DB
is something created by Twitter and it's
a very special purpose prof database
that's very well tailored for Twitter's
a use case the who follows who use case
but doesn't really handle anything else
than that alright so those are a few
vendors let's look more at the model of
a graph database by an example and now
I'll take this opportunity to to give
you some cultural education as well
doctor who is the longest-running
science fiction series ever it's about
the doctor what am i doing that makes
that sound the doctor is a Time Lord
from Gallifrey who stole a TARDIS and
use it to travel through time and space
so I have relationships from the doctor
to the planet he's from and the object
he stole he doesn't travel alone in fact
he travels with companion
one or more companions at any given time
and these companions have relationships
between one another as well the current
two companions are in fact married to
one another travelling through time and
space isn't just fun and making friends
the doctor is made a few enemies through
his travels as well so we can so we've
modeled the the fictional domain of the
of the Doctor Who universe in the graph
through various nodes and relationships
of different types or with different
labels but we can also overlay this
graph with with a different kind of
domain so since this is a science
fiction series and the longest-running
one in fact the first actor who played
the doctor is now deceased so we had a
number of actors playing the doctor and
these are used a few of them throughout
history and so we can model that as well
we so we can have both the fictional
domain being modeled in the same graph
as we have the as we have the
information about the the actual TV
series in the same graph so we have
given two different overlays of
different kinds of domains all mobile
than the same data set and then of
course we have episodes where for
example the Daleks and Rose Tyler both
appeared in the bad wolf episode so did
the doctor in one of the incarnations
that isn't here and we have what are
their names now again
this doctor and the cyl torrents and the
Cybermen in a good man goes to war so we
have characters appears in episode so we
still have the fictional ties into the
real world so if I want to use the data
I graph database for something that
isn't categorizing one of my nerdy
obsessions for example I could create a
a social database which really is one of
the it's the most obvious one out of the
most popular use cases for graph
databases there are other use cases such
as the second most obvious I think would
be network topology management which we
have a lot of customers doing but also
things such as master data management
and risk analysis and such things so say
I would want to to model a social
network between the as an example I used
TV series again the this is a movie the
carry the social graph of the characters
by in the matrix who might and and as
with the popular social networks of
today people can belong to groups so I
have a social graph with two different
kinds of relationships friendships and
memberships of groups so two different
kinds of nodes I have people who are
blue and in this picture and groups that
are purple this picture but i can also
overlay this with gathering information
about the habits of these people for
example their shopping habits and do
things such as
product recommendation which we have a
few companies to do this company does
not use our product but it's a good it's
a good example of product recommendation
if they had been using a graph database
I'm sure their recommendations would be
better how do you query one of these
things so you query a graph database by
defining patterns that you want to match
in the graph and use these patterns for
for traversing with reversing the graph
you start from somewhere and then you
traverse using a pattern and this really
is the key differentiator between graph
databases today and the network
databases of the 60s and 70s and in fact
we started out in the same way as they
did with the purely pro grammatical
interface but I think this is where we
evolve beyond that by having a decoupled
query language where you can actually
query the graph through there's
something that's in many ways it's
similar to to sequel but in many ways
very different so you have graph
patterns expressed as ASCII art so we
have a note here a and the relationship
drawn with just a ski arrows in between
the note B then I'm curious you put this
in a query you start from somewhere
store from a match from A to B through
loves relationships and u-turn u-turn
the lovers and of course you can do much
more complex and interesting things but
this is not a talk on graph databases
talk on no sequel space in general so
I'll move on to the next type of
database
that's one of the big four categories
and no sequel that's the column oriented
databases this is one of the most
popular most famous column stores in the
world it's in Greece stores many columns
I've never seen that many columns stored
in one place before this is usually
different from how column database works
it's just a really cute picture and take
a good long look at it because Greece's
economy is really not doing very well
and the workers who are supposed to
keeping this this thing from from
falling over are on strike I think it's
four out of five days a week now so
that's why I put that picture up there
because it's still standing but it might
not be for long so what about the column
databases then so they store data in
will really they embrace this semi
structured nature of data that we have
today by having stored still storing
data in kind of like the column the row
column tables that we have in relational
databases but having a row be more like
a document in document database and have
it participates in multiple columns
that's a very naive interpretation of
what a column database to us and in fact
they are I believe one of the most
complex kind of databases in the no
sequel space but man do they scale damn
these are good but hard parts use but
really good
the big one to first make a big splash
was google's big table it's not
something that you can pick up and use
because it's completely internal Google
like everything else what you can use is
Cassandra or age base which is part of a
dupe and I believe hyper table is also
available for use although not nearly as
popular as Cassandra which really is the
dominant column-oriented database in in
the wild when will I use a column
oriented database like say that I wanted
that my use case is that I want to
handle lots and lots of Rights I have a
really high right load for some reason
maybe someone is writing really short
messages all the time and need to handle
that and the reason I'm picking this
example of the micro-blogging example is
because that's the only reason that
that's the only example that Cassandra
themselves have been talking about for
the past three years at least so I guess
it makes sense so here I would have so
the reason I would pick a column
database for this is because even though
it's it requires me to to denormalize my
data somewhat i still have i get the
benefit of having close to linear right
scale and really good right performance
i can scale this database out to
multiple machines horizontally scale
them and i'll get i'll be able to have a
more and more right load for for each
machine that i add i'll be able to
handle the read load as well but
I'll not necessarily have my data
available for read immediately after
being written it might take a few
milliseconds before it's actually
available for being read but with a with
a messaging service such as this one
that isn't really important it's it's in
it's okay if a message arrives few
seconds after i sent it finally what
about this big elephant I've been
hearing so much about Hadoop Hadoop
really is it's it's lumped in with the
no sequel databases but I wouldn't
really call it a database but it's
clearly one of the biggest products and
that's sort of come out of this space so
what it is is a data processing
framework so Hadoop really integrates
with lots of different databases it even
has integration with with Oracle so what
it does is that sucks in that data into
Hadoop and process it most often using
MapReduce which is also again made
popular by by Google and sure how do
pass is really Hadoop is a large
ecosystem of things where the data
processing framework is main thing but
at the base of it it's a distributed
file system and it also contains things
such as HBase which is an actual
database but really the main thing where
Hadoop is is really winning and beating
everyone else is it's by on big data
processing and processing is very
different from querying careering is
what you do or can do on live data so as
a user search them
website they do a query and get the data
for that user and serve it up within
milliseconds processing might take
minutes or hours it's not something I do
live something I do in a data warehouse
and that's where we really really shines
and it's a space where we're our
products for example doesn't at all we
haven't focused on data whereas
processing at all yet we probably will
in the future but we currently Hadoop is
the big winner there okay so what do I
talk about actually I talked about
modeling I might have hidden it but the
important part of choosing a database
and regardless of which one you choose
is that it's all about modeling and
modeling is the active simplifying the
world enough to be able to reason about
it and to be able to store it and
process it and the important part about
modeling is to think about what it is
you model so this might be a good model
it might not be a good model depending
on what it is about the real world that
we want to be able to store process and
reason about so when picking a database
it's important that you pick a database
that is good for the kind of model that
you want to the kind of world that you
want to model and it also matches the
application model so that the model you
have in your application matches the the
model of the store in your database and
it's quite possible that you have a a
model that doesn't fit one particular
database where you can fit but where
parts of it fits one native 81 type of
database and other parts with another
type of database and in such cases I
really do recommend just
use both why not so again we have gone
through key value databases such as
Amazon simple DB Oracle no sequel
memcached Redis and these are really
shine where when the data you store is
opaque such as big blob of data like an
image don't really care about what's in
it you care about it being there they
scale really well add more servers you
handle more load document databases know
slightly more about your data so you can
run more kinds of semantic queries on
your data you can query for collections
of similar entities and not just get a
data entity by key examples include
Mongo react couch cetera data is still
structured as single atomically
contained values but they are have more
structure and you can nest them then we
have the column family databases where
the predominant example was Sandra and
like the key value databases they scale
really well they actually scale about
the same as as a key value database but
gives you some of the structure not
really all of the querying capabilities
of a document database but some of the
structure but at the cost of you having
to well you lose some of those queries
and you also have to do some de
normalisation of your data and also as I
said graph databases who's really shines
when
what you focus on is how data is
connected and doing deep traversals from
from one point and into your data such
as recommendation algorithms social
social networks friend of a friend who
oh that's really a recommendation
algorithm as well threat analysis and
such things complex domains worthy
relationships are the important aspects
but of course relational databases are
still valid for many use cases they
still one good reasons is because
they've been the predominant database
since the 80s and tooling and ad-hoc
wearying and reporting still better in
oracle my cycle and such databases than
in any other kind of database and of
course if you have a system that works
and works really well you shouldn't
change it and sometimes data really is
uniform and well structured you really
do have a payroll system so that's a an
obvious use case where you would want to
use a relational database just please
stop stop using object relational
mapping is there are monster they should
never been invented relational databases
are really bad is throwing objects
unless those objects are lots of objects
that don't relate to one another that
are all the same that's what relational
database is a good for but if we look
back at these these non-relational
databases we can see that they fall into
two main categories one being a great
oriented and these are the kinds of like
MongoDB the documents in
p value databases and even the the
column databases in that they focus on
I've your get optics do you have the you
can have things nest within one another
but it's all based of one single roots
and it's all contained in a single data
entity and on the other hand we have the
graph databases where where it's not
aggregate oriented it's really more
relational than relational databases you
have entities that relate to one another
in an arbitrary way this isn't something
that I've imagined or dreamt up with or
decided to feed you guys with it's
something that the great observer Martin
Fowler sort of said hmm this looks like
this is what's going on we have IV is
oriented which fall into three different
categories and we hi graph and he talks
about this in his I don't know if this
book is out yet I don't know if what
I've read is a preview or a final
release but his book no sequel distilled
he's co-author on that one also on his
blog he writes about this and that's
about it for me if you're more
interested in graph databases there was
a talk tomorrow at about this time of
day so 1230 in what's this room I think
by my good friend and my CEO knee ml a
friend and he's also javaone rockstar so
it's probably a good talk that's
particular about neo4j for the
enterprise and beyond and if you're even
more interest than that there's a we're
organizing a conference call graph
connect here in San Francisco about a
month from now talk to me if you want
discount codes questions yes
dr. quality databases in our graph
databases and evolution of object
oriented databases no I think there I
wouldn't say that it's the other way
around either because crafted up is a
really an evolution of network the
network model and that existed way
before object-oriented programming but
there they are similar for sure but an
object oriented database is more tied to
a specific object model quite often tied
to specific object oriented line
language whereas a graph database is
just about the data entities and how
they interrelate so nothing so while an
object database has obvious in classes
and hierarchies graph database doesn't
have those things yes what Facebook uses
they built their own thing because they
were quite early they existed before the
no sequel movement they believed they
initiated the Cassandra project but then
they open source instructed over the
fence when they didn't want to use it
anymore so Cassandra started at Facebook
but they're not using that at some point
they were using my sequel database is
charted in weird ways I don't know if
that's the case anymore but all these
big social networks have pretty much
within their own systems more or less so
Facebook Twitter a linkedin have their
own systems linkedin systems have gone
through various interesting faces in
their evolution
yes is the basic concept
no nothing not necessarily at all many
of these databases try to keep as much
as possible in memory and that is
another reason for for why you would
want to char the database and put it
onto multiple machines is that you can
use the memory ram of each machine for
restoring your data in memory but the
that is not necessary not necessarily
the main reason behind manage databases
so Cassandra runs in a JVM near for jay
johnson runs in a JVM Hadoop and all
those all the parts of the Hadoop
ecosystem runs in a JVM monga believe is
written in C or C++ couch was written in
Erlang hence the guys in the mustache
what else runs in the JVM there are a
few of them written in jigga I mean Java
is Java is a really mature platform we
can build databases in Java now that's
that's a pretty good testament of how
far java's come but really that's all
that's just an implementation detail
even if these databases are implemented
and run energy via implement job and
running a JVM doesn't mean that you need
to run Java in order to use them even
though I guess mostly you guys here
would since you're at this conference
no one else is yeah how does that work
out as these data visit the concern
what kind of interface do they offer to
connect to them
so that is still a quite a diverged
space with a sequel databases so
obviously you don't connect through a
through sequel connection to and you
don't talk sequel to them most of the
document databases you submit either
submit JavaScript queries the drone in
an isolated JavaScript interpreter in
the database or they have an HTTP
interface where you can can do simple
crowd operations using they call it
restful interfaces but it's really just
an HTTP interface it's close to rest but
not quite yes
the question that had
I do so the question was there are
actual examples on the near-field a
website on use on building access
control lists in graph database and he
wondered if there are actual companies
to do that in production and the company
where near 4j was started did exactly
that so that model is taken from from
that companies that was company that
sadly failed two times and went back
bankrupt two times before he realized
hey the key asset here is the database
let's problem from that but we were
before picasa existed we were the
biggest picture warehouse online picture
warehouse
in such a database um I don't have those
numbers yeah yeah yep and the I know
that the database was of such a size
that at least the ACLS were consistently
kept in hot cash and so they were all
always kept cashed in ram but with our
standard caching policy the the rest of
the data was bigger than what you can
fit in ram but i don't know the exact
sizes sadly this was a 16 gig spark
machine I think we ran that on
the ACL kind of thing so the company is
called neo technology and we do not and
the products called me for Jay and we do
not offer a particular add-on module for
for acls it's an interesting idea that
i'll bring it up with them you had a
question critical documents results for
example that each of those fit nicely
into a different types of sequel
databases my question is a dip solution
specifically that would I yes so I know
that there are people who successfully
Mary databases from differ of different
varieties I mentioned these ones by name
well you say it's a large company that
does media or media production systems
and web browser plug-ins who have a
creative collaboration platform like
successfully I stores there the data
about the pictures in a graph and the
social data between the users and all
that information in the craft database
near for Jay and then store the actual
content in a key value store so so the
data content isn't a key value store
because is large data objects and they
also store revisions there and the the
metadata so the data about the data and
stored in the graph and I think that's a
pretty pretty good example of what
you can do I've also seen successful
combinations of relational databases and
an graphs so most of the things I've
seen are obviously involving graphs
since that's where I work but so so yeah
it it I've seen successful combinations
I haven't seen any platforms or
frameworks that do it for you yet though
but I believe I mean given given the way
things usually evolve I believe we'll
see that within a few years I don't know
it's next I think it might be you that
yeah exactly think they do yeah at the
moment it means that it doesn't scale
rights horizontally yes maybe Jay scales
reads horizontally by replication but
but not rights we're working on solving
that it is an np-complete problem but if
markets work i read recently that if
market works p if markets are efficient
then p is equal to NP so we'll just see
about that yes
right so is there a single database that
has sort of all the attributes of these
databases yeah I I know of one database
that claims claims that it does it's a
very very loud mouthed Italian guy who
works solo on this database called Orion
TB is mainly competing with graph
databases but he has document like and
key value like and relate and sequel
interfaces for its database as well
orient DB yeah yeah Oh are I e.n.t yeah
but beware that it is a single guy
working on it it's a cool project but it
is a single guy
mmm there have been talks about that
mainly there's been talk like among the
document databases to standardize
something for documents and among the
column databases to standardise the
query interface for column databases as
I'm going to graph databases of
standardized there I don't think there
will be a standardization across all
databases maybe there'll be something
unlike a connection pool level level
where you will have a something more
generic than the sequel connections that
you get with relational databases today
or what you get is a connection you can
send queries in in the query language
for that particular database or database
category to it's kind of like you have
you when you send sequel queries you
have slightly for varying dialects today
but they share a common interface I
believe we will get to something that is
a bit more generic than that kind of
connection interface where you send
queries in quite different query
languages over the same kind of
connection then we will get abstractions
on top of that to diverge again so again
kind of this kind of API for it you've
been holding your hand up for a while
general queries
three relationships to those final
hmm so so the key that I'm going to hook
onto there is when you said all all
persons that have this capability so
those are not the sweet spot the sweet
spot is starting from somewhere in and
traversing from there those kind of scan
type rupture operations are less
efficient how much different is it I
mean it's there's no reason why it
wouldn't be as efficient as with a
relational database possibly better but
at the moment that is not the case I
don't have exact numbers sorry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
