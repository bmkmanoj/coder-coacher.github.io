installing the Oracle node sequel
database on the Oracle bare-metal cloud
it assumes you already have Oracle
bare-metal cloud account and that you
have access to either the Oracle no
sequel database Community Edition or
Enterprise Edition software the first
step in the process is to clone the
github project that contains QuickStart
white paper and scripts for installing
Oracle known sequel database this is a
byl bring your own license project
meaning you can either install Oracle
known sequel database Community Edition
or Enterprise Edition depending on which
version you have access to once you have
the github project cloned go ahead and
open the white paper and follow the
step-by-step instructions the white
paper will walk you through the process
of setting up the bare-metal cloud
environment including a virtual cloud
network and bare metal compute instances
the end result of this process will be a
three node Oracle no sequel database and
an application server front-end we used
insight of shapes for the database each
having 28 terabytes and local NBA mean
storage in a standard shake for the app
server the first step
to create a VNC virtual cloud Network
which we'll call Oracle no sequel vcn to
do this we go to the bare metal cloud
services interface and click on the
networking tab then click on the create
virtual cloud Network button enter the
name from the Quick Start Guide then
click the Create virtual cloud Network +
related resources button this will
create all the resources necessary for
the network including gateway router
table and three subnets one for each
availability domain click create virtual
cloud network to continue now click on
the VPN resource you just created click
security list click default security
list
a rule that allows traffic on TCP ports
5,000 through 5050 now we want to create
the required BNC compute instances click
on the compute instances menu item and
then click Launch instance button fill
in the information from the Quick Start
Guide for the Oracle no sequel database
node 1 now click Launch instance repeat
these steps for database and it's 2 and
3 and then create the application server
using a standard shape
once you have the four compute instances
running click on the link for each
instance to get the public IP addresses
we will need these to run install
scripts CD to the script directory of
your clone github project and run the
cluster install script the three
database IPS from the database compute
instances before running the scripts be
sure to copy the Oracle node sequel
database software and Oracle JDK to the
scripts directory as specified in the
QuickStart guide once the cluster
install script completes the database is
up and running now we can install the
application server using the IP of the
app server compute instance and a3
database IP once the application server
is installed we can login to verify we
have an operational system
you
and that's all there is to it the system
we set out to create is not fully
operational thanks for watching this
video for more information about the
Oracle med sequel database check out the
links in know QuickStart guide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
