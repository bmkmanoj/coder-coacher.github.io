today the topic is lessons learned use
of modern JVM languages besides Java and
before I begin with the session I want
to introduce myself shortly my name is
Kai vaina I work for my one wolf at all
that's a consulting and software
development company in Germany Munich
and I do a lot of consulting and
development especially in debt chava
environment besides I write some
articles for professional journals and
do some talks at conferences such as
Java one okay if you have any feedback
about this session you can contact me
via email or Twitter or social networks
I appreciate every feedback also a
negative one if you don't like anything
so please give me feedback after the
session I'm a this session I'm not an
expert in any of these languages I
didn't create these languages or so so
this is really a report from the users
perspective about using these languages
and I hope you learn a lot from this
session today okay now let's start the
first important thing here is I what I'm
talking about here so you see the Java
platform and what I'm talking about is
about using different languages at this
Java platform so the Scala there's
groovy and many others and all of these
are used on the Java platform but at
different languages this is important
difference between the platform and the
language of chava so and if you look at
it or net platform which is an
competitor to java platform dad's
comment to use several different
languages use C and C sharp and C++ and
now you can also use F sharp escala and
other languages and these developers are
used to that but if you look on the
chava platform usually that is what you
do you use the Java language here so
there's a little problem if to java
language sometimes so for example it's
not a real object oriented programming
language you all know
about primitives for example which are
no real objects it's a static typed
language so this is awesome in most use
cases but sometimes it's better to use a
dynamic language then the syntax of the
Java language is really where pose it's
not really suitable for creating
domain-specific languages and it's
parallel programming model is not really
easy to use for many use cases though in
the end it's not all rainbows and
unicorns in the land of Java and though
that's a great thing about a Java
platform as you can see here on the
bottom you have to travel to the Machine
and with the Java Virtual Machine you
can use the bytecode from several
different languages which can be used on
native machine code and you can use it
like on linux and windows and so on and
for a traveler machine it doesn't matter
which language creates this bytecode so
for example you can use java bytecode is
probably most of you too and you can
also compile a scallop ID code and use
it on a GBM or you can use groovy
bytecode though these are all ahead of a
head of time compiled but there are also
other options for example you can use
scripting and then this code is
interpreted or just in time compiled for
example the groovy script code and
besides these examples are many many
other languages for the Java platform
you can see here the most well-known a
java language or languages for a chava
platform there are about 250 more of
course some are only attack Chanel or so
but you can take a look at this link
it's really interesting how many
languages they exist for this platform
and so this today is a little story
about escape from the Java language
prison and why we sometimes use them as
our languages besides to chava language
so what's the key message of this talk
today there are three commercial
messages the first one is Java is still
the most important programming platform
and the second is Java is not a new
cobol which i have read sometimes in
and the second one the most important
one probably for you is modern gvm
languages besides Chava not instead of
Chava create added value and though if
you look at the agenda for this talk
today it's separated into two parts the
first part is about a business value of
these new languages when should we maybe
use some of these languages instead of
the Java language and the second part is
then about lessons learned because of
course it's not always good to use these
languages you shouldn't use them always
and a lot of problems sometimes when you
use them I will talk about this in a
second part of the talk okay so let's
begin with the first part created edit
value' when maybe you should use some of
these new GV m languages instead of Java
and first we start with the reduced
efforts and this is probably the
examples you have often seen probably
all of you know you don't have to write
constructors and getters and setters
with the new languages and so I use
another example here for example if you
have to create a comparator as you know
in Java you have to implement a compare
method and write a lot of polar play
code to do a comparison and here's just
a simple example of scala how you can do
it and though there are many cases when
you can really reduce the lines of code
a lot and important thing it has to be
readable also so you can also sometimes
write code which you cannot read after
more and cannot understand it so you
have really to choose when you have to
use the reduced lines of code but here's
a good example that's really readable
and it use some syntactic sugar of
scholar for example this underscores
here and the other thing you used are
the closures which are probably also in
Java 8 available and a combination of
all of these features of the new
languages and also the syntactic sugar
which is often not a possible in Java
because Java is to be backwards
compatible and so it's only available in
new more
languages and this is the result as you
can see here so often you can reduce the
lines of code a lot an example where we
really often use some of these new
languages is when we have to do
processing of XML because that's really
horrible if you have to use it in Java
and there are better alternatives for
example Muse just a little example muf
books several books the N side and if
you have to get a title of the second
book if you do it with any Java API you
have to write a lot of code a lot of
boilerplate code just for reading this
line and I fear one example how you can
do it with groovy so it's always just
one or two lines to read something like
this from XML processing and so really
it's a very good example when you want
to reduce the lines of code for XML
processing so we have applications where
we use the modern languages only for its
a med processing you don't have to use
these languages for all of your classes
and duvall application you can only use
it for some part of your application and
for example XML processing is really a
good choice so what's the second
business value you can add of new modern
gvm languages increased flexibility and
I've some examples here too the first
one is modular ization I don't mean
chicks or something like this year but
for example I feel an example of Scylla
but it's also for many of the other of
these modern languages you can structure
your code much more flexible so for
example here you can put several classes
into one file there are also several
packages and you can structure it as you
want we have used this feature this
flexible flexibility a lot for example
when we are working with new API is when
you want to learn new api's then it's
really much easier to drive all in one
class just for testing and writing a
unit test or so and then if you really
go to production code you can of course
still structured su to it with Java and
you own classes and so on but with this
you are really much more flexible and
another example for increased
flexibility
scripting so what you can do for example
if groovy or pipe now so you can change
the behavior of an application
dynamically at runtime so you don't have
to compile it before ahead and you can
either do it and we had I ready
execution of these scripts or you can do
it via the chase are 233 scripting for
the Java platform and integrate it into
your Chava code so again here is the
example and you don't always have to use
the code for all of your applications so
you can use for example groovy or Python
only way you really need it and you
don't have to write your role
application in pipe not groovy because
of this and in some use cases it's much
easier to use some of these dynamic
features instead of am writing with Java
and a lot of boilerplate code and this
is also an example of these dynamic
features for increased flexibility is
meta programming so I want to explain it
to you on one example I've often used
just simple code examples because it's
easier to understand then when I tell
you a lot of theory about it so here's
one example where if java code and this
is a class ABC and if a static factory
class for it which returns a new
instance of the object and then I can
use this object in a main method so if
you have to do this for several
different classes it's a lot of
boilerplate code again and now i want to
show you an example of groovy how you
can use meta programming and its dynamic
features to add some code to already
compiled bytecode afterwards so here's a
little bit of proving metric it's just
one or two lines of code and use the
feature of a delegate in groovy you
don't have to understand now how it
works really but I will show you the
result here with just two lines of code
you can use the dynamic features to add
this factory method which I implemented
in the travel code before endure in one
class to add it to every class you want
so in this example you still delicate
for the object and because every class
he has a
classic object every class uses this
feature now so as you can see it is a
java classes and not groovy classes and
the the tulip bytecode has added this
feature of the factory method so you can
really try it out in a script in one or
two minutes if you want and it works if
you add this line and then you can use
these factory methods no matter how many
parameters and though here you can see a
really powerful feature of this meta
programming by changing the byte code at
runtime and here I have a real world
example of where it makes sense it
doesn't make sense everywhere because um
it can also make your code much more
complex but here's a very good example
what does make a lot of sense and this
example is the fine line Grails Grails
that is a web framework for groovy and
in groovy when you have a database with
several attributes with sexual
attributes and for example ID and name
and description and so on what grace
does for you in your IDE it creates all
of these finder meta find the methods
for you dynamically so if you have a
table for example with an IT in a name
all of these alternatives for finding
data is created and generated for you at
runtime by the IDE you don't have to
write it by yourself you can just call
it and if you add another attribute for
example description then this will also
be added here dynamically at runtime and
all this is a really powerful feature
and you can see here matter it makes a
lot of sense because it helps you a lot
so groovy for example was a dynamic
language a dynamically typed language
here's a la another example of Scala
muscala I'm uses a replacement because
it's a statically typed language but it
offers implicit conversions so there's
also i show you this because there are
also powerful features in statically
typed languages and here you can see if
you would use it in java if you have a
10 an integer and want to subtract a
stream this is not possible and it
throws an exception in java and also
but you can use implicit so implicit
conversions we have to define it once in
your code and hear you say definite
define a method where you do dancing
with your spring and here you use the
string to int message and after you have
added this line of code and here you can
execute your code again and try 10 minus
spring 3 and it works so this is again
really powerful and so you should really
use it wisely I come to the lessons
learned later but yeah I want to mention
it use it wisely sometimes it makes
sense to use these powerful features as
you have seen for example if the grace
finder but often um it can get into
problems with other developers because
they don't know what's happening here
okay and another future of increased
flexibility how do you get more business
value it's the pit management because on
the channel platform usually you use and
which is a really powerful build system
which is developed in XML and use maven
on the other side which is convention
over configuration so Derek went can
figure a lot by yourself so I'm just a
powerful one and maven is the easy one
to use they have posts both their pros
and both their cons and what's really
cool from bill to which is greater Grail
is a build system for the which is
feeling groovy and use it groovy and the
great thing here is it uses the power of
armed and it uses the ease of use of
mail and that's combined in Braden so
you can still use all of your aunt asks
and you can still use your memory posit
aureus so if you do not have to rewrite
all of your code you can use your own
code for your build system and write new
stuff 5th grader and besides of this
combination with further advantages
because um you do not have to code in
XML but you write it in truly so um it's
really easy to start with Gradle you
should really take a look at it we use
right leg almost all new projects
because I'm
don't see any disadvantages it's an
amine time already released as wonder Oh
release so it's a stable release you can
get commercial support and it's really
easy to get started with it so we
recommended for most applications in the
future okay that was the second business
value the third one is ready to reduce
complexity how can we reduce the
complexity when using new languages and
one of the good example she is
concurrency because the current
situation as you probably know um the
key karet gearheads race is over and
multi-core CPUs are coming and of course
you need a new development models for
this to solve your problems because when
Charlie was created some time ago 15
years or so this was not a problem so
there were no api so concepts for it and
a problem with this is the you have
shared state you have different
processes and then you have your ship
date and have to solve these problems
and if you do it with this red API you
have problems like dead logs and race
conditions and other right exceptions
probably all of you have deemed is a lot
and it's really complex of salted
problems also chava five six seven and
eight added new API is to make it easier
so in the meantime you don't have to use
wait and notify or so to work with
threads but still it's really really
complex and so what's the solution this
can be a solution you buy a lot of these
books there's a very very good books for
example a left on java concurrence in
practice by brian guards it explains all
your problems about threads and it's I
mean it seriously it's a really awesome
book but it's also too complex I am it's
still too complex to realize problems of
sweats with this book and where I've
told best a lot of time to solve your
problems and now if you look at the
modern gdm languages there are for some
use cases better alternatives and that
these are the two alternatives you can
use software transactional memory and
you
use actors I will show an example for
both now to explain what's the
difference between the thread API
refugees until now and the first one is
software transsexual memory which is for
example implicitly supported enclosure
so you don't have to call any additional
API so at them losha is build within
software transactional memory and what
does it mean it's an alternative to log
based synchronization so internally
closure also does use these logs and so
on of the threat API but you don't have
to care about it and this is a very
simple example um you create you to
account bank accounts and define a
method for transferring money and then
you run your code here so you don't
write anything about em transaction or
so but closure issuers that only all of
this is done so if you withdraw money
from home account you have to deposit it
on another account and either both of
these are working on none of the sub
working but you don't have to care about
this transaction this is implicitly
supported by the closure language so
when to use some software transsexual
memory especially you especially if you
have many reads and only a few rights
because otherwise I'm when their
transactions and it precious then it has
to redo it and of course if you have a
lot of rights um the performance is not
really good so if you have a lot of
reeds and only a lesser price then you
can use software hands actually memory
quite example with closure and the other
example were directors actors isolate
immutability this means in the middle
you have your actor and here you have
your state you can still change your
state here and
your behavior but you communicate only
we are messages as you for example know
it from JMS you have incoming messages
and outgoing messages these messages are
immutable you can change the many ways
edit content to it and then here you
have your mailbox and you get incoming
messages and they are processed one
after the other so here again you don't
have to care about under logs and so on
and so it's a much easier in several use
cases and for but you have to be able to
split your problem into several
different parts if this is a possible
then actors are much better solution
than using this red API so for example
we use actors in telecommunication
systems where we have millions of
messages and that's exactly the model
here and in many use cases you can use
it and then you don't have to care about
the thread API and can use these actors
instead and these actors are also again
integrated into many modern new
languages for example here's scholar as
you can see you define an actor and
depending on a message with it arrives
it does something here and then you can
send messages as I previously to this
actor this is just a little example here
um but you can see and you don't use
this red API locks or synchronization or
touch stuff and though you lower the
thread to deadlox and race conditions
you still need some of these best
practices and you can also have dead
looks but it's a much less than with
thread API and here's another example in
troubie I'm here's an example of the
cheap-ass Ruby parallel systems you can
see there they gave the actors an office
aide so here you can still write em
simple methods and just use an
annotation to say hey this method should
be created as an actor so the cheapest
library does it implicitly you don't
have to create these actors this is
probably a bit easier to learn at the
beginning
so another example for reduced
complexity is the main specific
languages domain-specific languages are
used though that people can understand
and recently also if they are no
programming experts at least in theory
and practice probably only real
developers use it but also for them it's
easier to use them instead of other code
with it which is not domain-specific
language and we have used these days
else especially in test frameworks um
there are many kept formats available
and i will show you one example here
again just that you can see the
difference um and here's Scala test it's
a test framework for scholar and if you
look at the code I'm use first a simple
example of Java so if you wanna sub
fleet and look at the map and if it
contains a key and for example here in
Scala and it's more like a real language
so it is much easier to read and to
understand and to write this is only a
simple example especially auto test
frameworks and there are complex
examples and what really makes sense and
helps you a lot to reach the complexity
of your code and you can create such a
code with Java you can create own it
only with modern languages such as gala
and others here's a more powerful
example I really like that one you can
look at the block later if you want it's
the basic dsl and it simulates basic in
Scala so as you can see here this is
skyler code but what you really write in
this dsl is basic right this old ugly
language basic and you can see how
powerful these T cells are and what you
can trade with it so if you have any
business problem which have specific
names and so on you can create a
domain-specific language for it and then
it's much easier and reduces the
complexity of your code a lot you have
to create you TSL just once and then you
can use it developers can use it so the
fourth example for the
value added through new languages
reduced heterogeneity so this is how it
usually works in our approach X um we
have source code for example inshallah
we have in style scripts which are used
to a shell or anything else um use
dynamic database scripts via trade Ruby
or any other language and anja filled
with anime UNIX ml and so you have many
different languages which you have to
learn and what we try to do it's not
always working of course but what we try
to do we use em as few languages as
possible so you can do all of this work
sampling roomie we like to use Ruby for
period for example and then we also use
it for instyle scripts because movies
can also be used for scripting and why
not use Ruby 40 scripts to so then you
have all of your code in one language
it's much much easier to maintain it if
it's all the same language and if you
write some source code for your business
logic and then you look at your build
and you have to change something it's
much easier for every of your developers
um if it's the same language and the
fifth business value is innovation what
do I mean with this so of course when
you start with new languages you have to
learn them at the beginning and then you
have to learn new technologies new
concepts new solutions and one great
thing is of course you can do marketing
you can write articles and blogs and go
to conferences with it and in the end
you often also get new projects and you
can consult other companies you can do
coaching and development and besides
this for innovation you can also use
these concepts and so on in your own
language right so for example I have
never used stuff like immutability in
Java code before i started with stalin
and so on and there i think about a
right that use immutability and it makes
sense in many use cases so why don't
shouldn't I use it in my java code to
where it makes sense though this is
another huge benefit
my opinion and another opinion of course
innovation of using new languages all of
you now evolved talents or any you tell
developers and what year young
developers especially in Germany
probably Simoneaux Simoneaux United
States follow the leader so this should
mean a cool this enterprise users
proving Scala I don't have to use Java
the cyclic code it's boring and so on
and if you say in your recruiting to the
people hey when you style and grooving
on your projects then and they will
really like it usually though this is
another thing not you should not
underestimate this power of amusing new
languages ok so a conclusion about
business value um I think the new
languages can create a lot of new
business value to your projects you can
reduce efforts as we have seen reduced
complexity you can get better
flexibility and reduce the heterogeneity
but also important here again use it
grad make sense as I've shown you some
examples um there you can really add
value with it so in the end it's in my
opinion on your opinion of our community
to success to use these languages and
now we come to the but part of course we
have several lessons learned here when
we use these languages and that's what I
want to talk next so first of our
language selection as I've shown you
your 250 ranked languages for the chava
platform probably only 10 or 12 or so
should really be used but the question
is which one to use first again are
short exposures I've talked about these
concepts before steady kelly type
language versus dynamically typed
language my opinion is statically typed
language and has less power because you
don't have stuff like meter programming
and scripting and it's not that easy to
use this power and but there for the
dynamically typed languages are more
complex because you can easily write
code which no one understands if you
have seen the examples of demeter
programming
right some meter programming another
developer doesn't know what happens here
and if you're if a static language like
Scala are chava you get errors in your
IDE you doesn't don't get any IDE with
dynamically typed language there
everything is runtime exception usually
and the second important difference is
programming concepts so Chavez
object-oriented note hundred percent
because of print primitives and so on
but usually its object oriented and a
new modern gvm languages you also have
to use functional programming often a
huge difference for example is you have
to you you have diff your side effects
so you use Amitabh ility and such stuff
you will use recursion and so on and of
course depends on how all you are
because I'm if you have studied 20 years
ago you probably have learned all of
these concepts I have studied about five
years ago and I have not really learned
about these concepts here like recursion
and so on and so it's really tough for
me to use this functional context now
but with languages like closure these
are fully functional and also other
languages like Scala they use
object-oriented concepts by also
functional concepts and the great thing
here is because I'm this deferred side
effect and so on is much better for
scalability and multi-core CPUs and so
on so probably we will see much more of
these concepts and a future in using
languages ok so the question now is
which languages shall we use and this
here again is the experience of our
company and what we used for our clients
and what we will use in the future so in
our opinion if you use another language
p side scallop besides chava it has to
be Chava friendly because all or most of
our developers are Chava developers and
so I should easily learn a new language
and it must be feature-rich because if
the new language doesn't create any
added value we don't have to use it but
doesn't
any sense so these are the two
requirements um which we had to choose
our languages besides Java and as you
can see again there are several
languages so which to use and one
important thing here is the maturity of
the languages so we only use like of
course I use some languages for fun
sometimes to check out new concept or so
but we're really talking about languages
in production which we use in our
project in production and if we go to
production we can't use languages like
cotton linen or phantom or salon because
they are not ready yet they cannot or
should not be used in my opinion in
projects which go to production in the
next six month so these can be excluded
easily no matter which edit value' so as
I add because they are not ready for
production now at the moment and the
next thing is prevalent so how many
people who use this language is that
community can you discuss with other
people are that blogs are there books
can you go to conferences and talk about
these languages a lot with other people
who have experiences about that and if
you look again at the remaining
languages and we in our company don't
use closure or air young which is based
on Ella because it may be great
languages and it also have great
concepts for some problems but I'm
almost no one uses it so in our company
doesn't make any sense and so they are
only are still some left and now the
next important thing is platform
integration so again we are all chama
developers we want to combine these
languages with Java and first if you
look at the syntax alignment though
here's a little example with Java code
and then we see Ruby code which is
probably easy to use we see Scala code
which is a little bit another code but
it's also okay and then if you see for
example Ruby it's a more different and
pues I look different than Rubio Chava
and of course if you use closure then
it's a really another kind of language
so probably uie needs apprentices
generator to use some closure but as you
can see it's really another syntax
inshallah so this one our opinion read
so um the syntax alignment is bad so
it's not good for to learn for java
developers and now we will see the two
of our favorites which we use in our
company the first one is groovy and now
let's talk about seamless integration
here you see the example as I mentioned
at the beginning yes you don't have to
write your constructor and you don't
have to write getters and setters so
it's easy to learn but what's even more
impressive in my opinion is this though
this is also a groovy code right and as
you can see there's no difference from
the Chava code to the guru code so if
you begin as java developer and start
programming groovy you can still write
Java code and that really works for
about ninety five percent of your groovy
code and so it's really easy to learn as
java developer to write groovy and this
is one of the most benefits yes you can
use all of these pictures later you
don't have to write semicolons and
constructors and so on but you can start
with Java code and right crew a code and
that's really awesome for seamless
integration so groovy definitely screen
seamless integration with Travis perfect
and the second language we use a scholar
and Scala is not that seamless
integration because it has some features
which create bytecode which does not fit
perfectly to java bytecode and like
inexpressible language pizzas features
and if you want to channel my code
analysis with any tools it's much more
difficult and not supported by many
tools but um there's also work around
here in most cases it works and if it
does not work then you can just create a
challenge at first if you want to
integrate Java code with scallop board
so it's not as seamless as Ruby but it's
also okay
so you can combine it and it works in
most use cases so as you can see here
these are the two languages which we use
in our project beside java and why again
here because the languages have to be
challenged lee yeah this is China
friendly and this is also cha friendly
not as good as crew me but is ok and
this feature rich and here's also am the
reason why we you've both of these and
not at this one and another one with
grooving you have to dynamic one so we
can use major programming and scripting
and tech stuff and we've Scala we have
two functional one so here you can use
stuff for example actors and so on and
without side effects and so on so this
is a perfect match in our opinion to use
exactly piece too besides gava preset
visit java because with java and these
languages we can use all concepts we
need in our projects and what you also
can see here java is still the most
important language for so also in the
future we still use ninety percent java
and only when really 8x benefit there we
use groovy escala but in most use cases
are in most parts of our projects we use
java you can use groovy escala for some
code of your project you don't have to
switch all of your code to Skylar or
groovy so for example a groovy for it to
melt processing or so so this is really
the best combination and this will be
our solution for the next probably five
years or so okay so this was the
explanation which languages we use now
company for customers and of course
there's ever public problems too the
first one is a political one so every
customer asks why use new languages java
does the trouble right so that's
definitely true so um so you have to
explain why you add these languages why
they add value and as I have shown you
in several examples before how you can
add business value and if you are
germane with this style it usually works
because in the end they customize to pay
you hours and
and though it works fine line tool and
another problem it's also political is
cloud computing is requested by the
customer because it's a real hype and no
sequel is requested by the customer
because it's often necessary because you
need it for big data and high
scalability but modern GM languages and
I've never seen a customer who requires
it usually you have to make the step and
say hey we want to use it because we can
add value in any form and besides these
political problems there are also real
life problems for the developer and
these are the main problems which we had
in our projects yeah there are really
new concepts for java developers as I've
mentioned meter programming actors
electability and so on so you definitely
have to read some books and learn about
what you're doing before you do it and
also because these languages are really
powerful and sometimes they're not that
easy to use and you can do a lot wrong
if you just use this to all the powerful
language without any sense so probably
am if you introduce proved into your
project every developer things I a cool
features I want to use them i want to
use meta programming and so on and if
you every part of your developers use as
meta programming then then maintaining
your project will be our own so you can
get a lot of confusion to the media
programming and really use it wisely the
next program i've already mentioned it
by code is not the same as byte code and
you also will get a problem for example
debugging because it's not that good
supported by truvia scala as it is with
java and your if definitely took a look
at take a look at a total cost of
ownership so you need skills you need
training unit and refactoring and
maintenance so i'm at the beginning it
can be a huge interest in investor and
use other languages besides java apart
there's another thing um and so this is
also really
key message don't let yourself be fooled
because usually no customer cries if you
use a check speak compiler or if you use
a bit compiler for your web framework or
if you use a whistle compiler for your
soap web services right so you have to
learn this stuff also if you use new
concepts you have to land them and using
a new language is also adding just one
or two libraries to your project and
that's it and believe me learning dhruvi
is easier than learning crystallog wit
so this can't be a problem in my opinion
and here's one last example about a pipe
code so as you have seen before and
charm andrew is good Java and Scala is
okay and if you use non Chavan on Java
it becomes much more difficult so yes
just one example for this um it's a
really great block and you should really
read this blog post if you are
interested I'm here someone tried to
combine Scala with Ruby and you get much
more problems with this because all
create different pipe code and for
example Scala uses the + operator as
method and the pipe code which is
generated is this one it's a dollar sign
with plus but the dollar sign is an
illegal character in Ruby so you have to
find a workaround to call it in Ruby and
so you see it's not that easy to use all
of these tvm languages one with each
other sometimes we have to use
workarounds but these workarounds are
also available if you google for them
though it's no showstopper usually and
the last problem of course um the Ides
are not as good as they are Java no
matter if you use eclipse or netbeans I
IntelliJ support becomes better and
better for the new languages and many
changes ahead but they support for Java
is much better definitely so be aware of
this and also you have to evaluate which
ID is good for you language which you
use for most modern new languages and we
use IntelliJ because it has the best to
part in my opinion but why cut samples
in some types i've started and creating
the scala plugin for Eclipse this will
also become better and better so I'm you
have to ever late
even waited all the time okay this was
the problems which we had been using
these languages and the last thing is
how to get started so um not everybody
which I talking to is aware it that you
can make something out of nothing you
have to do some initial work you have to
have to learn these new languages right
invest some time by yourself a book and
start with it and when you start with it
that's the next important lesson learned
from ourselves um by the right book
don't buy a book which is thousand pages
and explains every feature of scallop
ruvi buy a book which is from the view
of a java developer for example here
making chava groovy or functional
programming with scala these books start
from the view of a Java developer and
explain you the features of for example
crew via scala from the perspective of a
java developer so you can easily learn a
new features and i also explain you why
and when you should use these features
so several examples of my talk today
were from these books and then you of
course have to use these new languages
look back at you finished projects and
look at the benefits which I told you at
the beginning of this session maybe
thing about invention you use another
language and thinking about it before
starting the new projects not in the
middle of projects that also happened at
our customer and use it for marketing
channels write an article play around
with it and go to a conference use it
for testing and then first start some
internal projects our first project was
Carl and prove your internal projects
because they are not that important and
so you can not do that much wrong as
with your customer and then when you are
ready then you can start it with your
projects and so I'm conclusion lessons
alone it's really a fun house it's a lot
of fun but you can also have some
problems with it which you have to solve
and so finally I hope you did get the
key messages let me cap that again in
our opinion chava is still a most
important programming platform and it's
not a new couple also the java languages
get new features all the time but a
modern gvm language
besides chava not instead of chawla
create added value and choose wisely
when to use which of them and be aware
that you don't have to use a new
language for all of your project but you
can use it just for some parts of your
project tool for example it's an L
processing is the best example for using
another language so I hope you can make
a cross on yes you get the key messages
and so finally let's get started with
the new languages and thank you a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
