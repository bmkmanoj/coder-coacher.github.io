infrastructure Identity and Access
Management or I am running applications
on the cloud involves multiple functions
managing a variety of workflows
assigning access rules for specific
groups of users with simple policies
empowering teams to acquire and manage
their own infrastructure services and so
on and all this needs to be done while
maintaining overall visibility and
control
hi can you tell me if there is a way to
easily establish governance across all
Oracle cloud infrastructure services the
Oracle cloud infrastructure Identity and
Access Management or iam service is
included for you by default
it lets you control who has access to
your cloud resources you can control
what type of access a group of users
have and to which specific resources
how can I get started with the I am
the I am service is enabled by default
at no additional charge with the I am
service you can leverage a single model
for authentication and authorization
across all the Oracle cloud
infrastructure services you can access
the iam service using the console REST
API command-line interface or CLI
or SDKs the very first user in your
account is the default administrator all
subsequent users are either created via
the iam service or via the Federation
with your existing identity provider
where you explicitly grant them
privileges to interact with specified
cloud resources
when you say resource do you mean any
cloud object that I create and use in
Oracle cloud infrastructure
that's right for example compute
instances block storage volumes virtual
cloud networks or VC ends subnets root
tables and so on across the compartments
in your tenancy
can you tell me more about tendency and
compartments
a tendency is the equivalent of an
account the tenancy contains all of your
Oracle cloud infrastructure resources it
is provisioned with a single top-level
compartment called the root compartment
you can then create other compartments
as required
a compartment is a logical container
used to organize and isolate cloud
resources each resource is in exactly
one compartment permissions in a parent
compartment are inherited by child
compartments compartments are global
distinct from physical containers like
regions and availability domains
resources can be connected or shared
across compartments for each account the
service automatically creates a
top-level compartment known as the root
compartment
much like the root folder in a file
system
users can then create child compartments
as required
sure so when I create resources should I
create them in the root compartment or
one of the child compartments
generally resources should be created in
a compartment that is not the root
compartment
it is best to design your compartment
hierarchy before you begin creating
compartments and resources
this is because access rules that you
set for the root compartment will be
inherited by all the child compartments
within it therefore it will be difficult
to control or selectively assign access
rules if resources are created in the
root compartment
currently resources cannot be moved from
one compartment to another compartments
help simplify permission management for
example you might create a separate
compartment for your networking
resources V CNS subnets Internet
gateways and so on and then allow only
network administrator's to access that
compartment is that so
how can I specify who has access and to
what extent
you can do that by assigning policies
policy specifies who can access which
resources and how
access is granted at the compartment and
tendency levels
you can write a policy that gives a
group a specific type of access within a
specific compartment or the policy can
be at the tenancy level where the group
automatically gets the same type of
access to all the compartments inside
the tenancy
policies are one or more statements
written in human readable format allow
group group underscore name to verb
resource - type in tenancy tenancy
underscore name allow group group
underscore name to verb resource - type
in compartment compartment underscore
name where conditions allow group
project a underscore admins to manage
all resources in compartment project a
underscore compartment policy support
the security principle of least
privilege by default users are not
allowed to perform any actions
how can I enable and disable user access
currently you cannot disable user access
however you can reset passwords or
remove keys and thereby change that
users group memberships you can also
revoke permissions by simply removing
users from any group that has been given
specific permissions
however you can manage complex
organizations and rules with logical
groups of users and resources and simple
to define policies
give me an example here are two
compartments with certain resources in
each specific access rules need to be
assigned to Bob and Jane Bob is in the
network admins group and Jane is in the
app developer group for enabling access
Bob and Jane need to be given console
passwords to use the web console and or
API signing keys to use the REST API and
SDKs
they must also be placed in groups to be
given access to cloud resources a new
user has no permissions until you place
the user in one or more groups and
there's at least one policy that gives
that group permission to either the
tenancy or a compartment Bob and Jane
can be members of multiple groups though
groups are used to grant privileges to
cloud resources a group has no
permissions until you write at least one
policy that gives that group permission
to either the tenancy or a compartment
I am resources compartments users groups
and policies are global so you can
access them across all regions here is
the URL for you to sign into the
web-based console use the console to
access and manage your Oracle cloud
infrastructure services
after logging in you will see that
access to different interfaces requires
appropriate credentials API signing key
the API signing key is required when
using the API in conjunction with the
SDK the key is an RSA key pair in the PE
M format minimum 2048 bits required in
the interfaces you can copy and paste
the PE M public key the PE M format of
the public key that is used for API
signing in is actually a certificate
that is exchanged in API signing in
using HTTP this is different from the
SSH key used for logging into the
instance which is actually a key
instance SSH key the SSH key is used to
access the compute instance when you
launch an instance you need to provide
the public key from the key pair in the
console you will need to copy and paste
the contents of the public key file
swift password you use a swift client to
access object storage service for the
purposes of backing up an Oracle
database system or DB system
so that is how you can easily manage
access to your resources on Oracle cloud
infrastructure
