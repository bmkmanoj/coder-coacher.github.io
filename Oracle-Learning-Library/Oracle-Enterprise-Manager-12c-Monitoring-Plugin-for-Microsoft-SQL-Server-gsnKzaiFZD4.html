for the Microsoft sequel server plugin
for Oracle Enterprise Manager 12c today
we'll be reviewing the updated 12.1.0
6.0 plugin including its new features
and monitoring capabilities throughout
this video we'll see how the microsoft
sequel server plugin is such a great
individual solution for monitoring your
microsoft database environment
this is mainly due to its integration
with Oracle Enterprise Manager making it
an ideal solution for any heterogeneous
database environment before we get
started let's review what we will be
covering in this video we'll start by
going over the plugins support
capabilities core features some of which
are new to this release and others that
were introduced last release and finally
the plugins integration with OEM the
Microsoft sequel server plugin is
compatible with the current OAM release
of 12c release 5 it includes support for
Microsoft sequel Server 2005 2008 and
2008 r2 with failover cluster support
also it supports sequel Server 2012 and
2014 including failover cluster and
always-on availability groups so getting
started you can see I have already
logged into an Oracle Enterprise Manager
12c cloud control web console and
navigated to the enterprise welcome page
from here you can go to the enterprise
summary page through the Enterprise menu
located at the top of your screen in the
inventory and usage graph to the right
you are now able to view your sequel
server databases you can drill down to
the details using the inventory and
usage details page
here you can see various details such as
target host name version platform and
more from here you can also click a
targets name to go to that targets home
page this release includes the addition
of a sequel server compliant standard it
is accessible through the Enterprise
menu
once at the comply
- bored you can select sequel server
compliance framework in the framework
summary section to see your sequel
server instances compliance score for a
more detailed view you can select sequel
server configuration compliant standard
in the table below here you will find
graphs and tables displaying target
compliance scores violations and trends
compliance management allows you to
track and report the conformance of
managed targets to see which targets are
most or least compliant from here or any
other page in cloud control you can
navigate to the all targets page by
selecting targets all targets once at
the all targets page we can find and
view our Microsoft sequel server targets
I prefer to refine my search and select
the Microsoft sequel server target type
from the left navigation pane this will
filter the list of targets to only
targets relating to this plugin clicking
on the deployed target will bring us to
the plugins home page the first thing
we'll look at on the plug-in home page
is the summary overview the summary
overview provides details of the sequel
instance and host plug-in status uptime
database and server names and your
Microsoft sequel version also in this
overview administrators are given the
ability to run jobs to start or stop
their Microsoft sequel server or agent
and jobs to pause or resume their
Microsoft sequel server this can be
accomplished by clicking the specific
buttons next to the server or agent
status confirming the job will start an
OEM job in the background at the bottom
of this view are links to the database
performance analysis and indexes pages
clicking these links brings us to these
individual pages we'll visit them in a
moment next to the summary view is the
database table in this table each
database associated with this monitored
Microsoft sequel server in
we'll be listed as a row with status
size and space available if you click on
a column header the table will sort by
that metric type clicking on the
database name will bring you to the
plugins database page for that specific
database displayed here is the status
for your cluster or an always-on
availability group also listed is a
notation of which node is currently
active in the health of each node if the
plug-in we're monitoring a single
database the reads rights and errors per
second would be displayed here instead
the data for that graph is displayed in
a historical line graph of the last 24
hours
over here is the associated services
table this table contains windows
services that are related to Microsoft
sequel server monitoring the status of
these services can be useful when
diagnosing issues with your sequel
server beneath this row detailed metric
graphs and charts are provided for some
of the most critical collected metrics
the graphs and charts provide easy to
see call-out points when hovering over
them with the mouse at the bottom of the
home page you can find the standard OEM
incidents and problems and job Activity
views here you can quickly view any
incidents that have occurred from metric
thresholds and other problems
mousing over the incident will give the
full description while clicking it will
bring you to the incident manager next
we'll navigate to the analysis page by
clicking the link we looked at earlier
in the summary panel this analysis page
is broken into two main sections the top
five sessions in the top five queries
the top five sessions metrics can be
organized by CPU time or memory
utilization while the top five queries
can be organized by execution count CPU
time or blocked time after selecting the
metric to view each graph can then be
filtered to show different sections
in time by day week and month hovering
over different points in the graph will
display detailed information on that
metric point the table below the graph
offers detailed information about the
top five sessions as well as the ability
to kill the session by selecting the row
and clicking the kill session button
above the graph clicking yes in the
dialog box will start an oem job to kill
the selected session moving down to the
top five queries graph again we can
hover over the lines to display detailed
data points mousing over the table rows
below the graph will show the full
execution count and query being run
using the targets contextual menu will
now navigate to the targets performance
page as you can see the performance page
is broken down into three key
performance indicator categories
processing connection memory and sequel
execution each of these categories
contains historical data on the defined
metric you can change the length of the
historical collection by utilizing the
radio buttons at the top of the page
next we'll go to the database page you
can access the database page in one of
three ways through the contextual menu
through the link in the summary view of
the homepage or from the database table
on the home page the database page
enables administrators to monitor and
manage their Microsoft sequel server
environments down to the individual
database level first select the database
you wish to view from the drop-down menu
within the summary view the summary view
shows the status ID owner and creation
date the graph below the summary is the
database composition that shows how the
database space is being utilized the
backup management table displays the
previous database backups and gives the
user the ability to restore the current
database to the selected state or to
delete the selected database backup this
view also gives the user the ability to
generate new backups for the
Microsoft sequel server database the
user may choose to back up the database
by selecting backup now or select to
schedule a backup for the future by
selecting scheduled backup if you choose
to backup now you simply give the backup
a name and choose full or differential
backup clicking scheduling a backup
utilizes Oracle Enterprise Managers
built-in job wizard for easy and
convenient plugin job scheduling moving
down to the second and third rows of
views on the database page we find
several graphs for showing the last 24
hour collections of the reads and writes
the database composition over time and
the database space available next we'll
go to the final page in the Microsoft
sequel server plugin the indexes page
at the top of this page is an indexes by
usage graph and table the graph can be
filtered by day week and month hovering
over different points in the graph will
display detailed information on that
metric point at the bottom of the page
is an index fragmentation table and a
recommended missing indexes table with a
job to create indexes the five pages we
have just covered display some of the
most critical Microsoft sequel server
information however to view all of the
metrics collected by the plugin will
navigate to the all metrics view here
the metrics collected are organized into
metric groupings the most recent data
collected can be viewed as well as some
historic values that are stored by the
plugin these metrics explore the breadth
of the plugins ability to collect data
from the Microsoft sequel server
environment to explore a metric further
expand the metric group in the left
column and then select one of the
specific metrics you wish to view the
values collected for that metric are
then displayed in this table on the
right
as you can see clicking on a row in this
table splits the page horizontally into
two sections the top section shows the
average low high and last known value in
the bottom section then graphs the
historical values of the selected row
over time the time frame can be changed
by selecting the view data drop down
menu above the top table now that we
have a good understanding of all the
metrics that are collected by the plugin
let's review the available incident
thresholds that we can utilize to alert
us in the case of a failure or problem
setting incident thresholds in
collecting historic data on these
metrics can prove to be a very
beneficial aid in alerting
administrators of potential issues to do
this we'll navigate to the metric and
collection settings page
if desired you can fine-tune these
thresholds for each of the metrics in
this list to a specific value this
metric and collection settings page is
already predefined without of the Box
thresholds for some of the configurable
metrics to apply a monitoring template
we'll go to the monitoring templates
page
you can filter this
search by selecting Microsoft sequel
server in the target type box and
clicking the arrow to the right the
Microsoft sequel server plugin comes
with three out-of-the-box monitoring
templates it includes basic cluster and
high availability disaster recovery
templates another feature implemented in
this release is chargeback functionality
chargeback functionality allows the user
to monitor and control IT costs by
gathering data on resource use and
allocating charges accordingly in the
chargeback reports section you are able
to review the charge summary for the
selected date range to view statistics
by cost center entity type or resource
the last thing we'll look at are the
business intelligence publisher reports
the Microsoft sequel server plugin is
shipped with over 12 out-of-the-box
reports for easy and quick reporting of
key metrics for an example let's take a
look at the report for memory statistics
as the report loads you'll see that the
data is logically organized for quick
viewing and easy print ability the
Microsoft sequel server bi publisher
reports are also great for analyzing
trends in data and finding stress points
in your sequel server environment before
they occur and that concludes the screen
watch for the Microsoft sequel server
plugin thank you for taking the time to
watch this brief demonstration hopefully
you have found this video to provide
good insight into the updated Microsoft
sequel server plugin and how it can add
value to your infrastructure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
