hi and welcome to this how-to video this
how-to video will show the steps
involved to install solaris 11 on an
Oracle Sun x86 server using ops center
Enterprise Manager 12c we can see here
we have our ops center buoy and we can
see here we're using the assets view now
this particular server here this is a
service processor of a son or a call
fire x 20 to 50 and what we want to do
is install solaris 11 projects we can
see here the via a tabular view we just
have this installed unlike the one above
here where we have the service processor
and we actually have an operating system
so we want to put an operating system
home care what we could do is we could
use the install server button here but
what I want to show you is how it
creates some plans and policies profiles
to actually install the year so that
woke up so we go to our plan management
section and we can see we have two
sections here we have deployment plans
and what they really are is a way of
putting multiple steps together and
making sure like it a chain deployment
and get all the steps together you
require now these are the ones we can
look at first now a profile as it says
at the top here defines a deployment and
configuration requirement so what we're
going to do is we're going to actually
one of these to install our server and
then once we've created one we're going
to automatically have this player to a
client so we can then run the plan
against the server so if we go to the OS
provisioning section we can see that
we've got a multitude of players or
profiles already defined so here are
some that actually come with a system
itself and these are ones that have been
created previously customers so by the
user so we have a desktop server here
and a large server so we're going to
provision x86 because the serving
question is an excellent six ever so
we're going to create a small server so
what we're going to do as this one has
already been created and has some
information which is personal to us to
use in the lab we're actually going to
create a copy of this profile to make
things a lot easier so if we click on
the copy profile button and we'll just
wait for that to come up then we can see
here we have a name of copy of the
actual profile itself so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to change this from
large to small so we're going to keep
this ticked because we want to create a
deployment plan so this will
automatically do it this for us so
solaris x86 and the operating system
provisionally in 36 needs to remain the
same so if we go through here we can see
here's our solaris 11 automatic
installer now opscenter inherently uses
the automatic installer features
inherently provided by solaris 11 so we
leverage those to actually create
solaris or an instant on the server and
pop center as added value with being
able to control the service process up
bring it down perod off set it to pick
Cebu and also create the required a I
configuration parameters to install the
solaris 11
so we can see we've got some software
groups here available now as this plan
previously was a large server we clicked
a small server and this will change the
actual what size and what software
groups you so you can choose this as
well so we're going to click through
this and here is kind of some standard
stuff so we're going to as this is a US
based that environment we can keep the
language the same that we're going to
keep the time st. is gmt I don't really
want to change anything yeah so at the
bottom here we want to automatically
manage with Oracle Enterprise Manager
oximeter what this means is it deploys
an agent controller on to the server
itself and that enables us to do do
things enables us to catch the server
and also enable us to actually have a
virtualization controller which opens up
opscenter to be able to create things
like zoned for office lifesavers so we
want to be able to do that if we didn't
want to do either of those we could
actually just elect to not deploy an
agent and just manage the server itself
just for IRS Sh which means a messa
social changes so we go next the user
account if we specify a user account
here then the root user gets turned into
a role which means it can't actually be
logged into directing on the seller so
you have to be go into this particular
user and then su to root this is a
solaris 11 security feature so we want
to keep this the same so I scuzzy disk
usage we could use this provisioning
however I want to use local disks local
food this so I'm going to keep this I'm
ticked our file system so this is us
through our actual swap size which I
could change and I can change this as
well at the moment has set default is
edifice which for a lot
naming services this is the naming
services pertinent to our lab which I
don't want to change so i could use ldap
or Nestle or not okay on to the
networking section so here what we can
see is we can actually do some link
aggregation we can use an igmp group of
English none of these opponents in my
lab so we can keep this thing with
respect to the networks what we see here
is with a choice of networks that were
able to have these are the three
networks that are pertinent to my lab so
where is he going to keep those eyes and
we're going to move across this
particular interface there so okay so
the summary part this is what we see
here so we can actually scroll down and
we can have a look at all the particular
pertinent choices that we've made
throughout the wizard here to create a
profile so using name for examples of
file systems that we chose the DNS
network into place so I'm happy with
that so we're going to finish here then
the job we run and we should see a
profile created for a small server so if
we go down here we'll just let the
screen refresh itself and here we can
see a small server so if we click on
this should be able to see all the
information that we put in so that's
done I'm happy with that it's what we
need to do now is to go out and check
out the deployment plan so over here
these are the deployment plan statutory
provision OS so if we have a look down
here we should see one for small server
so this was automatically created
because we take that check box to
started and we can also see here that
this is the actual plan or sorry the
profile that we create it so this is
going to be pertinent
so what we want to do now is apply this
plan to that particular X term 257 so we
can either go over to the right here and
click apply deployment plan or we can
right click on the mouse and we can
actually have a little sub menu here and
do a fly deployment plan so another
little wizard runs what can do here as
we can click our server section so we
just all the servers that we can use or
actually in the system we want double 12
so we add this to the target list we can
keep this with minimal interaction so
we've already formulated the plan so we
want to actually add some information in
there such as IP address back home so if
we click Next another wittily run and
will actually be able providing
information so alrighty here so what
we're going to do here was going to
enter our ip's that we need for this
particular server because there's static
ip's
just make sure of a glass thing
I've also set the hostname near because
that's the hostname that in DNS all
reading and all that ok so I'll happen
with that so we click Next we'll also
make sure that we from the actual
profile itself we flipped out for food
so now we're going to be with a
particular place so we go next now here
we can assign the actual server to a
server pool now this is to do with the
use of zones or logical domains or we'll
be able to spark oracle vm server for
x86 this is where you can put things
into server pools so that enables
features such as DRS dynamic resort
settling and a chaser availability now
at this time I don't want to assign this
to a server point just going to do a
simple insulin you can also do this at a
later time you wish ok so scheduling the
job I wanted the job to run now what it
could actually like to have it run
motivated to click next then we get a
summary screen similar to the one that
we have drawn a personal profile and we
can actually see all the choices that
we've actually made so we just want to
run through and maybe check and the DNS
is that a fast the network interfaces
and also the IP address extremely pretty
so I'm happy with that so we're going to
reply the part
so their plan gets applied and then we
can see actually here we can see the
deployment plan in progress so we can
have up here you can actually see these
are the steps that will be taken okay
our deployment job has finished so we
can see here that's the service
processor and here is on new solaris 11
based OS as in server is up and rank now
from the dashboard page here we can see
information pertinent to the actual
server itself number of threads that
anything and also in incidence we can
also use the summary page so free trip
on here we can get some really good
information about utilization fitness so
memory CPU is equal and also if any
exams are present on this particular
server and simulate utilization we can
also use some analytic information as
well so this is information that is
directly captured from solaris 11 such
as the top 5 cpu memory network niño
processes which in turn actually
down into so there are other things on
the other really useful such as zone
analytics should there be in zones
processes services to metrics and chance
so a lot of information that you can
actually gather inherently provided by
solaris 11 but captured in a graphically
formatting bar top center so that
completes this how-to video on how to
install a server with solaris 11 using
enterprise manager call center 12 thanks
for listening and culture
