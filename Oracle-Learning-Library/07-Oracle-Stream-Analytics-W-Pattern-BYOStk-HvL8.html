implement a sophisticated analytical
analysis of the movement of a particular
event shape value property it is
described in terms of its rise and fall
in what can be described as forming the
letter W while used in most industries
the W pattern is often associated with
financial services front of this trading
solutions and when identified in real
time can be an indicator that for this
specific stock market the specific stock
symbol could be often topping out and
getting ready for a move down first we
give the pattern a name W fluctuation
pattern followed by a description and
followed by tags which can be used to
search in the catalog and press the
create button the W pattern requires the
following parameters event stream is
they previously created event data
stream of shapes which could be a flow
of retail inventory levels from a
vending machine or from a financial
services market data feed in which you
would like to identify a double you'd
like movement trend
partition criteria is generally the
unique identifier in the stream such as
the device ID or a stock symbol window
is the time period to wait before an
output event shape is published that
indicates the downtrend followed by an
uptrend followed again by a downtrend
and finally by an uptrend in the shape
of a W has occurred this range is
between nanoseconds two hours tracking
value is the property value that is
being monitored by this pattern it can
be a numeric real-time inventory level
or a stock price defined by the pattern
criteria
once the w pattern parameters have been
specified the pattern exploration
immediately and continually execute and
after the time with the period has
elapsed it will indicate the event shape
or shapes that have matched the W
movement trend as a complex analytical
implementation often the response times
to the live output stream could be
rather lengthy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
