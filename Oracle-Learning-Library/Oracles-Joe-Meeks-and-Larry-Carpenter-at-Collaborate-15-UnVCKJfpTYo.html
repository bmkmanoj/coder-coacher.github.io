Jesus it's going on a long time now 35 +
years Larry how about yourself I've got
you beat there 41 this year well you
know what it's okay you can beat me
happy but what does have to be do right
guy now how many collaborates have you
been to area well I'd say that
definitely the last for but I think it's
been about eight in total and and other
user group me oh yeah I love the user
group meetings we do what u ke g the
german one I've been to several of the
u.s. ones that just did some of the
other user groups that are kind of off
the spectrum a bit yeah you know you
know personally for me in product
management I think that's a big part of
our role in product management is to
work really closely with the user groups
be out there with the folks that are
using the Oracle technologies do not
weaken this year yummy because that's
where we're going to get most of our
information from the people are using
our products and what we're doing and
how we can make sure that what we're
doing is actually what they need yeah or
how to make it better absolutely the big
thing so what do you think the value is
for customer coming to collaborate and
to or to a local user group meeting well
what I find the most interesting is that
not only do they get to hear some Oracle
people talk about what's new and what's
up coming and some best practices but
they get to hear real life experiences
of other customers their peers and they
can go and learn things before they
actually trip over the same things that
those people fell into that sounds right
and you know and the other thing I
always think about it the user group
meetings it's more of an unfiltered
content oh yeah no holds barred here
well because you've got product managers
showing up they're here to talk about
the products and interact with the
customers and it really in a user group
setting so that there's some unique
value you get from this kind of a
meeting that you don't get else
absolutely I find this to be one of the
most interactive shows that I've ever
been to where people are talking from
nuts and bolts right up to the to the
highest level of just over views right
down to the deepest technical details so
okay I think about this what advice
would you give to an Oracle customer you
might meet that isn't already a part of
the user group or hasn't come to a
collaborate
I would say that you know along with all
the ma best practices that we always
publish and we tell people to read and
to go off and do the research and try
things out and talk to us they need to
come to these types of user groups
especially the IO EG because it's so big
to learn from the experiences of other
people so that they can sit back and
look at it and say yeah Larry and Joe
told us here's an MA a best practice but
here's these for the customers have
actually done that and it always didn't
always match up but now I know how it
all Marik's you got it for me so the the
value of the real life user experience
networking with your peers people that
are doing the same thing you're doing
you know just the kind of experience
that you can't get in the office you
know when all you're dealing with is you
know the folks around you with that
project that's you get your benefiting
from the experience and many other
people doing the same thing you're
trying to yep and I think that's one of
the strongest things that people can
come away from the user group like the
iou G very good thank you very cool
thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
