application that guests can use to log
their visit to the mythical Plymouth
aquarium in this video I will show you
how to use Oracle Java cloud service SAS
extension control to deploy this
application
Oracle Java cloud service SAS extension
control is the main user interface for
Oracle Java cloud service SAS extension
from it I can deploy and remove
applications and libraries and monitor
system usage and metrics
deployed applications are listed in the
applications table and it's from here
I'll deploy the guestbook application
I'll give the application a short
descriptive name
and located in my file system
and now I'll deploy
a status note identifies the job number
for this deployment
I'll use this number to track deployment
status here in the jobs table I want to
be sure a deploy application job for the
visitors application is running
I'll refresh the screen until the
application appears on the applications
table
and up arrow tells me that the visitors
application is running
I can also verify its status here on the
jobs table
now I'll cast the application so I'm
sure there weren't any problems with the
deployment
I'll start the application and here's
the guestbook
I can slide in
you
at a comment
and see who else has visited the
aquarium this lets me know that the
application was successfully deployed in
this video I showed you how to deploy an
application by using Oracle Java cloud
service SAS extension control to learn
more about this subject and all other
aspects of Oracle Java cloud service SAS
extension visit us online at
cloud.oracle.com the Oracle Learning
Library or any of these other Oracle
websites I metaphorical thank you for
watching
