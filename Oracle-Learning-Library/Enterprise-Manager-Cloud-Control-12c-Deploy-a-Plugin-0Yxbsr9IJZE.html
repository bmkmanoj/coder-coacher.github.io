cloud control 12c demo series this
demonstration shows you how to deploy a
plugin to the oracle management server
and associate it with a target the
plugin life cycle consists of three
steps download the plugin from self
update deploy the plugin to the rms add
a target instance we start by navigating
to the self update console click on the
update type for plugins the plug-in
updates page shows a list of all plugins
that are available for download of being
downloaded or have been applied to
Enterprise Manager for this demo we'll
make use of the host sample plugin that
has been pre downloaded select the
plug-in and click apply this will take
us to the plug-in home page on the
plugins home page navigate to the sample
plug-in this icon on the latest download
tells us that the latest version of the
plug-in has been downloaded but has not
yet been applied select the plug-in and
choose to deploy it to the oracle
management server provide the
repositories sis password and click
continue the plug-in deployment process
will perform certain prerequisite checks
this includes checking for permissions
check with a disk space and other
validations this ensures that before a
plug-in is deployed to the management
server it is in a stable state and the
plugin complies with all required
guidelines confirm that the prerequisite
checks have completed successfully on
all OMS s and click Next confirm that
both the OMS s are up and click deploy
the plug-in deployment job has been
successfully submitted to track status
click on the show status button
the plug-in deployment activity can be
tracked from the deployment activities
page click on any of the IMSS and check
the steps that have been completed
refresh the page manually until the
deployment process completes the
deployment process can take anywhere
from five to ten minutes depending upon
the type of plug-in since this is a
metadata plug-in which is a lightweight
instance of the plug-in no OMS restart
is required the plug-in has been
successfully deployed to both the OMS
servers now let's add a target instance
to add a target instance go to setup add
targets at targets manually unlike
Enterprise Manager 11g there is no need
to first push the plug-in to the agent
as this process is automatically done
when adding a target instance to add a
target instance select the third type
that is to add an on host targets by
specifying target monitoring properties
choose the target type and select the
management agent to deploy it to
click add manually here provide a useful
target name and inputs for the target
instance properties and click OK now the
target addition is in progress the
confirmation dialog is displayed upon
completion click close
you can look at the new target that was
added by using the new feature for
target search provide a part of the
target name and click search click on
the target name in the search results
to navigate to its home page since the
target was just added it will need a few
minutes to collect all performance in
configuration metrics thanks for
