large studio compiler team do
performance analysis and today I'm
talking to now or Coptic our OpenMP
committee representative about what is
an MP and how we're supporting it in the
compiler so now goodie Tom you are open
at years so ultimately is a way to white
parallel programs and yeah the idea
behind open it p is very simple so you
start with your C C++ or Fortran program
and insert directives in the code
specifying to the compiler which parts
of the code we want to parallel eyes
what advantages does this have over
doing the same thing using POSIX threads
there are several advantages for one
thing opening p is easy to learn easy to
use all you need to know is what
directives you will need to paralyze
your program the other thing is you
don't have to rewrite your application
so you could start with your existing C
C++ or Fortran program and just insert
directives in the places where you want
to paralyze that's what's called
incremental paralyzation so you're just
adding parallelism big my bit to the
places of the code that you want to
paralyze so what kinds of parallelisms
is open up your support what is what we
call a paddlin region or you have a
block of code in your program and you
want that block of code to be executed
by multiple threads redundantly so you
would identify that as a pair of the
region another type of pal ISM is what
we call paddle of loop and here you
would have a look at your program with
independent iterations that can be
executed in any order and you would
identify that clue as a pattern loop so
you'd have multiple threads executing
that clue where each side
taking a different a different subset of
those iterations in the loop okay a
third type of parallelism is what we
call tasking where you have different
blocks of code in your program and you
identify those as tasks and then those
tasks at runtime would be put in a pool
or queue and the strides will just pick
one task after another from that queue
and executed so how long has the openmp
specification of being around 40 KMP has
been around for quite some time now it's
been around for about 16 years so the
first opening piece specification was
released in 1997 that was flourishing 1
point 0 and then last year in July 2013
a version throw pointer was released so
what's new in version for the oh so
version four point oh includes several
new features i'll just mention a few
here so um one of the features is called
region cancellation so there are
mechanisms for the programmer to be able
to abort or terminate the execution of
region if certain conditions occur so
you actually aboard sea region and you
exited clearly runs that's what's called
the region cancellation another feature
is task dependencies so let's say your
application has all these tasks that we
just mentioned and order to put in the
pool or the queue and decide start
picking them one after the other it
might be useful for some applications to
say that this task depends on that other
tests say task B depends on task and so
in this case of what you would want is
task B to wait for task a to finish
execution before task B would start
until the new specification gives you a
mechanisms to express this kind of
dependency another important feature in
the top corner specification is what we
call strength affinity often for sure
for getting better performance but you
want to do is have the threads of the
application run on certain processors
and just one on those processors and not
move around by the hour application is
executed so in order to you to have
those threats stay where they are there
are mechanisms in open air people we
know that allow you to specify this kind
of set affinity okay if I want to use
openmp what sort of things do I need to
pay attention to and all my programs
should work you need to pay attention to
several things actually out for one
thing we need to be aware that the
threads are communicating using shared
data and therefore you have to be aware
that when threads are accessing shared
data that access needs to be
synchronized so one problem that you
would need to avoid is what's called
data races and that's where two threads
are accessing the same piece of data
that's not super nice the access is not
synchronized and one of the strengths is
writing to that piece of data so that
would create what we call the race
condition meaning that the result will
be different possibly from one to one
and it will be unpredictable and the
program may even crouch so you have to
be very careful when you're accessing
shared data to putting the correct
synchronizations and avoid databases
another problem that that is not just
particular to open a paper to parallel
programming in general you need to avoid
how
deadlox and deadlox might come about
because you're not choosing locks
properly so you might have one thread
blocked waiting for another thread and
that other thread is also not waiting
for that threat so none of the two
threads can proceed rights as a forward
progress issue yes and and with this you
need to be very careful about how you
use your locks okay so do we have any
way of helping a developer identify
these problems I'm actually oracle
solaris studio does have a tool and it's
called the thread analyzer and yeah this
tool will help you detect data races as
well as said locks new program i would
highly recommend using it to look at
your white and opening paragraph that
seems like good guidance so thank you
very much for spending the time this
morning with me thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
