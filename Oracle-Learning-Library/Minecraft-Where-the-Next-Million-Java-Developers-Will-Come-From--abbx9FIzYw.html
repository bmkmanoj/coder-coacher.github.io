at Oracle
I am a I guess what we call a job with
systems engineers with Sun for 15 years
and I do a lot of teaching K through 12
on the weekends with a lot of products
that use Java like greenfoot we use
scratch and so forth so as of the last
12 months my students have gone
completely insane for this thing called
minecraft so I talk about that a little
bit now there's two kinds of people
there's the kind of people who says what
is Minecraft and there's the kind of
people who say not for president so how
many how many what is minecraft people
do we have in here and you're among
friends is okay we won't run you out
okay cool but I have to spend so much
time intro not sure president okay
you're in your inner eyes crabbin very
cool so let me here's the thesis of my
talk right now there are 42 million
people who have signed up to play and
register for Minecraft stuff some
percentage of those have paid 27 dollars
to buy the game and so forth and so on
my thesis is as follows if one in 42 of
those people can be interested in
programming Java creating a mod for
minecraft using Java we have a million
more Java developers that's my point
okay and that's not something I made up
I had this paid ad moment I call it my
kids are 12 and 15 I think a lot of
their friends in Computer Club and so we
we basically teach programming we teach
computational thinking we keep we sort
of get them the idea they can make
something and they only have to play
what's on their Xbox they can make their
own thing it's a good it's a lot of fun
and so I sort of watched them play
Minecraft a little bit like we seem to
be digging a lot a lot and I never
didn't quite get the gist of this I
didn't give it enough time and so I had
to think the add moment which was hey
Dad how do I add something to a jar file
wait a minute you just asked me how you
add something to a jar file that's all I
like my day job why are you asking it's
like well I need to make this minecraft
mod like how are you kidding me this is
in Java so anyway this begins my journey
so for those few of you I'm go really
quick those of you don't know what
minecraft is here's a brief introduction
it's from the Minecraft side it's kind
of a cool little thing so it's it's good
to see this let me go ahead and play
this this is a little tuna thing on what
is
Minecraft's and for those of you who
already know I'm so sorry but more to
get so up speed here with the Union
limit is your imagination let's go
wherever you want to go find the tallest
mountains let you down to the darkest
caves build anything you want day or
night rain or shine as this most
significant sandbox you'll ever set foot
in d build a majestic castle invent a
new machine or take a ride on a roller
coaster
play with friends build your own little
community protect yourself the strongest
armor that you can craft find out the
dangers of the night no one can tell you
what you can or cannot do it's no rules
to follow this adventure it's up to you
so it's an open sandbox building game
and that's a lot like calling a Ferrari
you'll need the transportation so that's
where it is and so why is it so weird
addicting and wired somewhere 42 million
people doing this thing it's good so it
bears understanding it's also the most
popular Java game so as a guy who's
trying to teach - trying to teach kids
Java for a day job anyway it's it sort
of really speaks to me
so these get passed through this really
quick so if you start up a Minecraft
game before you're writing anything in
Java or doing anything computational
thinking oriented you have to go into
the game and get resources to survive
basically so you have to build yourself
a shelter and if you have it set in a
survival mode the bad guys come out at
night and that's what the shelter's for
is attempting to not die because in
survival mode you have hunger and you
have damage you can sustain when bad
guys come and get you you don't have a
house that's really a drag nepo start
over again you lose all your stuff when
you mind things in Minecraft that's the
mind part of Minecraft there's all these
elements and there's things that you
might sort
recognises okay I know about whole I
know about iron and gold and diamonds
are somewhat precious but as you go up
the chain there they make progressively
better tools and there's this weird
thing in the middle that's red that is
called red stone of those of you who
remind people how many have made
something with with red stone circuitry
Wow my people I should let you explain -
this is so cool so I'll give you that in
a minute but basically there's another
aspect of this which is if you are
running a survival mode you have to
either figure out two animals to kill or
grow food or whatever so basically you
keep keep from dying one of the big
things in building or big things in
Minecraft is building different things
and the immensity so Mojang said the
coolest thing they say though with
Minecraft is Game of Thrones
there's group builds they actually build
the entire place of Game of Thrones in
world so it's like having an infinite
bucket of Legos and no limitations is
pretty cool okay so how to get it this
gets into the pretty part it's kind of
an interesting business model just go to
the download page it's available for Mac
Windows Linux and it's $27 to buy the
thing and connect online with friends
all this stuff there's a version you can
play on the web the Java based version
that you don't have to pay $27 for you
can pray a plate as a Java applet your
web browser and so the 42 million number
is a number of people who have
registered to play the game for free
there's some percentage that have bought
the game and so anyway that's that's off
of the download page that's that's
something you can go and get it's a
little odd that it's not an open source
free thing it's very much a for pay 27
bucks per client there's only one time
yes right and same with the Pocket
Edition iOS and some of the other
versions of it so it's not the
full-blown yeah
oh that's interesting so to repeat
knotch the guy who originally wrote
minecraft will give that a second
basically said he'll turn loose when he
considers to be done is that accurate
okay Wow
yes um you can kind of write stuff
against it now I'll show you how but
it's a little it's a little more
complicated than most of my K through 12
students I can want to junior high
students that want to make games we use
scratch from MIT and stuff like that so
I wanted to to barriers as possible so
one of the things we're working on is
the API so we'll get into that minute so
thank you appreciate that
you've got more questions Haller okay so
that's how good a little bit of history
so this is a guy's nickname is not just
Markus Persson he's the guy that
originally created it and he was playing
he was inspired by this game called
Dwarf Fortress we want to make a sort of
a construction fantasy game was based on
these rule sets he discovered the game
in phenomena and decided that was a
thing to do make a better version of a
called Minecraft order of the stone and
it's now just called minecraft there's
another guy so in December 2010 this guy
named James or Jeff rolled onto Mojang
as a developer for another game and
quickly went over to the Minecraft side
and then at in November 2011 not stepped
down from minecraft and Jeff as the
primary guy he's good Eevee's when I got
all this background information from by
the way March 2012 Mojang hired four
members of the Minecraft community to
help him sell off the game and endowment
contractors work on optimizations those
those four so they're like a 30 person
shop they're small developer company
what 7 yes there I will get into that
there's a group called craft bucket or
bucket so they basically hire the folks
who did a really good job of doing an
API for this as part of mojang not to
squish them but to do a good job of
making the API open so they've if you're
into the you know evil set these are
these are like the poster child boys
they'll open this thing up they're not
trying to be secret a little bit more
history was written in Java not for any
particular reason other than not you
Java really well and was comfortable
with that at the time being currently
Mojang and sticking with java because it
will help to create a modding api now
they have some challenges like if you
look at the Minecraft Pocket Edition
for iOS with the Xbox edition Java isn't
such a great option or even legally so
in those those aren't supposed to
support it as a you know can have a
free-form Java VM without issues on the
platform so they have done two ports and
C++ they're working on the official
modding API I asked a bunch of questions
like get a schedule I'm talking to
people at JavaOne we'd like to know and
all they would say is working on it's
taking longer than you thought will get
it so you can you can watch not just we
see where they are with that in Jeb as
well so anyway it's goodness but moving
port off that little bit stuff they're
built on top of just like something like
open wonderland and some other games
they're both on top of the lightweight
Java game wire library LW jgo and an
implementation of open AOL they said
that they're not they don't have
anything to release yet but one of the
things they're looking on building on
top of if other packages that help to do
video recording because if you're just
think of a Minecraft hand here you know
one of the big things is to make videos
in sin world just like in second life
they make videos and do all this stuff
in world so they're trying to improve
that so that you could just hit the
button to say record minecraft session
you have your video output so looking at
that it's not ready for public yet but
something there direction they're headed
in okay so a little bit about redstone
that was awesome that's that's the most
hands in a room I've ever had with
redstone circuitry so let me talk about
this a little bit um bit of an eye chart
especially from back in the back these
are some of the tools that I use with my
kids like my K through 12 students some
college students on the very far right
is just Java and an IDE like NetBeans or
Eclipse or something on the far left is
this thing from MIT called scratch and
scratch this sort of this drag-and-drop
block thing it's very hard to make a
mistake in contrast that too on the far
right side you know here's notepad
here's a Java compiler go at it I'm not
gonna throw a nine-year-old with that in
the middle there's this thing called
green foot and green foot is a sort of
simple as possible Java IDE so that
they're still coding in Java but man it
sure smells looks and feels a lot like a
scratch drag-and-drop block thing it's
just you're coding and
we type in the code and set the box so
in terms of comparison there's a way to
get from you know kids that are playing
minecraft but not in chayo no coding
that's not me I'm not interested to get
there here's an example of scratch on
the left in Java code on the right and
so Java code we can do in Greenfoot and
you know notepad as well this has been
fairly successful for me a lot of others
in the community that are teaching k12
kids rather than just jump in and say
let's let's fire up Eclipse let's go and
how quickly can we get lost right what's
this button do we use scratch to get
them the idea of all the stuff that they
can do from a computational thinking
asked termina perspective so variables
synchronization concurrency all that
stuff that from a computer science
standpoint want them to get I'm not
really cranked up about them being Java
certified into our session so as long as
they're dragging the blocks together and
doing programming stuff that's going to
make sense down the road for Java that's
all I'm really caring about so on the
left-hand side are specifically a bunch
of operators including not and an or so
we talked about boolean even though in
scratch we don't have boolean variables
in Java of course we do
and before we even get into minecraft
and coding up a mod there's this cool
thing called minecraft redstone that
that mysterious hmm I've never seen a
red mineral before well they put it in
sort of as a ruse but this is so cool
the thing on the screen these are all
configurations of elements in the game
so these are torches and blocks and
based on the configuration the thing in
the far left hand side is an
input/output gate the thing down below
is not data and or and there's pages and
pages of this stuff there's flip-flops
there's latches everything you have in
digit electronics you've got in the game
they can build a computer in the game
with stone and torches it's crazy
but it's very cool and it helps me a lot
as a teacher because I want them to have
a pretty good handle on boolean algebra
so we do this in Java and do this in
scratch and actually they can go build
stuff in Minecraft so when we get to
wiring up their doors wearing wearing up
their tracks wearing off all this other
stuff it this is pretty cool so
red sounded specific I want to show a
couple of examples and that's after so
let me go grab that this is a real quick
intro to redstone circuits
so you mind this stuff and when you mind
it with the pickaxe you get this red
dust and when you pick up this red dust
you can basically use it for wiring so
once you have this dust in your
collection you got your nine bins down
below you can worry about different
things so if you have a switch the back
out throw that switch is true or false
plus or minus the redstone circuit is on
or it's off so that's pretty consistent
straight cord for things like a NAND
gate ER and or gates so you can put two
inputs and the the result of that will
be either the end of the or based on the
configuration so this is already
exciting for me because we do a lot of
this where we're just we're making like
asteroids games remaining basic video
games they have to have mastery of
basically boolean logic to do a lot of
this you know should the craft turned
this way or that way should I fly off
the screen that sort of thing so even if
they're in Minecraft building this stuff
in using redstone circuitry that's my
only requirement so they can basically
set up and prove they know and or not
from the boolean stuff so that's a real
simple example I'll show you a little
bit more complicated in just a minute
that's gonna go hang on there's a little
more complicated examples you can you
can literally wire out circuits with
major components such as I'll show you
in a minute there's you can do 8-bit and
16-bit L use in world they've made
complete pseudo two solvers and we'll
just using stones and torches it's
craziness but in a good way
yeah and so the primary things that you
end up sort of hooking up or things like
doors anything that has a true or false
state open or closed railroad tracks car
tracks having you know the terms can go
left to right and Pistons can either be
engaged or not engaged so it's all this
true/false stuff that they can wire up
in world and it's really easy I do a lot
of stuff in second life this is way
easier this is a scratch of 3d so if you
don't you aren't engaged with this with
with if you have kids you're not doing
this jump in because there's there's
programming and math all over this
I'll pass the tech that I want to run
over time here but anyway so there's
this really interesting thing right
wedged in the middle of Minecraft this
game where you can go build stuff is I
like all of boolean algebra sitting in a
block just waiting to be messed with but
you can tell these guys are nerves as a
as a programming company that happen to
be on a chronic admission here well
let's go ahead okay let's jump into that
so let me show you a couple examples of
more advanced redstone circuits there we
go let me grab that sorry it works a
little better if I if I run it from the
video player so so these are some more
advanced example of using redstone in
Minecraft
I think this is just music I think music
go falling for ya let somebody have a
little bit time on their hands for a big
computer pixel screen so the really cool
part here is 15 year-olds of their own
volition won't be interested in 8-bit
aou if you tell them they can do it in
Minecraft don't go do it it's like a
secret don't tell you should be
interested this is about this so I
should also say there's a creative mode
of Minecraft so typically you won't
build anything like this without the
monsters coming in blowing things up so
there's a creative mode if you really
want to build stuff you can flip it over
you don't have to have all the guys
attacking you all the time
very experienced with your life that
somebody just blew up your ASIC computer
that you built down the road yeah so
anyway no Jay think the most impressive
redstone thing they've seen to date is
they as you go to solver in world and
this is kind of representative of some
of the complexity that they'll build
just using redstone circuitry and
torches so that just gives you an
example so in terms of teaching in class
if I'm teaching programming and we're
talking like even from the historical
standpoint we're talking about you know
back in my day we have this we have that
you can build some of the stuff in
Minecraft using redstone just it's crazy
it's ok so that gives you an idea
there's a lot more on the web and it's
just generally it's amazing that that
that's something that kids would want to
do and build these old you know kind of
computer circuits that's a lot of fun
yeah
why why minecraft or why redstone yes
don't have to have a waste gratis
graphics card honor yeah I know the
question is why why would kids do
minecraft in general this is a bomb so
if you have input shout it out so this
is technically a sandbox creation world
so it's urgent like I think the infinite
box of Lego's is the best description
I've heard there's just additional thing
it will get into Tekkit in some mods in
a minute and actually make your own mod
in Java the cool part is there's lots of
people making their own more Lego bricks
so addition to having all the infant
Lego buckets you can make more different
kinds and so it's like a little badge of
honor hey I made a mod and I'm playing
this and I can do this other thing so
it's a creation part that's the thing it
turns me on so much about scratch is
okay are the kids gonna really be
enthused of making a you know beginner
2d graphics game maybe not forever but
it's their thing they can they can they
can create what's what's in their head
in the world you can build palaces and
other people it's a multiplayer sandbox
effectively and it's it sounds look if
you haven't done this to try this it's a
little weird but I guarantee if you turn
12 year olds 15 year old onto this you
won't be able to extract them from it
it's just yeah there's a huge social
aspect to it as well let's go build this
stuff and have a conversation in world
so anyway there's a whole there's a
whole angle that's hard to communicate
in 45 minutes why this is so cool but
just kind of a lot of us trust us so let
me show this here's the example of
something why kids do this
this is another example of using and
this is called the animal Hanan in this
case the redstone has been used to wire
up a button to lots and lots and lots
and lots of TNT on the opposing hillside
is a little aperture for an animal to
fit into so you see the Redstone you
trail for the switch up on the hill so
he'll go up on the hill on a second
there's the launch platform there's the
button to use processing I don't care if
there's logic involved in that that's a
lot of fun okay and that goes on they
want more cows and stuff but generally
yeah you can make things low high in
space that's kind of fun so thanks to
red stuff okay so in addition to all the
stuff in world there's also the you can
mod or make an existing modification to
a minecraft server I'm gonna pull that
one off and show that video as well so
this is there's a collection of mods
called Tekkit so rather than like spend
your life loading mods and have 50
year-old say dad how can I add something
to a jar file they've got a little thing
called Tekkit dad just load stuff up and
let me show you the demo of that real
quick
Tay so you spell ticket take T E K ki T
there's
and this will show off some things in
Tekken that don't exist in Minecraft
that you have to mod crystal chests are
Aman you can see inside the chests
there's a bunch of machines there's
different minerals the the amount of
stuff that this adds to minecraft
minecraft is already massive but there's
a number of mods collected in the
different packages this is tech it
represents about 41 mods and yes we've
got a server up and running and a bunch
of friends of kids playing it and I mean
they could view this for the rest of
their life it's there's so much in terms
of all the walks and what they could do
and machines they can bail them
generators and then it's craziness but
in a good way so just to kind of get an
idea for some of the stuff you can't do
in Minecraft just vanilla minecraft but
if you have mods you can that some of
the machines there demonstrate a lot of
that and you can do something simple
when you add a new block so if you want
brownstone or whatever you can add that
as well that gives and something here
that shows off some of the building
aspects a lot of this kids like to get
together and adults like to get together
and just build huge projects like that
so that gives you an idea of some of the
stuff you can do some of those things
were mods some word
but that's just kind of in terms of
scope and complexity that gives you an
idea of some of the stuff you can do is
like a big multiplayer sandbox
yeah specifically there are the pipes so
being able to make machines and you can
kind of do the Mayan civilization thing
and you know forever be stripping the
land of coal in order to feed all the
machines with tech it you can do you can
make generators that use wind power
geothermal power water power and what's
the last one
nuclear in solar so there's kind of a
cool there we go so there's kind of a
fun Thank You Tekkit there's kind of a
fun green you know don't destroy the
environment by stripping the local land
of mining of stuff like make machines
that use reusable power that's kind of
fine anyway so about the mods they're
written in Java that's the initial
question of dad how can I add something
to a jar file I want to mess with this
so let me get past that so there's not
quite yet a public API that's one of the
reasons that the the team called a
bucket Guk AIT was brought on board to
sort of get a public API that all this
can load up and just go so the existing
minecraft Java distribution is the fact
obfuscated if you get minecraft.jar it's
obvious gated it's hard to make sense of
there's two or three different people
that have sort of provided something
that will help unobtrusive at there's
lots of tutorials on how to give it Eve
got the Minecraft are kind of you know
work with it
developers have been made available tool
kits like craft bucket which I'll show
you in just a second aid in writing mods
in Java explode into minecraft and this
is a very common entry point for avid
minecraft players to start screaming
with your own game modifications the
thing that blows me away here I have
about four or five dozen friends and
friends of my kids about one in four is
picked me up Java not true dude like
because I want a job in college or
something they're learning language to
my minecraft period no other reason than
that they just want to make a new Lego
block in Minecraft and you know from my
perspective I'll take it that's what it
takes to get kids programming and
learning stuff I'll follow you down that
all the way like okay so that's what
bucket is about bu k ki T this is a
think about for people that Mojang the
folks that make Minecraft actually hired
into the 14 for the API stuff but it's a
continuous build thing that matches the
current version of Minecraft so that if
you look at the Java Doc's for it it's
sort of everything you would expect
here's all the walks here's where it
means to be an entity creeper here's
what it means to be a hunk of stone
right so it's basically the API to all
of Minecraft and give you a quick
whirlwind tour being up and running you
don't have to use any IDE of course you
can also to cut a tin can but you may
not want to so there are instructions
for how to get started with a minecraft
mod with NetBeans with the cliffs with
IntelliJ and there could be others so I
mean it's just Java code at the end of
the day I like to use this with my
students because I can say let's hook
this thing up grab the git repository
build run and then let's go I won't have
to have we don't have to do a lot of our
own source management so we usually
start with something like that means you
have to go grab there's a craft bucket
there's a repository that once you get
that and build it it's a fully running
minecraft server you get to clone map
and then open the project up from
repository and I'm sorry so these are
all in the web if you go to the bucket
wiki it's all here you don't have to
write down every word on the screen I
just wanted to give you an idea of
starting from nothing
I opened up my IDE I cloned the
repository
once you've got the code down you have
to do a priming bill to get the
resources there's one other thing
besides java code it's called a yml file
I think it's yet another markup language
or yml it's just a little config file
that says here's some stuff here some
data might will be whatever so once you
build from the repository and then you
run the server and a local host so
you're actually running the minecraft
server even if you didn't do this in
NetBeans you can do this if you play a
single-player mode on minecraft you're
running a server there anyway they got
land parties so if you've got a local
server other people can hook up it's
kind of cool
so even if you don't do the developer
version of this you're still somewhere
in space and time running a minecraft
server and hooking up to a client with
that so anyway once we've got you grab
an IDE we've got the repository down
using craftbukkit you can use others and
then built it and run it you can then
basically hook up with the minecraft
client so you just download minecraft
exe or whatever Windows Mac Linux on
your machine and you can talk to it and
then from there you can start
experimenting with the mod so I'll show
you a couple of examples here one of the
things that usually happens if I'm at a
school where the machines aren't latest
greatest and lots of memory we try to
run the server at barse and says oh my
gosh java.lang out of memory help help
and most of them go wow what's this so
one of the things that little Tekkit
launcher does you can download tech at
the server or take it to launcher one
nice little things the launcher does is
for kids that don't want to get in the
command line and in type of buncha you
know - it makes this whatever the
technic launcher allows them to kick off
the client with with minimum/maximum is
for Java memory Java heat memory so
that's kind of cool but just if you're
if you're trying this with kids maybe
what first thing you might happen is
they'll come up and say I'm out of
memory
minecraft is this is some pop quiz
if you're running a minecraft server and
it's one-to-one right how big is the
world god what is it going forever so if
this relief earth if you have one and a
half times that that we're gonna have
time the radius of the earth that's the
size of a Minecraft world so if it feels
like if you walk you can't just walk and
suddenly you come around the world it's
it's huge so the space that they're
traversing with this world the server
you just fired up effectively is
something that covers the size of the
earth plus about half so obviously they
don't load that on to memory they sort
of run it in chunks and as you run the
server it'll say you know generate this
I'm simulating that so it's pretty cool
computer science tech that they've done
here
ok so lastly if you wanted to adjust
that and then you just as if you're
about
play a monkey with Minecraft you would
fire out the clients in go to the server
park we go multiplayer and simply say
add server localhost 120 700 won and
then fired up so you're then talking to
the server that you just built a lot of
people run their own servers I do that's
s like a badge of honor - I just build
something in redstone I just built a mod
I've got my own server or my friends are
on right so that's pretty common as well
so ok we haven't done anything yet
because we've got a minecraft server up
and running that we built and we have a
client connected to that but it's sort
of still vanilla minecraft so in terms
of trying to add things and modify that
the the bare minimum it takes is a Java
class that took classes from plugin and
then a little small config file like
plugin dot yml and that simply says you
know the name of the class and if you
type in compresses if your mod is to add
commands you can text and type in things
like Hey Joe how's it going list got
some commands you can add commands to
that so to show you the code for that
this would actually be a prequel
hands-on lab we just didn't get that one
time so that's what it looks like on the
right hand side there in your IDE for
your minecraft mod you'll have some Java
file that subclasses from Java plug-in
and you'll have a little configuration
file that really does no more than say
this is the name of the plug-in and
maybe the version so here's all the
stuff that the so the Java file looks
like this this is sort of the simplest
minecraft mod or plugin it extends Java
plug-in that is an word got bucket so a
lot of what bucket has done his main
api's into an obfuscated jar file for
the minecraft server so she got some got
Java code to talk to not have to worry
about the whole obfuscation thing so
there's a bunch of stuff but in general
that's the header this is all available
on the bucket wiki and then you've got a
disable or enable
listener
to put something into the log file
minecraft is really useful because what
will my 15 year old friends they'll get
into a squabble he took my stuff look at
what he what do you weigh kids will be
kids whatever it's not the technology's
fault
so a lot of times being able to log
stuff and say oh hey Joe Willard a mod
that wasn't very nice or whatever so
it's a good have something up hook into
sort of the Minecraft system and say
this mod is coming online and some other
stuff a plug-in manager so it's a hook
for disabling enabling the mod and then
lastly there's a implemented command so
this particular one if you want to do
something like Oh change the color of
the arguments for the chat into green
and send a message that way that's
that's a little code that does that so
we're just calling the stuff inside the
minecraft.jar through the bucket api
that they've made available so pretty
simple stuff and then lastly the actual
test command itself might do something
like have a guy throw a snowball
snowball is one of the things that you
can have in world is block and you can
grab one of those and throw it at
somebody so that's that's kind of like
that's a Minecraft version of hello
world it's throw snowball so that's you
know maybe not quite two pages of code
kind of simple little thing for a
plug-in here's some other examples so
you can do things like send a message to
another player so again kind of hello
world style maybe a different color so
this is all in the Java file for the
plug-in you can also do things like
change different colors the hello world
and then we're complicated you start
doing things like change the blocks
around so if you get the players
location and get some information back
about the block see standing on so the
whole rule set of Minecraft in general
is free it's just amazing all the stuff
you can do is got gravity it's it's you
know there's fire there's water and all
this all this stuff about a real light
world of the kids experiment with so
even if they're not writing code there
is like the matrix they're experimenting
in some world
state limits in the edges and boundaries
and how this works like the pig cannon
thing they put more dynamite in does it
go farther right I mean so the holes the
kind of testing a system that that part
really appeal to the kids and then
lastly to kind of recap like you know
some other stuff in here besides
Minecraft besides Java and I wanted to
get right on that
so that is I do a lot of work with K
through 12 and we get I get students
that have never done programming thing
whenever so we usually start those off
with start those kids off with a tool
called scratch from MIT is just
scratched mit.edu and that is the
simplest most bulletproof thing that we
can get a lot of stuff done and I've
ever used so we did actually there's a
simple data structure in there there's
variables there's conditional logic
there's sequences there's just a lot of
computer science stuff that want them to
have but it's in the guise of hey let's
go make a video game let's we'll make
the animation right moving up the pipe
one of the things we usually move from
scratch Alice from Carnegie Mellon
that's a sort of 3d version of scratch
it's still drag-and-drop blocks but the
complexity of navigating in 3d space is
a little more complicated than the
scratch for your 2d space so it's a
little more complicated but still cool
stuff the one in the middle I'm focusing
on the green foot teams actually here
they're on the pavilion if you want to
talk to them oh hello so the hand over
there you have any questions about green
foot please go see them here's my master
plan I they're still students did say I
want to write a mod and minecraft but
they kind of don't really like jumping
into NetBeans or Eclipse or like you
know I want to fly here's a 747 I mean
not a good idea so something like a
Piper Cub right green foot is sort as
simple as possible java ide it's got a
2d framework it built into that so a lot
of stuff I do in terms of teaching math
games building asteroid ships they have
momentum cosine and sine stuff like that
I do that in a scratch first if the kids
haven't done this and then we move over
and do the same thing in green foot and
I actually show just just like I had
before the blocks you know here's the
here's the an LOC in scratch here's what
Han looks like in Java right so towards
the end of the day we sort of have some
things to do if they've never coded
anything you typically write some
projects in scratch you get them started
we typically write some projects the
same things we can in green foot which
is 2d and then moving over to writing a
mod for Minecraft dents a little more
complicated because it's not visual
you're writing them on code you're
trying it out in in green foot and
scratch feedback is immediate they
change something and the little guy on
the screen he flies off or it doesn't or
it turns blue or whatever so that
immediate feedback try something
something changes try something
something changes we get to just meet
you all know we get to just writing Java
code you kind of hope it's this mod
there's a whole process behind it I'm
trying something I'm thinking about and
oh look it works it's a little more
complicated on the Java minecraft mod
side so my suggestion if you've got kids
that were kind of like cranked up about
this but haven't done a lot of
programming I would suggest this path
scratch first green hood next and then
Java and I need minecraft thirds that's
why I'm talking about terms of drag and
drop watts into writing minecraft code
so we are at 7:10 and I just I wanted to
leave a little time for some questions
so thank you for your patience and what
questions do you have in the fire way
yes question in the back speak loud oh
thank you question is curriculum me
personally I do not but I think I had
the same yes you sure does
I think I had this up anyway there's a
thing called Minecraft edu calm and they
oh there it is so if you go to minecraft
edu calm this is Joel and cinterion
company and more interestingly there's a
Google group for Minecraft - teachers
they put thing in there and put their
and their shame on me so if you look on
the google group and look for
minecraft - teachers they are in fact
sort of putting their curriculum Rubick
rubrics guidelines what they're doing so
there isn't count the scratch actually
has a full-blown curriculum guide that
you can download and sort of hand to a
teacher or whatever this is under
development this is relatively new I
mean minecraft hasn't been around too
long it's been around for a couple years
you know in math right so there's a lot
of people over in Minecraft - teachers
that are sharing what they're doing and
while we're doing extensive stuff
they'll do complete lesson plans in the
world amongst other stuff I don't
personally have a big collection of this
by subscribing minecraft as teachers so
that's to answer your question I would
say go to minecraft - teachers and
Google group and that is as close as we
have as to a curriculum guide and
collection of teachers doing a thing
it's very cool and it's very you get a
lot of sideways looks like you're gonna
do Wyatt in class you're gonna run a 3d
game to talk about math oh okay I get
that but not a lot even though what what
else question yes there question with
modified clients communicate with
efficient servers they've got a
versioning scheme so the client has
built in as soon as there's an update on
the server it says hey you want a 1.3 is
out you want to update you can choose to
or not - they try and do backward
compatibility and - it's sort of a
slightly different question one of the
things Mojang is trying to do and be
careful with their mod api is preserve
all the mods people have written because
they can conflict right I can write one
you can write one we both say I've got
ever mint striped block I do - yes right
so there's kind of two different things
there one is if I'm firing up with an
old client against a different server
the client has built into it some stuff
to say oh wait a minute let me check and
see that's a 1.3 server I need to either
upgrade or die right and the other thing
is oh wait a minute somebody wrote a mod
that allows them to see all the stuff
and kill people or whatever so that's
something watch out for as well before
they actually get clever enough to write
their own mod they'll go find a naughty
one and then loader then it's literally
a minecraft server that wait what why is
everybody dying suddenly so that's
that's hard to please but yeah yeah so
one of the common things is hey we'll
get our friends together we'll set up a
minecraft mod and we'll put it out there
if you open it up to the public you'll
get people coming in they're really
really good at tearing things up they'll
let so everything fire a blower thing up
and all this other stuff because they're
running with the mod that you don't have
so one of the most common mods
unfortunately for better or worse is
anti griefing making sure that you know
hey this is a spawn area nobody can
torch this place or nobody can mess it
up or I put this stuff here and it's
mine and you can't get into my chest
that's sort of basic that is frankly
that's the most common first minecraft
experience we do a bunch of players is
people start taking their stuff and then
they escalate in tech it you can make
nuclear reactors I've had new Wars where
they'll take out entire like 5 10 20
city blocks with these nuclear reactors
that they set off so not very nice
what's that yeah some people well yeah
I've got this TNT I wonder what I can do
with it right yeah question
oh it's definitely it rents a job sir
and so I mean it's a sandbox is running
now I mean you know like every other
week there's some weird oh wow do they
thing that you think you're teleporting
anyway it's a Java server and I mean if
this curious Java is not a server so
I've got a bunch of Linux machine that
runs come on
so I mean it's
oh yeah that's interesting so yeah
pushing waters can you grab some major
mod he's doing something not nice like a
dial service attack mod yeah no I don't
think they provide like bio IO access
all that stuff so I mean come on d8 guys
are online you check me on the subject
we're going to 7:15 I want to thank you
very much for coming
I've got a server set up they'll put the
stuff on called new to Java org Annie
WTO Java org so I'll put these slides up
and some of the stuff we're doing is
this there's a lot of lot of people who
know job as a day job working with kids
that when programming just a perfect fit
for to get along we're doing this
already so thank you for your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
