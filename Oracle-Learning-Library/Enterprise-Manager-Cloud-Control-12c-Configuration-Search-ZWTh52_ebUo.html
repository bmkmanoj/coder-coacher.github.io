Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series the configuration search
functionality of Enterprise Manager 12c
is a simple and graphical way to get
answers to complex configuration related
questions
it basically leverages each target types
configuration collection and
relationship definitions a little bit
more about that in just one second when
users go about building a configuration
search specification they can save that
specification for reuse by themselves or
other users of Enterprise Manager 12c
and if you're just getting started with
using the configuration search
functionality you should start by
familiarizing yourself with the target
definition and relationships for targets
that you'd be interested in building
configuration searches for to do this
from any targets home page go to
configuration last collected to see the
target type definition for configuration
that will be collected and go to
configuration topology for a sample or
understanding of some of the important
relationships that will be collected
about your target type here we see the
last collected page for a typical single
instance database on the left-hand side
you can see the different configuration
items that are going to be collected
about this particular target type in
this case single instance database
things like initialization parameter
system global area data files redo logs
etc this is the definition for this
particular target type and gives you
what will be available for you in
building a search definition later on so
you should become familiar with what the
names of these particular configuration
items are for the target types that
you'll be interested in building
configuration searches for likewise in
the topology page this you can get an
understanding
of what the types of relationships that
are automatically detected and collected
by Enterprise Manager 12c a couple of
important ones for things like databases
and Fusion Middleware is hosted by as
well as installed at hosted by is a
relationship to the actual host on which
that database instance is in resides and
install that is a relationship to the
Oracle home the Oracle home is important
because that is where patches are
applied so if you're going to be
searching for applied patches which
we're going to do in our demo scenario
you were going to be leveraging the
install that relationship to build that
query likewise if you are interested in
showing the platform or operating system
or hardware information about the hosts
on which the databases are it deployed
you would be leveraging the hosted by
relationship so let's get started by
building a configuration search let's
build a search where we are looking for
database instances with or without a
particular patch installed we're
interested in knowing the version of the
database as well as the operating system
on which that database is deployed so we
got to the configuration search library
by going to enterprise configuration
search and here we can see the list of
out-of-the-box Oracle supplied
configuration searches as well as any
user defined or user developed searches
so to create a new one we click on
create once in the create new search
configuration ship screen we choose the
starting target type and in this case
we'll choose database instance you'll
notice that down below database
instances now the starting point and you
can see there are two buttons add
relationships and add properties let's
click on add properties as you can see
this gives me essentially the
configuration collection definition for
in this case the database instance
target again if you remember when the
priests
we saw this when we were looking at the
last collected screen for the database
instance so again we familiarized
ourselves with this target type and we
know that the version that we're after
is under the instance information so we
choose version and then click OK and we
can see that now version is a property
that will show up in our report and you
can see in the drop down here I have the
ability to add some pretty sophisticated
filters like contains or doesn't contain
or is or starts with or ends with so I
can add some pretty sophisticated
filtering so for example if I was only
interested in version 11 databases I
could add you know 11 here on the
right-hand side to get a list of only
those databases that are have version 11
in their version name so we can always
see where we are with respect to our
search as we're going along here by
clicking on search so we can after we do
that now we can basically see that what
we have is a list of databases and their
version now we're interested in finding
out the patches that are installed in
and remember that the patches are
installed in the Oracle home so we need
to add the relationship or install that
or a home in order to get at the
properties of the related Oracle homes
so here we can see all of the
relationships that could be detected by
Oracle Enterprise Manager out of the box
including our host by hosted by host as
well as the installed at Oracle home
that we saw in the topology viewer in
the presentation so let's choose install
that Oracle home now you can see that I
have access to the Oracle home
properties and its relationships as well
as a matter of fact so if we choose on
click on add properties we are again
presented with the configuration
collection definition but this time it's
for the Oracle home target and you can
see that I can click on patches
installed in Oracle home and I'll choose
patch ID and click OK
now at this point I'm interested in only
finding databases that have a particular
patch installed this one 3 3 4 3 2 4 2 4
so I'll add that into the patch ID
contains that value and click on search
as you can see this narrows the list
down to only two databases but we were
also interested in understanding the
operating system on which they were
deployed so we're going back up to
instance database instance and click on
add relationships once more this time
we'll choose the hosted by host because
the host target contains the operating
system name that we're after so as
before the host target is now accessible
to us and its property so let's click on
add property for the host and now I get
to see the configuration definition for
the host target type so I'll open up
operating system choose name and click
OK if I were to click on search at this
point I can see where we're at
and we can see that our report now
contains a list of databases with a
certain patch installed as well as the
operating system name as well as the
host name as a matter of fact to our
report I can export this list by
clicking on export to a CSV file or I
can print it directly from here I can
also save this specification by clicking
on save as and I can give it a
particular name if I were interested in
saving it so I could give it a name
something like db's with a particular
patch installed name but me I'm not
interested in saving this at this point
because I want to show one more swipe a
slight modification to this scenario so
let's say we were interested in
databases that do not have this but
Giller patch installed so you might
think well I could go to the list of
filters here and choose does not contain
but that actually wouldn't get me the
results that I'm interested in really
what I need is a way to say I need to
check all the database all the patches
on a particular database and none of
them need to meet this particular
criteria which in this case is patch ID
contains 1 3 3 4 3 4 2 4 so to do that I
move to the right here and I choose
options and here you can see that by
default it's doing the Oracle home and
patches installed in Oracle home
properties that meet such criteria in
the case where I am interested in it
databases that do not have that Oracle
home or that patch installed I would
choose Oracle home where no patch is
installed in Oracle home meets such
criteria so I'll click OK and let's
rerun the search so this time we see a
list of databases that do not have that
particular patch ID installed so again
probably a pretty common search scenario
