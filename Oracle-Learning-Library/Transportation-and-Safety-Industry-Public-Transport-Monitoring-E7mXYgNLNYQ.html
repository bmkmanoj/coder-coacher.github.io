showing the construction of a streaming
application solution for the monitoring
and management of real-time traffic as
more and more vehicles cars buses
bicycles hit the roads the chances
increase exponentially of excessive
speeding and blockages on the roadways
with real-time capabilities now
available to manage the flow of traffic
using dynamic signage traffic lights and
policing this kind of solution can
instantly identify and reduce congestion
while enhancing the public's journey
experiences all built on the
industry-leading oracle stream analytics
platform and executing on a big data
stack spark streaming and caf-co runtime
let's kick off by logging into the
stream Explorer user experience and
reviewing the configuration of the new
highly distributed runtime and the
enabled visual analytics capabilities
in the transportation and logistics
section of the catalog we will find some
pre-built artifacts for the solution
which define the base stream of the
vehicle data in this case public
transport buses providing indication of
individual speed use Holloway's and
assigned drivers etc connections define
the underlying configuration for acts in
your database and Kafka topics with a
map artifact describing the geofence
areas of interest in this case around
Atlanta a target has been created to
send the result in analytical streaming
topic event data to a receiving traffic
manipulation application or business
process and finally here a database
reference to specifically define a table
with persisted information regarding the
drivers of each of the vehicles
okay time to create the application
provide a useful name and description
with tags for later catalog searching
and connect to the streaming data
you
here we can see the spark console
showing the newly created and deployed
application
you
now back to our user experience tooling
where we want to add a spatial
analytical stage to only identify the
vehicles that are within the area of
Atlanta with just a few clicks of the
button this capability is executing
returning the desired results
you
we add another stage to our application
pipeline to ignore vehicles which are
not moving and then using the powerful
temporal analytical features of the
tooling we define a dynamic moving time
window in which we calculate the average
speeds for all vehicles identified by
their assigned bus trip ID
you
for ease of reading and later usage we
can easily change the live output stream
event shape column names as desired
you
the next stage is used to reconnect the
calculated streaming data with the
original base stream so that we can
leverage the entire collection of data
available using another time window and
stream source correlation
you
using the intuitive integrated
expression builder function we can add a
new live output stream column adding a
news event type shape to the stream
which will provide the method to
identify the various speeding violation
levels
you
so how do we use this new column well
with a business rule stage you can
specify the different speeding limits
and then assign a value that represents
that violation such as reckless or minor
these values are used later in our
visual analytical section of the
application
talking about the visual analytics
capabilities of our user experience we
also want to ensure all of the highways
have a usable name so we provide a
default name unknown to those without
any value this again can be used by our
visualization section later
you
and here we can see all of our completed
business rules for the default highway
for reckless for major and for minor
speeding violations
you
so who are the drivers of these vehicles
this can be assessed with another query
stage that will firstly ignore no
violation speeds
and then we'll correlate the streaming
data with a database table joining on
the driver ID and numbers available in
the data
instantly the results are returned
showing for each bus vehicle the name
age issuing license district of
offending drivers etc
you
can we actually get the real-time of the
offense easy using our expression
builder which will not only return the
current time but then can be used to
convert that time to another format
you
once all the analytical analysis has
been completed the assess event data can
now be sent to a downstream application
or process using the defined Maps
target remember that only published
applications can start to flow the
resultant events as needed this will be
done later in our application
development process
you
let's now add some cool visualizations
to an application the visualization tab
provides a wealth of different charts
that can be used such as spatial where
we can immediately identify the
different speeding violations using
color coding and notice that these
charts can be saved as slices for later
review
you
here the various vehicle positions and
speeds can be observed on a configurable
focused map view
you
and another bar chart visualization can
now be added on our business rule stage
which will show the congestion around
Atlanta now
for each highway we can see the average
speeds with the lower the average speed
the greater possibility of congestion
you
now that this real-time application is
completed and as we mentioned previously
we now want the resultant analytical
event data to be sent downstream this
could be to a receiving application or
process that will immediately manipulate
the traffic flow or in our case to our
integrated real-time and historical
visual analytical reporting capabilities
you
as we can see the publish button builds
the final application and redeploys to
the spark runtime
you
with that completed in the catalog we
can see those visualization chart slices
created earlier
you
now next we can combine both the
real-time streaming data with historical
data using a cube catalog artifact
this is how you can define the various
visual attributes such as metrics
dimensions and an analytical time task
period duration
you
once the cube has been created and
appears in the catalogue you can enter
the chart analytical environment to
create the different views desired from
the available data which will be
represented later on a new dashboard
here we create a big number chart and
save it with a specific name
you
next we can create a pie chart showing a
number of violations by type and once
again we can save this chart using a
name
you
finally let's create a bar chart showing
the number of counts by each state or
district of Atlanta
you
and once again we save this chart with a
specific name
you
to complete our solution we can now
create a real-time operational dashboard
to continuously show the results of our
analysis
the dashboard catalog artifact allows us
to select the visual elements to be
added to our dashboard we've provided
options to refresh the charts on a
regular basis
you
we can then save the funnel results to
the clipboard for later external viewing
of the dashboard with its independent
URL
you
so there we have it a complete
end-to-end vehicle monitoring and
management analysis application built
not in weeks or days but in minutes
you
