selim which is a new programming
language which is basically what you
know we try to think of it as what if we
started Java today but you know remember
the experience we had from the 10 or 12
years of Java so as I said what we're
going to talk about today is you know
what is salon why did we start yet
another language where we are at we'll
show you a bunch of the features there
are many many many features in salon so
we had to end pick the most interesting
ones so you'll get a you know pretty
decent lookin or feeling of what what
salon is about and because the language
is not just the vaporware we act are
actually going to write down a demo life
and make it work good and yeah I will
talk about the community and where we
are at you know compared to other
language isn't thing like that so my
name is Emanuel Bernard I work for I was
actually reading my name first I work
for jboss I'm initially part of the
hibernate team but I'm doing everything
around data these days so trying to
coordinate a few things and still trying
to code on especially on a grenade ogm
which is the no relation or sorry the no
SQL approach for hibernate the
experiment we are doing here I'm doing a
bunch of work on the standardization in
the JCP and I do any made a few podcasts
oh okay hello my name is Tiffany Pardo
I've been working on a few open source
projects such as rest easy and salon a
few others that I I started like Jax
tablets I've been contributing to salons
since May 2011 so a year ago which was
roughly a month after it hit slashdot a
ton of you you guys remember if you even
know / that anymore i've had the news
that it's been you know it's it's out
there is ready stage
so I remember I saw this thing on
slashdot and then i looked at the the
slides that Gavin wrote for China for a
conference in China and I was very
interested so I sent him an email saying
you know how can I try this well yeah
it's a bit hard because we don't have a
compiler at the moment like excellence
can I write the compiler so that's
that's what I do these days I write the
JVM compiler we have actually a
JavaScript compiler as well so we'll
talk a bit more about that later on and
then a bunch of tools like a salon de
can hurt which will present later on
good so seven came from the kind of the
frustration we had when we were walking
on CD I on the you know pretty advanced
I mean specification that we're using a
pretty advanced feature of Java with
regard to the type system and you know
we try to take a step back and say you
know what would we do if we could start
Java from from scratch today and Gavin
you know started walking with on that
and interacting with a few other people
like that a JBoss and you know that that
literally where it come from so if we
had to summarize sellin we we found
those six words which I think are good
summaries the first thing is that it's a
it's a very powerful language much more
typesafe than than Java in many ways and
with some feature that that I extremely
powerful and you know gives you much
more freedom in the way to express what
you want to do inside the language the
type system is actually not java's type
system but our own type system which is
as some interesting features like union
types that we're going to talk about
later it's readable o our moto was to
say most of you spend most of your time
actually reading the code you somebody
else has written or most probably that
you have written but forgotten right so
the key feature is to make it easily
easy to read I mean easy enough to write
but make it extremely easy to read even
sometimes at the expense of not be
to compact right if it's if it we have
to add a bit of a business to be more
readable we will do that it's
predictable in the sense that we try to
keep the rules simples that the hidden
goal is for for Stefan not to have too
much of a hard time to write the
compiler but the good side effect is
that because the rules are so simple
having we don't have too much too many
corner cases we don't have that many
features they are each of them are quite
powerful but that means the you know
interception of the various features
don't end up being too much of a mess to
try to work out but salon is not only a
language we're really thinking big in
this area and what we really want to do
as a food platform so our goal is to
actually also rewrite the what you guys
call the JDK so we want to other we were
walking on a salon SDK that will
actually reduce all of the feature of
salon and provide something much
pressure than the the jdk we have today
if you think about it java actually aged
aged pretty well the jdk not so much
what a lot of things should be
deprecated one of the things we've done
is that we we've put modularity at the
core of the language you know today you
have maven and then you get your
dependency from somewhere and so on and
so on in Java but the compiler doesn't
know about that what we did in salon is
integrate modularity at the art of
everything including the compiler so the
compiler or literally is able to read
data from a remote repository push data
to a remote repository so that every
single tool can actually reuse the same
logic right and because of the strong
type safety and because of some of the
decision we made the seven is actually
very easy to to build tool for and
actually we do have I sorry Eclipse base
ID as well as you know command line
tools for for that so let's have a look
at salon as a language if you look at
that it should look fairly familiar to
you and that's one of our goal and one
of our goal is actually to make the
language very readable for java
developer
or even sea bass developers let's do
something a bit more complicated bit
more realistic there is a few things you
might not do I mean you do not use in
Java like shared but you know it can
imagine it looks like public you know
that must be something around that the
actual class name as parameters that's
probably look like the constructor and
the actual attributes are the same name
as the parameter s res a bit harder to
guess but we what up what happens is
that we actually set the value from the
constructor values automatically where
is the constructor by the way so instead
of having any kind of an ad hoc syntax
to write the constructor wet what we
thought about is to make senin extremely
regular as far as the grammar I sconce
l2a simplify or work and be make it much
more regular unreadable so in this case
you know where do you put the body of a
method well within the method boundaries
where do you put the body of a class the
body of a class being the actual
constructor of this class then you
actually put it in the class at the
beginning of the class you literally
have the color of the compiler
constructor and then you carry on with
the actual methods the other thing we've
seen which is a bit different is the
idea of sure because we have modularity
we try to rethink the notion of
visibility inside salon compared to Java
and we we very much dislike the default
values with regard to visibility in Java
plus adding yet another key world was
not really something we were ok with so
instead we we use one key world which is
shared and the idea is kind of using
Russian door strategy where everything
that is marked as share will be visible
by everyone that can seize the
uncompressing elements so if we look at
an example in the class foo I've got a
bass method which is not shared so it's
private and not visible by other people
but the bar method is actually shared so
it's visible everywhere
is actually visible so the class who can
see the class foo and then can call bar
but because the class foo is also shared
it means it can be seen at not only
within the same package but also across
packages in this case the class action
can actually go and call bar makes sense
it's a actual you know there is actually
much more simple in about one sentence
you can describe it in the specification
of course we have attributes what they
are is literally properties right the
Gator of the terrace in Java which are
convention based actually enforced in
the language that's something fairly
fairly standard with any new language
these days an interesting feature of the
attribute is that they are immutable by
default we try to enforce immutability
to you know help with regard to
scalability down the road of course not
everything can be written in an
immutable way so you can actually make a
natural mutable but you have to specify
that it's available and you have to use
the assignment operator which is
different than the you know the operator
use for scale here ok so we really want
to make it explicit for you that you're
using a mutable state versus and
immutable state again we want it to be
readable so that in you know very
quickly you realize oh that's a mutable
state so if I share this state you know
between different thread I need to be
careful about that and of course if you
want to customize the code of the
getters and setters then you can do that
but let's thank you but that's that's
you know that's the minor case the
interesting case is really integral
scale which is the immutable attribute
and the other one the valuable one let's
talk about inheritance where there is
nothing fancy about inheritance you can
create subclasses the only difference is
that instead of calling super from the
constructor we actually use a bit more
compact syntax to say you know what
point 3d actually would call the super
dot you know
the super called constructor of point
with those parameters yes I'll talk
about that in a minute that's a good
point of course you can have you can
override you know potentially method
attributes well you can override method
like you can do in Java you can also
override attributes because attributes
are very much like methods think of the
getter that's a method so you can
override that more interestingly you can
also override classes we did that
because hey that was possible and a
makes the language much more regular in
this stage and it's also a nice way to
do the factory pattern where you define
the actual class implementation
differently depending on how you
override stuff one thing we change
though is that by default construct is
not over rideable you can override it
but you are to specify that explicitly
if you have put a default implementation
then you just use the default keyword to
say this stuff can be overridden by a
subclass if you don't have an actual
implementation but one subclass is to
actually implement it then you use the
form of keyword for that so again we
want to be extremely explicit here and
when you overwrite something you need to
say that's the that is the actual
implementation so we use the actual key
word for that if you I am sorry yeah
Stefan was telling me that these are not
teeworlds so to speak these annotations
the language has actually very very few
key words that's minor detail there is a
difference between jealous over right
and the actual pareto a bra an addition
insulin is the fact that you must put it
if you are actually overriding something
so it's kind of an optional check in
Java that's totally unforeseen 782 to
reduce the kind of a little bug you
would get so that's an example so we got
shape which is the abstract class and
you got a or for more method so it's
named former and then a default
attribute implementation of training
which is the equivalent of two string in
Java that is a US overridden from the
you know super object and B that I am ok
to be overridden so on it's an actual
actual default string and square
actually override those two by the way
the difference between a method and an
attribute is the pantages at the end of
it that's what you can easily recognize
them so as somebody mentioned in in the
audience we do not we can have only one
construct top class because the
construct the color of the constructor
is actually within the body of the class
it actually goes beyond that you can
have only one method of a given name
inside a class and when you think about
Java you're like well but i'm using
overloading everywhere so you know how
can i do that and be why did you remove
this feature this feature actually
turned out to be to make the compiler on
the rules much much more complex and
make other features either impossible or
much harder to do so instead we decided
to get rid of this feature by rethinking
why you actually want to use these
features and that's interesting we need
to speed up because 20 minutes to finish
the demo it's gonna be interesting what
was I saying yeah overloading the two
main use case you use overloading for
our to simulate something like optional
parameters basically you've got a very
complex complete method but you want you
know a much simpler way to access it
with some default values and not having
to repeat this kind of default
everywhere salon actually as default
default parameters values and also as
name parameters will see an example down
the road the second use case you use
overloading for is to be able to use
different implementation depending on
the subtype of a class hierarchy we also
have a different way to do that a we
have type cases which is kind of a
switch for the type so if I
type you know this subclass then do this
code otherwise do that God the advantage
of that is that the compiler actually
checks that you actually support every
single subtypes if you don't support one
of the subtype the compiler face the
second feature that is an awesome
feature that I I wish I have in in Java
just about every other day is union
types but we're going to talk about that
a bit later now these are optional
parameters that I was talking about in
this case I've got a class rectangle
which has to default parameters with
default value that are put inside the
constructor parameters so I can actually
call the parameters without any value
any parameter value and I get a
rectangle of size 2 by 3 by the way
that's a concert oh there is no new
keyword a constructor is very much like
a method it is actually a method that
returns an instance of rectangle so the
way to call it from from salon is just
to call the method and be done with it
so I believe the rule the rule is that
you put the one with the default values
at the end of the method and I guess if
you start to define one you will have to
define all of them like you can only
have default parameters at the end of at
the end so non-default have to be first
because if you call it with sequential
parameters then you need to give all the
non default first but you can reduce the
ambiguity by the using the second
technique which is literally using named
parameters the syntax is slightly
different we just brackets instead of
parentheses as its mots mostly for
another interesting feature of seven
which is a very nice sweater or present
tree-like structures we'll see an
example down the road and here i can say
explicitly I'm overriding the ID
parameter with the value for and of
course the width parameter has not been
overridden in this case okay and it's it
replaces in many ways the Builder
pattern you have to do manually in Java
another feature we have is the fact that
you generate many times in Java or the
you know similar languages you you tend
to duplicate some of the some of the
logic here you could actually use an
abstract class to factorize that but you
usually don't do it because you can only
have one you know one for class pair
pair hierarchy what seven lets you do is
provide a default implementation for a
given a given method in this case video
3d as default implementation for volume
I can overwrite it in any of the
subclass but otherwise the different
implementation is is a is inherited so
that means that somehow we've got
multiple inheritance that's okay don't
worry what we have is actually a subset
of multiple inheritance that you you
know you might remember from C++ we do
not share state we actually share the
actually
fermentation of a metal and every time
there is an ambiguity in seven with just
the compiler says I'm sorry I don't know
what to do so please make it explicit in
your code either the one you want to use
or actually just override the the method
yes well that the default method in Java
came a bit later but yeah that's pretty
much similar to that yeah except i think
they change the well if i kept up
properly today properly i think they
change the syntax and they don't let you
write code in interfaces now you have to
point to a static method you changed it
back again okay okay anyway yell us one
thing I wanted to show you is the
extreme regularity of Salem so this car
doesn't make any sense to bed the key
point that you can take a bit bit of
color and put it within a class that
would be the constructor and put it
within a method that would be the method
body core and yes i can have classes
within methods or a nice one and they
believe you don't know they are actually
nice shoes kisses for that the one that
is more interesting is that's a table in
HTML so instead of having an xml or some
kind of template outside salon here with
insulin you can actually describe those
kind of hierarchical structures so you I
style descriptors or even you know
xml-based status based descriptors let's
say JSON can actually be returning salon
in in a very nice way and type safe yes
well we try to do useful things so there
was a brief introduction but another
cool stuff about Simon is that the type
system is sound and Stefan will give you
a I guess a quick quick demic well I
don't know if it's going to be quick so
now that everybody is warned you know
can go on with the real meat of the of
the problem we have 150 slides of Greek
mostly to explain the semantics of the
language so I hope everyone's ready now
now this is this is an intro to salon
we're not going to go deep into the this
back let's see instead of doing that
let's see a few things that you would
notice if you start using the language
so for instance you can call methods on
literals number electrons what does this
tell us this tells us that we have no
light anymore this is getting very
precise you man they're going to cut the
the projector in a minute so let's make
it quick it tells us that we don't have
primitive types so there's no special
hole in the type system for special
things like primitives everything is an
object you know turtles all the way down
and the thing is that underneath of
course we optimize it to primitives
whenever we can so it's still fast but
you don't have to deal with that the
second thing here on the second line you
can see that we're building a sequence
of strings and there is some type
inference there because we're not
repeating the type of the sequence on
the right it may look like it's the same
as in Java 7 where you know Java would
look on the left side and decide that
you know what you're putting on the left
side is the type so you don't need to
repeat it but it's it's really very
different because we're actually not
looking at the left side at all here for
type inference we're looking inside the
sequence so you will see later on why
this matters we have intervals as well
and if you're lazy like me then you can
use function or value keywords instead
of specifying the type name of the
return value of private methods or or
attributes and then the compiler will
look at the right side and decide okay
you're putting a cube in there so make
you must be returning a cube and you're
calling my cube which returns a cube so
the type of cube 2 is a cube as well
there's no I have to point out that this
is not dynamic you know this is really
static the compiler knows exactly what
you're doing it doesn't change at
runtime one of the things we're trying
to
to do in salon as well as to to save
people from dying because of null
pointer exceptions that happen at the
wrong time you know the the the problem
with Neil pointer exceptions is that
usually you get them at the wrong time
so you get an object somewhere you store
it you think it's it's it's fine it's
safe and then you pass it around and a
couple of times then much later down the
road you try to access it and that's
where it crashes you know so debugging
is hard because you have a crash that's
not at the same places you know when you
obtain the the item in the first place
so that doesn't help you so what we're
doing in salon is that whenever you see
something of type cube you know it
cannot contain no right it always has to
contain a queue if you want to have
something of type tube or neuro then you
need to put a question mark at the end
so when you see cube ? it means it could
be cube it could be new and of course
the information propagates down the road
so if you define an attribute cube that
could be new or not then it's cube ? and
if you try to access properties of cube
such as the area then the compiler will
not let you because you know you don't
know it could be no so the first thing
you need to do is to check if it exists
you know if the cube exists then it's
not new and then we allow you to access
what's in the inside this if thing is is
a bit special because it actually
refines the type of cube within the body
of the if you know within the body of
the if cube is not of type cube ?
anymore it's cute you know why is it
just cube because the compiler knows
that you checked for it you know so you
don't need to repeat it or downcast it
or do something you know we know that we
have a bit of sugar to help you deal
with no safety so we have the else
operator for instance which is a bit
like the groovy Elvis operator so cube
would be Cubano cube if it returns
something but if it doesn't return
anything then we'll make it a cube of to
null safe access as well you can access
the area attribute of maybe cube you
know if it's not nil then you access the
area which is of type float
but if maybe cube is nil then the return
of this expression will be new therefore
the type of area is float or nil
depending on if maybe cube is defined on
them so what can we do with lists we
have let's say we have a list of numbers
1 2 3 we can access sub lists so one to
two or one to the end we can do
something a bit more interesting a bit
like map spread thing where we can call
this read the successor attribute of
each of the elements of the number that
gives us a new sequence so in this case
successors successor is plus one so it's
really boring so we'll have a sequence
of two three four right because we read
one successor to dot successor three dot
successor did a new sequence and if we
can do that with attributes we can do
that with methods as well right so we
can call minus two on each of the
elements in number so we'll have minus
10 and one that's one until the end of
the sequence of numbers so we'll right
now so i'll have two and three until you
know the sequence of numbers is bound
it's one two three so we'll have from
index one until the end of the sequence
you know many times you have to do size
minus one that's the kind of thing we
want to get rid of so you can also do
functional programming in so long this
is an example of things that you know
people familiar with JavaScript would
have no problem with you know the the
biggest most successful programming a
functional programming language now is
JavaScript everyone's using it everyone
knows what a function is everyone knows
how to create functions and deal with it
as first class methods so you know
though you know no she doesn't do
javascript maybe yeah you should she
only does plain HTML so here we have a
project map which is a hashmap or
whatever we read all the keys of that
and then we are so the keys are probably
going to be a set
we're going to filter all the keys which
means that we're going to call a
function and that function is going to
take a key and tell us whether we keep
it or not so if the key contains a URL
then we're going to keep that key and
we're going to map it so we're going to
transform all the keys that we kept by
calling a function that will access
while actually okay sorry I need to
debug this presentation here so it's
okay whatever so we access then the
project map again and get the venue
pointed to by the key this sort of thing
is is pretty straightforward for people
familiar with JavaScript because the
syntax is similar but we also have a
different syntax to do exactly the same
thing filter and map but in a more
interactive way that doesn't hide the
algorithm so much so for instance there
are called comprehensions in the second
part we're doing exactly the same part
as in the first except with the typo
we're going to iterate all the keys in
project map and for each of the key that
contains URL then we're going to read
the value of that key in the map and
that gives us a list right so we're
going to briefly talk about some of the
type system you know it's a pretty we
have a lot of cool features in the type
system but cannot talk about all of them
one of those that is very interesting is
the union types union types allows you
to be able to hold values among a list
of types so for instance you could have
something which is of type a or type B
and before you can use it you need to
check whether it's type a Type B so for
the anecdotes type ? so what we saw
earlier the question mark at the end of
the type it's it's actually an alias
it's just syntactic sugar for type or
nothing where nothing is the type of new
so whenever you see cute ? its cube or
nothing
right let's let's move on and then you
will probably see the answer so let's
see an example of what we can do with
Union types here we have an apple that
you can eat and a garbage that you can
throw away let's define a sequence of
apple and garbage and here what we have
because of type inference i could put
value boxes and you will see the type of
this sequence but because of type
inference you know we're looking inside
the sequence what's in there we have
apple we have garbage so the type of
that is a sequence of apple or garbage
right we can have both types of elements
in the sequence so if we iterate all
those boxes we have a box which is of
type apple or garbage what can we do
with it we can read the string attribute
by because they have a common subtype
which is object which defines string so
string is well defined but if we want to
call methods of an apple we need to
check is it an apple first you know so
we do is apple and if it's an Apple then
we can call eat and that's again a case
where we have type refinement within the
body of the if because the type of bugs
is refined it's not books or something
else anymore it's it's it's apple you
know it's it's not apple or garbage its
apple because the compiler knows so this
is K swearing in Java you would do an
instance of and then you would do a
typecast you know here you don't need to
and we have another thing called
intersection types and this is best
described with an example so we have
stick to the food metaphor so we have
food that you can eat and drink that you
can drink and you know if well I guess
maybe people are not that familiar with
Guinness here in the US Guinness is a is
a drink from England or Ireland which is
really thick you know so once you've had
a Guinness usually have you know you're
not hungry anymore so it's it's it's a
bit like soup right so it's it's both
food and drink so you can drink it you
can eat it and and this this type of
thing which is both food and drink and
you don't really care what's in there
you can express it in the language you
can say okay I want
something which is food and drink
because I want to eat it I want to drink
it could be soup it could be Guinness
could be anything you don't care as long
as it satisfies both interfaces then
you're fine with it that's the first
language that's report Guinness yeah the
exhibit is a feature of salon but I
don't know if it's me or your back f 90
so we have a lot more features obviously
type parameters we saw it briefly
introductions attribute and Method
reference annotations which are a lot
more powerful than in Java because you
can run real code in there we have a
type-safe metamodel interception tons of
stuff that I won't have the time to talk
about today but I want you to talk a bit
more about modularity them anyway I'll
started talking about that and this is
something that is very important you
know in in Java you have classes which
belong to package and then this package
belongs to nothing but in insulin it
actually packages belong two modules you
know and and within your module then you
would define which modules you import
and what you export and and this is
something in the language from the start
so it's not gonna be in cell on nine
know right it's not insulin seven and
then eight and then nine and then who
knows it's it's already in there you
know and and all the tools know how to
use it the IDE knows how to read and
write to repose even remote once the
command line tools also know how to deal
with that so you learned something to
plug something else to make everything
mother and the SDK is not over from from
the start actually a mecca three think a
lot the SDK to make it as each module as
many more as possible to avoid you know
to avoid doing something too big another
reason we rethought the SDK is because
we should put both JVM and also
JavaScript and you cannot write I mean
some stuff cannot be implemented in Java
Script so having a very nicely isolated
module actually met our life how do I
nishal II but much easier on the road
right so this brings us to heard what is
hurt her is our next gen module repo
it's already available on modules that
same language
org and the tools if you download salon
de or are already using it what we
wanted to do was to do a module repo
that is intuitive and good looking a bit
like github which is an example that we
copied a lot and make it collaborative
as well you know because we're doing
open-source helping sources is something
that is very social you know so you want
to be able to to follow what people are
doing keep up with with the new versions
that come out and everything and
communicate with the authors so it's
free software so this this extremely
cool thing that we have running at
module sign langu torg you can download
it and run it privately or publicly if
you want and do whatever you want with
it so it's you know we encourage you to
use the same tools that we're using
obviously and fix our bags and fix our
backs please yes we don't have any
better okay so you know enough talking
let's show a bit some of salon running
so what happens if you want to try salon
then you would go to the you would go to
the Eclipse marketplace for instance or
go to our website and find our update
site but if you go to the marketplace
and you search for salon and you phone
on you find our plug-in you click
install and then boom you have the same
thing as I as I do here so you have an
eclipse base ID let's start using it so
we're going to create a new new project
new salon project you're collecting all
the demo you've done since yeah I'm
keeping them because you know every so
often I get a demo that doesn't work I
need to use the previous one so we have
here demo I think call them with dashes
usual well who cares so I create a new
project and here i have a list of
repositories that it will use from the
start but because i don't think i have
very good internet here i'm going to use
a local instance of her that will use
later on
so I have created my new salon project
now i'm going to create a new module i
use very unique names for the for the
modules very nice easy to remember I
think it's the one encryption to write
so what we have here when I created a
new module we have a module descriptor
here that tells us that this is the name
of the module and this is the version we
have a package descriptor which tells us
that this package is shared so it's
exported outside the module and we have
you know this optional thing that you
know you can have a rentable function
now will function with no parameters and
then we allow you to run it so we have
something here but by the way out
javadoc your salon doc is actually an
annotation and what's inside is marked
down so let's see this rose okay can
everyone see by the way or do I need to
increase the font size yeah okay so we
have here run it it's there we have
something it's it's hello world it's
really boring as hell let's try to do
better the command line parameters are
available in an object top-level object
whole process so we have here the local
instance of heard and we're going to see
if we you know I think heard has an API
right search modules let's spits out
some Jason so we're going to try to use
this API in in our application right so
let's see if we have anything that deals
with Internet okay so we have a net
module in in heard let's use this
what the auto completion is based on the
remote people and you look at the
versions yeah and the auto completion
will query all the repos that we have
and as for the list of stuff that
matches so now we're going to within the
language you define your dependency
right it's not an external thing slowly
mix of that or whatever let's copy it
from here
yes please so what i'm doing here is i'm
parsing the your uri as something that
is more meaningful and now i'm going to
try to access it so i'm going to call
the get method which gives me an HTTP
request which i'm going to execute which
gives me a response so this is a URI you
know let's see what we have in the
contents of this response can't see
anything with the contents right so we
print what we get from there right so
now I've queried the the thing and I
have some Jason as plain text you know
okay so it's this is this is not very
good I can do better than where is it
can do better than this you know surely
there is something in heard that lets me
deal with Jason excellence so we have
Jason module let's use that this one so
what I'm going to do here is import the
few things from the JSON module and I'm
going to parse the Chasen into something
more interesting by the way so step step
and use a lot of auto completion here
but there's also a few I don't know how
we call that but in so quick fixes yeah
that we have also implemented to him yes
there's a ton of quick fixes in this
thing so we have some jays in here now
let's see what we can do this if I
remember correctly what we need to do is
we need to access the results or the the
the damn well let's let's
now we don't print it anymore okay if I
print it again don't remember what's in
there right so we have something which
is a JSON object and we have the let's
print all the names of the modules right
so we have the results which is an array
and contains objects of type module so
what we do here is that we're going to
check that the list of modules is an
array so we're going to access results
and check that it's reading an array and
if it's an array then I can iterate
every elements so what is the type of
JSON then all right interesting question
the type of Jason is just your object
and the type of modules is just array
but the type of each element within this
array is a union type if you've ever
done some JSON then you would know that
the spec specifies that it could be a
string boolean integer flow to object
array or nil and nothing else you know
it's one of those butts nothing else if
you wanted to express this thing in Java
you would say object you know that's the
common subtype of each of those we're a
lot more precise here we can say that
it's one of these and it's nothing else
you know it can't be an elephant which
is reset because that would work happen
so good right so if it is an object then
let's sprint its object in the JSON
sense of object yeah the actual top
level class let's print its name then so
no Don casting here we just verify the
type and then we go right to music so
we're here I'm accessing the the name
and it tells me that you know I can't I
called print with something that could
be new or well I know it's not now you
know it's it's I know its name so why is
it getting in the way you know what well
okay whatever I'll give it a default
value what this is
where we still have to ? you okay oh oh
that's why it was nagging me you know
because you know programmers make
mistakes so we actually do have to you
know figure out that it's actually not
called name but it's called module so
it's a good thing that it actually tried
to get me to handle this case so now we
have all the list of the modules so this
is how we traverse some JSON for
instance and let's give another example
of how we build some Jason we're going
to describe this talk today and so we're
going to build a new JSON objects we
have a title for this talk which is
intro to salon and we have speakers
which is an array boom yeah that one
wrong ok we're going to think that we
have weird operators so we like a
special syntax but no it's actually a
stolid salon we just use the name
parameter approach and then we pass in
this case what you would get as Java
enums sorry Java entries like a topper
yeah the arrow thing is just syntactic
sugar for create an instance of couple
of two so key value if i run this then i
can see that we have this JSON objects
printed properly and what's what's funny
with this is that you know because what
you can put in in Jason is really tight
it can be only one of those things you
can't be so number of bugs found during
the demo for instance we can say that we
didn't find any bugs you know this is
correct we can put strings we can put a
raise what we cannot put is something
that doesn't fit you know that is not
one of those string or boolean or
something if I try to put anything like
response object that doesn't work you
know everything is red the compiler
tells us now cannot put something like
that I can put a boolean you can put
integral integers so it's it's it is
really type safe so we have this thing
now what can we do it
mom guess nothing nothing right now I'm
going to publish it anyways you know
it's it's so easy so i'm going to log in
there i'm going to create a new web load
which is a private repo where i can
stage my module and it's going to tell
me okay this is the common line you need
to be able to upload it ok so i'm going
at the common line it's all dark it can
see anything what he's doing that I just
want you to remind that now remember how
many kilometers of XML you have to do in
maven and settings that XML to actually
publish an artifact somewhere or in a
remote repository nice pass world yeah
it's the most common password on
internet a figure that people are not
going to you know discovered 21 so say
is a bit like github with the auto
completion of the values common so it's
literally a say dash compile but you we
have some nice bash extensions for that
all right we actually renamed it to
salon so we have only one command called
salon and then you have sub comments
like you having it so you can do salam
help and then it would tell you that you
get co-pilot you can dock it you can run
it so I compiled it here and I told him
to upload it directly here okay so I
have it here i see that you know it did
some checks like I own this module I'm
allowed to publish it and it's got a
bunch of things so warning me because I
didn't compile it for JavaScript as well
I didn't do the dogs but who cares let's
publish it all right that's bad man yeah
I you know I the if there is garbage put
in there no because we actually check
who's allowed to publish and modules so
we have here are two versions so we have
one here it tells me that if I want to
run it from the common line money to do
this bit of magic here i'm using the
distribution that i built yesterday so
up and now the common line will go fetch
it directly from her
and then run it you know so everything
is really integrated so let's go back
here quickly two words about the
community at the language is open source
everything is completely open we have
some people from jboss red hat and we
have contributors from anywhere and then
perhaps you you know if you're looking
for a nice project to occupy a few hours
then this is this is one of those it's
important when you're contributing to
open source to to have fun so that's
what we try to do you know make it
painless for people to contribute as
much as possible so we use the best
tools for the job we have also it's you
know contributing to certain language
might sign sounds something like really
hard but it's not rocket science we have
many small components that people can
make it quick difference in you know we
have the type checker we have the JVM
combatir the Chava script compiler we
have the Eclipse IDE we have a web ID
where you can try salon code online you
can try it it's pretty nice runs in your
browser we have heard which is play
application we have you know the module
system tools to generate HTML the common
line if you know there's a lot of
different types of things that you can
do in there the way we have a real you
know real spec it's not just a bunch of
documentation prudence that we call a
spec it's an actual spec we also have
documentation that is you know more
readable but now now the Greek now we
don't have the Greek to do the proof
so they seem to have what I'm sorry well
that's that's that that's a ok so they
say that that's not really true because
we actually have a few academics that
worked on the type system and that did
verify that its sound you know sir now I
only made the joke about the Greek that
yeah all right no no it's not no we do
care that the type system is sound and
it is and you know it's just a Greek we
don't care about so let's see where
we're at so we have five mile stones
until we reach version 1 mass times 1
and 2 are done by sounds 3 is done as
well we have a lot of code already
running a lot of stuff already put in
those milestones and we have the fourth
milestone which should arrive within a
few weeks yeah probably 2-3 weeks where
we have again a lots of new features and
the milestone five will be the final
version before version 1 so in that one
we will get all the goodies and then the
red language will be ready to ship if
you want to find more information we
have a website where you can find the
blog introduction to our reference you
can find all the downloads for eclipse
or the common line distribution the API
heard of course which is also online and
all the source code is on github so you
can you can hack into it all the issues
our issue tracker are also open and the
discussions are held on public mailing
list so whenever you know if there's
something that you think we should
change in the language or something that
you like or dislike and don't hesitate
to bring it up and and that's it yes but
if you have any questions just with all
that back to the you know we're talking
about the proof of the type system that
that actually shows the variety of
contribution you can make so some people
actually don't run ceylan or write some
code write this for example rod state
which is an academic that actually
worked on the on the type system and you
know discuss that at length some other
person might work on her which is made
in java at least at least today so has
nothing to do with salon we've got
people contributing dogs we have of
course people writing modules or right
you know walking on the compiler so
there's you know you do GRT of things to
do and and there is the SDK of course as
well yes which is only so long coat yes
yes yes we haven't the question is is
the JavaScript back-end already running
yeah we the JVM and the javascript
compilers are both at the same level of
completion so whatever you can do in one
you can do in the other and if you go
and try that salon blanket or you will
have a web ID where you have nice color
completion and come and even a command
completion method attribute competition
and have a dogs on everything so you can
you can actually run the salon code
directly in your browser yes
right so the question is what's the UI
that we have in our SDK we don't have
the UI yet done in the SDK this is one
bit that we didn't finish yet and the
other question was do we need to depend
on the SDK and the JDK know the idea is
that the SDK will have that and we'll
have something based on either swing or
Java fix and that's what we want you to
depend on because if you want to then
run it on your browser depending on the
JDK it doesn't make any sense because
it's not there now the the SDK module
that gives you the UI then can depend on
something but it could be implemented by
on the JVM by depending on swing and on
javascript by depending on a HTML what's
it called yeah canvas right generally
speaking that that's a huge undertaking
to try and say let's go on Rida SDK so
the strategy is going to initially Rob
you know some of the library that are
already available in Java which of
course depend on the SDK what of course
those won't be able to won't be
available as you know in JavaScript but
the go down the road is to rewrite you
know more and more of it insulin a bit
like back in the Java day you know we
were we had like you know one hundred
percent Java code versus pure Java like
some polymer and see some other part
that we're in a in Java so we you know
that's going to take a while but that's
that's a strike for instance collections
that are in the SDK that they're not
very complete yet but they are not
wrapping the JDK collections they're
written in in one hundred percent salon
which means that you can also use them
in JavaScript which is pretty cool all
the question yes yes we so the question
is can we extend a Java class yes we're
fully interoperable with Chavez you can
extend java classes you can call java
classes you can even depend on java
modules that are actually maven
artifacts so we would resolve it from
the maven repo and let you touch it
right so the question is that do we
support cyclic dependencies between Java
and salon in the IDE and the answer is
not yet so we in the IDE you can already
have some Java code and call it from
salon code but having cyclic references
where you call some word you depend on
the Java class and the Java class
depends on the salon class this is
something we will do for the mass on
five yesterday that should lead just one
way if you if from salam you depend on
the java class that you're that sits
next to it that works yes now and the
beauty of having a murderer is so yeah
the question is that is the sdk going to
be complete for salon one and the answer
is no and that's the beauty of having a
mother or SDK from the start it's that
you we don't need to you know we can
ship version one with the nez DK that is
not finished and then as as it appears
as it matures then you only need to
update your module dependencies and you
will get the new version you don't need
to wait for Salon version 2 to get the
the newest and greatest version of salon
dotnet yes UK the question is can we
call overloaded Java methods and the
answer is yes any other question ok so
the question is any real world usage the
you know if this thing is not final yet
right we're at milestone they're just
ready and why is he actually one lucky
know if you're asking me if it's the
right time now to write to use salon in
production then the answer is no that
would be crazy right so so no let's wait
until solani is version 1 and then we
can talk but but we do have a lot of
code already in the SDK so we do have a
lot of usage and and that it's looking
pretty good is it the right time to
write a module to get a feel
salon and you know contribute to the
what would become the sdk the answer is
yes that the language of the kampala are
at a very mature level so if you have a
few hours of spare time that's
definitely the right time to go and have
them it's probably the best time as well
because we're not a version one yet so
if you find something that you think we
should really change you know that it's
still time to try to convince us give
another language level yep yes so the
question is can we have can we make the
distinction between an array of non nil
strings and an array of nillable strings
optional strings if i recall correctly
we we can but i think the interface of
array is defined in such a way that we
don't that that getting items from the
array can return nil anyways if you hit
outside of the balance so it's not going
to help you a lot so you're rather than
throwing an illegal array index
exception but but if you write your own
custom array that we would never have
this kind of problem then yes you can
differentiate the two use case
now that I don't think that's the exact
question but but if yes we can put
question marks anywhere and it's just an
alias for or nothing see you yeah on by
the way we have generics I don't think
we showed them that we have a simpler I
mean a more natural and understandable
version of generics that Java I mean the
question is how do we deal with variants
that's a good question because we in
Java you deal with variants at the call
site where you define wild cards and
then you say extends or super and and
that's something that is usually
confusing to two people so what we did
is that we moved the variance to the
decoration side of the parameters where
you say I'm have a type map that is
parameterized on key and value and you
can say that key is an in parameter so
it has to be contra variant or it's an
out parameter it has to be covariant so
it's the variance is done where you
define the type and not where you use it
which makes it for a lot simpler usage
yes
call sideburns yeah we did there's a lot
of things about Java generics that were
not good ideas but you know made sense
because of backwards compatibility
issues other way a big disclaimer like
Java right yeah we obviously we love to
other you know all of the reasons which
made Java so cool in 95 still stand
today you know things like trying to
make it readable trying to limit the
number of things you can do in the
language and and the number of things
you can do wrong you know this something
that we're heavily inspired by and and
to get back to generics like we will
have refi generates in salon as well but
the question is how do we do refi
generates at the byte code level and and
and the other question is well how do we
do mixings at the byte code level how do
we do closures at the byte code level
you know there's you come so you trick
it but we got pretty good support for
interoperability between the java
generics and the cell on your ex-wife
yes
alright so so for interoperability with
Java which requires call side variance
then we are discussing now whether we do
it by magic you know where the compiler
will just guess what you are trying to
do by the way the question only happens
with inheritance so whenever you're
inheriting an interface that has
constraints of call site variance then
that happens but the compiler can get
you know it looks at the the the
signatures and just generates compatible
signatures you don't even have to see it
but it's a bit of black magic so we're
also thinking of adding annotations you
know compiler we have annotation so we
can annotate anything we could let you
annotate it the type at the call site
and say that well the JavaScript
compiler will ignore this but the JVM
Kabbalah will generate the proper wild
card so that the signature matches but
you know this is something that you
don't need in salon you only need it for
interrupt so we're trying to make it as
you know as easy as possible but also
not pollute the type system for you know
if you're not using it for interrupt you
don't need to pull you the type system
for that let's call it a day thank you
very much for all the questions that are
actually very interesting yeah very good
questions today thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
