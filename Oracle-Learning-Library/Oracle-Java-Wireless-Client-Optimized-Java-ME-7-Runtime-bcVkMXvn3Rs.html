started pleasure to have you all here in
the room with us my name is rana mitrani
and joining me here for the session is
fouled Petra shiancoe both of us are a
part of the product team for Oracle Java
wireless client which was Oracle's Java
any implementation for the mobile market
I manage this product and fowl is the
lead for the vm which forms the
foundation of this product so that being
said I would like to with a quick show
of hands try and understand how many of
you heard about this product before how
many of you are developers so that I can
tailor my discussion are we can focus on
the talk accordingly so is there anybody
in the room who has heard about or
played with Oracle Java wireless kind in
the past ok and yourself as a developer
or as an oem ok great so that helps me
understand and get a better context of
where everybody in the room is coming
from so let us get started here the
clicker doesn't seem to work I can stand
there so through the course of the next
hour i would first give an overview of
the product how it fares in the market
what's the install base like and what
really are the highlighting features of
this product then we get into the
details of some of the differentiating
functionality of oj w see and what i
mean by saying differentiating is there
are other Java ME implementations in the
market but what differentiates oh JW see
or what are the unique features over and
beyond the standard Java ME features
which makes it lucrative for developers
we'll talk about those and then I would
end with some discussion on the tools
that support development on this
implementation and why it's better to be
using those tools than others and an
overview of the kind of platforms on
which we have the audio WC install base
out there today so with that let's talk
about what not just in terms of oj WC
but beyond that in terms of the holistic
product portfolio of Java ME does Oracle
have at the ecosystem level Oracle's
towards the Java ME platform and which
includes 29g SRS with a wide coverage of
the device specific functionality or for
developers it means the API is for
getting deep access to the device
hardware and as you all are aware just
like for java SE for Java ME as well we
follow an open development process and
the security model that we have for Java
ME is the same that's inherited from se
as well so those are the key points that
I would highlight as the definition of
the Java ME platform that Oracle leads
in the community and the products level
we have an implementation or the product
Oracle Java wireless client which
actually runs on the devices and these
devices could range anywhere from the
low end future phones to mid or high-end
feature phones and nothing limits them
from using on smartphones as well but
that is just not the focus of this
product at this point in time and we
will talk about the performance of
Oracle Java wireless kind particularly
the performance of the vm as we get into
the specifics of the features and the
kind of devices that we are targeting as
I said anywhere from the low end to
medium high end feature phones which is
like I'm seven am-9 based devices and
footprint varies based on the JSE's that
you would want to pick to make a part of
the stack that has to be deployed on the
devices so that really depends on the
OEMs so say you are LG and you are
looking at
applying audio WC on the lower end
devices which are very constrained
resources and you do not have more than
1mb to allocate for Java heap or for the
application platform you can pick and
choose the jss which are important and
you can deploy that mini h or set of oj
WC on the device and if you are porting
Oh jwc on a higher end device you can
take the complete set and towards the
complete set we can support as many as
the 29 g SRS that i said are a part of
the java any platform today on the other
side when it comes to application
development we have tools such as Java
ME SDK and fluid which is what we
recommend be used for application
development for owc based devices and
the primary reason for that is Java ME
SDKs emulator is based on the same code
base as Oracle Java wireless client
which means if you are trying to run
applications in that emulator you can
expect the same application behavior and
performance as you would expect or as
you would get on the real devices so
while you might not have the actual
device to play with before it gets out
in the market but before that if you are
using Java ME SDK to do application
development you can expect similar
behavior when it comes to commercial
deployment of those applications and
Luet applications perform much better on
oh JW see because of some performance
optimizations that we have done in terms
of the UI scaling rotation and other
features which help you get a better
behavior on audio WC then on Eddie or
any other Java any implementation so
while the eluate application itself
might not require any change it would be
the same ap is but you can expect better
performance better experience so some
more details about Oracle Java wireless
client on one hand I'm claiming that it
has differentiating functionality we are
continuing to innovate on the other hand
I would want to talk about the proven
track record that we have in terms of
the handset types we
deployed this on over 250 different
device types and which roughly
translates to over 100 million devices
just in terms of the binaries shipped
out from Oracle but say if you are an
oem like LG or samsung or nokia and you
would want to do reporting yourself you
would get this source from oracle and
you would want to and you can put it on
any number of devices and device models
that you would want to and if i were to
take that into account practically it
translates to all the Java ME based
devices on the planet today the entire
install base of over three billion
devices that we talked about so that's
about the history the install base of
the product and in one statement if I
were to say I'm just saying that this is
a pervasive product pervasive product
beat in the form of the binary ship from
Oracle or the binary shipped by various
OEMs who base those binaries on the
source ship by Oracle across all of
those devices through the
differentiating functionality that I
talked about at the beginning that we
offer for developers to write a novel
applications or to be able to leverage
the deep device hardware we are able to
enable smartphone-like experience on
feature phones and what that means is
you might not have a device which is as
expensive as six hundred dollars but it
might have all that functionality such
as support for gestures support for
touch interfaces and sensors such as
accelerometer or compass and if you were
to write applications you would want
access to all of those features and that
is what is enabled through this platform
and I would actually encourage you to
visit the Java ME mobile booth in the
demo grounds where we have some of the
devices that you can look at which are
not really smart phones these are entry
to mid-range feature phones and you can
see the kind of applications that run on
those devices so the bottom line here
being it's not
necessary that you have to target
smartphones for writing cool
applications that the end users would
want to use in fact for smartphones may
be reviled west for applications is over
with 25 billion downloads for just
iphone applications alone and I don't
know how much more for Android
applications but if you were to look at
the kind of applications that you can
target for the devices which are much
higher in volume than smartphones and
which might not have as much content
today then you are looking at platforms
like Oracle Java and s client which can
enable smartphone like application
experience on those devices then in
terms of the API is that you have access
to other than the Oracle differentiating
features which we would talk about what
those api's are over and beyond the
standard Java ME api's you have access
to the standard Java any platform ap
eyes which are implemented as a part of
the ogio WC stack and the stack conforms
to CLD c 1 dot 1 and mid p 2 dot 1 along
with the set of other higher level jsr
s4 device functionality and lastly I
talked about Java ME SDK and Luet which
offers you a complete tool chain for
writing applications for targeting audio
WC based devices and again reiterating
it's not just oh JW see based devices
that you could target with tools such as
mesg k and lowered but you can expect
better performance or you can expect
similar behavior as on the actual
devices because of the underlying code
bases being the same I mentioned earlier
about the kind of devices in the market
on which owc device is installed so I
provided some numbers about the devices
on which Oracle's binaries are deployed
and some devices on which OEMs binary
themselves are deployed and if i were to
enlist
all of those on one slide of course I
could not have and I could have run out
of the slide deck itself if I were to
list all of those but here is a snapshot
just to highlight that we have a diverse
set of devices out there different form
factors different screen sizes different
kind of functionality as you look on the
devices some with full keyboard some
with just a touch interface and this is
not a complete list of OEMs but a subset
of the OEMs who have deployed this
runtime on their devices this is to
highlight that top 9 out of top 10 OEMs
have embraced or jwc and have it
deployed on their devices in the market
just a snapshot again for information
and here is the architecture diagram to
call it so or the software stack as it
looks to quickly explain it at the
bottom most layer you would see the
mobile device operating system which
could be say an open OS like Drew and P
or it could be an artist a proprietary
operating system for from an oem but
that is not what we really care for if
we were to Porto jwc on that device OS
and the reason for that is the coating
layer that we have which goes out as a
part of the oj WC stack and the sporting
layer enables easy porting with reduced
costs and time to market to get the
stack on the devices and hence also to
say that in terms of the device hardware
and the underlying OS we really are
agnostic we can put this stack on any
kind of devices out there on the right
side you see the tools that I mentioned
for doing development and debugging or
emulation of the applications and this
big block here which is titled runtime
environment this is the actual product
stack which includes the CL dch I
implementation the underlying vm mid pd
profile for mobile AP is with
is the very basic required set as per
the standards accepted in the mobile
industry and the higher level optional
ap is for functionality such as payment
or location or other sensor api's or
some things that will help you enable
other kinds of use cases for your
applications and at the very top this
horizontal bar reflects operator
extensions and what that means is in
addition to the API is that we support
out of the box 40 jwc we also enable
plugging in additional extensions which
operators say AT&amp;amp;T or water phone or any
other operator out there might require
as a part of enabling specific
functionality from their network so
those api's also can be plugged in on
top of the standard oh JW seastack
bottom line this is a highly portable
stack complete in terms of the
functionality that you would need to
write rich applications complemented by
a good set of tools for doing debugging
and deployment of your applications and
on top if there are specific API is that
have to be implemented for the
specifications for a network or for a
device those could easily be implemented
on top of this because of the modularity
of the architecture here so some points
about why we claim that Oracle Java
wireless client is a differentiated Java
ME implementation because as I said
earlier there are other Java ME
implementations out there on devices
like as a developer maybe you would not
get to know what the underlying Java ME
implementation is whether it's deployed
by IBM or by applix or by somebody else
but it's at the end when you run your
applications how those applications
perform or what kind of API is get
exposed to you is what will matter to
you as a developer and that's what I'm
trying to highlight here as
what differentiates this from the other
implementations first and foremost is
the Oracle mobile developer ap ice these
are API is that we support over and
beyond the standard API is in the jsr s
and they help you enable novel
application use cases like let me give
you an example say if you were to write
an application which performs in a
certain way based on your location based
on the location of the end user and the
end user did not want to consume data
over operators network was that feasible
otherwise if we do not support an om da
Oracle mobile developer API which would
enable providing the cell location
information based on cell ID or based on
imei rather than using data over the
operators network perhaps not but
because we provide this API we do the
underlying grunt work as a part of the
implementation for that API it becomes
fairly simple for a developer to enable
that use case through his or her
application similarly there are other
such use cases that we will talk about
when we talk the specifics of the Oracle
mobile developer AP ice but the idea
here is this helps right additional
functionality or helps build additional
functionality on top of the standard
functionality that you can get for your
applications using the standard GS ours
next is network AP ice which provide
additional intelligence to applications
by being able to access data from
operators network so there is a lot of
information which sits in the operators
Network which today is all unused if
it's not exposed to developers or if
it's not exposed in a certain way that
could be used for the end users like
what kind of purchasing does an end user
do on this phone what kind of websites
does this user visit or what are the
kind of different functions that this
user exploits on the device and if this
kind of information could be made
available or this kind of intelligence
could be built in into a
an application that can add more value
on top of the application behavior then
this is something that would help
benefit the end-user the operator who
could monetize from these assets and
also fraud the developer who could help
write some differentiated applications
that he could monetize from so that's
about network AP ice again this requires
some support in terms of the back-end
infrastructure from the operator but
when it comes to the functionality in
the client we have it available in the
form of network AP ice next is a content
management api's or as we call them
application management system ems api's
these enable getting access to the EMS
of the device or it provides some api is
for handling the content on the device
or the content which is transferred two
and four from the application in a much
better way in a much more intelligent
way talk about all of these in detail in
a few minutes but just to complete the
overview the description for the
differentiated functionality is not
complete if I do not talk about the
highly optimized cldc h AI
implementation that we have and the vm
performance for which will provide some
benchmarking numbers in a bit but this
is another reason why applications are
more performant or you can expect better
behavior of applications running on top
of oj WC with that i would in my power
to go into the details of each of these
specific AP is and the differentiating
functionality for odbc 11 yeah now it
works so my name is Paolo I'm part of co
DC HIV m team and well II so I'm based
in santa clara but i moved here from
Russia so the most of all
is based in Russia we are working on
standard api's for for mobile and
embedded and also non-standard
extensions so Oracle mobile developer ap
is a set of non-standard extensions to
support and to provide additional
services and additional functionality
which is the main specific or service
provider specific and which may be
available for application developers for
example support of additional payments
functionality support for web web
services available through the provider
networks access to local application
would not not only local but also data
start on the unliganded cloud or in the
service provider storages for example
personal data of of the users network
API so I will cover them in a bit more
details later a location-based services
in some case our devices are very
limited and we want to extend and
provide additional functionality through
or through the service providers just
one just want to add we our platform is
running on a wide variety of devices
from really small and by the two most
powerful mobile devices the vm also runs
as an emulation platform for application
developers as a part of sdk as we know
mentioned we run in the same bits and we
have the same behavior across the across
different platforms and in some cases we
are trying to extend on the platform
capabilities from system level like for
example if you have only one native
threat one process allowed by the OS we
are trying to scale and support mode
multitasking on top of
for with in 1811 native process also
your phone OS is like in native resource
management capabilities we are providing
it on the vm level in our protein level
and here we are talking about functional
extensions for application developers
it's not per stack extension some of
them are standard some of them are not
so this one on standard ones so these
are areas you you can see the list of
various extensions we provide with omd
it's multimedia multiple services for
example audio video streaming and
overlays on top of video playback
location-based services for enabling
this functionality for devices with no
no gps hardware on board you I
extensions to support web view and
additional data attributes device and
application access well here we are
talking about connectivity functionality
and system system properties access to
see system properties and also well wide
variety of other extent one of other
extensions so network KP is allowed to
enable missing functionality through
accessing them them on the on the web um
we are we exposing rest interface to
application developers and so the
current implementation is based on GSM a
one API 220 spec implementation an
example of of the CPI is might be in an
app that requires the current device
location through something request to in
operator it receives its location and
does for example displays it down on the
map
I Brady knows the device location by
cell i do by in law other means scanning
the Wi-Fi access to by five points so
here is the list of my OT which which is
covered by the CPI is its payment voice
call control data connectivity profile
and device capabilities and here is the
link which fold which should show that
details on this API so you can find them
also on GSM a lot that Khan website so
we implement web payment ap is which
includes gsma one payment functionality
we also support authentication
mechanisms of up two of two the 0 so
here are the examples of OMG enabled use
cases you can mention control install
about applications on the device barcode
scanning and rendering sup subtitles
overlays over on top of the video
playback instant messager invoking some
location-based services with some
parameters and while launching the
browser email browser with additional
parameters so it's so available
selecting network network channels and
multiple location-based services so they
are all available through our
non-standard non-standard packages you
can see the names on the right column so
here are a few samples of how how it
works and how app developers can access
this dish note services for multimedia
well this is an example you obtain
extended video can control object and
you can request for for frame with some
parameters we can read assist extended
system properties well not the standard
and non-standard you can control the net
access points and treat and excesses
properties and then work services and
applications from your app and here is
the time for for some demos and I would
ask you not to help me them um a messy
case so don't talk about what you're
trying to highlight
so basically msep is allowed to to
explode to provide the MS capabilities
to your applications ms is an
application management system it allows
to refer stowed provides and supports
application lifecycle with all its
states and it lost to manage
applications install update manage the
state won't stop so ms basically handles
events the one system I want sending
sent to and from the platform to the
application sent from app to app okay so
this probably was let's try to try not
is lets probably move further we we can
we will try to to show the demos at the
end okay so content management API
expose pluggable content discovery
mainly applications and services and
traditional libraries installed on the
platform also it allows to to access
well deccan services and content stores
which is which which is provided by the
service source provider and it allows to
prefer app developers to manage content
as a managed installed an update start
and stop locations and services on the
device so here are some performance
metrics we used some standard our
benchmarks we are constantly measuring
the vm for the vm performance and we
provide compelling performance to other
JVMs on this in this space in some cases
are all there is a trade-off between
people are performance and footprint we
we provide flexible way to tune the vm
for both footprint and performance we
are optimized for all the arm flavors
starting from arm 72 cortex a8 course
and now we we support cortex and cortex
m3 m4 also we run on x86 hardware the vm
itself equals above the draw very very
small dependencies of the vm on the
underlying operating system so we can
basically can run on bare metal
the only seen is needed for for our
studies c++ compiler and fuel system
system calls this is for permit pa by
Rho vm for libraries world in the room
there are more requirements so these are
few features we've recently provided in
the vm one less junkie hip it allows to
to efficiently support limited operating
systems with no virtual memory mapping
functionality so we can dynamically
extend the Java hip size by request
constantly requesting and releasing
chunks of native memory and we map the
Java hip to this separate chunks native
Native memory so this is an optional
feature and the last cover more
platforms also we provide it extended
CPU profiling and memory tracing so this
functionality well loss well in one of
the first application is an emulation
environment for application developers
to tune to tune their applications and
services to opt on this platform
extended CPU profiling allows is well is
optimized and allows to run this
functionality on very limited systems
with a small network than 10-percent
with a limited memory we basically
decouple functionality and move heavy
weight calculations from the device to
to the host to the developers developer
machine and memory tracing allows to
attract all the memory statistics
locations object-type sizes and so on in
real time so you can find out and
optimize your app for
applications for memory consumptions
find memory leaks and so on so with that
I'm passing the mic to Victorino thanks
Robin and I'm sorry we could not play
the videos here on this laptop and in
the meantime I quickly tested them on my
laptop they're still functional and
hopefully as I conclude talking we
should be able to play those videos if
my friend back there can help me put the
laptop up here on the big screen so
after having heard power will talk about
the differentiating features which a
developer could leverage in with an
objective of creating differentiated
applications or differentiated use cases
that those applications could serve let
me talk about what are the kind of
platforms on which we have deployed owc
today and that is not the end of it this
is not an exhaustive list it is just to
highlight how pervasive the platform is
or if you were to tomorrow target
reaching out to or JWC based devices you
have a whole gamut of those devices and
platforms out there for you so again
just for information not an exhaustive
list but a highlight so before talking
about the platforms here is how we
deploy uwc and I tried to give some hint
of it when I was providing an overview
of the product when I said Oracle has
deployed its binaries on over 250
different device types which roughly
translates to hundred million devices
devices installed paste or if OMS were
to do it themselves then there is a much
larger list so that kind of gives an
idea of what I was referring to as two
different modes in which oj WC could be
deployed on devices number one if you
are an OEM and you do not have special
Java expertise in-house and if you're
looking
purporting help from Oracle or one of
Oracle's partners then you get oj WC as
a turnkey implementation that means we
do the porting for you we do the device
specific optimizations and it's
available to you as a turnkey out of the
box put it on the device and your device
is ready to ship tomorrow if the
hardware cycle hardware manufacturing
cycle is all taken care of on the other
hand if you are a big o a.m. which is
what the case for LG samsung nokia and
some others is you might not necessarily
want porting done outside your
manufacturing house and which means you
might have java expertise inside and you
would want to get the source for this
product and do the device specific
optimizations yourself in which case you
get the source and do the porting and
get this implementation out on the
devices but if you choose to do so then
you are unable to get all the
differentiated features that we talked
about such as the network api is or
content management API or om das or the
specific performance tuning that we have
done in the vm and you chose to do so
because you have Java expertise in-house
deporting expertise in house in which
case you can offer your unique features
on top of the standard GS ours so that's
the key difference that I'm trying to
highlight in terms of the two deployment
options that OMS have today or the kind
of variations of oj w see that you might
find on the Java ME based devices in the
market so on the next few slides to be
precise on the next three slides I'll be
talking about the platforms on which
Oracle has done its binary deployments
and I would talk about these specific
jsr s or the completeness of the stack
that has been ported on these platforms
I would start with brew MP the
well-known open mobile platform for
lower end devices of course when you
talk about higher end devices and smart
phones all the OSS out there are open
but for lower end devices typically its
proprietary oasis from the manufacturers
as we
them are tosses but brew MP stands out
in terms of being open to third-party
developers and on this platform we have
a pre-integrated stack so if a device
manufacturer were to come and ask for
porting o jwc on blue MP devices to be
shipped in the market tomorrow then it
could be quickly done with reduced time
and cost to market and the
implementation scope varies and can go
all the way up to all the jsr supported
in MSA and we do both sbm as well as nvm
implementations for our vm we've
supported different form factors for the
different kinds of devices some listed
here as you can see all of these are
blue MP based devices and there are also
listed some success stories from the
operators across the globe or some of
the commercialized Qualcomm's chipset on
which the oj WC on blue MP platform is
deployed today and at the very end
nothing that I would read myself but
just to highlight that there is
integration there is collaboration at
the two companies level the two platform
providers level with Oracle and Qualcomm
standing behind getting oj WC on blue MP
based devices so that's one of the
platforms the next one I would highlight
is the media tech platform which is like
the king of the platforms the king of
the chipsets for the lower end devices
if you talk about the market share media
tech has close to sixty percent of
market share for the chipsets used on
the lower end feature phones to
mid-range feature phone devices and we
have a pre-integrated stack in terms of
a reference implementation for some of
the chipsets for media tech and these
chipsets are listed here the
implementation scope is relatively lower
than that for blue MP given that
mediatek chipsets are targeted for lower
end devices we are not looking at a
complete MSA stack
to be available on those devices but in
which case we have a smaller subset of
GSR switch is JT WI which has been
ported and is available of the chef's
today again some success stories in
terms of the operators and the OEMs who
have deployed this stack and lastly
again as I said this is not an
exhaustive list but last for this
sharing of success stories here that I'm
talking about the platforms that are
supported by oh JW see the third one
here is the td-scdma platform for the
China market and then you talk about
td-scdma platform you are roughly
talking about ninety percent of devices
in the China market and I'm not saying
that ninety percent of the China market
has oj WC binaries shipped from Oracle a
good percentage of those have and if OMS
were to port o JW see themselves on
devices to be used in the China market
then this has already been proven those
devices are already in the market and
have been functioning well with
application developers targeting their
applications and reaching out to the end
users so when we talk about applications
here is just a snapshot of what kind of
applications are talking about that
could be targeted on these devices map
music stock mail or the others listed
here we are talking about a fairly wide
set of applications or in other words
enabling rich set of functionality in
your end applications and this stack for
the td-scdma platform is already pre
integrated with spread term and lead
core like platforms as well in addition
to the media tech which I highlighted on
the previous slide so with these three
top chipset vendors MediaTek spreadtrum
and lead core we are talking about
reaching out to about ninety percent of
the market in China and this brings me
to the last part of
this session here where I would want to
talk about the integrated tool chain I
referred to it in the beginning with
Java ME SDK and lo it but let's take a
closer look at how it's integrated with
Oracle Java wireless client for those of
you who are familiar with Java ME SDK it
won't come as a news if I say that Java
ME SDK provides device emulation a
development environment as a part of
NetBeans are now are with the latest
release of Java any SDK we also have an
eclipse plugin so if developers choose
to work with eclipse as the development
environment you can use Java ME SDK with
eclipse as well and that being said Java
ME SDK provides a complete environment
from development right to the emulation
and with the help of on-device debugging
and tooling functionality now available
I can say that the debugging and
deployment all the way up to the device
and Java ME SDK emulator is built on the
same code as oj WC so whatever jsr is
that we talked about whatever
functionality that we talked about which
differentiates owc is also supported if
you were to leverage that functionality
while doing development with Java ME SDK
Java me sdk has a modular architecture
which means if tomorrow you come and
report that there is an issue that needs
to be fixed and the next release of Java
ME SDK is not going out for another six
months we can always provide that fixed
and provide a plug-in which can be
deployed through an update Center
functionality which is available as of
the end of last year as a part of mes
decayed 3 dot 0 dot 5 release and the
future versions and in the right box
here in addition to the overview that I
just provided for the Java ME SDK
tooling environment there are some
highlights of last couple releases the
last 13 dot 0 dot 5 in November of
2011 and three dot 2 which got rolled
out just last week to run through this
list we are talking about support for
Oracle mobile developer API is that we
discussed with peril we are talking
about network monitoring CPU monitoring
functionality which helps with on device
monitoring and on device debugging
functionality then we have update center
which helps us release plugins if the
functionality has to be released
independent of the scheduled product
releases and we now also have support
for small embedded application
development so in addition to the mobile
phones if developers were to target
their Java ME applications for small
devices such as medical sensors or for
devices leveraging wireless modules or
say for devices used in home gateways or
energy meters then they could use Java
ME SDK for doing embedded application
development for those kinds of devices
as well and as much as it is important
for development and deployment of mobile
applications it's even more important
for deployment and testing of
applications on small embedded devices
to have that on-device debugging and on
device tooling functionality available
as a part of your development
environment and that is what java any
sdk supports so this is enough of
talking about Java ME SDK as a toolset
for developers but the highlight here in
the context of oj WC being if you have
an audio WC based device and if you are
using Java ME SDK as your development
environment you are very sure not to
have to fix any issues with your
application or very about the final user
experience if you have used this kind of
a tooling environment for doing
application development at the bottom
here are some screenshots of the
functionality available through Java ME
SDK I would encourage you to visit the
Java ME boot in the demo grounds to
actually experience this functionality
live and if
you are interested in playing with a
reference board as well which is used in
small embedded devices a kile board
based on ARM Cortex chipset then you are
very welcome to play with that board at
the booth next 20 cards is lewitt which
stands for lightweight UI toolkit it's a
a UI library built on top of canvas and
it's available in the open community
it's all open sourced and it helps you
create Richard interfaces richer it gets
richer functionality for your Java ME
applications over and beyond what you
can leverage through LCD you I in mid p
and this runs on any cldc one not one
mid p 2 dot 0 based device but because
of some of the performance optimizations
that are hinted to earlier it helps you
get better behavior for LeWitt
applications or for those richer
features animation or rotation or
graphical scaling that you might have
implemented in your application you can
have a better experience on oj WC based
devices just like for java me sdk in the
right side box here there are some
highlights in terms of features
delivered in the last couple releases of
fluids fluid 1 dot 5 was released late
last year in 2011 you can take a look at
it and the previous releases as well as
I said this is all available in the open
community on lower dot dev java.net if
i'm not mistaken but even if you look up
on LeWitt you'll get to this website and
you can find the source code and all the
functionality that's available at your
fingertips to enable better looking
applications and target smartphone like
experience for lower end devices in
summary Oracle Java wireless client this
implementation for Java ME from Oracle
offers unique advantages for developers
by number one enabling you to write
smartphone-like applications number
to extending superior graphical and REM
performance which means better end user
satisfaction better and user
applications number three offering
functionality to leverage assets from
operators network or from the deep
device hardware as I mentioned or as
Powell talked about content management
AP ice and lastly by promising behavior
and experience on the actual devices the
same as you would see in a development
environment if you were using tools such
as Java ME SDK and we talked enough
about how top OEMs and top operators
have deployed Oh gwc on their devices or
in their networks which translates to
saying if you were to go venture out to
write applications targeting ogio WC as
your app platform you will find plenty
of commercial devices out there not
plenty but a good set a really pervasive
platform out there for targeting your
applications here are some additional
resources if what we talked about is
something worth investigating further
and if you would like to get additional
information about the underlying vm in
ocho WC which is cldc so that's the top
session listed here the other two which
talk about the standard Java ME features
and functionality but that is something
which is useful in the context of OG owc
as well given that we talked about how
this implements standard Java ME jsr and
on the web these are the pointers for OG
owc and for the associated tooling if
you were to look for more information
and with that before I open up to Q&amp;amp;A I
would check if I'm able to play the
videos here and show some of the demos
that would help me substantiate the fact
that something which we could not have
done using the standard
our API is is now enabled through
Oracle's unique mobile developer api's
so back there oh let me go ask him to
switch the monitor
so you while we are setting up the hard
work and if you have any questions
please feel free to ask now if the
cheaper art event which will not allow
you to deploy the complete mobile sorry
elements tax that we have today but a
smaller subset of that in the future of
the future releases they would be
looking at an even cheaper or references
both in devices as well so what you have
available today as an example in
background light of device like a boat
like in bed and we have a demo in one of
peoples in the level ground as well it
shows a subset of the any immediate
product just that we just released that
can be run on this endless based device
so it's a carriage a robo which on which
we have the price countless hours and
you are able to remotely control to a
remote controller this Java is empowered
really yeah so basically returning back
to a question I will address this one so
the reason why we choose where we've
chosen the cardboard is that it has
pretty big amount of external RAM and
ROM which allows us to do on-device
debugging and profiling while developing
the second for developers to relate and
try this platform on real product real
product devices will have much less
memory we are targeting devices with so
cortex-m based devices the devices
cortex m3 for the maximum amount of RAM
until now is 200 k so that there is one
being released that has 256 of K of RAM
on the on board but we are targeting
much less so that the subset of of the
port of this prototype board the Trina
mentioned as I seal this HIV m which is
so this you wanted one compliant and has
a subset about just a few few few
classes and methods implemented for
device access to to read some sensor
data and which has several sensors on
board well I change it just means it had
so it's running within 32 k of Rome
totally it includes OS drivers native
code and Java so foot for Java hip we we
give 88 k 8 k from Rome is I believe
wrong with about two to three hundred K
but Ramos less expensive on this board
so we are pretty pretty we can be pretty
small so the question on the back
about the high water per person per
memory profiling and even providing DJ
ian had to push all the data to send
things off to the FDA cell it's not like
that's a problem for providing that's
assessing and the other thing is for
high board this is the aec channels
devices no agency comes uninvited they
are the opposite of paper all inclusive
back stitches and like for these for
like Hannibal if you are to loot liya
right right so dressing are you first
question your first concern is if I
understand it correctly so the problem
is that these devices have very limited
network capabilities and you cannot
transfer all the data to the host or
what what's the problem and not the
devices are available
formation so it is only like 15 what lie
to you that I use like some more iphone
okay okay thank you so let's let's
probably discuss the flight because so
basically we are implementing now we are
working on the architecture that will
allow you to to do this debugging and
profiling on on I did one on a device
that has some well a channel or service
a service channel or whatever so we
implemented trying to abstract the data
and all the logics from the the channel
on the protocol it's it's based on so we
can properly address your if you have
any example in this specific example we
can consider them
so I will try to answer very carefully
we are reusing the experience in our
small embedded solutions and yeah we are
looking at the api's we are looking at
the optimizations and Toulon support
shall we they're trying to reuse it so
let me try to add to that this doesn't
mean that we would recommend one
solution over another if somebody were
to choose that capable implementation
available in the form of Scott available
today they could do that however if
somebody is used to writing applications
in an environment like 40 jwc we have
this new ME embedded product based on
the same code base and providing same
experience for applications as oj WC
does of course this is a subset of OT
owc but this is offering similar
experience and offering similar api's
for developers as well so these are two
alternate forms which would be available
both capable both to be chosen based on
the end users are the device
manufacturers desired functionality and
for developer it's like whatever is
available on the devices as the
implementation you would want to write
leveraging the API is for those
implementations right so we are offering
multiple solutions based on the actual
market or device requirements any other
questions oh thank you very much for
these questions and let's talk a fly
like to so any other questions ok thank
you
we are actually at the top of the hour
so if you could pick just one of those
stem adventure yes so this is the demo
showing integration with this back and
services basically so this app
demonstrate ability to to buy an app
install it on the device using this net
ms AP ice basically we select so we
browse the content on the in the h the
store we can select a nap pay for it and
download and install it on the phone
with basically this is what what's been
done here so this is this ole this is
old Joe 80s and again toten so this
functionality is targeted to really
small and limited devices and the goal
is to extend its capabilities which are
not available on the platform
so with that beautifies is top of the
hour enter welcome any questions yeah
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
