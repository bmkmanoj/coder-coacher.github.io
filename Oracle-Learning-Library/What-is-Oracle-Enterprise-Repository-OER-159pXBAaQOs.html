curriculum developer at Oracle in the
previous demo you have learned what
solar governance is in this demo I will
show you how our governance can be
implemented by using Oracle Enterprise
repository this graphic shows where our
Enterprise repository we are fit into
the solar governance framework Oh er
helps to define organization rose as
responsibilities it is mainly used in
design time and it supports runtime
governance during design time governance
we archetype to create reference
architecture and the service capability
catalogs as well as define standards
during runtime governance by working
with our Co web services manager and
Enterprise Manager we are can implement
deployment testing provisioning and
exception handling frameworks it also
enables continuous integration through
asset harvesting we are provides
enterprise water governance of assets
projects and over also initiative we are
s asset management function provides the
means to centrally manage the metadata
for any type of software asset from
business processes and web services to
patterns frameworks applications and
components it interact with runtime
components to get information on metrics
such as service reused to assist with
the design time decisions from this
central repository you can also map the
relationships and interdependencies that
connects software assets to the ZOA
anaconda the ZOA to business objectives
asset management must therefore include
two
and metrics to measure and communicate
those compliance with governance
policies and the ROI of the so
transformation effort we are also allows
organizations implement existing yo
based access control model and therefore
limit access to asset based on user role
in word we are essential to Solar
governance
let's take a closer look on how assets
are managed by oer at design time the
command line in the script based
harvester to can publish assets such as
weasels xsds web services and so on from
local or remote file systems you can
also discover and publish assets by
connecting to a host server such as ARCA
so sweet
developers consumes a framework and
other prescribed assets and use this to
implement the composing service a
typical composite implantation includes
people components along with supporting
whistle and schema files the composite
service is deployed to the ZOA
infrastructure configuration metadata
MDS host the sources of composites to
configure and run the application for
example it holds the composite xml which
is used to implement the application the
mirrors that use AR are developers
architects adi managers and business
managers developers use oer to share
reuse and engage with the developer
community architects use a yaar to
manage and optimize the enterprise
architecture managers use AR for service
management and measurement that aligned
to your business strategy this is a ARS
architecture we are is essentially a
single Java process users mainly use
web browser to work with Oh er
command-line tools and IDE are also used
for certain tasks like harvesting
database is connected for information
storage and email notifications will be
sent for changes in this repository this
is how it looks from users perspective
web console is a primary interface for
users to find and consume assets and
perform administrative tasks the asset
editor is used to administer assets and
to configure the resources that
associated with assets such as value
lists categories and relationships the
type manager controls the organization
and display of information for each
asset type as it appears in as a editor
and in the web console policies and
compliance templates a specialized asset
types that you can also configure with
the type manager the import/export two
is designed to enable the interchange of
assets and related metadata between
instances of AR besides graphic tools we
are also has command-line tools like
harvester iam utility and workflow
utilities to harvest import metrics and
customize AR workflows in summary with a
er you can configure automatically
publish an update repository content we
are provides load based visibility to
also assets this enables developers to
easily harvest locate and consumes the
assets you can graphically display and
navigate relationships and
interdependencies to simplify impact
analysis and ensure business alignment
you can assign and approve assets across
deployment test staging and production
you can also enable automatic
notification
of any changes we are provides advanced
capabilities such as Express workflows
policies contracts and more we are can
demonstrate the ROI from so ax was more
than 20 out-of-the-box reports to show
savings tracking lines and illustrates
our progress hopefully you now
understand what is our co Enterprise
repository and how it can help with
lower governance and they be her thanks
