content and experience cloud the people
you collaborate with may need to view
and work with files and various folders
in the cloud to help them do this you
can share folders or files in two ways
you can add people as folder members or
send them a link to the file or folder
you want to share right from your iPad
or iPhone just select your sharing
choice from the contextual menu next to
the item you want to share if you want
to add a member to a folder the person
you want to add must be someone who uses
Oracle documents cloud service when you
add them to the folder you choose if
they can view or download items in the
folder or if they have the rights to
contribute items or even manage other
members of the folder if someone is
already a member of a folder and you
want to send a link to a specific file
choose to share a link from the
contextual menu of the file and then
select to send an existing link there
are two types of existing member links
you can share one that downloads the
file directly when the link is clicked
provided the user has the rights to
download items from the folder and one
that opens the file in a browser when
the link is clicked this is a useful way
to encourage people to review and
discuss items online using the items
conversation if the person with whom
you're sharing the file is not a member
of the folder then you can send them a
public link this was great if you're
collaborating with someone in your
organization who doesn't have an account
on Oracle content and experience cloud
or even there outside of your
organization
when using a public link rights to view
download or contribute to the file or
folder are specified when you create the
public link you can also set the link to
expire so that a person's access is
revoked after a certain date you can
even require a passcode to use the link
so if you want to remove a person's
access you can change the passcode you
can also specify if anyone can use the
link or if they have to be a user of
Oracle content and experience cloud if
made available to anyone then the access
history records the name of the link
when it is used if only available to
registered users then they
must login and their name is registered
in the access history once a link is
created tap it to share it and if you
have an Android device things work the
same way
