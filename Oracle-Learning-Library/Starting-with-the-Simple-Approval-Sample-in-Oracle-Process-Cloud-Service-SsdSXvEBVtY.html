to point out some of the basic features
used to create this application this is
the application homepage for simple
approval the left pane represents the
application components the numbers tell
you how many of each component exists in
the application the right pane tracks
the recent activity
the process editor shows the overall
workflow for the application this is a
simple process to request approval the
process involves two worlds the process
owner and the process reviewer the
process owner starts the process by
submitting the details of the approval
request using a webform the process
reviewer approves or rejects the request
if approved the request is fulfilled if
rejected the request is sent back to the
process zone at any time I can modify
the process by dragging and dropping
additional flow elements from the
component palette to the process or
delete existing flow elements the
implementation pane is where the
configuration for each activity in the
process is defined in this application
the process starts with a webform
created using the form editor the form
editor lets you design forms to get
input from the user and present
information relevant to the workflow to
create a webform drag-and-drop controls
from the palette to the body of the form
each control has a set of properties
that define its behavior and style
when this webform was built a business
object was automatically created to
store its data additional form
operations including testing the form
and adding web form rules are available
a gateway has been used to implement the
simple approval rule gateways have two
possible outcomes the first is based on
a condition specified in the
implementation pane the second outcome
is unconditional and is followed if the
specified condition isn't met I can
validate and test the sample application
and then publish
when I test the application it's
automatically validated deploying it
lets me play the process by stepping
through each activity or test the
application and workspace to mimic the
end-user experience when I deploy the
production version to workspace I must
add my end-users to the application
roles before they can use it thank you
