to adapt and customize one of CDC's
duplicate identification services the
scenario that we're going to follow is
about a fictional company who are a
payroll provider they called paid and
they provide out sourced payroll
services for other companies now each
person each individual that they have to
pay is set up in their database as a
contact in their system as a contact and
it's the contacts the individuals that
they need to pay who they want to
deduplicate now there's a snag however
which is that the same individual could
easily work for two or more of paid
clients because the same person can be
employed by different companies and if
that's the case those aren't duplicates
as far as paid are concerned because
they have to provide to pay packets if
the same person is working for two
different companies it's only if the
same person is working for the same
company that they have a duplicate on
their hands now this means that they're
going to have to not only take into
account whether the individuals details
are the same their name their date of
birth their address and all the other
pieces of information that we use to
find duplicates but they're also going
to have to take into account whether the
company name that they work for is the
same or whether the company they work
for is the same more generally so to
achieve that we're going to have to
adapt the matching one of the matching
services now what are we going to have
to do well we'll have to change the
match rules because at the moment the
match rules don't take into account
whether an individual works for the same
company or not so we're gonna have to
make changes to the match rules but
we're also going to have to adapt the
interface is the data interfaces and the
web services
around matching and the reason for that
is that we need to bring in a new
attribute now there is an attribute in
the data interface called individual
candidates that's the the data interface
name there is a map and actually in that
individual candidates data interface
already called account name and we can
use that to pass through the name of the
company that each individual works for
but the problem with that is that it's a
lot not a very reliable field in pates
system it's a free text field and it's
got unreliable data and so as well as
passing that in they want to pass in an
account ID which is a numerical and it's
a very reliable field because it's a
primary key and they trust it it holds
unique data but in our individual
candidates data interface there is no
attributes to hold the account ID so
we're going to have to create a new
attribute and also make a change to the
web service to pass that attribute in as
well as changing the match rules to look
at the attribute and take into account
when we find duplicates so again let's
just reiterate the basic issue here that
we're trying to solve is if we have the
same person working for the same company
that is a duplicate if we have the same
person same name same address same date
of birth but they work for different
companies that is not a duplicate as far
as our scenario is concerned so let's
look at how we're going to adapt the
matching service to deal with that
so we want to adapt one of our duplicate
identification services to deal with
finding duplicates based upon not just
the individuals name and address and
date of birth but also their company ID
so how are we going to do that what a
good place to start is by looking at the
jobs within CVS so here's the edq c.d.s
project let's open it up and let's look
at the jobs node and within the jobs
node we have a batch individual matched
job and we have a real time individual
matched job now if we wanted to identify
duplicate individuals in both batch and
real time we'd have to adapt both jobs
but we'll just stick with the real time
individual match job as an example
during this video so let's open that job
and let's try and get a sense for what's
happening within the job so the job has
one phase called individual match but
within that one phase there are actually
eight linked processes now each process
is the mate it denoted by the three
yellow balls joined together so you can
see the eight processes going down here
what do they do well just to get a sense
of it we're starting with inputting the
data in this process here and then we're
standardizing the data in these two
processes then we're doing some
clustering going further down we're
preparing the data here in this process
this is where we actually do the
matching so this is the process where
the matching happens called match
individuals we'll look at that later but
then after that we prepare the results
from matching and finally in our last
process we output the results so we have
eight linked processes now how are they
linked well they're linked using data
interfaces and there are also data
interfaces for input into the first
process and output into the last process
now the symbol for the data interface
the icon you can see here so you can see
each of these processes has a data
interface on the left for inputs and on
the right for output
so what data interfaces are used well
for input into the very first process
we're using a data interface called
individual candidates and for output
from that process by using a different
data interface called combined data
preparation and we're actually using
that combined data preparation interface
for the input and the output for most of
the subsequent processes you can see in
all of these and moving down also here
as well and for the input into the match
individuals process this process where
the matching actually happens after that
things change a little bit so the output
from the match individuals process uses
a data interface called internal match
results that's also the input and output
for the match results prepare process
and it's the input for the match results
output process as well but the final
data interface in the job in that match
results output process is called
individual match okay
so we've got a number of different data
interfaces being used
and we're going to have to adapt each of
them to include an extra attribute to
call account ID all right
in fact actually we'll only go as far as
match individuals because we don't want
to output the accounts ID so we won't
have to adapt the final few data
interfaces but up to this point we'll
have to adapt each of them okay and in
fact that really means too because we've
got the combined data interface data
preparation data interface which is used
throughout apart from the the inputs to
the very first process which is
individual candidates so really just two
data interfaces we need to adapt but
we'll also have to adapt each process as
well so when we add a new attribute to a
data interface that's all well and good
but we need to make sure that the
attribute is populated
at the outset of each process it's read
into each process and that it's
populated when we write out of each
process as well so the reader and the
writer of each process must populate
that attribute so just adding the
attribute is enough we need to go into
each process and make sure it's actually
populated so it's coming in and out
there's a value coming in and out of
each process in the chain as well now
finally data interfaces I hope you
remember are really attribute templates
and they need to be mapped at the outset
of each job they need to be mapped to a
real source of data and now that could
be staged data but because this is real
time job it's actually going to be
mapped to a web service so as well as
adding the attributes to the data
interface we also need to add it to the
web service in this case that it's
mapped to and if we were dealing with
output there'll also be a web service
used for output that we need to adapt as
well but we're not doing that in this
scenario so we're gonna need to change
add an attribute to two data interfaces
and we're going to need to add an
attribute to a web service as well we're
gonna have to go into each process and
make sure that that new attribute is
populated in each process and output
from each process and then once we've
done all that we can actually go into
the match individuals process here and
that's where the match process will be
and then we'll need to adapt the match
processes rules to use our account ID
attribute that we've added okay so
that's the little challenge that we have
and next we'll look at how we're going
to go about doing that
okay well let's get our ducks in a row
by adapting the data interfaces and also
the web service first of all so the
first data interface for input there is
called individual candidates let's go
find that so in the project browser
we'll go up to the data interfaces node
and open it up and there is the
individual candidates data interface so
let's open it double click it and we
need to add a new attribute you can see
the attributes that are here already by
the way that they're the kind of things
you'd expect first name last name date
of birth various details like mobile
phone numbers and email addresses and
national insurance or tax numbers and
address details etc now we do have here
as I think I may have mentioned an
account name attribute so we can pass
through the free text account name that
this individual works for is employed by
and is paid by if you like but we said
that's unreliable it's a free text field
so what we need is an account ID field
which is going to contain this reliable
primary key which is a number so we're
going to need to create a new attribute
for that so let's do that in this
individual candidates data interface and
to do it very simply we just click the
plus button here and we type a name for
the attributes so I'll call it an addict
ID like that and this is where we put in
the data type so we'll make it a number
and we'll just move it to the bottom of
the data interface so we know where it
is and we can find it easily so that's
done we've added a new attributes to
that individual candidates data
interface now we said that that is
mapped to a web service and it's matched
using this real time individual match
mapping so we can have a look at that
mapping right click on the data
interface and go to mappings and there
it is real time individual match that's
the name of the mapping
and there is the name of the web
services matched to its maps to
individual match okay so let's find that
web service we'll go down to the web
services node so here is the individual
match web service and we're going to
need to create a new attribute there as
well for the account ID so let's do that
very similar to creating a new attribute
for the data interface itself doesn't
have to be called the same thing but
probably helpful if it is so that's done
so there's our new attribute for input
for the web service we don't need any
new attributes for output
we're not going to change the output so
that's fine that's done now the data
interface and the web service are linked
together via the mapping that we just
looked at so we're going to need to
adapt that mapping to so let's do that
so let's go into individual candidates
there right click it mappings and here
is the real time individual match
mapping and if we double click that we
can see the mapping and let's go down to
the bottom on the Left we have the web
service attributes on the right we have
the data interface attributes and at the
bottom of each you can see the new
account ID attribute we've added and we
just need to map it from one to the
other so that's saying take the value in
the account ID attribute from the web
service and pass it through to the
account ID attribute in the data
interface that's all that mapping is
doing very simple let's finish that so
that's done now that takes care of the
incoming web service and the individual
candidates data interface that it's
mapped to but after that we have the
data the combined data preparation data
interface ok and that is taking the data
all the way through our job all the way
to the match individuals process here so
we also need to add the account ID
attribute so that data interface to
let's do that now here on the left here
it is combined data preparation let's
double click it and again here we're
going to need to add and you attributes
which we'll call X ID and remember it's
gonna be a number as knit so done so in
a way that's that's kind of put all of
our ducks in a row we've got all of our
new attributes set up for our web
service and for the two data interfaces
and we've done the mapping between the
initial the web service in the initial
data interface now what we need to do is
to make sure that our processes are
actually reading in and writing out a
value for that new attribute otherwise
the attribute will be available but it
won't be populated so you know that's
not a lot of use so we need to go into
each process now okay in our job up to
the match individuals process and we
need to make sure that we're actually
populating that new account ID attribute
so let's start with input prepare here
right click it and open it and it'll
open to the process canvas and here's
the reader and it's very simply make
sure that we're going to read in that
account ID at the moment you can see
it's not selected let's select it and
now it is so that's ready into the very
first process great but we also need to
make sure we write it out there's the
writer at the other end writing to the
data pro combined data preparation data
interface and at the bottom of that data
interface we have the account ID
attribute that we added and over here on
the left and the available attributes it
should be sitting there as well there we
go let's select it for writing and let's
just map it hook it up to the account ID
attribute in the data interface okay so
done so now in the first process we have
the account ID being populated by the
reader for inputs and we also have it
being written
by the writer as well so let's just save
that and we can close that process now
so that's the first process taking care
of now we need to do the same thing in
the other processes going as far as the
match individuals process so let's go
into the next one standardized address
and let's open it and we're just going
to do the same thing basically there's
the reader let's make sure that we
select account ID for this process done
okay good
and there's the writer and again let's
just make sure that we take that account
ID attribute there and we selected for
writing like that there it is and we
actually do map it as well
okay so it's going out via the Taoiseach
interface as well as in that's the
second process done save it close it
okay and now let's do the third process
so we're just going to go through and do
these processes standardized individuals
again let's open it let's let that open
for a second thinking card there's the
data preparation interface
let's bring in account ID done and the
other end we should find a writer
there's the writer and again let's
select account ID for writing and let's
make sure that it's mapped through to
the right field there we go that's what
that one's done save that and we'll
close that okay so big process of things
that's why it's taking a little while to
to think there so next one in the line
is the cluster a real-time process let's
open it again exactly the same thing
read up let's make sure we're reading it
in account ID there we go done and the
writer let's select it for writing there
we up and let's write that out or map it
across
save that and maybe their match prepare
real-time let's open that one and again
to readers to writers here and we have
to make sure we pass this through in
both so one one will deal with what's
called the driving record and the other
will deal with the candidates so if you
like you think of that as the original
record and the ones to be to be compared
to so the easiest way to think of it
anyway we need to deal with both so
let's make sure we read it in in this
reader and also in this reader too there
we go and let's make sure that we write
it out as well in both of the writers
let's do that now so that's one writer
done let's do the other writer too so
we're just making sure this comes
through everywhere okay good close that
one up then and that should take us now
to the last process that we need to be
concerned with which is match
individuals so all we want to do is get
this account ID as far as match
individuals not further than that
because we don't want to output it but
we do want to use it for our matching so
that's something that one and let's just
again we've got two readers here we need
to make sure that they're both reading
in account ID they're released on the
first one let's select it just make sure
that's there yep good and let's do the
second one as well
okaythat's they're great and we'll save
that too so that should have made sure
that the account ID is now being
populated and passed through each of our
processes in our job as far as the match
individuals process which is the last
one where we need it so the next thing
we're going to do in just a minute is
have a look that's the match individuals
processor and have a look at how we can
change our match rules to use that new
account ID attribute before we do that
let me just mention that we haven't done
any preparation to it okay we're going
to just assume it's okay
obviously it might be that you want to
not just pass in and out but also adapt
one of your processes to prepare prepare
it somewhat before I won't do that but
I'm sure you can think about how you
might be able to do it so next we'll
look at adapting the match rules to use
the account ID attribute
let's look at adapting our match rules
then so we're still inside the match
individuals process and we can see the
match individuals process saw which is
the match processor and it's accepting
input from two readers
one called working data reader and the
other reference data reader these are
the the readers that we adapted to make
sure we were reading in a value for our
count ID earlier now one of them will
read in the driving records and the
other one will read in the candidate
records too matching okay now let's go
into the match processor itself and we
need to make sure that the match
processor inputs the account ID so let's
double click on the input sub processor
and there are the driving records
there's that's the driving records
stream in this tab and the candidate
records are in this tab so we need to
make sure for both of these that we're
actually inputting the account ID and
there it is for the driving records it's
not yet selected so obviously we need to
select it and now it is selected for
driving records let's do the same for
the candidate records let's go down and
find it it's not already selected so
we'll select it and now it's there so
we've read in the account ID into the
match process of both the driving and
the candidate records good so far now
what we want to do is to compare the
account ID between records isn't it is
it the same or not and to create
comparisons we need to first have an
identifier that links together the
account ID in the driving and candidate
records so let's go into the identify
sub processor again we won't have an
identifier for account ID yet we need to
create one
let's click the little plus to do that
so we call this identifier account ID
and remember that the attribute is a
number so we'll make the type number
there we go and we need to map it so the
account ID or the act ID field in the
driving and candidate records then we
can just do that very simply just like
this
so there is our account ID identifier
mapped to the ACT ID attributes in the
driving and candidate records let's
click ok and let's next go to the match
subprocessor so the business end of
matching really now and we'll start by
taking a look at the match rules now in
this processor there are a lot of
naturals and they're divided into groups
so let's take a look at one of those
groups this name exact group and this
has a number of naturals within it you
can see them here and each for each rule
the name must be exactly the same hence
the name of the group naming site but
the first rule is looking at whether the
name is exactly the same plus the date
of birth an email of the same similar
the next one is looking at the name
being exactly the same and the address
and the email next one is looking at the
name obviously but also the email and
phone number this one's looking at the
name and the company and the address
remember the company name isn't reliable
in our data which is why we need a count
ID and so on and if I just took a look
take a look at the next group down
standardize given name it's very similar
again it has very similar rules and
except this time we're looking at a
standardized form of the given name so
William instead of Bill for example plus
other factors in each rule now remember
what we want to achieve we want to make
sure that the account ID is the same for
any records which we're going to
identifies duplicates now one way to do
that would be to change each of these
rules in each of the groups so that they
also look at a comparison on the account
ID that would be one way to do it but we
have to make a lot of changes to a lot
of rules we'd have to add a new
comparison looking at account ID for
each of these rules and we'd have to do
it in you know each of these groups as
well and there's a lot of groups so that
would be one way to do things but
another way will be to turn the issue on
its head and say well yeah we can say
the account ID must be the same for
records to be duplicates
but we could also say if the account ID
is not the same records cannot be
duplicates and that means creating and
the elimination rule which we put near
the top of our list of rules so that's
probably what we'll do but to do any
rules at all we first need a comparison
so let's go back to the comparisons tab
let's find a new account ID identify
there it is let's add a comparison for
it now we're going to choose equals so
we're looking for an exact match
I'll call this account ID exact and you
know we're assuming that the account ID
holds reliable data it's a primary key
so hopefully that would be the case in
reality we'd probably want to do some
profiling and some investigation to make
sure it is the case but let's just
assume it for now so I won't do any
fuzzy matching on the account ID we're
just looking at is it exactly the same
one comparison account ID exact so we've
got our new comparison great now we can
go to the match rules tab now let's
create a group the first group at the
top and these groups fire in order okay
it's called eliminate matches between
candidate records so no two candidates
can match only a candidate can only
match with the driving record that's the
purpose of that let's create a new group
and we'll call our new group eliminate
if account ID is different there we go
and we'll move it so it's second from
top of our list of groups so it will
fire the rules within this in fact there
will only be one rule but they'll fire
second after the rules in this eliminate
matches between candidates the very next
thing we'll do is we'll look at the
account ID is different and if it is we
won't go any further and none of the
other match rules will fire so it will
never be a match let's create a rule
then so let's call this account ID
different
the decision will be no match and we
just find out new comparison at the
bottom here I counted the exact that has
to be false so if the account ID is not
the same then the decision is no match
and remember that rule is firing really
close to the top of our list of rules
just after the elimination if they
dealing with two candidate records so in
fact we could probably even put it right
to the top but we won't do that so what
that means is that we're actually
eliminating any pairs of records where
the account ID is not the same and if
the account that is not the same we're
not even considering whether there are a
match based upon any other factors and
that means that the account ID must be
the same in order to find a match that
should be the result of this logic let's
click OK and we can save this process
and close it and we'll close the job as
well
and in a moment I'll fire up the
real-time duplicates identification for
individuals and we'll go to the web
service tester and we'll see if it's
working okay so we want to see if our
changes to real time duplicate
identification have worked so the first
thing we need to do is to go to the
server console and let's just connect it
looks like it's not connected to the
server at the moment so I'm just
connecting up and now what we can do is
we can run the real-time process so
we're going to see the EXCI DQ C D s and
actually we're gonna start this real
time start all job here and it'll take a
little while to fire up but let me just
get it started or at least get it
beginning to go for us there we go
I've got a current tasks in a moment
we'll see a pop up now has to do some
preparation first so I'll stop recording
now and I'll start again when the real
time services are running and then we
can test our real time individual
duplicate identification and see if our
changes have worked
so back in a few moments time
so the real time services have started
you can see in the server console here's
the real time individual match service
running so let's go to the launch pad
let's start or call up the web service
tests are there and we're going to test
our changes now so we'll select the e DQ
CD s projects we'll select the
individual match service and we'll call
that service and on the left we'll have
our inputs on the right we'll see the
outputs so let's match some records
together in record one candidate we're
putting zero candidate zero means that
it's the driving record actually and
what I'm gonna do is put in some of my
own details here so just go a little bit
further down there we are and first name
I'll put in pizza last name Webster and
a little bit further down I'll also put
in my email address there we go
and finally at the bottom of the fields
for input in record one you will see our
new fields act ID account ID so it's
there that's great let's put in a value
of one two three four so that's our
first record the driving record let's
add a record that we want to match that
one against then and in our second
record actually we're going to put in
exactly the same details because we want
to find a match so here is record to
record ones just above it they're
candidate one so this is a candidate
record that we want to match against
record zero the driving record and it
will put in exactly the same information
first name Peter last name Webster and
then further down we wanted the email
address don't we so let's just find the
email address there it is
and then finally at the bottom again
we'll find their new field account ID
act ID and we'll put in the same value 1
2 3 4 so we've got exactly the same
information in the two records that
we're going to match let's go to the top
and let's hit Send there we go and we
should see the results here and there
they've just arrived so we found a match
match score 96 which is a strong match
in CES the match scores are on a scale
between 0 and 100 with 100 being high so
96 is a strong match and we've matched
on the name exactly and the email
address so that's great we found a match
we found a match because all of the
details including the account ID are
exactly the same now let's test the
change that we made so the change that
we made to matching was that we've
introduced this new account ID field and
if the account ID is different in the
two records even if everything else is
exactly the same the two records cannot
match so in the first record candidate
zero let's change the account ID to 5 6
7 8 so now we have a discrepancy in the
account ID it's 5 6 7 8 in the first
record and in record two we'll just take
a quick look at the bottom a record -
you'll see the account ID is still 1 2 3
4 so now we have a different account ID
even though all of the other details are
still the same now when we see its end
we should see a different results so
let's hit send now and on the right you
can see no results returned that means
no match was found Y was no match found
because the account IDs are different
and that's exactly the outcome that we
wanted to achieve
so our changes have worked
so that was an example of changing an e
DQ CD s service one of the duplicate
identification services and just to
remind you we changed the interfaces to
put our new attribute in account ID we
change each of the data interfaces that
we needed to change we changed the web
service that was bringing the data in
which is actually what we're looking at
here we changed the mapping between the
web service and the data interfaces we
made sure those data interfaces were
populated in each process within the job
up to the point of matching and then
once we've done that we could actually
adapt our matching processor to use our
new attribute so there we go
that's how you can go about customizing
and tailoring a c.d.s service</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
