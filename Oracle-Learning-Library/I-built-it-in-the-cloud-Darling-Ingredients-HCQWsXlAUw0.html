Oracle and I have with me Tom from
darling ingredients hi Tom so Tom tell
us about darling ingredients what do you
guys do
Tony Greece's largest provider of
sustainable national ingredients for
food fuel fertilizer awesome so let's
talk about this architecture that we
have over here and as I understand you
have ABS applications you also have some
third-party applications running across
three availability zones over Oracle
cloud infrastructure correct yes we were
moved our primary bs development QA and
UAT systems over to or apply out we
actually have 14 deviousness systems
running across three Velda domains along
with additional third-party applications
Hyperion or attacks of laboratory
information systems it's we did this in
the Phoenix location it has three
availability domains we we distribute
among the three availability domains so
that would have some resilience in case
one availability domains went down with
your still continue to operate in
availability domain one we have six VMs
or 28 OCT 2013 18 mediums with 2006 use
EBS where it takes application tiers
three database cloud system supporting
that with block storage and in our third
availability domain we have 18 VMs and
to bare metal servers 113 no CPU support
EBS informatica Hyperion laboratory
information systems all that one off of
all Tom's that's season 5 database cloud
systems block storage and we chose this
particular model because it could be one
availability domain goes down with your
team operations and then you still have
your on-prem datacenter correct yes we
have a production on-prem database
system that we currently do not a
replication from production over to the
or cloud infrastructure this facility to
the ten gate fast connect it's a real
speedy way
and if I understand correctly you had a
challenging situation where you had to
move all the 33 VMs and the apps into
the cloud within like 48 hours we
basically had 48 hours to move it our
older systems running on was a V block
that was actually running to fail so
instead of doing a camp X we start going
up X mountain he's an Oracle cloud
infrastructure we worked with the Oracle
team over a 48-hour period of 14 DBS
instances and all these other
applications over within a weekend well
that was quite a dust that you achieved
in 48 hours
indeed it was rather intensive but with
the help of Oracle's planning
infrastructure we got accomplished and
turned out rather well thank you so much
for sharing your connection with us and
thank you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
