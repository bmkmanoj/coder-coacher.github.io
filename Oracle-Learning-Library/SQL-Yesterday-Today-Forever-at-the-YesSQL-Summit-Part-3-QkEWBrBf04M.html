people consuming they say wow that's
advanced I'm not advanced phone I can
you do with that so and I think part
that it happens because of the accrual
that features over time if we start
today and say here sequel sequel flutes
powerful analytics it's not an advanced
feature its sequel and people start
learning it from the start that may be a
way to switch it up and one of the
things we're doing there so my advocates
team has connor mcdonald on it because
one of the members of the new ask tom
answer team and he's publishing a series
of kiss videos keep it simple sequel and
his argument is that sequel doesn't
complicate things see one especially
sequel analytics makes things much
easier and it's attempted was very short
like five minute videos that takes you
through explaining and understanding
analytics and very clear civil way so
hopefully the check those out and let us
know if you think that are effective
yeah if you haven't seen those Congress
videos are great so we can will circle
around back we have time to them and
let's still go on the next one so this
is a dress for Graham so no single
community or especially if you sell that
video no sequel is like we're web-scale
and I actually saw a new ad come out
last week for another company saying we
are web-scale so is no sequel really web
scale is horrible would scale what is
what's what is web scale I don't mean
that's a bundles web scale is always oh
well it's really big data sets right so
defined really big you know when what
six years ago now when we were still
doing TPC see we did 30 million GMC so
that's five hundred thousand real asset
compliant transactions a second each one
of those inserting fine items so you
know that's two and a half million
items being inserted of every second how
much are you really doing through your
website yeah I mean there are some web
scale folks out there there's this
amazon and there's this ebay and paypal
maybe write these guys do have millions
of transactions per second there's an
awful lot more people who were web-scale
Wallabies oh well of course we have to
use this technology because we have to
be able to scale to how many orders of
magnitude more than where you are now
right and because of that you're going
to be handcrafting things in systems
that don't have a lot of functionality
you have two bright in the functionality
that you want to want to do so things
like joint right up so I mean the whole
web scale thing does seem to be very
much a fashion it's pull out there my
favorite Larry quote is that you all
said that the IT business is the only
business that is more fashion conscious
than ladies shoes and I think that's I
think that's that's right you know when
web-scale became a very smart it became
a very fashionable thing to no sequel as
a very fashionable
going to be so there's folks are caught
up in the in the hype and and you say
these things go through a cycle there
much height and then they take off
relational databases gone through 30
years of competitors coming and going so
I think I think there's something of a
different aspect of this latest phase
because what's happened in the last
10-15 years is that the concept of what
does a user has changed users used to be
corporate employees and enterprise
systems will pretty much the dominant
form of software and now the users are
consumers and what you have is a get
rich it's like the latest gold line the
Goldfield so it's a gold rush to find
the apps that will generate the eyeballs
that get the ad revenue that that drive
money to your company and so that's why
I think there's so much focus on these
new fashionable software solutions
because they drive fast adoption and
fast implementation of user interfaces
to present you apps to users to get
eyeballs and they're going to keep doing
that for a while there's going to be a
tremendous amount attracted in this part
of the world because once consumers are
opened up as the Qt driver for revenue
there's no going back cool thanks hell
so running shorts I'll go into the next
question anybody have a quick sound like
any want anything else to get short you
know is it not enough okay I wants it
throwing the out before going to maximum
okay the next one is on happy so this is
um for Brendan so how does POC
spin into this discussion this is a
trick question in the rights of plant
and it was just crafted because i was
sitting here but and has to make the
serious answer to the question is that i
will talk at some length at ten o'clock
tomorrow on the topic of why PL sequel
is there and what it's all the good news
is that was selected as the editors
choice of one editors choice the bad
news is is concurrent with mohammed on
everything you've ever wanted to know in
your whole life of the optimizer so if
one or two people come i will be
thrilled and I'll take the chance now to
address a slightly different question
first one which I begged Iggy and Kyle
to address and they clearly didn't so
here it goes sequel is the theme of this
panel see what as opposed to something
else over haven't said what we mean by
sequel but it's crystal clear but most
people in this discussion of taking it
to me and it's um select insert update
delete and I suppose commit as more or
less they correspond to conducts
relational algebra that seems to be the
way we're taking sequel but there's an
entirely different operational
definition of it for anyone who works
exclusively with oracle database or
things now oracle database and that's
that sequel is any piece of text that
you can get done using something like
sequel plus an interesting thing about
oracle database is that there is only
one API to it and that's these texts
statements that you throw at it and by
definition in one school at all they are
only sequel right and vigorously
discipline disagrees with is it so need
to say that we don't have a vocabulary
sufficient that is certainly true that
it's called sequel plus it's certain
sure we have something called DBMS
sequel dot powers of excess surely a
single statement it's certainly true
that we have a view come feed on a
sequel that shows you some not all of
the texts that you can get done this way
but among the texts in else she gives an
anonymous PL single block well since
we're having this conversation since i
got this question j we're talking
exactly enemy a pistol moment about the
article database and then the question
is and again whatever address a thing of
tomorrow if you're going to do insert
update delete select countless commit
how are you do them the other
interesting thing about sequel that
people rarely mention and known as
mentioned it yet is that you can't write
a program of it it scope of concept
doesn't extend beyond the singles
there are many things that you can
achieve with a single sequel statement
and anyway this piece of text that is so
declarative things are wonderful how do
you make it help well there's only one
way to make done as to squirt it out of
some are over ordinary if-then-else
language and now there's just two ways
to it have that language running outside
of the database or have it running
inside and the purpose of the else equal
is to be inside the database and to be
the vehicle for doing insert update
delete commit in a coherent fashion so
that the many operations on the many
tables that you want to do to achieve a
certain business purpose either succeed
or fail as a unit control in that
fashion and of selective on saying all
about that so that's what you're seeing
is for it's just one of the many things
were getting the sequel done but it has
properties that make doing it that way
huge the advantage and then the sequel
that the outside world does to the
database is limited to the cold state so
she's very good- incorrectly then using
he'll singles always or supercharger
sequel or make it more efficient engine
running and database I wouldn't put it
that
I would say that the purpose of it any
kind of persistence mechanism is to
store the right stuff and to give you an
impact the right stuff I think then that
idea I heard it from the conference
platform from prostate and but it's
certainly a crucial idea isn't it so
correctness is most important talking
about performances are luxury at least
in our world this kind of application
that relational databases used for money
people's life and death all that stuff
you know there's no eventual consistency
when my bank account so in that arena
Erica this is most important and
security is also right as it happens if
you do the actual stuff that programming
considers a sequel game so that they
delete and select only within the
database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
