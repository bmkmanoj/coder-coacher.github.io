I and welcome to this how-to video this
video will show how we deploy oracle
solaris 11 and oracle solaris 10 zones
or local zones to a global zone solaris
global zone which is running solaris 11
so we have our server here which is
managed by off center and also has an
agent the agent is actually a
virtualization controller which was
enables us via ops center to deploy and
manage Oracle Solaris zones so we want
to actually firstly create a profile and
to actually figure and set booya the
configuration parameters we need to
deploy a zone and then we will create or
have creative forest or this process a
deployment plan which we can then apply
to the global Arizona instance we have a
static page so if we come down here to
the actual profile section we can see
that we have actually some profiles
already in place so if we click on the
solaris 11 ozone profile we can see it's
fairly generic and it's actually one
that we could copy as a kind of template
so what we're going to do is we can
actually copy this particular one rename
it so we'll call it to see here we'll
call it solaris 11 zone x only six
because its neck say 60 and we're going
to use local rather than
network-attached storage or sex or if to
host design so we want to actually
create a deployment plan for this
particular profile if you create the
plan over to be storing the left and we
want to keep the toyota solara see
here were actually specify the identity
of the zone so this is our kind of pre
facts it's it's automatic and it's
actually stated as number one which is
fine to be one from now we want to
install from the IPS repository so
that's fine so we move that on from now
now here is where we can actually alter
the zone configuration and specifiers so
we can use a dedicated or shared cpu
model we can put the number of shares
it's going to be share which in our
capacities we can also choose to cap the
cpu physical memory lot or virtual
memory and actually define as parameters
here if the actual metadata of the zone
were placed on NFS then we could
actually have a high availability
configuration I don't need that because
I'm actually only going to install
designs locally actually on the door
design circle is so so we'll move on to
the next page and it's a part of the
wizard and we can see here we can also
be actual size of the file system so
we're happy with the eight gigabytes
standard and we move on to the zone
storage this is where as i said in the
step earlier if you want to have high
availability you could actually choose
to have an as file system here i want to
keep it simple so i want to have that
done locally i also want my storage for
the zone
so moving on to the network's we wait
here so their networks actually come up
in this particular wizard and then we
can actually choose the number of
connections we won and in a movie so the
default Network has come up the this
particular subnet is the one who wants
only want one connection so there is no
fool with the zone set up which is the
language we can keep it to very generic
here and if you wish you can actually
change the root password from the
default on the system gives you a couple
of boot variables here which are both
detected by default so we've selected or
actually having to keep the default
where we automatically boot the zone
when the global zones looted and
automatically boot the zone afternoon
creative so with solaris 11 the root
user is actually a role and by actually
putting these particular fields in here
so create a new user account actually
enforces that particular privilege so
route becomes
naming services in the lab is fairly
simple and respected his own networks so
I want to come back so I'll summary you
can actually scroll down here and
actually take a look at all the choices
that we've actually made so I'm happy
with that so we're actually going to
finish that what that would do that was
then we'll run a job to create a profile
that's actually come back besides it's
actually a success and if we look here
on the left when the page refreshes we
can actually see this is our pacifica
profile that we just created so we take
tax lien for that profile to
automatically create a deployment plan
so if you pop to our deployment pairs
here we can actually see that this
particular plan has been created for us
what we want to do now is to actually
apply this deployment plan to a solaris
11 zone we could actually elect to
actually run it from this particular
actions pane or we could actually just
go on top of the clan like we are here
click the right mouse and then select to
apply to put another wizard runs and
here we actually select the global zone
were interested in
and here 110 is the server we want so we
added to the target list and keepers the
default will apply with minimal
interaction because we want to actually
use all the defaults that was set in the
profile and actually just add yahoo
address tomatoes now so if it next yeah
and we just want to confirm the identity
this is already set in the profile so
that's fine storage again so this is the
name of Ivy desk you could change if we
wished this is all from the profile that
we said we happen to that the networking
as our network we wanted the one
connection and we wanted a static IP
that's all we have to do here is just
put our IP address in pick next this is
where we have a chance to change the
hostname of a wish and change the
network's if we wish again so we're okay
with that will happen with that so we'll
say next now we get a choice to actually
run a job now or a later date and time
so I want to run the drum now so we go
next and we have a summary page so again
we can go through just like we did with
a credo profile and we actually review
all the choices we've actually made this
particular zone so we're going to apply
that
we can actually see now apply deployment
plan is actually in progress we can
actually see here these are the steps
that the actual plan is going to take so
we'll take a look at that in a little
while and see how that's getting so if
we go back to our heart profiles what we
want to do is actually now create a
solaris 10 zone so as again we can see
here we have a profile already created
so what we're going to do is we can copy
this again so we want to have a local
one so we can make a copy
again this is going to be an x86 one so
we use the same sort of lame
intervention as we did for last one
again we're going to create a deployment
profile so we'll go next happy with the
naming prefex as the laws with a solaris
11 1 now with solaris 10 we have a
choice is over having a whole root zone
a sparse cruiser or a branded saying we
want to keep them simple here so we're
just going to go with the detail default
which is an 18-4 root zone so we go
forward and we get the same screen as we
had with your uncle solaris 11 one where
we can choose whether we want to share
the dedicated cpu model how much shares
they're going to be what we want to do
into happening and we're also not going
to have as much of recovery so the file
systems we're happy with that going on
to the storage again we want to actually
keep everything local keep it nice and
simple networking we'll just wait for
our network to load actually choose the
network domain and the number of
connections okay the default one is what
we want that's the right network and we
want one connection so this is where we
can actually look at the language so
we'll keep things very simple or people
were everything to the default and like
the solaris 11 one every one of you guys
this if you want unlike solaris 11 we
wanted to employ as an agent
specifically to the death to the zone so
we can actually manage it with respect
to updating the software
naming services want to keep it simple
just like your person or so let me work
so we're going to choose done and we
have our summary page so we can actually
go down and scroll down and make sure
that all the choices will make creating
this profile
okay so the actual profile has been
created so what we actually want to do
now is we want to look at the efferent
deployment plans for our zones so here
is the one that we've just created so
what we're going to do is we're going to
fly the plane so right mouse click apply
the plan and we're going to choose our
server
we see our 112 server which is the one
we're interested in we add it to the
target list and just like the other ones
are we apply the attraction
okay the automatic naming we're happy
with move forward to the next one the
storage should be just a confirmation of
the local images which is a local
repository where were you ask a little
bit for now our zone here this is where
we actually have to put our IP address
in so we pop our I people are interested
in that's fine move on this is our host
names of where we could change things
we're happy with that or having a VIP
and everything so we just moved forward
scheduler job we want the answer dropped
alone now rather than later date so we
move on summary screen just to cap the
whole thing off and we're ready to go so
we can see the apply deployment plan is
in progress just like the other one we
sit for solaris 11 so these are the
steps that will actually take place to
create the Oracle Solaris okay our
solaris 10 deployment plan is finished
so we just click on it have a look we
can see here that all the steps are
completed successfully so that's looking
good so if we have a look at the asset
view we can see that's our global zone
there we now have two new non-global
zones one solaris 10 we click on that
one and see it's a mongoloid zone for
solaris 10 and we can have a look at
analytics if you wish so we can have a
look at the top five processes
history metrics chance that kind of
thing we can also have a look at the
solaris 11 zone the same you sweeping
the summer of year which shows us our
file systems equal utilization and also
our n86 as well so again like solaris 10
you can see processes for CPU and memory
we also if we go back to the global zone
we can also have a look at analytics and
we can actually see zone analytics now
which will actually tell us the zone
noob with the network consumers here for
the global esc larson in design and the
Salar comes up so that completes our
how-to guide thanks very much for
listening and watching
