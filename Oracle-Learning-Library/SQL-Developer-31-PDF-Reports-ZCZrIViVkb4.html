this demonstration will show you how to
customize your PDF reports in sequel
developer 3.1 we introduced PDF support
for reports to set the PDF options
select an existing report and go into
the edit dialog in this example I have a
report that shows all the salary for my
employees right click on this report to
open up the Edit report dialog in the
Edit report dialog there is a tree view
and there is a section for PDF expand
that here are all the options for PDF

cellpadding I'll change the horizontal
alignment to Center in the column layout
I want to display my column labels on
each page I'll change this to all pages
and I want to change the header color
I can also include a header or footer
let's add in a footer I can insert the
date at time
and I can also add in page numbers
in the page layout you can change the
margins I'll change the orientations and
landscape in the security when I select
an able security for a document the
document will have encryption the
encryption can be for all the document
contents or all the contents except for
the metadata I'll leave it as is
so my report has sensitive information
such as employees salary I'm going to
require a password to be able to open
this file now if you set a password to
open the file you also need to set the
permission password and this allows you
to be able to change whether or not you
can print the document or copy the text
or images

where you can make changes the font and
style I want to go ahead and shade the
odd rows to a different color and click

password protected you will be prompted
to enter in a password and here is your
