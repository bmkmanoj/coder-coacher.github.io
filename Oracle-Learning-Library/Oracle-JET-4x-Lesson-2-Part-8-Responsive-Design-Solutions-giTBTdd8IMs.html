second of the three weekly lessons about
oracle jet in this part you'll learn
about jet features that help you curate
applications that reorganize themselves
to the resolution of the device in which
they're being used responsive design is
an approach to web design aimed at
allowing web pages to be viewed in
response to the size of the device that
it's being used to view the application
some of the components and techniques
you'll learn about in this part have
been mentioned in previous parts already
though hair they're all covered within
the same part of the course so that
you're able to get an overview of all
the features related to responsive
design at the same time one of the
application patterns outlined in detail
in the jet cookbook is the responsive
page content pattern which combines a
number of techniques relating to
responsive design one design technique
that can be used to help with responsive
layout is to use the a jet panel
component as a placeholder with
different outer colors being used for
the different areas of your page layout
this allows you to easily see how the
panels will lay themselves out as the
browser size has changed or when you
view the page on different device sizes
it's much easier to make adjustments to
a simple panel until you get the basic
flow correct after things look pretty
good you can start adding in the correct
components and the content to replace
the edge a panel look and feel
several jet components are well-suited
to help with requirements that relate to
responsive design in addition to the
layout features and components that
you've looked at so far also be aware of
the behavior section of the jet cookbook
which provides information and
responsive helper classes responsive
JavaScript's and responsive loading in
this part you've learnt about all the
features in jets that support you in
creating applications catering to
responsive design requirements for your
homework for the sparks choose a layout
design with different layouts on desktop
tablet and phone screen sizes using a
Jeff flex and a Jeff flex ID some CSS
classes along with ogia panel to create
the layout
keep in mind the topics discussed in
this part think about how you could
change a view model code if you are on a
mobile device versus desktop and with
that we complete part eight of the
course and see you in part 9</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
