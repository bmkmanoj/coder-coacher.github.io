cloud control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I'll introduce you to the
new middleware routing topology feature
in cloud control first locate and view
some target in cloud control for this
demo we'll start with an existing
middleware system or farm which consists
of a single WebLogic domain regardless
of which type of target you select from
its target menu click the new routing
topology option the routing topology
viewer graphically depicts the different
targets that make up this middleware
farm along with their dependencies and
relationships here we see two WebLogic
servers along with a relational database
mouse over a target to view some
high-level information about the target
and click the more link to view a more
detailed overview from this property
viewer you can quickly inspect some of
the targets configuration parameters
incidents and alerts and its compliance
status if setup
suppose you're not interested in all the
different elements of the topology
diagram you can add in or filter out
specific types for example let's include
JDBC data sources in our diagram this
could be useful to help trace and
troubleshoot interactions between your
middleware and supporting databases the
zoom toolbar is found to the left of the
diagram you can also pan by dragging the
maps mouse over each data source to view
an overview of its configuration
including the connection URL and
connection pool size let's reset the new
type filter to view the original diagram
from the same toolbar you can also
filter the display targets by their
availability status in other words
whether they're up or down and by their
health state for large topologies
instead of browsing the entire diagram
you may wish to perform a search for a
specific target you can search based on
name type status and so on let's search
for all targets named store the matching
search results are shown as a list and
also highlighted in the diagram you can
hide the results list if desired click
reset fine to clear the search criteria
once we've identified a target that
we're interested in we can drill down to
that targets home page by mousing over
it and then clicking its name for this
demo let's select an SOA composite
deployment to return to the routing
topology use the target menu just like
we did earlier with the middleware
target we've seen how to get some
general configuration information about
targets without leaving the routing
topology but you can also do the same
with monitoring metrics click
annotations and then metrics now some
basic real-time metrics are included for
many targets including the database and
applications to view the parent targets
of this SOA composite like we saw
earlier select the group by middleware
view instead of the group by application
view now we can see metrics for the
parent WebLogic server as well notice
that we're still restricted to seeing
the topology related to this one SOA
composite to return to viewing the
entire middleware farm click show entire
farm now we see the entire domain once
again finally if you wish to return back
to the previously selected target click
return to current target thanks for
watching this demonstration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
