solutions architecture at Oracle cloud
welcome to this review of the Oracle
cloud database service
the database service provides database
systems to customers these database
systems are bare metal compute instances
that have 10 gigabit network connections
and high speed low latency and DME SSDs
the local nvme storage is two and three
way mirrored for redundancy on the local
drives Oracle transparent data
encryption is enabled by default on
every database system
database service customers can increase
and decrease the number of licensed
cores on their database system
dynamically with no impact to database
operations this is especially compelling
for oracle database customers whose
performance requirements vary over time
as you add and remove licensed course
your cost increase and decrease
accordingly licenses are built by the
hour so a customer that needs a database
system with 36 cores on the weekend but
only four cores during the week only
pays for the licenses they actually use
let's launch a database system using the
Oracle cloud console in the upper
right-hand corner at database and then
click DB system we then choose launch DB
system we start by entering a display
name choosing an availability domain
choosing the addition of the Oracle
database we would like to install
choosing the shape of the bare-metal
instance in this case I'm going to
choose a dense IO instance this instance
has 512 peaks of memory 36 cores of cpu
and 28.8 terabytes of high speed low
latency and DME SSDs we then select our
initial cpu core count we provide an ssh
public key so we can gain root access to
the underlying their metal instance
later we choose a virtual cloud network
a subnet specify a host and domain name
we enter a database name choose the
database version we then enter and
confirm our database admin password and
click Launch DB system
the database service supports all
flavors of Oracle database from the
standard edition to the enterprise
extreme performance edition
customers who need highly available
durable Oracle database can easily start
two systems one in each ad and set up
synchronous or asynchronous data guard
across the low latency 10 gigabit
network the database service enables you
to bring your existing Oracle database
tooling and monitoring into the cloud we
provide you with root access to the
underlying bare-metal instance this
means customers don't have to change the
way that they operate their Oracle
databases now that they're in the cloud
existing tooling existing processes and
existing training all extends seamlessly
into the database service database
systems can be completely isolated from
the internet making the Oracle cloud a
safe and secure place to operate your
Oracle databases database systems can be
attached to your on-premises network
using VPN and other private connectivity
options
an optional arm an agent to backup your
databases to the Oracle cloud object
store is included in every database
system
