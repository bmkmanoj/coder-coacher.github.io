cloud control 12c demo series this
demonstration will show you how to add
an Oracle Exadata database machine as a
managed target discovering an Oracle
Exadata database machine is a two-step
process
first we add the compute nodes as host
targets and second we add the Oracle
Exadata database machine as a non host
target in this demonstration we are
going to discover an Oracle Exadata
database machine x2 caught Iraq but the
steps to follow are identical for all
the supported members of the Oracle
Database Machine family the x2 rack
consists of two compute nodes three
storage cells two InfiniBand switches
and Ethernet switch a KVM and two Power
Distribution units the PDUs are usually
connected to the network external to the
database machine to allow for for
monitoring capability however in this
environment they are not connected to
the network so we will not be able to
monitor them let's begin the process by
adding the two compute nodes as host
targets this is the same familiar
process for adding any host target
adding all compute nodes at the same
time ensures that subsequent Exadata
database machine discovery can set up
monitoring high availability
you
once the compute nodes are added as
hosts we are ready for the next step
which is to add the Exadata database
machine as a non host target
you
we start by nominating a computer
agent from which to perform the
discovery
and the database home directory next you
specify the name and nm2 user
credentials for one of the InfiniBand
switches here we have already created
named credentials for the nm2 user but
you can also enter new credentials here
and save them if you wish
clicking next will cause Cloud Control
to interrogate the InfiniBand switch and
examine the database machine schema XML
document to retrieve the database
machine topology after which you will be
presented with the components page
listing details of all the components
that are considered part of this
database machine at this point you
should confirm that the topology details
are correct you can also choose which
components should or should not be
considered part of this database machine
because the PDUs are not connected to
the network and therefore cannot be
monitored in this environment we will
not select them for inclusion as manager
targets next we proceed to the
monitoring agents page here you can see
that the discovery process has
arbitrarily assigned the agents on the
compute nodes as primary and backup
monitoring agents for each component you
can modify the assignments if you wish
before proceeding to the agent
credentials screen where you specify the
credentials to be used for operations on
the host agents on the monitoring
credentials page we specify the root
credentials for the Exadata storage
cells
then we specify the nm2 user passwords
for each InfiniBand switch whether
common across all switches or specific
to each finally we specify credentials
for the integrated lights-out manager
interfaces before proceeding to the SNMP
subscription screen here we can specify
root user credentials to allow
Enterprise Manager Cloud Control to
receive SNMP traps for the storage
service and InfiniBand switches on the
component properties page you can
specify the SNMP community string for
your Ethernet switch and pay to use that
will be used to establish SNMP traps for
those devices the review page presents
the component name IP address and
monitoring agent assignments that will
be used at this point you can go back to
make adjustments once you are satisfied
that the information is correct click
the submit button to promote all the
components to managed targets when that
is complete you will be presented with a
page summarizing the outcome of the
target promotion process your database
machine will be listed on the exudative
Database Machine screen from which you
will be able to click through to monitor
and manage it
