revert model changes to a previous
revision we first want to go look at the
versioning history so we right-click on
the object and then select versioning
and then version history and it's going
to give us a list of all the revisions
that are currently in our subversion
repository and so what we want to do is
we want to select two of the revisions
and then do a comparison between them so
I'm going to go ahead and select the
revision that I want to compare against
and then the locally saved copy and
select compare the compare window
appears and we want to go look at the
differences you'll notice that the
revision that we're comparing against
does not have the cust Commons in it so
let's go ahead and merge that because we
want to go back to that revision so that
cost Commons no longer appears and
you'll see that in the table it's no
longer there so now we want to commit
these changes to the repository so we go
to pending changes refresh and then
commit those changes we can put in a
comment saying we want to go back to
this revision and then click OK
and so now if we go to the version
history and do a refresh you'll notice
that another revision is now in the
repository with the change that we made
you have just learned how to revert
model changes to a previous revision</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
