features and updates for the application
testing suite flow to one my name is Yu
Tang kata katsu and I'm a Google product
manager for the product in this
recording I'd like to talk about the new
features that are available for the open
script load testing module and also for
the Oracle load testing or olt so this
recordings covers slides 16 to 31 in the
PowerPoint file please note that some of
the opens for the topics that are common
in both functional and load are covered
by another video recording so please
take a look at that one you can find the
other recordings in getting started with
ATS a wiki page product training section
ok so that first several slides we are
going to talk about today are the
updates we have done for the ADF flow
testing module in a total of a bomb
version of the open script so in order
to make this a DF load module more
reliable and easier to work on we have
made enhancements in the area and that
includes a new correlation library and
also some UI enhancement and the new
debugging features we have
so in 1201 open script ADF load testing
module introduces new correlation
library first of all if you open up the
library in the preference dialog
you'll notice that we have much this
number of rules defined compared to down
in the ninth of three one version of the
ADF library so in the screenshot here
you see 88 library 9.31 and at leasts
there are 10 rules or so defined I can
see there and actually there's a scroll
bar here which means there are a bunch
of others other operation rules defined
for this library instead what we have
here for the total one is just a 10
dozen or so that's that that's the
number of the rule and Croatian rules we
have for the 12 one version of the ADF
library and this is because we have
removed many of the old regular
expression based creation rules and
instead added an ADF rich response
correlation rule this one ADF rich
response correlations so I will talk
about this in the next slide or but
basically what we did is if we have
added three new rules and removed a lot
of others ok so let's take a look at
this in the actual product oops
so this is open script UI 2 other one
version of the open script and I have
ADF load script open so I'm going to
view all transcript preferences and open
up the ADF load correlation rules you
may already noticed but the arm from a
total one version of the Oakland script
the preference dialog is go to filter
depends on the what kind of what type of
the script you're open in the open
Street UI so depends on
the script type you're actively open it
will also select the the contents which
is going to be shown to you so because I
am opening a PDF load testing module the
functional testing options or web
services options are not showing up here
and this is covered in the other
recording so if we for more details
please take a look at the on the
PowerPoint file or the recording for the
functional and load updates ok ok so
what we have here is the ADF load
correlation rule for the unfolded one
version of the open script this is all
we have for the idea of correlation
rivalry and we have redirect URL and
context ID these are the new regular
expression based creation rules if I
double click I see the pattern so these
are the regular expression based
correlation libraries then you may
wonder what happened a lot of other ones
we used to see in the 9.31
will remove them but there have to be a
reason they existed so you may wonder if
it is really okay to removing them so
that is why we actually have this
correlation rule here
ADF rich response correlation when I
open this the UI looks different free
differently from the other rule you just
saw this is apparently not a regular
expression based correlation rule it
looks some more like a dom correlation
so if I open this this is the
traditional dom correlation rule it has
a list of HTML elements wheels
checkboxes and based on how you
configure in this dialog dom correlation
will create expands basic relations in
the script you see them soap XPath
variable as a command in your script so
likewise if open ADHD response
correlation it also shows a list of
elements the difference is
it shows ATF specific elements instead
of the weather element so that is why I
have a component ID in the top I didn't
see them in the Adhan correlation and it
perches out the rich ATF XML content and
apply X past based variable based on the
information you configure in this dialog
so it works just like the damo
correlation so you can think of this is
the ADF version of the Dom correlation
and this is why we could remove a lot of
obsolete the regular expression based
curation rules
so basically we're removing a lot of
regular expression based ADF rules and
adding an XPath base
ATF correlation rules okay this is how
the script looks like after the new
version of the correlation rules are
applied in the right-hand side of the
screen you see a screenshot of the
script field of the opens with UI and
within this diagram at the upper side of
the screen in use it shows ADF expands
based variables and they are created by
the ADF rich response correlations which
we discussed in the previous slide and
the lower side of the screen you see
HTML expels variables and they are first
out by the Dom correlation rules so in
the 9.3 one version of open script
script recorded the ADF application you
you saw a lot of salt regular expression
variables and they're still here in talk
one but you will see a lot less of those
and instead you see in these experts
based ADF variables
so I have open script open and I have ad
F load script shown in the script field
and when I expand one of the node
navigation node
I see soap expands variables here and
they are pressed out by the Dhamma
croatians is a web input with link and
in addition to that I see eightieth
variables group node and let me expand
this and here you see the X path based
ADF variables the variables was shown as
salt ADF variable I'm sorry soap ADF
path variables and I can click each of
them to see their detail information in
the tree view and also from the XPath
thing syntax and I can edit them if I
wanted to I can also click the group
node and open up a table view to show
them all at once I can still click each
of the item to show the details
individually
so in summary in 1201 ad followed upon
show has less regular expression based
variables and has more of the new XPath
based but ATF specific variables and
they are shown in the tree view with
organized views that you can read them
easier than a lot of regular expression
variables open script ADF module also
provides new debugging capability in two
other one and one of them is the ADF
component radio which is shown in this
slide and you can find this feature as
an additional table in the details pane
in the open script UI and here's a
screen shot in the slide you may think
this is similar to how HTML Dom tree
view looks like and that is actually
correct but instead of pressing after
HTML it purses out rich ADF XML content
then displays the components in a tree
based structure like this and you can
select a node to see the attributes the
information in the bottom side here and
also locate where in the idea of rich
XML in this component reside and you can
use this information to understand the
application structure and make use for
that script debugging so again I'm back
at open script product if I select and
now one of the navigation node in the
script view and it will show the content
information in the right hand side in
the details pane and this is not new and
what is new is I see a new tab here
IDF component Tribune and this is a new
tab for the 12.1 for this EDF Lautner
show and here is the raw XML content for
this selected node and here is a tree bu
structure for this
ATF content and I can expand that trade
will manually and in select the node and
I can also do the search to find the
components and looking for so I'm going
to type wave link okay sensitive okay so
now I found the components I was looking
for and here is the attribute
information for that node and if I
scroll this down you see where in this
XML this component tree side and I can
use this information to debug my script
another the working feature introduced
in 12 1 for the ADF load module is the
ADF comparison bill in addition to the
existing comparison options as an header
or HTML contents we have a new option to
compare the rich ADF XML content between
the recorded end playback and what this
basically allows you to do is to find
out the difference between the recorded
and playback and use that information in
order to modify your script in case of
the error in your script to see this
option in the product you can go to the
result view which is the bottom part of
the screen and select one of the
navigation node and then select the
comparison tab in the details view so in
9.31 we now have a good option to
compare the ADF rich XML content you can
select the content or even the formatted
content to compare the recorded in
playback information for the ADF content
but the problem is it does not format
well enough for the ADF content so what
I often did is to because the
information I wanted to know is
somewhere in this line and this is
actually very long and it is not really
formal too well for me to compare
between so I what I often do you still
select this entire string here and copy
and open up the text file and paste that
and use a third-party tool to compare
against and in 1201
you don't have to do this anymore
because you have a new option here which
is a DF component hierarchy and what
this does is it puts out the ADF content
nicely in the hierarchical format and
allows you to compare the contact
between the recording and playback
in user-friendly texture of view and
when you find the difference then you
can use that information to modify your
script accordingly
and as mentioned earlier the ADF
correlation library introduced a new
expert based correlation rules the new
library is not just readable in the
script field but actually it performs
better than before you see a diagrams in
the screen and they are the results of
our internal tests down at the
development so please take a look at the
diagram in the left side and this is the
result of the test which is measuring
how long it took to process a certain
task and there are three lines in the
graph Dom new ADF and old ADF and Dom is
the Dom correlation rule and new ADF is
our new correlation rule based on the
XPath and old ADF is the our old ADF
correlation rule based on the regular
expressions the x-axis in T indicates a
number of variables that was passed by
the module and the wine axis indicates a
time which was taken to process the
variables and according to this data new
ADF modules performance is more stable
than others it is showing flat valid
regardless of the increase of the tasks
on the other hand you can see the old
regular expression has a performance
problem it is going up right as the
number of variables which need to
process increases and the similar result
was shown in the right hand side of the
diagram as well so from these results we
proved the new ADF correlation library
which is based on XPath is stable and
scalable compared to the older version
of the ADF closure
the next new feature is the new
accelerator we have for the JD adverse
one application open script provides
accelerators for the Oracle applications
such as EBS vision ADF for civil
applications and also for the web
specific technologies such as web
services or Adobe flex and JD e1 load
testing module is the newest accelerator
we added to the list to create a jte
load testing module please go to new and
find oracle JD edwards enterprise one
under the load testing so this is my new
load testing straight for the JD Edwards
one if you go to the peel open script
preferences and correlation you see JD
Edwards load testing correlation library
and we have five JD e specific
expressions configured
so jde mojo is actually only for the
load testing and we do not have a JD
module for the functional testing but
you can use the standard web functional
testing script to record and playback
the jde
applications the next feature here is
the authentication improvement open
script supports basic
ntlm or digest authentication by
manually adding an authentication node
into the script the improvement here in
this project was to automatically
configure the authentication without any
manual interaction however unfortunately
this feature was deferred to 12.2 and it
is not available in the total one yet
another new feature in 12-1 is a large
data handling in some cases open street
playback involves a large data and that
could overload the open scripts
capability of executing the script
typically this is when an application
contains a long list of name but appears
in its post data when this happens the
playback can unexpectedly fail due to
the excessive memory consumption and
even runs it can take a long time to
complete in the new feature provided in
total 1 you can place a large data
threshold in opens with preference which
is shown in this screen here and move
all the data goes beyond the threshold
into the external resource file so that
the large data won't eat up your memory
during the playback this is not only an
option for the load testing module and
applies that all other modules in open
script as well in addition to the post
data this can also be seen when a table
test or in the functional testing or a
cycle query in the database test returns
a large amount of result
and it can also be seen when you have a
very long action message in the
conflicts HTTP script let's take a look
at the post data example in this slide I
have a screen shot of two load testing
scripts open the script in the left side
was recorded without having the large
data into the restaurant file so
everything was recorded into the script
the script includes a large
authentication data in the post data in
one of the navigation the script in the
right side I recorded the same
application same navigation but this
time with the configuration in the open
script to move the large data into the
resource file so what are the
differences either the data is moved to
the external resource Verona actually
you can still view edit the data so what
are the differences and actually there
is no difference you see from the GUI as
far as you are in the trivial you'll not
notice the differences and you can
perform the script editing as usual the
difference you can see is actually in
the Java code if you flip the user
interface to the Java code you'll see
the significant difference see the
content size difference between the two
for this particular posterior parameter
value at the left side all the data was
written into the script and this this
will result in consuming excessive heap
to process the request on the other hand
the script in the right side only has a
single line indicating location of the
resource file this will save the memory
and make script much faster the process
at the playback time
but where does the resource files
actually stored they are stored in the
script directly and you can either see
them from the Navigator tab in the
developers perspective from the open
script UI or you can directly go to the
file systems the files are shown with an
extension RSC
so in my open script I have a script
open that has a large data which is
written into the resource file and if I
go to the OPCON scatter preference and
under the general know that you see
large data and this is where you
configure your large data threshold in
my case I have said the data goes beyond
to Tula bite move to the rest res file
and you can configure the threshold body
on your preference and I know this
parameter has a large authentication
data if I double click I can still see
that data and just so just like it is
written into the script I can modify
that and I can do anything I wanted to
do just like the ligature script but if
I flip this code into the Java code view
I only see that post data contents they
are specified in the location of the
resource file I don't see the
authentication data I saw in the tree
view you can find the resource file by
switching to the developers perspective
in a navigator tab here and find this
your script name and it's under the
resource folder and this is the the
resource file which was taken into the
external file
okay
the next new feature is a result content
similarity in open script result view in
the result field in the total one
version of open script you'll notice
there is an additional column similarity
which is this in the screenshot in this
column you can see the difference
between the recorded and playback
information in a percentage value by
clicking this button compute similarity
this feature provides you a quick and
high-level information of the level of
the difference between the recorded and
playback without going to the details
view to further investigate and in fact
this is especially helpful when your
script is passed and not failed this is
because when your script is passed and
shows all green you may think you're all
set and probably do not want to further
check the details of the contents
returned from the server however it is
possible that the script is passed but
the server still returns an unexpected
content the wrong contents and that
since the script is actually failing and
this depends on how much validation you
have done in your script for that
particular page so when your playback is
completed with the past result in order
to ensure the successful playback you
can click this compute similarity button
and then the percentage but it is going
to show in this mayority column and if
the displaced percentage is low even
though the playback was passed result
there is a chance that the script is
still failing and in this case you may
want to further check the details for
that particular page to ensure the your
script is actually passed or not
the next couple of slides are the new
feature for the Oracle load testing in
the previous version of the Oracle load
testing virtual user display was a
debugging tool which allowed it to see
the status of the running values in the
load session in 12.1 we basically
rewrote this virtual user display and
introduced the newly logging feature
this new virtual user log feature
provides three different view options
summary of the whole scenario summary
that is grouped by the reuse and the
option to display all locks the screen
shot showing the slide is a bit small so
let's see this in the actual product so
this is how nearly lock look like and
you can open the spear on via log from
the top or call load testing tools menu
and selectively you lock this is how you
open up the virtual user locks and as
mentioned the virtual user log have
three different p options summary
summary / vu and all logs currently you
are seeing the summary view the summary
view provides an overview over how many
times the particular type of message has
occurred and for what number of virtual
users for example the action submit form
at the step 3 has occurred six times for
the five we use and likewise we looks
like we have a header here the same
browser exception and this theme browser
exception has occurred for a single time
at the step one and with the one virtual
user so here is a summary / vu option
summary by vu view provides an overview
of how many times a particular type
message has being thrown by a particular
virtual user this is basically a summary
view grouped by the virtual users and
finally what we have here is the all
logs
and this is option to display all logs
just like the old virtual user display
and in the virtual user display because
of this limitation that only able to
show the logs sometimes it was hard to
narrow down to the virtual user that is
actually causing a failure and that's
one of the reason we have this new
virtual user virtual user logs and you
can click in select one of the items in
the grid and select the content button
to show the detail information for
example this is the request header
information you can also see D response
header information and here is the
content you can also see in HTML and
because this is a whole logs and it is
it is showing all we use so I have a
value 3 video 1 because iam it's all
mixed
just like the old spiritual user display
but in this special user lock what you
can do is you can actually filter the
WiiU so if we want if I want to see only
the to you one day I can type one here
and click filter now only information of
the blue one is displayed
so the new video logs provides
additional view options from the old
version of the video display it shows
three view options and also allows you
to view details for the each contents
and also filter the content to display
and by this you can quickly narrow down
to the cause of the system failure
the last feature for this section is a
self-contained scenario files in the 9.3
one version of the Oracle load testing
you can save the scenario file as a file
name with extension SC n so this SC n
file is actually very useful debugging
information as includes all the scenario
settings on the other hand the SCM files
are the XML format and it is very
difficult to read for humans and also it
was not possible to import into a
different oddity server unless he has
the same set of scripts and data files
already deployed in the specified
repository and workspace so basically
this is for just for you for your
reference read-only and it's not
important and that was a cinephile in
1201 version of the oracle o testing it
provides a new file type that includes
script and script assets and also the
Essene file and zipped up as a single
file and this is a self-contained
scenario files and what this allows you
to do is you can bring a scenario from
one machine to another and automatically
deploy the script and data bank files
included in the scenario into the the
other environment
so let's see how that can be done there
you have two machines machine a and
machine B and you want to import a
scenario setting from the machine a the
machine B and first you need to do is to
export the scenario in the machine a go
to all LT minute tools and select export
let's see de in actual product go to
tools and select export and this is a
dialog we need to work on well I'm going
to select is to see a scenario as a type
and this is the scenario file I have and
please make sure to check these
checkboxes for the recorded data
playback result and data bank if you
want to include these into the scenario
files and click export this will allow
you to save this in the your file
systems so I'll just select desktop ok
open folder and I'm going to open this
with 7-zip just to want to see what's
contained in there so what I have in
here is the new LT this is a script and
data banks this is a data bank file and
I also have a scene as SCN file as well
so just make sure if I open this here so
you see script Java so this was a script
let's go back to the slide
so once you have exported your scenario
and you need to file transfer the SCN
zip file to the target machine in this
case it's machine B and select to open
that the Sen zip file from the open
scenario dialog in that system so let's
see that in the royalty server where you
need to go to is here open and select
the self-contained scenario institution
scenario ok and click OK and this will
automatically deploy the script and also
the data bank file into your system
after that you're all set and you're
ready to run your load test that was a
new feature updates for the open script
load module and for the oracle o testing
the next section talks about the feature
updates in the other part of open script
so Seco query result validation and to
make a simple you can call it sicko
query test that is how it says in a UI
actually so this is the feature update
in the database module in 1201 we have a
new command that compares a sequel query
result against expected values and
reports of failure if the comparison
doesn't match this feature is provided
by both API and GUI let's see that in
the actual product so I have database
script open in my open script I already
have data base connection configured and
now I want to add a sequel query test
I'm going to select the run and
and actually I have cyclic query here
but if you don't see the single query up
here go to other and find the database
section and select the sequel query node
and click OK this is the database I want
to test against and I'm going to write
down the sequel statement that I want to
verify and I'll click test button and I
can see the results coming back in the
table now I want to verify this query
result to make sure you return the
correct values each time I run this
query and what I can do is to click this
create sequel query test button to open
up a single query test editing view I
will name my query and I can specify
which result I want to verify I can
enable or disable or check specific
cells that I want to test and then I'll
just click OK and click OK and move this
to right position and now your query
test is set now I can run this query
and the result is coming back in the
result view and if you open up the java
code this is how the API looks like
utilities get Cleary service assert
clearly
okay so playback is still going but
let's go back to the slides because it
may take a little time because I checked
all cells so this is the sequel query
feature in the database module and as
you may notice this feature is similar
to the table test in the functional
testing it is a table test that runs
against the clear results that's how you
can think about this feature the last
feature in this recording is the proxy
command-line interface this is a
debugging feature there you can use your
browser to capture the HTTP traffic and
log into the CSV file log the traffic
into the CSV file and just like the way
open script it does at recording let me
show you that in the browser how it
works
the first I will go to the browser and
change the practicing go to tools
internet options connections run certain
things and I'm going to change the proxy
server to localhost with the port number
seven eight eight eight eight and then
I'm going to launch a command line and
write down the command which I already
written down here and so copy and paste
and press ENTER to start the proxy and
please note that I have the proxy
directly is set to the C or a call log
five so this is the directory that the
traffic information is going to be
stored so let me show you the directly
here this is C or
log five in my local file systems and I
have proxy log CSV file created just now
let me open that to see what's in there
it looks like I only have header
information and I don't have any data
locked yet because I haven't done any
transaction yet so what I'm going to do
is to go back to the browser and
navigate to one of the site I'm
interested in so this is the f-m stock
website I'm going to log into the
website and as I navigate through the
window you can see traffic information
added to this directly or call log five
directory I'm going to continue my
transaction search good okay I'm done so
let me take a look at the proxy log CSV
file - and what's in there
okay so now I have an information logged
in here I see the HTTP request I made
and I also have a post data information
and response code and here is the
content content size and also I see the
duration so this is the log file that
made it for you by the proxy and if I
want to stop the proxy I'll just go ctrl
C + + y and it is stopped and this is
how the proxy command line interface
works let's go back to the slide
and the steps how to work with a proxy
you can see in this slide and actually
you may wonder why do you want to do
this this is helpful for debugging when
you are working with the HTTP script and
you may encounter problem in the script
playback and as you narrow it down you
may find some navigation could be
missing from recording or maybe have it
captured in a bad way so apparently in
that case you can use a third party
tools such as wire circle fiddler to
capture HTTP traffic and compare its
result against your script so this proxy
feature provides a basically the same
similar capability with the wire circle
filter but allows you to further narrow
it down the root cause in some cases for
example the problem may not be the
recording itself
if the problem seems to be in the
recording you can compare it with the
other third party tool but the problem
may be at the script generation that
takes place after the recording so you
can compare the capture file from the
proxy and then compare with a script to
see where the problem might reside if
you see the difference between the proxy
log and with a script then maybe there
is some problem with the script
generation not recording yourself if the
problem seems to be in recording itself
then you can compare the result with
those with a wire circle fitter to see
what could be the problem
and apparently we support HTTP as well
for this proxy c'mon line okay so this
is the end of the recording for the
Oracle load testing and also the open
