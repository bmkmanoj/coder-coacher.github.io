the London java community and I go
involved with free 10 about 18 months
ago when I did a lightning talk on
behalf of the LJ CEC for the JCP group
so a lot of acronyms a java community
process we kind of have a program called
the dr j sr and this was the first jsr
that we adopted when we used it as a
pilot scheme to figure out how we would
go about rolling out the dr j sr program
globally so my initial involvement was
doing a lightning talk on this and
basically from there it's we got
involved with myself and Richard on
writing some of the tck tests and then
sort of moving and tzk implementation
test and side separate those out when we
got to about forty fifty percent of the
way through that we kind of realized
that there was still a lot of the API
that wasn't was in flux ooh it was a
active process in refining that so we
helped her with some of the design
discussions and her met with Stephen
many times over the last year so we've
held this boffin you see that there
aren't any slides because it's we want
to give you guys an opportunity to ask
questions and and we wanted to be as
interactive as possible so just go down
the line and introduce everyone hold
some of them donate intuition but
Richard journal entry yourself my name
is Richard and Jim had said all the
useful information you need to know
about me already hi there so I'm Stephen
colborne I created jodha time and
obviously I've looked up to jsr 310 a
fair bit with other people around me
keeping me sane along the way I'm Roger
Riggs I work for oracle I remembered a
good bit of my past working on Java ME
but I've gotten involved in 310 to help
but get it into the JDK cool so about 11
hours ago now we had a session on this I
see a few familiar faces in the audience
so let's just let's just start off by
opening up to any questions that people
might have
well there are a few obviously we've got
a number of open issues in both in the
sort of design and implementation
there's a bunch of implementation work
that has been blocked by design issues
the oh there's no processes in OpenJDK
that we need to sort of synchronize with
and so there's a little bit of extra
work there there you know a couple of
sort of larger design issues about the
suitability in the usefulness of the AP
is that we're going to hash out and you
know if you want to see all the issues
there on the github pretty transparent
operation the you know there's a fair
amount of work to do we be a bit of a
challenge I think the challenge is to
get it done by to fit into the milestone
six and then OpenJDK schedule which is
sort finishes at the end of January
does ask you a question or do you any
more information on that everything's
good okay and any other questions from
anyone on the floor okay so I have some
loaded questions I'm Steven could you
tell us about some of the difficulties
that we've seen with I guess providing a
calendaring system which addresses the
majority use case of people that use
like ISO I'm from what we found out from
some of the polls that we've run that's
the majority of users versus also making
sure that because we're and I guess a
glow of the JDK is used by people all
over the world how do how do we make
sure that we still address international
concerns as well as making sure we have
a usable and logical system for most
people I think the thing with the joists
are like this with the date and time
thing it's it's a question of how do you
balance competing interests you know
we're also used to seeing the java.util
calendar class and you know do you write
in your code gregorian calendar equals
new google calendar do you write in your
code calendar equals new gregorian
calendar or do you write calendar equals
new in calendar new instance those are
kind of three different ways in which
you could create your calendar objects
and each of those has different impacts
through say yeah you know if you do
gregorian calendar equals new gregorian
calendar your hard coding the fact that
is a growing calendar so the rest of
your code could actually quite clearly
work with that if you do calendar dot
equals new gregorian calendar it's a bit
like you feel like you're using list
equals new arraylist so they're kind of
fine but then if you pass that calendar
object off to another method in another
part of the system by method actually
doesn't know that you create to the
gregorian calendar
I'll come back to that in a minute and
then you kind of have the last one which
is calendar equals calendar new instance
so you know that's the way which is all
localized and safe so why does all this
matter what it matters because you know
the calendar system we use here in
Europe in u.s. whatever isn't the only
calendar system in the world if you go
to Thailand you know the year is
different if you go to Japan they count
years from the start of the Emperor if
you go to you know the different rules
again if you go into the Islamic world
or into the Hebrew world now the chances
are if you're yo if you write calendar
equals calendar new instance you know
and you've got one and you're in some
other part of the world you could
potentially get one of these other
calendar systems and you kind of might
think your application can deal with it
but perhaps it can't you know the
chances of you having tested your
application with one of the other like
other coming systems is probably quite
small so there's a there's a real
tension between saying you want your
application to be simply localized
across the world and actually the
implications of that because i'll give
you this implant a simple example you
know in the coptic calendar system there
are 13 months of the year and the first
12 months of year have 30 days the last
month of the year has five or six days
now that has certain different you know
things like if you think you know you're
going to add a year to a date by adding
12 months you know yeah you might have
made that assumption in your code
because you were in your head thinking
well obviously all my all yet all years
always have 12 months but that's not the
case in some other calendar system so if
you're just dealing with a java.util
calendar object rather than jungkook
util quick Gorean calendar object
chances are you may well have made some
wrong assumption in your code you won't
have tested that depending on how you
created it you may end up with a bug in
your code if you run your code in some
other locale so there can be some real
subtle zoos around is and so kind of
coming back to where James started on
this is like to what degree do we
balance the rick
for it to be easy to create and use
calendar systems around the world
against the requirement to you know I'd
like my co not have bugs you know I
quite like the requirement of not having
bugs
so
like
No
has significant
or even possibly the same there has any
changes that issues have to have a dress
differently
just because it's part of the baby
I think that the question here is
basically how given Joe to time you know
isn't it just the case you can take the
things that we enjoyed a time and move
them straight in the JDK because that
seems like a fairly obvious thing you
know there are many people out there
using jodha time they're mostly pretty
happy and they mostly don't have any
problems so I didn't write a blog post
about this a fair old while ago which
it's quite easy to Google Joe two-time
not 310 ahem which I just did so I kind
of went through this kind of full basic
reasons so there are some design issues
in jodha type and you know if you're
just using it perhaps you don't really
notice them you know cause things just
seem to make sense and most of the time
you don't tend to worry about those
designer shoes so kind of separation of
the machine time line versus the human
timeline we talked about this that this
morning that you know machines a good
accounting big numbers humans did want
years month days and they kind of get
confused in in jodha time and the second
one is pluggable calendar systems so
this kind of alludes to what I've just
talked about there in Jones a time you
have pluggable calendar systems if you
have a datetime object or you have a
local data object enjoyed a time and you
call the method get month you might
assume it returns 12 12 but as we
discussed a moment ago it might actually
return 12 13 but it's such a it's such a
SEP technically what you enjoy the time
the correct way to used at a time is
every time you make a method call you
should pre check to see that it's the
iso chronology in that nobody does this
you know it's just not a feasible way to
be dealing with aidan times you know for
every time you pass one of the Joe
two-time objects into a method the first
thing you should do is check to see
actually it's a nice oh yeah that's
crazy you know it's basically a design
flaw that kind of when you actually
think about afterward
kinda makes sense the third example
which I gave a drover time which is
wrong is null handling in johto time if
you pass null into anything it always
just accepted so if you pass null into a
thing that's meant to accept a date or a
time it just uses the current time so if
you do the period between nulla nulla
it's the period between now and now
which might be 0 or it might be a
fraction of a millisecond just depending
on how the clock choosy to do it they
said generally just a bad idea that was
easy to fix that wouldn't be a huge
problem but the final one is the
internal implementation jodha times
internal implementation you know you
guys don't know this but actually it's
kind of unmaintained book okay that's
the dirty secret of jodha diet you know
yeah there are plenty of issues that
have come along that just mean it's
really the way in which it handles
daylight saving time the way how it
handles time zones make it really
difficult you know handling of the gaps
and overlaps between the different
timelines is really really difficult and
it's just not possible to say it has
this behavior in this case and it has
this behavior in this case and it's
reliably going to give you this result
I've had things where it'll return you
won one thing in the eastern hemisphere
and one in the Western Hemisphere yeah
it's that kind of unreliable behavior
that's you know I've tried putting it
down it it's not easy to bend down so
it's the learning of all of that feeds
into jsr 310 but that means there are
three tend ends up looking quite
different in certain ways but if you
like this are 310 I would say this
inspired bikes it it takes the learnings
off rather than being any kind of
immediate derivation so does that answer
what you were asking
call so question for Richard and for
general Java developers that are using
the current dates and calendar systems
because you kind of like give us a brief
overview of the new things that we
should expect and we'll be using on a
day-to-day basis once job rates out I
think the thing to bear in mind is that
the whole approach to the way dates and
times are represented in 310 is
significantly different to the previous
existing implementations in Java
specifically a lot of common use cases
and common concepts are explicitly
modeled right down to the idea of having
combinations of a month of the day for
birthdays and all sorts of things like
that which are hmmm just not really
there and you kind of have to as
mentioned before use zeros for certain
fields which has unreliable behavior
with existing JDK classes so I think
probably the biggest change for people
would be that when there's laying out
the design of their application they'll
have to think about what specific class
they wish to choose should this be a
local date should it be a zone to date
time what's applicable for their
specific scenario and that's something
which they may not have really had to
deal with before because they've just
had these kind of does everything
classes like calendar where you just
throw that around and play around with
it however you want cool
there any of the questions on changes
between I guess what we have now and vs.
java 8 and 3 10
not really that's where that the answer
is right though yeah and so we've talked
about this that Jess r310 API is we've
learned mentioned this morning as kind
of a more seamless model to time and to
try to keep those discontinuities from
showing up in the API but when we sort
of examined that in a leap second
problem and Stephen looked into it
pretty pretty deeply the discontinuity
time actually you know Java gets it from
the operating system the operating
system gets it from ntp and it goes
pretty deep so even the technique which
is sort of advertised in 310 of
smoothing out the leap second over you
know a thousand seconds before and after
requires some part of the system to
actually accurately do that and if java
doesn't know whether the operating
system does that or the operating system
doesn't know that in the ntp server is
going to reliably do it you know you
really can't at the top level
application you can't guarantee that
that's the behavior yeah I mean it turns
out ntp does actually have so this is a
network time protocol it does actually
have the information it can accurately
send out the information that a leap
second is about to happen is happening
and kind of has happened the trouble is
that somebody's done some research and
it's like ten to twenty percent of all
the ntp servers in the world are sending
out the wrong information all the time
alright so this is so broken it's like
there's not that much we can do Upper
our level and it's kind of like I
thought we would be able to but the
reality is you kind of have to say man
you can look at coping behavior I mean
at the Java level you can look at the
stream of time coming in from the lower
level and say oh it looks like there was
a discontinuity after the fact let me
smooth it out but then you you know
because the Java view of time doesn't
necessarily match the native view of
time if you're talking between even
between two you know a native task and a
Java task now they have a gapper skew in
time and that can cause a series of
problems or if you're talking to another
server somewhere else and your time
you know they're there are skews that
are actually better adapted between
servers than there are locally but it's
really better to solve the problem way
back at the source and not have to try
to patch around it in the intermediate
layers I was going to ask I think
Douglas had some comments on this issue
before on the mailing list about what
you thought is the definition of time in
310 bogus key can use the microphone
just so there if ever okay I saw people
moving up I also talked about this is
for the archive I'm Douglas server i'm a
member of the expert group i'm also i do
jdbc back whence this whole process
first started one of the things I was
very concerned about is how this API was
going to handle leap seconds and there's
there's really three choices you either
have a non-si second where seconds vary
in length that's the choice that that
we've made for 310 you very your epic
because if all your seconds are SI
seconds and you ignore leap seconds then
your epic is shifting on every leap
second so that's a possibility and the
the third choice is you model leap
seconds so that's what you can do and
what was the question what was my oh
okay are you doing for my end point on
how how we should be handling leave
seconds I I think that the the smooth
leap second is a fine thing at
high level of the system but ultimately
it's all based off of UTC or if you want
to go below that the PAI or atomic PSM
gps time and UTC has leap seconds so
something in the system somewhere has to
know about seconds and handle them and
there has to be a clear contract between
the different layers as to what's
happening to leave seconds we can't
ignore them and that's what's been a
problem for 30 years is computers
everyone is just kind of oh it's ugly
and ignored it and you can't do that get
wrong answers everyone is fine for a
while you just reboot the system and
then yeah it doesn't bite you again for
a long time or you or you wait for the
Americans to get rid of leap seconds
which is what they've been trying to do
they do 10 years I think I I have not
heard anything that that's moving
forward maybe you were hearing something
that I'm not but wag it went to went to
a the big vote thing at the beginning of
this year and they kind of said we're
not on a vote on it yeah so he's gone
back to working committee for another
three or four years basically yeah well
that's part of the problem here yeah we
don't know whether leap second will
exist in ten years dogs okay
the secured steps and a day is from when
decided directly overhead somewhere
where n is directly overhead again the
radius Earth spins buries its hot 86,400
nice SI seconds it's actually slightly
offered
so hi
for everything
SI second and so if all your Fox ticket
SI seconds which is the same speed of
all the time every day that's good but
if you do that over time some moves and
this guy so leap seconds are inserted
order the twelve o'clock noon Sun is
directly overhead and if you don't do
that the Sun actually is
all this Louis done not just know he
does very averey's yeah hey go up down
up
and
51
because
one of the bigger trouble
things the first one is that
the java did didn't happen
second thing is
the individual presentations
so but what I thought we have in Java
was it just at one day and get me see
only handed that what they all about
that they have
so now we have this all sort of thing
that's how long buddy just told anyone
handle it is that they observe a duel of
other temperatures there is a bc you go
back to the origin
but now everyone is getting exposed to
all these need a start
yeah Douglas take that explain more you
Joby which is the microphone feedback
yes sorry I your voice carries very well
but I don't like standing behind the
thing I'm sorry the jdbc expert group is
absolutely dedicated to supporting jsr
310 and we are all the members of the
jdbc expert group are going to find all
the members of the 310 expert group if
it doesn't make it into JDK 8 this is
really important for us actually the
databases support the databases and I'm
talking ansi sequel support state times
really well it's fairly precise what it
means you have date time and time stamp
they do not have time zone information
nor is there an implicit time zone
java.util.date if you read the Javadoc
has an implicit UTC time zone which is
really yeah it over you till date yeah w
todd has an implicit local time saying
no it's it actually says that the
internal representation is UTC well I I
can kind of see what you mean but yeah
I'm not saying what I if you do the
tasting if you do the two string is
locally gets look at the internals
anyway yes so there is no explicit I
mean there's no implicit time zone
information on a date or timestamp or
time either but an c sequel also defines
time stamp with time zone and so that's
where you need to go if you want to use
a local date then use an c sequel date a
local time as a sequel time a local date
time you use NC sequel time stamp but if
you want to use an offset date time then
you're going to be using time stamp with
time zone because that is specified as
an offset now ansi sequel does not
specify a time stamp with
named a time zone where you get into all
of the daylight savings time rules
that's not in ansi sequel a lot of the
vendors have a time some capability of
supporting timestamps with name the time
zones so if you're working with a
database that does that then you can use
assuming the vendors driver supports
that you can use zone date time to do
that so it's all becomes well defined
now it if you've got a database that's
full of timestamps that you've been
interpreting with some magic as being in
some particular time zone and then now
you're going to start writing code
you're going to have to think about it
and this is this goes back to what
Richard said that's going to be the
biggest transition of moving to 310 is
in the past you just sling around date
or in calendar and it does you know you
write a bunch of code and you get to a
place where you want to do something and
there's no thinking you just used a tour
calendar whichever one you're in the
habit of using but with 310 you're going
to have to make a design decision what
is this chunk of data now what am I what
do I need to do with it what information
do I have and that's going to slow you
down you're going to have to think more
now you're pro you go to debug less and
that's a good thing but it will be a
difference
okay does anybody have any follow-up
questions from from that cool so back to
some of the loaded questions Roger could
you talk a bit about integration a bit
more in a bit more detail our intuition
into OpenJDK and whether you feel that
there might be any opportunity to use
any of the new language features well
we've we haven't looked at it
extensively there's but there are
several new language features in jdk
that we have some potential there's a
construct being introduced as part of
the lambda project that allows default
methods to be added to interfaces and
there's a potential there too it's more
of an implementation optimization where
instead of putting code down in some
classes you could potentially use the
default method to have the
implementation be shared across or the
implementation of a method that has a
consistent behavior across all the types
be done in the superclass more
interesting but you know potentially
less useful we've been looking at
actually using lambda expressions or we
haven't looked very deeply but those
potential to use lambda expressions in
some places in the API but it doesn't it
may not be that constructive for example
one of the constructs in the API is
called a daytime adjuster it's basically
you know a single method of class or
function that can look at a date and
time and modify it in some way you know
if you want the third Friday and in
September you can write a function that
does that you pass it into a datetime
object and the daytime object calls it
back reevaluate sitting it produces a
new daytime object so it acts as a
lambda but if you are thinking of using
lambda in that same context you could
potentially put you know a lambda
expression right there and in the call
to daytime adjuster but in almost every
case the expression that you put there
would more efficiently be done just by
saying you know date time dot you know
with your x plus 5 or something just in
what you directly operating it with
daytime objects so I think the we need
to look at it some more you know
more depth but we haven't really found
the you know sort of a killer
application for lambda yeah I mean
lambdas are good for passing off to to
other systems to process your code but
if it's just calling back immediately it
doesn't gain your great deal so it's not
obvious how lambdas fit into the JDK
whereas default methods in interfaces
and potentially method references those
are possibilities for I think though
from the point of view of the API uses
the immutable style of classes within
3-10 does fit a more functional style of
programming which is being encouraged by
the whole move so the people are
actually coding even and they probably
won't be using those features with 310
it would feel natural to use well I
think this is a thing I mean it's like
functional style jodha time am j sr 3 10
that they're quite functionally sort of
designed libraries you know in terms of
you know being immutable in terms of the
the way the method calls hanging
together that's sort of a style it's
Howdy fit immutability into java is not
always an easy question yeah and that's
kind of what drops out there it's a
different way of looking at it with it
yeah there is one other aspect of the
implementation that we might look at so
there are sort of the primitives for a
data object and time object and then
there's a datetime object and an offset
datetime object but for example when you
add in a one second to a datetime object
the implementation of the sort of the
offset datetime object dispatches to the
date a local accommodation of local
datetime object inside the offset
datetime object which in turn reduce
patches to the time object which then
actually adds the second which sounds a
lot like a functional application of a
function to add a second that's just
dispatched down to the right level where
it's actually evaluated I'm not sure
lambdas actually would help with that
but at the moment it's all sort of
explicitly coded in the invitation
so yeah
question
sounds like
a lot of stuff yeah was described a
whole while back so there is no interval
class so Jojo time has an interval class
which is has a start instant and an end
instant in the same ways you might have
had a local date range from a start date
to an end date these are things which be
useful to business applications but we
don't have them yet then they're kind of
disco so in terms of the broad set of
functionality that's in there there's
not really a whole lot you can take out
without it just not really making my sex
now can we find bits we can take out
probably you know will that save us
maybe I mean
sound apartment
what you're in a position today where
you can go and download it from get out
and you can give feedback and you know
that that's that's the thing that
actually is kind of required in terms of
you us knowing whether it's something
you find user port so yeah that's always
been the case is always on github is
actually officially an early draft
review at the moment which is an
official JCP stage where you're supposed
to get your feedback for 30 days not
that anybody really cares because it's
always open that or it's always an early
draft with you but hey that's that's the
way the game works yeah well sure so
part of the integration steps is where
we've created us a project within
OpenJDK and obviously called 310 to
stage the 310 source code into the
OpenJDK sort of framework and builds
it's getting pretty close but when we
get that in will be able to do built
sort of private builds of the sort of
collected OpenJDK the thing that will go
into OpenJDK and we'll have to figure
out how to make it whether we can make
them available or regularly like they do
with the lambda builds and the rest of
the JDK JDK is built every day every
every week for some download and use
well um November
well yes there i think you know there
there's quite a bit of risk here because
i think there's a lot to do i guess i
would sort of thinking of alternatives
and ways things we might be able to do
so there are sort of five packages
within the date-time API but basically
the core package Minh says chrono
there's a low-level API which gives
access to a lot of datetime
functionality and that was pretty pretty
core the chrono package has the API for
calendar neutral or regional calendars
there's a formatting package sort of a
complete formatting package I could
potentially see that we could fall back
to using simple date formatter with all
of its flaws if there was for some
reason that the formatting package
couldn't you know we couldn't see
collective resources and finishing in
time and there's a separate time zone
API that lets you get details out of the
time zone database you know potentially
you know the time zone behavior that's
built into they all all the api's could
be done without that exposing that
explicit API so you know what we're
talking we will be talking about
alternatives to try to reduce the risk
and make sure that it gets in the three
can they're light as you know I agree it
sounds risky and it's not without some
risk I think you also have to bear in
mind the converse risk in the sense that
because you need you're going to need to
maintain binary compatibility so
standardizing part of the API without
being sure that the other parts are
going to fit in with it imposes design
constraints down the line which you may
realize that you wish you hadn't made
and you kind of already got to AP eyes
which are design decisions that you
probably with hindsight wish you hadn't
made so best not to have a third APR in
that situation just a note for anybody
that's interested in a really quick way
to try out what's available um if you go
to github and go to dr j sorry 10
there's a project called time machine in
there so all this is is it's a
basically we ran a session in London
which was to get people from the local
java community to come in and actually
try out the API so what we have in here
is basically free sets of failing unit
tests so the project loads straight up
into eclipse you can give the API a
once-over and we'd also appreciate your
feedback because it will help us to to
improve what we have so that's what this
bottom link is and on top of that i have
another loaded question and which is
probably more for my benefit but Roger
and Steven could you allude to what
impact you think the doctor Jess our
programmers had in terms of this chair
sir I'm only elude it's pretty loose
actually I think it's very beneficial
the you know 310 actually Steve I
shouldn't see them talk about the
history but I think it's always
beneficial to have sort of a broader
view of the ongoing work the
contributions that the ljc has
volunteered to make to contribute to
writing code writing tests and
validating the api's is is you know but
that's one of the reasons we have the
JCP and expert groups and the diverse
involvement is to get different views
and different contributions yeah I mean
if my perspective acting is kind of been
essential you know I've had a busy year
yeah time is always off of an essence
and everything we do having a full month
year old child doesn't help you
necessarily and being able to get to
work on these things so you know it's it
is an essential aspect of yo balancing
ideas about getting work done you know
you need to have people working with you
on something like this you know it's you
can't just do it when you're right so
that's why I always at events like this
I'm always saying no you come and give
you feedback you know come and ask you
questions come and dry it out because
without that you know it's just a
limited people's opinions the more
opinion you have the better
cool does anybody else have any other
questions guys when you're going to do
the method centers you get a sterile you
want for the new date and times are you
going to take yeah we talked about that
extensively at the jdbc standard session
yesterday sorry Allison I well so I'm
not going to answer your question no
we're tired of adding new methods for
new types it have you looked at jdbc 41
and jdk 7 so you've seen the generic get
method all right so for those of you who
aren't familiar jvc has got about 6,000
methods that are of the form get X X X
where X is some random java type we got
tired of that in jdk jbc 41 which is a
jdk 7 we introduced a generic get object
method it takes a type argument which is
a class so you say get object which
column and the results that you want and
then a class and it will return an
instance of that class or the bar so we
are not going to add any more get XXX
methods so if you want is a offset
datetime from your result set you will
say resultset get object column 3 offset
datetime class ok that's the getter
there is no setter in jdbc for one
because one of the vendors at the very
last minute put the kibosh on the design
and it didn't happen so in 42 we're
introducing a generic setter now when
you're getting a value from the database
you want a Java value when you're
putting something back you want to put
back sequel
so the argument to the generic setter is
not a java class it is not exactly but
we'll skip a whole lot of details an
enum which specifies the sequel type
that you want this thing to be so you'll
say prepared statement dot set object
parameter index my offset datetime of
ansi types time timestamp with time zone
and that says put this offset datetime
into the database with as a time stamp
with times up so again there will be a
generic setter and update methods on for
updatable results house so but Douglas
even if you don't add a new API with a
new type don't use somewhere in the spec
have to say you must support you know
there is a day times to be in the magic
table B 3 will list the new types that's
ok pretty much the only change
so I've got like a couple of minutes
left so if you do have a question or
something that's burning on your mind
now is the time
okay so I was that last minute question
go for it no okay cool I'm so just a
quick note on what people can still do
to get involved and the project on
github there's a public issue list as
well so if you want to have a go at bits
in peace and actually see how this API
works that's that's still an option and
once we actually get the feature
complete there's going to be other
opportunities to like help completing
the testing there's also going the
opportunities for performance tests as
well and so yeah thank you very much for
your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
