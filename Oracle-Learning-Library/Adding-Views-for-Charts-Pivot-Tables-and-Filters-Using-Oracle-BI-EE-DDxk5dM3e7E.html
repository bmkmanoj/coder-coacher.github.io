filters using Oracle bi I am a sales
manager and I want to add a chart to an
existing analysis to better visualize
the revenue for each region for which I
have responsibility I want to replace
the table view with a pivot table view
and add a filters view so that I can
identify any filters that are applied to
the content once I have added these
items I want to save the analysis first
I must find the products by region and
line of business analysis I select
analysis in the search list and then I
enter products by in the search field I
click the search button the analysis is
displayed in the catalog area I click
Edit I want to add a pivot table view
and remove the table view I know that a
pivot table view allows me to better
organize my data and present my data in
a crosstab format I click the remove you
from compound layout button in the table
view I click the new view button and
then I select pivot table the pivot
table view is added to the compound
layout
I want region on the column edge so that
my data is organized better I drag and
drop region above the average order size
column region is repositioned I review
the pivot table and see that the data is
better organized for my immediate needs
next I want to add a chart to the
analysis I click the new View button and
then I select recommended visualization
for comparing values in the select
visualization dialog
I select number three line bar I scroll
to view the chart I drag and drop the
new chart to the right of the pivot
table I want to add a filters view to
the analysis after I add the filters
view I will be able to see the filters
that are being applied to the analysis I
click the new View button and then I
select filters to add the filters view I
can see that the analysis is being
filtered by region and line-of-business
my teams responsibilities include
services and communications in the
Americas and amia regions I can also see
that revenue and build units will not
display when they contain null values I
need to save the updated analysis I've
modified the product by region and line
of business analysis to include graph
pivot table and filters views the pivot
table and chart help me better visualize
my data now I can see which products are
performing the best this will help me
develop a strategy for my team's area of
responsibility thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
