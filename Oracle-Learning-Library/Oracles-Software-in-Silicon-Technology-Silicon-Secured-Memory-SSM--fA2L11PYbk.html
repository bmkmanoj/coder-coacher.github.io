silicon secured memory feature of the
spark m7 processor commonly referred to
as SSM Oracle's revolutionary software
and silicon technology hard wires key
software processes directly onto the
processor to enable high speed analytics
and secure data without adding latency
examples of where we're doing this today
are silicon secured memory data
analytics accelerators and cryptographic
accelerators
this demonstration focuses on the
capability of the silicon secured memory
feature this features safeguards against
invalid or stale memory references and
buffer overruns as each memory is
allocated it can be tagged for each
region of memory when the silicon
secured memory feature is enabled and a
memory references performed the hardware
also verifies the right to access the
memory region if the reference is valid
it completes normally if the reference
is not valid an exception is generated
and the reference is terminated and now
some background on the heartbleed bug
that is being used to demonstrate the
value of the SSM feature to secure your
data the heartbleed bug is a severe
memory handling vulnerability in openssl
the bug is in what's called the
heartbeat extension with in openssl the
way it works is that ssl sends out
what's called a heartbeat signal to see
if the server is online it sends a
specific signal to a server and the
server if online will send the same
signal back to the client heartbleed
takes advantage of the heartbeat by
sending a malicious heartbeat signal
that tricks the server and descending
back more memory than the client is
authorized to access this additional
memory potentially contains usernames
passwords and other unauthorized
information when the SSM feature is
enabled it can protect against the park
bleed bug by detecting an invalid memory
access on the server and issuing an
exception now let's go to the live demo
to show the serious impact of the
heartbleed bug without the SSM feature
enabled then we'll demonstrate the
ability of SSM to detect the violations
of the heartbleed bug and limit their
impact after logging into the software
and silicon cloud you will see the
following web interface page here we
have the ability to create and manage
our own virtual machines we've
previously created three virtual
machines for this heartbleed demo a
spark server for the good user client an
x86 server for the hacker client and the
new m7 based server for the open ssl
server that contains the heartbleed bug
we previously uploaded the client
server programs to the developer cloud
into our own secure storage area
reserves specifically for this account
here are the two client programs the
good user client and the hacker client
and the openssl server interface that we
started on the three separate virtual
machines we begin by first doing a
typical login password authentication
from the good user client to the open
ssl server now we can invoke the hacker
client code that exploits the heartbleed
bug by asking the server for more memory
than it is authorized to access
now we can activate the silicon secured
memory feature and run the hacker test
again this time the invalid memory
access is detected an exception is
generated and the hacker code is
prevented from gaining access to the
unauthorized memory on the server bounds
checking is a method of detecting memory
violations in software and is a feature
of many compilers but the performance
impact can be up to 80 times slower when
compared to SSM which has near zero
overhead we've demonstrated the value of
SSM to secure your data and to do it and
near real time SSM is an effective
debugging feature for testing of
applications before they reach
production or can be used in a
production environment with minimal
impact to performance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
