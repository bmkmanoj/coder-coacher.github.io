basics of file based data import for
oracle salescloud
here is a brief overview of the
application components involved in file
based data import you start with a text
or XML data file and zipped attachments
once you upload those files through the
setup step of your import activity the
files will be stored in the file
repository until they're needed for
processing any changes you make to the
application through application composer
will be visible as you go to map your
fields after you schedule review and
activate your import activity the
application uses the mappings you
specify to populate the interface tables
and then the oracle salescloud base
tables this diagram offers a brief
overview of what happens in the
application however there is a lot that
you must do before you start your import
activity let's take a look at those
tasks you should perform to import data
into Oracle sales cloud the first step
is to compare the fields you have in
your source data with the fields
available in the application knowing
what is available is an essential part
of the data mapping process you must
understand how the standard application
is laid out and how the data is
presented in the application this
example of the trading community
architecture party model illustrates the
need to understand the structure of the
application so you know how to import
data you likely have contacts in your
data contact is not an object in Oracle
sales cloud but a logical entity
representing a person associated to an
organization contact point address and
classification are not fields on the
contact record in the user interface
this information is held as separate
records and different tables so that it
can be associated to different entities
for instance there is no email field on
the contact email is a contact point
record that can be associated to
multiple contact or customer records so
there is a one-to-many relationship
there the best way to understand how
data is structured in the application is
to look at the application itself
however in some cases it may be helpful
to look at an enterprise relationship
diagram or erd to understand the data
architecture continuing with the party
model example here is a portion of Annie
Rd looking at the diagram may be useful
when you need to better understand
relationships between different entities
to find the ER Dee's and other helpful
tools visit the Oracle Enterprise
repository I'll talk about this helpful
resource more in the additional
information segment once you understand
how the data is presented in the
application you may need to add custom
fields objects or choiceless values to
meet your business needs customizations
like adding custom fields are done an
application composer details about
customizations are in the extensibility
guide see the additional information
segment to learn more about that
resource when you customize the
application keep in mind that you must
generate the artifacts required to
support import and export if you don't
do this your custom fields will not be
available for mapping in the file import
tool lookups are lists of values review
lookups to be sure the values pertain to
your business you may choose to adopt
the standard application lookups or
modify the lookups to suit your business
you can edit lookup values through the
setup and maintenance area of the
application once you've made all
necessary customizations you must
prepare and cleanse your source data
files the application accepts both text
delimited files and XML files text
delimited files such as CSV files
support simple one-to-many relationships
or one to many to one relationships text
files are simpler to work with because
you can edit them in a spreadsheet
however text files may require more
import tasks executions when dealing
with complex relationships
xml files support more complex
relationships like one too many too many
relationships xml files can process more
data in a single import task however
editing xml files can be more
complicated you must have knowledge of
xml and an editor you are comfortable
using like XML notepad use text files
whenever possible the customer object is
inherently more complex so xml may be a
preferred choice for that object csv is
the most common file import format CSV
files are comma separated value files
however commas are not the only
acceptable delimiter other delimiter x'
like semicolons and quotes are also
allowed the file can include a header
row in this example the header row
includes the name of both the object and
attribute this is very handy when you
get to the mapping part of the file
import activity we provide file based
data import templates to help you get
started see the additional information
segment to learn more about those
templates when you prepare your source
data files in CSV or XML format keep
these tips in mind take the time to
clean your data to eliminate unnecessary
records ask yourself if you need so much
history you will import each object
using a separate file you will need to
import those files in a certain order to
be sure that a parent object is imported
before a child object for example you
must import sales accounts before you
import the other data that will
associate to those sales account records
unique identifiers or keys help you
identify unique records as well as
relationships between objects leverage
your source system to generate unique
keys source system keys provide the most
flexibility for you and will save steps
in the import process also be sure that
your choice list values match the oracle
salescloud lookup values
here is a sample import file and the
manage sales statuses page in the
application here I can't compare the
status codes on my file to the available
codes some look at values are seated for
you when your environment is provisioned
like these sales statuses other look at
values are generated as required like
business units be sure to verify the
values in your file with the lookup
values listed in the application beyond
lookups you can check other key data
directly in the application in this
example I can match the product group ID
from my source file with the reference
number in the manage product groups task
you can also use reports data export or
web services to gather data once your
source files are clean and ready you can
create your file import activities in
the application keep in mind that there
is a correct order when importing
objects for example you should import
sales accounts first so those records
are available when you go to import
contacts and other data related to sales
accounts see the other segments in this
series for a walkthrough of the steps
involved in creating an import activity
in the application once your import
activity is complete you should check
the status and review any errors then
view the imported data in the
application if necessary fix import
errors and re-import again see the other
segments in this series for a
demonstration that concludes this
