performing pre upgrade tasks this is the
second in a series of eight videos about
upgrading Oracle's so a suite 212 C if
you haven't yet seen the overview video
take a look at that one first they'll
give you a high-level introduction to
the entire upgrade process that I think
you'll find useful in this video we'll
talk about the requirements for
upgrading to Oracle's so a suite 12c and
some tasks you'll need to perform
beforehand
the first task you need to perform prior
to the upgrade is to review the
documentation there's a wealth of
information to guide you in the specific
needs of your upgrade the document
titled planning an upgrade of Oracle
Fusion Middleware introduces Oracle
Fusion Middleware 12c to experienced 11g
users and explains among other things
where to get product distributions and
upgrade tools it describes in detail the
supported upgrade starting points so you
can determine if your version of so it
can be upgraded if your operating system
is supported your database your topology
and so on it provides detailed
information on what to do to bring your
environment into a supported upgrade
starting point you can then read about
recommended backup and recovery
strategies as well as what to do to
prepare your Oracle databases for 12c as
its name suggests the interoperability
and compatibility guide helps you to
determine whether various Oracle Fusion
Middleware components of different
versions or releases will work together
in a supported configuration for example
certain components in your environment
may need to be updated before you
upgrade to so a suite 12c this document
will guide you through the process of
identifying relevant components
determining version information and
avoiding specific interoperability and
compatibility issues there are a lot
more documents than the two we just
mentioned in fact there's a set of web
pages that organizes the 12 1:3
documents to make it easier to find what
you need this is the upgrade and patch
tab of the install patch and upgrade
page for 12 1:3 it includes links to
help you plan execute and troubleshoot
your upgrade
the install tab links to resources to
help you install your development
environment your production environment
and additional products the books tab
provides access to 12 one three books
that address administration concepts
installation interoperability and
upgrade and patching each title is
available in a variety of formats a
particular interest to us in this
conversation are the books in the
upgrade and patching section notice that
there's an upgrade guide dedicated to
upgrading so a suite and business
process management finally you can
access the release notes from the common
tasks page release notes include
late-breaking issues that may not always
be documented elsewhere throughout these
videos will provide links to
documentation on specific topics but we
highly recommend a careful reading of
the relevant documentation before you
begin your upgrade after you've reviewed
the documentation and verified that your
environment meets the system
certification compatibility and
interoperability requirements the next
task is to create a complete backup of
your 11g environment including the
database remember that much of the
upgrade occurs in place making changes
to your existing installation that can't
be undone so if anything goes wrong
you'll need a full backup to be able to
restore your environment and try the
upgrade again there are a number of
additional pre upgrade tasks that are
critical to perform at this stage if
you're using a 32-bit operating system
upgrade to a 64-bit environment verify
it's working properly create an upgrade
a test copy of your production
environment the threats configurations
in Sowa 11g aren't carried over to 12 C
because 12c has shifted over to work
managers for the most part so read the
sella tuning guide revisit your tuning
settings especially the work manager
settings for so on tuning is an
iterative process where you tune run
benchmarks and then retune so to
minimize downtime determine your tuning
setting changes on this test system and
then apply those settings to your
production
after upgrade to save time migrating 11g
data to 12c purged any instance data
that you no longer need to maintain the
upgrade will overwrite some startup
scripts and configuration files save a
copy of any customized files before you
upgrade so you can reapply those
customizations after the upgrades
finished these tasks and others are
important for you to consider before you
begin the upgrade in earnest as you may
recall from the overview video file
based policy stores are not supported in
12c so if you have one you need to
create a database based repository and
reassociate your policy store with that
new repository you'll then need to
backup your environment one more time so
you've reviewed the documentation and
ensure that your environment met the
requirements you've done a full backup
performed a few other tests to prepare
your environment for the upgrade if you
previously had a file based policy store
you've upgraded that to a database based
store and taken another backup now
you're ready for the last two the pre
upgrade tasks installing the Fusion
Middleware 12c infrastructure and so a
software in the next video installing
12c software we'll discuss and
demonstrate the software installation
routine until then I'm Ron pinkerton
