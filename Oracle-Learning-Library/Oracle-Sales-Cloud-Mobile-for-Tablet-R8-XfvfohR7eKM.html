about using Oracle sales cloud mobile
I'm rarely in the office so I need to
view reports and activities from
anywhere even when i'm on a flight each
morning I review various reports there
are 20 pre-built out-of-the-box reports
available to me I can view historical
trends my team's pipeline forecast
reports and even more with all of these
reports I can view high level metrics
but also drill down to more details
in a conversation with one of my sales
reps yesterday I heard that the green
server upgrade opportunity had
progressed much faster than expected
when tracking thousands of opportunities
I need to find specific information
quickly so to find this opportunity I
use one of my saved searches and then
use multiple criteria to get the results
i'm looking for once i found it i get
into the details and edit the
opportunity to bring it into the current
quarter this is great news so I post a
comment to the social conversation
associated with the opportunity
encouraging the team to maintain the
momentum and accelerate the process
with access to the progress on all of
our deals I expect to exceed our numbers
this quarter i can adjust relevant
forecast items to reflect any changes to
give us a more accurate overall forecast
once on board my flight i can continue
to access information using Oracle sales
cloud I make good use of my travel time
and I'm prepared for my next appointment
as you can see Oracle sales cloud makes
it really easy for me to stay informed
and take action as deals progress this
helps improve our forecast accuracy
based on real-time events and activities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
