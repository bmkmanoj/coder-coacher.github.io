a gestures technology I did a
presentation on this last year it was
different than the one I'm doing now had
a lot more people last year though I
guess FX has kind of eclipse my project
since they decided to go ahead and add
multi-touch there's gonna be a session
on that later on tonight I'm excited to
go and see what it's all about I hope
you guys go too so just a little quick
stuff about me I work for the government
the Department of Defense but under that
I have several bosses including Owen arm
which stands for the Office of Naval
Research and NAVSEA where we build
weapons which I can't talk about so
let's just not go there
however NAVSEA makes me stick their
sticker on everything I do too since
they pay half my salary all right so
let's talk about what uh what we're
gonna talk about today this first of all
we're gonna discuss why I'm here what
brought me here the path that led me to
to where I'm standing now then we're
gonna talk about what makes a gesture
all the different parts and pieces we're
gonna go into a great tool it's called
the mt4 J which stands for multi-touch
for Java we'll get into that we'll look
at a little bit of code I'll try not to
blow anybody's mind it's pretty easy
then I'll talk about some research that
I've been doing and HSI which stands for
human systems integration so I'm just a
regular smo but I like to open my mouth
at the government and so they keep
promoting me and giving me people
underneath me and some of the people
that work underneath me even though I
only have a bachelor's degree they all
have PhDs and in head shrinks they're
all head shrinks in fact I call them my
pact of head shrinks I have three of
them and they do the HSI part and they
explained it all to me it's much better
this year than it was last year when I
only had one head shrink working for me
so we'll get into that I think you guys
will find it interesting then we'll talk
a little bit about what you guys can do
have a quick summary and questions and
answers I was gonna have a demo but
unfortunately my laptop it doesn't have
a keyboard it's two touch screens and
when you plug in a projector it
apparently takes one of my screens away
which means I lost my my keyboard so
that makes things a little difficult
even though I do still have touchscreen
capability on the one screen and I
cannot get internet here so both of
those things that are combining to mean
no demo sorry
I'll show you where I'll show you where
you can go to get it though all right so
let's move on so this is what happened I
was working for for the the weapons part
on something that I can't really talk
about and they wanted me to to build
this panel that went in a space where
they didn't have room for a keyboard and
mouse I was like ok no problem we'll
just put a touchscreen in seems like a
great solution right so I got a bunch of
such screens and started playing around
with it and quickly discovered that
touchscreens are really lousy
replacements for mice and keyboards they
don't work well for example some of the
things that that we had problems with
our sliders little slider bars they had
to be three times wider than normal in
order to get above a 95% accuracy on
getting it now the stuff I work on is is
pretty pretty important stuff that
accuracy level when people are getting
shot at is just not you know somebody's
getting shot at and they have to try
three times to get a scroll bar to go
they're not gonna be happy and since
they know how to kill people I didn't
want them coming after me so so I
realized okay there has to be a solution
to this well about that time I got my
first smartphone love it love my
smartphone I don't know how I ever live
without it but I realized hey this
gestures thing that could be our
solution so I started looking around and
see hey are there any gesture stuff out
there that I could use at that time
there wasn't now there is through
FEX apparently as we just found out
yesterday but at that time there wasn't
any other solutions to put gestures on a
regular touchscreen through just about
any of the code the languages the coding
languages so that was a big problem
there wasn't a way to fix it there was
no easy way to fix it so again I have a
big mouth I decided to go to my
superiors and say hey we got to get
somebody to pay for for me to find the
fix for this and we can apply the fix to
everyone and then I said oh and let's
make it available to everyone even the
civilians because she could PR right I
mean you guys liked it when we when we
show that we're using our our tax
dollars for good things am i right so
they were like okay we have this one
program you'll have to give a huge
presentation in front of a really a lot
of really important people and see if
you win it so I went there they had a
lot of really high ranking people a lot
of really important people some
congressmen and I had to give a
presentation I was sweating there was a
lot of other people that were there that
people were shaking while they were
giving their presentations it was pretty
intense and they only had several
million to spend and I got about half of
the money so everybody agreed with me
that this was a was a good problem and
needed a fix and I got tagged to do it
so that's what led me here kind of in a
nutshell so I went with that money and
set up a project now before I get much
further into that let's let's talk about
some definitions that we're all on the
same page there are there's several
different types of touch there's single
touch and multi-touch I don't know if
any of you work in the government but
the government likes to be ten years
behind we don't like to be cutting edge
anymore
we're always exactly what was cutting
edge ten years ago so single touch was
cutting edge ten years ago so that's
what they kind of are pushing me tour
even though I keep trying to tell them
that's dumb let's do multi-touch it's a
long story but anyway single touch is
when you have one point of contact so if
you just touch the surface with one
finger and do something that's called a
single touch gesture then there's
multi-touch gestures where you can have
two 200 whatever this machine on each
screen will take eighteen touch points
on each screen I have one machine that
are one large touchscreen back in my
office that's 32 inches and it takes 38
touches yes I tried it I got all of my
all my friends at the office we all got
together and touched it all at the same
time to test and see how many points it
will take you can't do anything with
more than five I found out so I don't
know why I have that many but I did a
lot of a lot of research on this so in a
gesture is a recognizable pattern of
touch movements that are used for for
user input so things like like a drag or
a flick things that were that we're all
familiar with pinched to shrink a screen
or to zoom those types of things even
taps and double taps are gestures a lot
of people don't realize that so let's
talk about some challenges I had as I as
I discussed earlier there are no
everybody who made gestures so far says
hey there's big money in this
I'm keeping it close so for instance the
Apple people you cannot get their
gesture code for anything sure you could
use it if you buy an Apple product but
you cannot have it same with with Google
Google's a little bit better about it
but I mean Google paid 3 what was a 3
billion dollars to to have to tell
Oracle a year ago
they paid three billion dollars to keep
from being able to have to release their
their gesture code so they thought it
was worth at least 3 billion to keep it
secret
Microsoft has it Carell has it Asus
actually released theirs for a couple
weeks and then they were like looking
around and said oh crap there's money in
this and pulled it all back and started
suing everybody who's trying to use it a
couple other other in
interesting stories with that but there
really isn't or wasn't until FX
apparently any open source touched
things for Java so I had to stick a
bumper sticker on this when I did my
preview to the Admiral he was like that
page needs a bumper sticker so that's my
bumper sticker I don't know what why I
needed one but yeah so let's see so the
next thing that we're gonna talk about
is is gesture meaning state mapping so
there really isn't an agreed-upon
standard yet sort of the iPhone and the
Google how many people have an iPhone
how many people have a droid phone does
anybody have both I have both of my
office they work differently some things
that you do on one don't work the same
on the other the same exact gesture that
you would expect to do the same exact
thing it does different things the
iPhone and the droids they're the two
big players right now but they don't
have an agreed-upon standard there isn't
one this is a problem because people are
expecting whatever they use the most so
people who use the iPhone when they go
to use a product they expect it to work
the way that the iPhone works people use
the droid expect the opposite they
expect what the the way the droid does
it so we're studying this and I'll get
to a little bit more about that in a bit
let's talk about what makes a gesture so
there's a lot of different variables
that go into a gesture for instance you
have direction which includes changes in
direction for example if I'm if I'm just
going this way then you have that
direction but what if I go like this
that's a whole bunch of directions that
I just did velocity as we all know this
is a drag this is a flick what's the
difference accelerated and then came to
a sudden deceleration that is the only
difference between a drag and a flick so
velocity is important we have starting
in ending locations we need to know
where it started where it ended for
those types of for making sure we're
doing it to the right thing and such
and you need to know how long it took
what we're what time did it start what
time did it end and then you have to
have a tolerance for deviation so as we
already discussed I work on weapons and
have you guys tried using a smartphone
while off-roading anyone yeah we have we
put them in the back of seat on vehicles
that I can't really talk about but let's
just say they go really fast make loud
booms and go off-road a lot well the
people in the back seats trying to use
those trying to use gestures they need a
much higher tolerance than what
somebody's sitting at a desk would need
because they're bouncing all over the
place trying to touch a touch screen so
tolerances are also important if it's
multi-touch you have to have two or more
of each of these so it starts to get
kind of complex all right so now let me
talk about this tool I did create this
tool I found this tool this tool is made
by somebody in Germany a company in
Germany I think it's actually one guy is
the creator here by any chance no okay
just wondering it's a great tool it what
it what he made it for my understanding
is he made it for games he wanted to be
able to do games with touch and so he
designed it for games to be able to get
the inputs for me from your screen t2
java the way that it works is it treats
each each point of contact like a mouse
like a mouse pointer so basically it
keeps track of all these different mice
pointers or you write the code rather to
keep track of all these therefore mice
pointers this just changes the touch
output to mice pointer input so that you
can easily manipulate it you have to
have a tool like this if you're gonna
write Java unless of course you're using
Java FX I don't know how they do it yet
so this this tool is very important it's
it's been very handy I'm very
appreciative of it I had nothing to do
with it I don't get any money for
promoting it but
it's I'm very thankful that they created
this it's made my job a lot easier and
anybody out there who wants to create
gestures is the first place they should
go
MT 4j org they have desktop touchscreen
stuff completed they have a beta 4 for
Android phones that will never be an
iPhone 1 because Apple doesn't allow it
Apple says no so you can go there and
you can play with it the iPhone 1 works
pretty great I've played around with it
even though it's just the beta version
it actually works quite well if anybody
has any questions don't be afraid to
stop and ask okay so let's let's look at
creating a gesture had actual nuts and
bolts to it so some examples come with
mp4 J this is not one of them however I
used one of the examples that came with
it it comes with the drag it does not
come with the flick they did not write
flick code in they just wrote drag code
in so I guess they didn't need to flick
anything in the games that he wrote so
as we as we talked about earlier what's
the difference between a drag in a flick
well as I said the difference is in a
drag you're going at a steady speed from
one point to another the only difference
between that and a flick is you're
accelerating your velocity is increasing
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
add the flick to the drag it's really
easy to do it's only a couple lines of
code which is why I picked it I didn't
want to blow anybody's mind and I didn't
have a lot of time to go into a lot of
the more complex ones you can do a lot
more complex things than this but we'll
just start here all right so first off
there's only three methods that they
have for the drag the first one is
cursor started as I mentioned we need to
know exactly where where we start at
it's called cursor started because as I
mentioned the empty 4j tool converts
touches to cursors to Mouse pointers
essentially so when once you touch the
screen this basically kicks it off and
says hey I'm star
a gesture and let's see where it goes
then we have cursor updated which is the
main meat of it and then once you lift
your finger off its cursor ended which
makes sense right they all make sense
and what they do so once you once you
close the gesture then you're done so
the only thing we need to change
actually is the cursor updated but we'll
look at the code for the other two as
well so let's start with hopefully it's
readable let's start with the cursor
started code it looks messy there's
there's it's not really well commented
this is actually the code from mp4 J
unedited you you can see what it does
though if you if you spend enough time
and looked at it it's pretty easy to
tell what's going on here so I'm not
gonna spend my time going line by line
through this part so we can see what
happens here we're basically just
starting the the gesture so this is
where we end the gesture this is the
code for ending it again unedited I
didn't modify this at all it's the drag
code for for that came with mp4 J and
this just lets us know that we stopped
the gesture give everybody a couple
minutes to look it over
all righty so now let's get to the good
stuff so this is actually the tire
update one this will do either a drag or
a flick the drag code is I'm color blind
so I hope it's red I think it's supposed
to be red the edited code is red that's
the part I added for a four to change
the drag to a flick the other stuff is
what was there ahead of time so what did
I do
well essentially I just said I got a
vector and said hey if this if the
velocity vector gets higher then then
this minimum velocity then it's a flick
it's not a it's not a drag any longer
makes sense right because we're if it's
a drag we're going at a slow steady
speed if it's a flick we're gonna be
accelerating so at some point we're
gonna hit a minimum threshold that says
hey I've been accelerating and actually
the minimum velocity also can be gotten
from the start where you take a snapshot
at the start I have a lot more complex
code than this for other things but this
is just easy to show so so by using the
velocity vector we can see how fast how
fast the fingers go on we can see where
it's at
does anybody have any questions about
this I mean it's pretty straightforward
actually it's it's fairly easy to do to
get started in gestures is really easy
doing things like this it's pretty
straightforward it's not really all that
complex it seems pretty daunting but it
really isn't and you can do amazing
things with it and you can patent those
amazing things and - oh wait that's
Apple never mind
or you could baby seal or you can sue
Google see whoever you want make your
gestures first
hey Apple got three billion three
billions a good chunk of change I'm
thinking I got three patents alrighty so
let's talk a little bit a little bit
about the research that we're doing and
actually it's when we get to the HS HSI
part you guys I think are gonna really
find this interesting so as I said I did
a project that's called IAR which stands
for independent Applied Research I spend
about four hours a day basically half my
day working on this it's being written
for Java its intended for Java and it
will be open source when I'm done with
it
I'll be releasing it to everybody we
want to benefit the community at large
we want to make you guys feel
comfortable doubt that our tax dollars
are going to great causes so the Navy
also uses touchscreens on some of the
systems and we want to be able to add
gestures to the systems without having
to buy proprietary hardware so what are
the goals to develop a standard library
of human system integration approved
gestures to make it easier to generate
new gestures and to make the library
available for use so now we're getting
into some of the HSI research this were
my I had shrinks come in and basically
what they did is they took about 200
individuals of different walks of lives
sat him down with a smartphone and a
large touch display and they asked them
to do different things different tasks
it was just a blank screen on both sides
and they said for example in this case
go back go back a page how would you do
that and they had to without any
prompting so show how they would they
would go back a page using a gesture why
is this important well
if if a lot of people do the same thing
then it's gonna be natural and
instinctive for people to do that if you
get a high group of people all doing the
same exact thing then that's what the
gesture should be for that task if it's
all over the place
then that's gonna be a hard gesture to
make because nobody's gonna know it and
it's hard to get tutorials for gestures
because they they don't really have a
button or a little question mark you can
push people got to kind of know the
gestures you can train them which a lot
of us have been trained by this by our
smart phones but really what do we do on
our smart phone if you think about it we
tap we drag we flick and we pinch and we
spread that's what most of us do that's
it if you think about it
however our smart phones can do a lot
more gestures than that but most of us
don't even know because they're not
intuitive and
no but there's no way to train us how to
do it so for example with the back one
on it turns out that it's different on
the devices it's usually somewhat the
same but 15 percent said that to go back
you should do a flick 23 percent thought
it should be a single tap somewhere and
62 percent thought it should be a swipe
which is a drag the those head shrinks
they just they don't like the word drag
so they change it to just white for some
reason on a cell phone
to go back people thought you should do
a lime which is also a drag like I said
they're funny people and they're always
analyzing my head
23% that said that you should point so
that's that's just like I don't even
know how people try to do it but like a
short drag is the way that they explain
it to me
5% actually did a sideways V so a less
than sign to go back pretty create if I
thought you know because these are
people that that have don't have
experience to smartphones
and they were like well if I wanted to
go back I would probably want an arrow
or something so they did a sideways V so
I'm gonna show you a bunch of the
results that we got on the next slide
but really quick I want to talk about
how they are if it's favorable that
means that a lot of people did the same
thing if it's reasonable that means some
people did the same thing and if it's
unfavorable that means people were all
over the place so here it is hopefully
we can read it it's a lot of information
on one slide it's actually two columns
I'm sorry this is the way my head
shrinks gave it to me I tried to get
them to give it to me another in another
form but they didn't had time for me to
turn this in for public release now let
the interesting thing here is looking
back these are actually ordered in the
order of how of how congruent they are
look it back it's almost at the bottom
of the first column it's near the middle
now I'm gonna come back to this slide
but let me go back to this slide with
back we saw 62% did the same thing on a
touchscreen 72 on a on a mobile device
and that is not reasonable they did a
whole formula my head shrinks came up
with the whole formula and all this
stuff which I couldn't show because the
public release people wouldn't let me
they're mean like that and we will show
it though we're gonna release all of
this five neat all of this research at
the end of 13 and a year from now
basically but back is is near the bottom
so what was favorable pan almost
everybody did the same thing for pan
moving an item that's simple everybody
knows how to move an item right so it's
funny I got actually they didn't want me
in the room because I thought I would
spoil it but I got to watch video of
some of the tests like the cut every
single person did something different
200 people did something different no
two people did the same thing
for cut think about that thinking to
yourself how would you do a cut a
gesture for cut cut something we do a
lot what would you do I have no clue
what I would do and I've done tons of
gestures I've been working on gestures
for a while I thought that was extremely
interesting
every single person did something
different for cut some people put their
fingers on the screen and did scissor
motions some people did pinches some
people did circles but every single
person did something different some
people struck it out it's crazy
again all of this research and how
exactly the exact digits will be
released in the year and they will be
for public consumption maybe I'll even
get to come back and share them next
year here copy was also not very well a
lot of people they were like maybe five
or six people that did the same thing
with copy it's just not intuitive but
these are these are tasks that we do a
lot so what does this mean
somebody needs to make a gesture for cut
and copy for these things on the bottom
and start training us how to do these
and if you do patent it and Sue Google
and Oracle I mean Google and Apple don't
see work class forget I said that that's
bad
so make yourself a couple billion you
know good stuff but these are these are
seriously cut and copy who doesn't cut
and copy I do it all the time I was
doing it when I was trying to get this
presentation up today I had to do it to
get something on the on the drive to
make this available for you guys later
we cut and copy all the time but there's
no jet no no no nesters to do that that
people recognized so let's look at some
of the other ones that that I think are
pretty funny
undo save these are things that we use a
lot also extremely unfavorable even redo
closing an app you would think closing
an app would be more favorable but it's
not people did tons of people did
different things there was very little
congruence the things that that are
favorable are switching to the next step
switching to a previous app moving an
item as I said catch actually did pretty
good
so I'm not sure exactly what catch means
I tried asking them and they explained
it to me in psychology psychology ease
which I don't speak but they think I do
so they up because I'm their boss they
think I should know psychology ease and
they like to talk to me that way and
then I when I say English English they
get upset with me but anyways so does
anybody have any questions about any of
these yes
you could just put a big button on the
screen but you know with with screen
sizes and things we don't always have
room for that kind of stuff actually
that's actually an excellent question
think about a menu bar think about a
menu bar this is one of the things that
I discovered was really bad and actually
trying to save stuff did not work well
on a touch screen without gestures when
you touch a menu bar things drop down it
works fine with getting it to drop down
you want to hit the save and that drop
down file menu good luck good freaking
luck you will almost never get it in
fact I could demonstrate it on this when
we're done with the presentation you
will always get the one below it or
above it never fails even happens to me
on my cell phone so that's why the menu
bar needs to go away for touch screens
menu bars are completely uneffective but
there's no gesture yet to do so a lot of
the things that we do on the menu there
isn't there's no gesture for save that's
that's wildly recognizable there's no
gesture for undo redo all the things
that we normally get exit on a menu bar
they just don't exist there and I say
there's big money and people who invent
the gestures yes
right
right
that's an excellent question in there
there are actually different schools of
thought on that and I personally believe
that it should be both we should be able
to customize their gestures but there
should be a standard so this laptop
actually does the same thing I can make
my own gestures if I want to open Guild
Wars 2 because I like play Guild Wars 2
I could make a gesture to open Guild
Wars 2 and it'll only do that so there
there are things out there that do stuff
like that getting it into a national
program the gesture inside the program
that's a little bit harder and that's
where where this stuff comes in but yes
it's it is great to be able to to create
your own gestures and I'm actually
working on trying to get that in Java I
wasn't supposed to tell you that though
so please don't tell the government I
told you that in if I succeed that will
be released as well yes
right
right
right
right there single touch
yes you can use this as single touch I
like I said the government always 10
years behind ten years ago there weren't
so many multi-touch screens so seriously
I have two single touch screens a
multi-touch screen in this laptop that's
multi-touch and I have a bunch of iPads
and phones and stuff like that that they
let me buy and yelled at me saying why
are you getting so many toys but anyways
they will I work mostly on the single
touch the for when I do actual
government integration of this and yes
you there are solutions that the flick
is the nut is the obvious one that I use
for that it's through this study it's
what everybody expects to work when
you're trying to scroll stuff a flick
works great a drag also if you want to
go more slow so you would want it to
create drag and flick into that and that
those are both single touch gestures
they don't require multi-touch
right that's an excellent question and I
actually actually tested that I was
worried about that I was like what kind
of performance am I gonna get so I cut I
plugged one of my single touch
touchscreens into a 486 laptop because
the government doesn't like the throw
stuff away so we have a lot of these
things laying around in fact we never
throw stuff away we blow it up long
story but I'm serious when we're done
with our laptops we take a ball out put
them in a pit throw explosives in there
and blow them up it's it's all kinds of
fun but it's less than productive but we
just happen to have 46 and I'm talking
this thing was so old when I when I
accidentally tilted it sideways the hard
drive slid out and fell on the floor I
was like I'm not even sure this thing's
gonna work but I plugged it in plug my
touchscreen monitor into it ransom code
I saw no performance hit from doing
touch screen into that into that laptop
there was and it doesn't get much slower
than that these days so it actually
turns out that that touchscreen send it
fairly fast and that the perceiver
thinks it's just mice so especially with
the single touch it's no slower than
using a mouse so you really don't have a
hit and performance and some of the
multi-touch if you want to get really
crazy and have like graphics and
particle effects which I have done you
can get so you can get slow you can make
it slow if you want to but you got a try
so any more questions about this table
I'll move on to the rest of the
presentation all right so what are what
are we gonna do one of my my head
shrinks working on for me they're gonna
make a style guide which is a list of
standard gestures that are available in
the in the library that I'll be
releasing the API that I'll be releasing
and they'll recommend where you use them
so we'll kind of try to have a standard
so it'll be all the gestures that I've
created
we received or whatever and where we
think through Studies on human beings
they should be used we will will try to
encourage standards while still allowing
for novel gesture use like like you said
it's important that that you have that
that you let people make their own so
what do we what do you plan to do in the
future well we want to assess gesture
function relationships so look at things
like form factor interaction styles and
specific scenarios or task sets things
like a replacement for the menu bar
there needs to be a replacement for the
menu bar because we can't have that
anymore we want to compare the
effectiveness of specific gestures in
relation to specific functions and we
want to do organ amitis essman we
already have done some of that it turns
out that if you have a wall a
touchscreen like you said you have a
wall if you have a wall if you use it
for a long time you get something called
gorilla arm and that's because your your
arm from using it so much feels so
freakin heavy that it feels like you're
dragging it so hence the term gorilla
arm it also turns out that having it a
surface flat in front of you like you
would with a with the pad on a table is
not the best way either the best way is
actually to have it at about this angle
at about a thirty five degree angle in
front of you and our genomic research
has has found that if you do that you
actually it's actually less strained to
use a touchscreen that it is a keyboard
if you think about it keyboards are bad
that they give you carpal tunnel and all
that all kinds of stuff if you do a
touchscreen at the right angle you won't
get carpal tunnel so and there's tons of
other advantages I could talk about
advantages to touch screens all day one
of the key ones is you don't have to
take your eyes off the data because I
work for the government and as I said
people use this stuff when they're under
fire we don't want them taking their
eyes off the target to move stuff and
even though I've been typing and coding
for years when I when I code on a
keyboard I look at my fingers and then I
look up and see all the mistakes I made
how you guys are but I'm guessing
soldiers are not touch typists either
especially when they're wearing gloves
and stuff so it's important that we have
them be able to keep their the data and
their interaction with the data all in
the same field of view which touch
screens allows alright so what can you
guys do make some gestures make some
gestures and send it to the empty for
j.crew I used to have my email on here
but last year when I did this
presentation somebody from a foreign
country that is doesn't like the u.s.
started sending me bad emails so that
email got shut down and I can't give my
email out anymore
but you could probably all right so this
is uh yeah please make some gestures and
like I said get impacted it's great
there's there's tons of room out there
still for patenting gestures I've
already patent three I'm hoping that
Oracle or Google uses them so that Uncle
Sam can get lots of money from cuz I
don't get my own patents I have to Pat
file it through the government so is
that are there any other government
workers in here that know what I'm
talking about so you guys know exactly
what I'm what I deal with on a daily
basis so yeah do it send it to Mt forge
a take a look at the empty 4j project
its hasn't been updated in a while
I'll admit it was like April of 2011
when I was last updated but I have a
feeling if he gets enough emails he
might get a get hoppin on it again but
it's actually pretty complete as is
there's a there's some places there we
you can that ask questions and and stuff
and look at forums so take a look at
that page it's a empty 4j org so real
quick I just want to give some thanks I
want to thank the Navy for letting me do
this
it's great to be paid to play it's a lot
of fun I really like it but it is work
it is hard work and please don't think
I'm like the GSA I do like coming to
conferences but I don't drink so it's
I'm not here for the party stuff and I'm
not gonna be running down the hosting in
any songs or anything like that but they
do the baby it was gracious enough to
let me do this and a large part of the
reason why they agreed on this though
one of the key selling points is because
I told them that I wanted to make it
public release and we have a big PR
problem right now so that was like hey
this would be good PR if we made this
and send an out and that was one of the
deciding factors on why I got the money
and and other other people didn't so I'm
really thankful for them for giving me
this chance I'm I'm really thankful to
empty for J as I've said in the past my
co-workers who've helped out in various
ways my employees Oracle for letting me
speak here for the second time and to
all of you for coming and staying till
the end thank you really appreciate it
does anybody have any questions
oh I do have a fact that's right let's
see I have two different facts one for
when I get for government people and
want to give for regular people so where
do I see this going well mice and
keyboards are hit are gonna be history
they're already clearing out space next
to typewriters and museums to put a
keyboard and mouse it's inevitable we're
all moving to touchscreens we have so
many touchscreens in our lives
all of us have smartphones many of us
have have pads
there's touchscreens everywhere you
can't you can't get your money out of a
bank without touching one there's
touchscreens and cars
there's touch screens everywhere most of
us don't even realize how much we
interact with touch screens the days of
the keyboard of mouths are gone you can
already get laptops like mine that don't
have a keyboard it doesn't you can come
up and look if you want to see if you
don't believe me and they're gonna be
gone so we need this we need gestures
so I already talked about the hardware
thank question that somebody had am i
enjoying this yes I love this this is
fun this is more cutting-edge than my
usual work which is ten years behind the
technology curve so this is great stuff
I'm having a lot of fun yes okay right
right
that's a great question and actually
right and and actually that that is that
already has been been tested out how
many of you have heard of swipe you've
heard of swipe says swipe came with some
of the droid phones early on and I think
it's back now we swipe you don't ever
lift your finger to type you use one
finger you don't ever lift it except for
when you want at stop words so you do a
whole word lift your finger to do a
space and actually they did a study or
we did a study with swipe we gave it to
a bunch of college-age kids that hadn't
used it before and we gave it to them
and and tested them first we tested them
on their typing speed on the keyboard
and they all did decent but not great
you know because they were college kids
and we gave him them a swipe phone and
tested him right after we gave it to him
they did horrible horrible their their
typing speed was way down so we had him
we let him keep them and had him come
back three weeks later and most of them
were right about where they were with
typing and three weeks so really like
that's interesting so two weeks two
months after that we brought him back in
and every single one of them was swiping
faster than they ever typed every one of
them I heard somewhere I don't know if
it's true or not that somebody using
swipe actually broke the typing words
count speed record using swipe so yes
there will be new ways of interacting
they will be probably a lot faster more
efficient and more natural because the
keyboards really right
right right absolutely right absolutely
and there there is another issue though
that that brings up a lot of people have
a hard time adjusting to lack of a
haptic response the haptic responses you
feel the keys you feel them press in and
some keys have bumps on it like the GM H
or something like that so you lose that
when you go to a touchscreen well sort
of they actually have invented touch
screens where buttons come out of the
screen it's really freaky and it breaks
down a lot so I don't recommend going
out and getting one because they're
super expensive the then the Marines
have one and they let me play with it
for a couple hours one day it was a lot
of fun but this is an issue the haptic
response is an issue on most
touchscreens that what they're they try
to replace it with clicking sounds and
such but the haptic response is
something that we will have to get past
but it seems like as we're getting more
and more used to not having the haptic
response it's actually not that big of a
deal so a lot of people are are turning
out to be just fine some say they could
never do it without the haptic response
but most people actually get along okay
without it so are there any other
questions yes
where
sometime and I
you realize there was additional data
submarine
right
research done in two
that's that's why we did that that that
table that I showed earlier that's why
we did that to find out what's intuitive
because we we looked at that and we
discovered that as I said earlier there
really is no way to have a help tutorial
or whatever I mean you can force people
to do one when they first started up but
they hate that because no let's be
honest when you buy something new and
shiny the first thing you do is not I
want to I want to be forced to do this
stupid tutorial you want to get in and
play and then they forget how to open
the tutorial and they never ever go back
to it so that doesn't really work that
well there really isn't a great way to
get a help for gestures because they
don't have a visual cue
they don't exist visually so the the way
that we're trying to do that is to just
discover what's natural for all of the
different gestures and just have it be
intuitive for people to do it
as as my slide showed for some of them
like cut and copy we're a long way off
as I said with cut every single person
did something different every single one
we had no two people do the same thing
out of 200 people that's pretty amazing
there were 200 different gestures per
cut out of 200 so yes this is a huge
problem do I know how to solve it no I
don't not yet I'm sorry maybe next year
I'll get my shrinks right on it call
them up later today I need to anyways so
they hate it when I call them shrinks
too but I pay their bills so they get by
any other questions alright thanks for
coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
