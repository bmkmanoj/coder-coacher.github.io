engagement and monitoring presents using
indicators to discover intent here I'll
show you how easy it is to use social
engagement and monitoring to get
insights into the social media
conversations taking place among
consumers I will start with listen and
go to the dashboard tab and from here
click indicators let's expand our group
and select the topics we're interested
in which our database cloud and Java
cloud here you see a list of indicators
these are pre-configured semantic
filters that give visibility to
conversations that fall within a
specific context such as consumer
interest and intent for example the
favorable indicator collects
conversations that say what consumers
like about a brand although you can
choose as many indicators as you want
i'm interested in customer service and
intent to switch and we'll select those
now you see the charts populated for
both topics you can click on the bar to
see more information about the topic in
the themes pop up you see the list of
conversations that are around customer
service the themes tab gives us a
summary of what consumers are saying at
the bottom of each message there is a
sentiment expressed in the conversations
for example this one is neutral
here's a negative one and here's a
positive one other key information is
the content type and the customers
gender indicators can be used to
identify consumers for one-to-one
engagement and help build long-term
relationships with your brand to learn
more about engagement you can see our
other demos on the engaged topics so
that's how easy it is to use social
engagement and monitoring to get
actionable insights into the social
media conversations taking place among
consumers please visit our documentation
