with a desktop integration suite video
this video covers what is desktop
integration suite or D is for short what
applications can be used with desktop
integration suite how to contribute and
edit content using desktop integration
suite and finally how to connect to web
Center content server desktop
integration suite is an application that
integrates your desktop experience with
Oracle's web Center content server
allowing you to easily manage files
directly from your desktop using
applications you notice such as
Microsoft Windows Explorer desktop
applications like Microsoft Word and
Excel and email clients like Microsoft
Outlook and Lotus Notes when you
integrate Windows Explorer with content
server the top level folders directory
is added to the Windows Explorer
hierarchy providing a means through
which you can connect to and manage
content servers when you right-click a
content item a pop-up menu appears with
content server options such as chicken
checkout and content information you can
check content into the content server by
using drag-and-drop or copy and paste
depending on how your content server is
configured you may have profiles
available they contain default metadata
values you can change the profile or
edit the metadata values upon check-in
once checked in the new content item has
the metadata values assigned during the
check-in process essentially you work
with content server items in much the
same way you do with other folders and
files in a file system although some
tasks may have a different effect
content can be open from windows
explorer or directly from any of the
native applications using the open
option in the oracle UCM ribbon then you
can browse to or search for the desired
file if the edit option does not display
the content item is checked out by
another user you can select view to open
a read-only copy or a new copy
when you open a file using any one of
the integration methods the content item
is also checked out of the content
server preventing anyone else from
editing it when you save a file that is
open in your desktop application the
file is saved to cache it is not
actually saved in the server until you
close the file and check it into the
content server if you prefer to change
any metadata values simply select the
Edit metadata checkbox and click OK
if your edit head item requires a review
process you can take advantage of
workflow metadata fields to initiate
that process automatically provided your
system has been configured to do so
simply select the desired workflow along
with the values for each step and click
OK your item is checked in the content
server and the workflow initiated email
client integration allows you to
integrate Microsoft Outlook or Lotus
Notes with the content server as a
result you can check email messages and
their attachments into the content
server directly through your email
client and share them with others
however you cannot check them out using
the email client depending on how your
server is configured you may have access
to digital access manager features which
allow you to define and provide images
and videos in specified formats and
sizes when you check in email messages
with attachments into the content server
you have the option of checking in an
attachment separately from its email
message or checking in both as a single
item you can set this to be handled
automatically in addition you have the
option of checking in only the
attachment or only the email message
to download the desktop integration
suite client login to content server
from a web browser expand the my content
server tray and click my downloads then
download the appropriate version for
your machine and follow the installation
screens once the client is downloaded
and installed you are ready to connect
to the content server there are two URLs
you will need the server WebDAV URL and
the cgi URL as you type in the server
name the URL is automatically inserted
into both the WebDAV URL and cgi URL
edit those fields if necessary and click
OK</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
