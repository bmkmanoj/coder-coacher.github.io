Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud control
13 scene demo series and helps you
understand and configure notification
blackouts unlike the regular blackouts
that suspend monitoring on the targets
in order to perform maintenance
operations notification blackouts are
solely for suppressing the notification
on target while the agents continues to
monitor the target MMS shows the actual
target status along with an indication
that the target is currently on the
notification blackout events will be
generated as usual but even
notifications are suppressed in a
nutshell this feature allows you to have
monitoring visibility on a target under
maintenance period let me take you to
the process of creating notification
blackout for a database target instance
from Enterprise Manager cloud control
console navigate to enterprise menu
monitoring blackouts opt to create the
blackout and in the selection dialog
select the notification blackout option
and create in the create notification
blackout page you would opt to enter
either of the maintenance option
depending on your need select the first
option under maintenance if the target
is under plant maintenance and an e/m
administrator do not want to receive any
notifications during the notification
blackout period since the target is
brought down deliberately for
maintenance the duration is not
considered by calculating availability
percentage selling the second option non
maintenance if the target is
experiencing unexpected downtime such as
server crash the administrator do not
want to receive alerts as they are
already aware of the issue and are
currently working to resolve it however
availability percentage computation
should consider the actual target status
during the notification blackout
duration by default and the maintenance
option is selected now select the
targets to be added to the notification
lockout further demo let's choose a
specific database target instance to be
patched one could opt to enter other
required scheduling parameters and
submit the Blackhawk creation process
the notification blackout just created
is displayed with the type
differentiating if it is set for
maintenance or not and you can choose to
see the details by selecting the row and
scrolling down for the information in
the oil targets page for the specific
database target instance added to the
notification blackout observe the target
status icon corresponding to
notification Blackhawk for maintenance
note that the actual target availability
status is reflected next to the spanner
icon navigate to database monitoring
status history page to check the
availability percentage note that the
availability is 100 percentage though
there is a finite notification blackout
time as seen in the pie chart this is
due to the fact that notification
blackout is set for maintenance as shown
in the current status or as indicated by
a target status icon message now let me
show the difference when a notification
blackout is set for unplanned non
maintenance mode I've shut down the
target database instance to represent
unplanned downtime create the
notification blackout to repeal the
issue which caused the database to
shutdown select the second option non
maintenance and add the database
instance target notification blackout
created with non maintenance option set
has a specific type clearly conveyed the
option chosen in all targets page for
the specific database target instance
it's status icon reflects the down
availability status and the little dot
indicates that it's under notification
blackout navigate to its monitoring
status history page to check the
availability percentage observe that now
the target downtime is included in
availability percentage calculation and
the current
status indicates that it is under
notification blackout during
notification blackouts no actions
including notifications are performed
over incoming events but an
administrator would want visibility into
latest events before stopping the
maintenance to monitor the events during
maintenance window that's either during
blackout or notification blackout
duration navigate to incident manager
console and examine the view events
recorded during blackout that concludes
the demo on configuring notification
blackout thank you for watching this
