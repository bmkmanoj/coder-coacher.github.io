Cloud Control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I will show you how to use
Enterprise Manager Cloud Control to
create fusion middleware provisioning
profiles these profiles can then be used
for future provisioning or cloning
operations being able to provision or
clone from a profile simplifies the
middleware installation and
configuration process and ensures that
any Oracle Fusion Middleware software
being installed across your data center
meets the IT standards in your
organization this video is applicable to
Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud control
12c release for with Fusion Middleware
plug-in release 12.1 point zero point
seven Oracle Enterprise Manager supports
the creation of three different types of
provisioning profiles the first and
simplest type is an installation media
based provisioning profile this type of
profile execute one or more previously
downloaded product installers you can
download this installation media from
the standard Oracle edelivery site or
the Oracle technology Network site
administrators use this type of
provisioning profile to perform a fresh
installation of weblogic server for the
very first time the second type is an
Oracle home provisioning profile this
type of profile captures an existing
Oracle middleware installation that has
already been discovered as an enterprise
manager target this profile includes any
modifications or patches you've made to
the base installation as well
administrators use this type of profile
to provision custom installations on one
or more hosts the third and final type
is a WebLogic domain provisioning
profile this type of profile is captured
from an existing dome
which has already been patched
configured and discovered as a managed
target in enterprise manager this type
of provisioning profile is used to both
install weblogic server software and
configure a new WebLogic domain
to create a fusion middleware profile I
will need to log in as an administrator
who has been granted the provisioning
designer role
navigate to the Middle where
provisioning page this page provides a
summary of all the middleware
provisioning profiles and deployment
procedures that are available to the
administrator from the profile section
click on the create menu to expose the
three types of middleware provisioning
profiles that I introduced earlier first
I will create a provisioning profile
based on an existing WebLogic domain be
sure to provide an appropriate name and
a detailed description so that you and
others can distinguish it from other
profiles then select an existing
WebLogic domain target in this example I
will select a domain that has previously
been configured for Oracle so a suite
once I select the source domain the
domain home and host fields
automatically get populated if the
domain relies on a relational database I
can also create a database profile but
this task is beyond the scope of this
demonstration
provide the necessary credentials for
the selected Oracle home and WebLogic
domain targets and test these
credentials
you
optionally customize the schedule and
upload location by default the profile
is created immediately and it's stored
in a default location within the
software library
you
while the first job is running I will
create another provisioning profile that
is based on an existing oracle home
remember that this will not capture a
domain configuration only the software
installation and any modifications that
I've made to it
choose an existing oracle home target
and then provide its credentials
you
finally I will create a basic
provisioning profile that simply run
some existing installation media
for example assume that I've previously
downloaded the standards so a suite 11g
installer jar file from the Oracle
technology Network
note that enterprise manager supports a
variety of different Fusion Middleware
products and versions
you
next I select the host target and
credentials to which I've downloaded the
installation media files
you
and then I select the directories on
this host where the installation media
resides in this example sua sweet
requires an Oracle WebLogic server
installer asso installer and optionally
an Oracle Service bus installer as well
you
I can also track the progress of any
provisioning jobs from the procedure
activity page
and for troubleshooting purposes I can
view the results of each step involved
in the creation of a new provisioning
profile just click a specific step on
the left side of the page to view these
details
you
after a profile is created I can click
on the profiles name to view additional
details about it such as when it was
created and who created it if I select a
WebLogic domain profile then I can also
view additional domain details like
servers machines clusters and even data
sources JMS servers and persistence
stores
so that concludes this demonstration on
creating three different types of
middleware provisioning profiles with
Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud control
12c next you can use these profiles to
run middleware deployment procedures and
quickly provision new environments
