of this presentation was not recorded we
are joining the program already in
progress so we started with very basic
kind of candy bar kind of device and
then those have been evolved so then
came QWERTY and then now we recently
launched the asha 311 which is a full
touch device now although i mean you
know these are not very uh very much
visible here in these kind of markets in
the US for example but then in markets
developing countries these are still top
selling and in these kind of markets
nokia is still one of the leaders and we
are making more and more these devices
smarter and then we are building in more
capabilities there which I am going to
kind of talk about here so i will get
into the sdk a little bit later because
considering that you know i will talk a
little bit more about the platform and
the Java ME part of it and then perhaps
SDK we can keep it towards the end where
I do a demo so this is the developer
nokia com it this is the one place that
you go to download the sdk to download
up to get details etc so what is the
offering so what we have is we have a
standard Java ME offering and then so
typically all the standard mems a subset
is supported and even if you consider
these je sors there are extensions for
certain GS ours like jsr 179 where the
extensions have been created to support
these kind of devices which for example
179 extension has been created because
these devices do not support GPS so we
have created an extension for cell ID
based positioning so using the
triangulation mechanism you can get the
location of the mobile pretty pretty
accurately in
situations so in addition to the MSA je
sors what we also have is the
complementary nokia api offering so the
UI api so it gives access to native
elements in the UI then the gesture
frame animator then these are mostly for
supporting touch and form factors and
then the in-app purchase so building in
monetization into your application so
this is the API offering and again this
talks a little bit about what all is
there new into dot 0 so 2 dot 0 was
launched the SDK was launched when we
launched full touch devices asha 311 so
these are um these were launched in June
this year and with the SDK we provided
access to developers to our new API set
which includes full touch and quite a
lot of native elements around full touch
then gesture sensor orientation etc then
in terms of tooling what additions we
made we we now have our SDK we which
along with the SDK we have an IDE
integrated which is based on Eclipse and
though our beneath the Nokia ID is based
on Eclipse we support NetBeans so now
you can fully you know code and
integrate our SDK into NetBeans as well
and then what we also have as part of
that plugin is a Maps API so for example
as a developer if you want to build in
location capabilities into your
application you can use this Maps API
for Java ME and we also have the
lightweight UI toolkit so a series 40
port for that so it's it's a plug-in so
you need to include it into your
application it's like a library external
library and you get access to a LeWitt
kind of structure but based on series 40
forms and then in terms of documentation
we have some porting guide because for
Android developers because eventually
Android and Java I mean the base is Java
and then
after talking to quite a few developers
we did we realize that the business
logic can be reused of course the UI
logic cannot be but then a lot of the
business logic code you can reuse when
you are developing and we developed a
porting library I mean of course the
best thing would be to go for a tool but
then we started with the library first
so i would like to stop here i mean
which part for example because it's a
small crowd i mean i don't want to make
it um you know a monologue so what do
you think would interest you should i
show a demo or should I talk more about
the api's or as far as I remember there
was another platform series 60 yes I
didn't die with Windows Phone
introduction so that was from what
right it's exactly so serious 60 there
were quite attached devices so is this
something that was backwards into Syria
supportive
okay so series 40 and simba symbionts
series 60 was based out of symbian two
different platforms completely serious
party was never based out of symbian and
this book this has been existing for
quite some time so this has been not
existing right from the early 2000s but
but what is really new is we are
building a lot of new capabilities and
because we we did a lot of study about
these consumers also you know that who
are actually using these kind of phones
the feature phones and do what do they
really want and we realize that you know
feature phones are used by people who in
developing markets who are very
aspirational of course given a choice
they might want to have an iphone or
android phone but then not everybody has
the resources to own the same and these
were kind of people who wanted the same
kind of experience in lower price points
and hence we started developing and
evolving the series 40 it was it it's an
okay OS and Java it's a java based
platform and then we have been
continuously improving the middleware
and the the java and also we have been
adding new api's so there is where we
are kind of investing to make sure that
it's a viable platform for developer so
that we can't build all the apps
ourselves so we would like compelling
apps to be available in series 40 and if
you see now for the example this device
which is a full touch device asha 308
which was launched last week so these
these devices have Angry Birds and you
know whats app and e body all these
running and they are being used also
quite a lot so I mean it's a relatively
longer answer but then kind of the
rationale behind why why we are kind of
developing this platform and then
investing more in API is tools etc so
and any other question see I want to
make it a little more interactive
because I I mean I can know so well I
what I do
you know maybe i will go quickly over
the slides and then if you have any
questions just stop me and then we will
get into the demo part so what what are
we introducing so i'm in this session i
will talk a little bit more about the
full touch and the newer api is that we
have launched because when last year we
were conducting these developer
feedbacks we got a lot of feedback
saying that ok the UI it's not possible
to develop compelling you I with Java ME
and what we have done is we are trying
to give access to more and more native
components so for example this is the
new UI here and then there are things
like the category bar so we call this
category bar and then we call this the
action action button so you can actually
click on it and then there could be
seven actions in your application so
what what we are trying to do is we we
are giving access to all these native
components using third-party API it's
called the Nokia API if you are
interested I mean again we can exchange
email i can give you details as and when
you learn about a tour you want to know
more details about it there's a whole
lot of details here keeping it
relatively higher level at the moment so
multi-point touch so these support these
devices do support multi-point touch
again getting into the specific asha 311
supports up to eight touch points and
then there is asha 305 306 with support
to touch point so that there are some
differences there but overall
multi-point touch is supported so you
can build those kind of you know touch
experiences and paint kind of an
applications then sensors so we do a
width on the full touch devices we
launched the accelerometer sensor so and
we have to remember that these are
devices we are talking about which are
less than hundred dollars and they have
acceleration they have orientation
sensor then they have double tap sensor
the others very existing before so
charging and the base
once and so jsr 256 you can use to
access these sensors build applications
so typically i will show you some
applications which use the jsr the modes
it supports both asynchronous as well as
synchronous modes which ever so
synchronous is like if you are using it
in a game loop you would use the
synchronous mode and pull the sensor so
basically again applicable for games
like the road racing kind of a game
there is a lot of code which is
available which I will show you again on
developer Nokia and those are like free
games etc so you can download them try
to understand so okay so getting into
the tools part again I will you have I
will show some applications where we
will do some run through as well so this
this is just the kind of overview so the
as I mentioned so we have the latest SDK
2 dot 0 it supports the IDE and then it
provides app templates it has a nokia
specific jad editor so all the values
are pre-populated it has something
called the device sdk manager so this is
something similar to what our
competitors also offers so what it tells
you is you you can select a device
because often developers are like often
they feel that okay how do i get to know
which tool set to use with which device
what is the resolution that it supports
because if you are for example
developing a game the resolution is the
first thing you need to take into
account so whether it is a 240 400 240
360 or whatever qvj then also things
like the frames per second etc so we
have this device sdk manager which i
will demo which will tell you what
devices support what kind of display
what is the form factor and then what
tools so devices DK manager so since it
is integrated with ID so when once you
create a middle a project then if you
select this device as DK manager it goes
to a form like this so again I will demo
this so you can actually select on
the layout types then also the display
sizes and then you have a open search so
here you can example for example you
want to know what all devices support
in-app purchase so then you can give it
as open search and it will tell you so
again here and then it will tell you the
SDK configurations that you need to use
and what SDK configuration support what
device so then that there is a lot of
templates for in-app purchase then for
user usage of maps api so you can like
for example take the directly take the
template and then start working with it
there are code examples which are given
then there is the job the auto filling
jad editor which also i will show you so
these are the code samples which are
provided and i will show you how to get
the code samples and then they are for
example compiled and then we have the
sdk which provides simulation the sensor
a mulish emulation and then you you can
also for example in your applications
say for example you need to use you are
using the Maps API I have a little more
details here about the Maps API and you
can dynamically you use the location
emulations so it will use the Nokia Maps
solution and you can emulate the exact
same behavior on the pc we support
NetBeans there is on-device debugging
support so okay so before i'm getting
into the Maps API what I do is I'll
quickly show you how the tools look like
and then perhaps go back any questions
so you need to go to develop a nokia com
and so once you download i should share
the link so developer nokia com / java
and you get the nokia sdk and the no key
ID so it comes as the same package so
once you invoke the no key ID the
welcome page looks something like this
so here you will get lot of information
about how to get started you know since
you are like not really emmy developers
so this gives a good good information
then we have something called the java
developer library so this provides
details on all the api's on all the
extensions that we support there there
is a lot of training videos here then a
mapping of the run time that we are
supporting on the device and the api is
that its support then how to publish so
nokia has a store so this again is a
competitive advantage for us because we
we have a single story and as a
developer if you publish in the nokia
store I mean it's pretty simple it that
is just a one euro fee and then you can
publish so this the welcome page gives
all these details and what I will show
you is on the main page okay let's go so
so for example if you see this so on on
the IDE you have something called the
Nokia series 40 code examples so if you
are new for example to a java me you can
load any of these applications and if
you select them they will tell you which
all jase arts are they using so i will
show you an example of a full touch
application on the emulator which is
what it's again all these are demo apps
so these are not reproduction so what
this app which I have developed does is
there is a panorama picture and we have
just taken the picture from one of these
websites which give you panorama picture
and using the sensor you can actually
see different parts of the picture so so
these are all precompiled so you can
just run
and
and you can use netbeans as well and you
what you have to do is you have to just
include the SDK with this sum so this is
the structure of this device which is
asha 305 and what i'll show you here is
the accelerometer so when it runs on the
device what what really happens is that
as you turn the phone you can see
different parts of the picture so what I
am doing with this simulation is I am
simulating the turning of the phone and
it shows you what what the app can do so
what it really means is that you don't
really need a device to test all these
things you can you can do it right on
the SDK and what the implementation does
is it just gives you the XYZ coordinates
oh it's it's okay
multi-touch okay
let's see
and another question
can we write some kind of streets to
for example you show us the rotation of
the poem can we write the script which
will form the certain rotation we expect
or something like that you would like
you would want to write a script which
will rotate the phone I mean down I
think it should be possible but
basically you want to do stress testing
of a particular app right right so I
think that use case should be possible
you have to use those XYZ coordinates in
such a way that you simulate these
conditions so I am if I if I understand
your use case right you are trying to
the yes I think it should be possible
okay so multi-touch right now I need to
see full touch component demo we used to
have this some the paint app so what i
will do is maybe after this session i'll
show you where the paint up it is there
on the website and then what you can do
is you can use that let me see battle
tank clipboard they used to be a painter
just wondering
what is the mechanism
oh ok i will tell you that i can that i
can show you because i think that's an
interesting question i don't have a very
good app but um I am I can tell you how
to do it so what we have done is you
have to do a left click and drag up left
click and drag down and that's how we
are simulating it so if i had the paint
one if I could have shown it to you but
i will show you how how we can do it so
we do have that so left click and drag
okay so you can get the paint
application and there is something
called pinch-to-zoom simulation right so
let's try with this image so what you
have to do is now the status is idle
then you have to the recording has
started so then left click and then if
you play it back it plays so I don't
know if it recorded here or not but if
you use it with the paint application
because this this is just a JPEG image
right so in the paint application what
it does is you can numb it's using these
gestures right so there you can actually
see it I don't have it in my workspace
but try it with the pinch and zoom
simulation and you can access it from
here okay so any questions ok if not
then they are this flipboard app is also
something which is pretty good so for
example this shows effects with the Java
ME so for example you have this Sun
again this is something which is a
little bit inspired so this kind of flap
affected so I am doing it with a JPEG
image sure but you can do it with an XML
as well so you know you you can build
applications and use cases around that
so
okay yes so I can so this application is
also there so
so what i will do is i can i can share
with you the code and then you can just
have a look so this is this is something
that I in fact I got it from a wiki wiki
page the code and then d try I tried it
here and then it worked but then you you
can try it so this is another app then
this is a weather app which okay let me
talk a little bit more about the Salida
based positioning and the maps and then
I will come come back to this weather
app so i will share with you the code
for the flip board and any other
questions
ok if not then we'll go to the slides
again
ok so the Nokia Maps API so what what we
have done is no Nokia Maps as you know I
mean it's a complete Maps offering and
we are trying to provide the same
experience for CDs 40 developers so you
can develop this kind of social social
local kind of an app using the Maps API
so what are the features for developers
so you have multiple map type so in your
application you can show if you are
using the Maps API you can show a street
map satellite view terrain view it has
that support you can build put markers
on the map you can put polygons
polylines etc you know like where is my
friend kind of an app or the overlay
support is there then there is a
download indicator this is the link
developer knock nokia com develop maps
maps api for Java ME you can get more
information here what are the services
which are available because those are
what the developers can do but then
finally what service does the Maps API
provide so we have the local search we
do geocoding and reverse geocoding which
means that from lat long you can get an
address and from an address you can get
a latitude and longitude it can do
routing it can share your location from
from your app and there is this
integrated KML support so which is more
popular than XML or JSON when we are
talking about the maps are navigation
space so little bit about the pricing
models so you can have access to all
these services and there are basically
two pricing models one is the standard
one is the premium and the standard it's
actually free usage within these limits
and once you exceed these limits on a
consistent basis then there is a
transaction fee so how it really works
is that if you have an app where you
want to use the location API you would
need the app code and the token ID you
have to
stop with the site which i will give you
and then you will get the app code and
token ID which you will put in your
application and then you can just
publish it in the Nokia Store so when
you use when your application is being
downloaded etc so nokia will track how
many hits are there and once you start
term exceeding these numbers
consistently is then when we nokia will
ask you to either pay or upgrade
yourself to the next package which is
the premium package that the difference
is that in a standard you will get ads
whereas in the premium model you you you
have a opt-out clause so this is mostly
for more kind of commercial use cases so
again this gives us summary of what is
really the standard offering and what is
the premium offering so again you need
to if you want to use the Maps API you
have to register free and then you will
get the authentication credentials here
in this link so I all these details are
given in developer nokia com maps and
then once you publish the app quota is
exceeded and then nokia would can
contact you alternatively you can write
to this email address location API at
nokia com if you would directly start
with a premium model so this is sum over
all about maps and then we have Lou so
what we have in lewitt is we have
developed a series 40 portfolio it so
basically what it means is it's
optimized because when we are talking
about these devices these have you have
limited heap here so this is one of the
things since you are all java ee
developers when you come to the emmy
world the first thing you have to you
know really optimize is for memory and
of course the cpu as well but more so
for memory because we do have a
restriction on the charge yard size
which is around to mang mb and then
we have a limitation on the heap size as
well because these are again less than
hundred dollar devices and the the cpu
speed again there is asha 311 which is a
one gig processor but then there are
other devices which are not tongue that
one gig or very high speed processor so
if you want your application to run
across then you have to optimize so this
Lewis library again is optimized for
series 40 this sum is I mean if you up
for skate then the size comes down to
around 100-200 again with your app of
course happy why logic so and with this
you will get the series party specific
themes for non-touch full touch and
touch and type and in ad in addition we
are giving these themes along with the
bundle so you can use resource editor
and then get them into NetBeans and
directly generate your UI so again in
terms of so this was overall in terms of
the tooling support what we have
introduced into dot 0 then documentation
again I was talking about this Android
porting guide so it's an interesting
guide because it's a I mean I I started
reading it it's interesting because
there are so many things you can reuse
and you will realize because there is an
example here and it talks about how you
can reuse your business logic when you
move from Android to series 14 ok so
then a little bit about how once you
have developed an app and then you want
to pub you know publish it then what is
the process so there is the nokia store
and you have a 1 1 euro registration
fees and then there is the standard 7030
revenue sharing so and what is very good
is that you can for example you decide
your own how much you know you want to
build what kind of app you want to build
for example free or you want to include
in app purchase etc and then you can
price your application
differently in different markets so the
store gives a lot of flexibility there
again this is something which developers
have told us that we don't have any
restriction like you have to price it
the same way in all markets so we gave
lot of flexibility there we have a QA
process as well and then also in
addition there we provides a marketing
support in the sense we have an online
marketing pool which helps you create
banners etc and if you want to feature
your app we use the assets that you have
created and we provide a dashboard like
which which gives you the kind of region
by split of your application like where
it is being downloaded from and then
what are the key countries on the key
operator so this is with your publisher
ID you can directly access this it is a
basic not very detailed analytics but
still useful in order to understand the
kind of usage that the application has
so then again so I I showed you the
weather of the cottage 360 tourism
another app so this is a simple game
which uses the in-app purchase API so as
I was talking about so monetization has
become I mean when you when you develop
an app you always want to build in such
revenue models which can help monitor
help you monetize better and for series
40 we provide this in app purchase API
which is a part of the platform you can
also build ad models we nokia partners
with we serve and interactive they had a
session today so in this is a simple
game again all the code is available for
free so i can show you this so what here
what i am going to try to do is I'm
going to try to emulate so it's using
our test server the Nokia published
server in test mode and I am going to
run a whole transaction end to end and
I'm going to show you how it works and
also this shows operator billing so
nokia supports
both Nokia Store supports both credit
card billing and operator billing so I
am going to demonstrate that so this if
you see this is a very simple game again
a demo game code is available soon and
then if you want to buy so here we are
getting this data for example what what
is the price of the application from the
publish server so once you kind of so
how when you use the in-app purchase API
you define what is the price point that
you have and then this API will help you
get get that and again all this complete
code is available here and if I do a buy
so you have the account
so I am using you can change your
country also it's in the preferences so
I have said one of the countries as
India that's why it's giving me an
Indian operator Vodafone in so full
experience so I just confirm so it's
doing the transaction using operator
billing so again it's asking me so
payment completed so it went all the way
up to the published server and then you
see a full full experience here so again
here you can use some the Nokia drm or
you can use your own drm solution so in
this application for example what we are
trying to protect is the drm data which
is in the resource file so this resource
ID this ID number is when you will get
when you actually define the content
item as in-app purchase protected again
I don't want to get into too many
details here but if you have questions I
would encourage you to send me an email
and then I can get back with with the
right answer so here it is just a set of
pictures that I am protecting and there
is a test mode file which is set to test
mode is equal to purchase so this is the
one which tells the application that the
published server is working in the test
mode and you can do repeated purchase
here you can put test mode as fail and
it will fail each and every time and you
can put a test mode is equal to normal
and then it will do a normal sequence
again there is a lot of documentation
which is available as part of this the
SDK and it can be integrated with ID
netbeans ide as well and all this
whatever I demonstrated quite a lot of
it is already documented pretty well
here and you can go through it and then
understand and I mean if you are already
a java ee developer i mean i think if
you can see some of our sample code then
you can understand quite much the flow
and more important thing is you know how
to optimize and how again focusing a
little bit on the UI because
normally when you are developing for
mobile device the i mean this is
something which i have again heard from
developers that more than fifty percent
is actually your UI your i mean people
have actually tracked there are the
statistics the downloads etc and then
they have realized that the more
compelling the UI the more compelling
the name these are very very important
of course i mean if you are targeting
the enterprise then it's a then there
are other parameters like security etc
which becomes more important so that's
kind of what i had so again key
takeaways again there is a huge demand
for apps and then just to give you the
kind of idea we have around 17 almost 17
million downloads a day of which happens
in the nokia store and half of it fifty
percent actually comes from Series 40 so
we that is the demand side so these are
not phones which you know people don't
have people use only for voice so people
do use apps there and on the supply side
again we have around one hundred one
hundred thousand intent items for series
40 and in terms of developer offering we
have exciting api's we are adding more
api's we are improving the toolset based
on feedback because we feel that this is
a good opportunity and that people can
really harness so that's kind of the
summary so any any questions
so no as of now it does not support
OpenGL and yes I mean because one of the
reasons is again the the cost we are
operating I mean these are devices which
are less than hundred dollars so these
and the processor speeds are also
varying quite a lot soon so any further
questions okay if not then thanks a lot
