afternoon to you I'm happy for everybody
who joined us today thank you for coming
my name is andreas i work in cinterion
I'm in charge of the m2m modules
portfolio so unlike myself today our
technology is wireless and we provide
connectivity and machines and I will
walk you through who we are then I will
explain our standpoint how we see
machine-to-machine current developments
and then why we decided to make Java
become an integral part of our portfolio
strategy and what that then means to the
ecosystem in the industry given the
nature of the session welcome to join
this is a very intimate session so we
can do it interactively if you have
questions or you want to ask me
something just do it right on the spot
I've actually provided for some time in
the end but just ask me so who is who is
Jamal so starting with when I arrived at
the san francisco airport I'm being been
asked which is the company I'm working
for so i say i work from gemalto nobody
knows who that is typically say well
there must be something of our company
in your purse either like you visa
credit card or it's the sim card in your
mobile phone or it's your health card or
any other smart card and we did the exit
system to do to the White House for
instance and that gives me clearance at
the border so should give you some idea
who we are so we are shipping more than
2 billion sim cards every year we are
driving force in the area of NFC and we
are a co-founder of the Java card forum
so at a point when we were thinking how
to enhance the smartness of a sim card
on the mobile phone gemalto approached
son by the time I think
and embedded a very small profile of
Java on the SIM card to make it run
small applications so who is then
cinterion we are looking back to almost
15 years of history we were founded as a
small group inside Siemens at that time
called Siemens wireless modules our
cradle was when BMW came to Siemens and
said siemens can you build a mobile
phone into a car and the management said
yes we can do that so build a module
pretty big one can be used as a weapon
very heavy name was a one by german
standards we are very straightforward so
a1 the first product that was in 1992
and then we brought the first product to
the market in 1994 and then we found
different adoption in other verticals of
the machine to machine industry so
welcome to join and in the meantime we
are shipping about 10 million
machine-to-machine modules into the
market they typically look like this
something that you sold on a PCB it's an
incomplete product per se itself it
cannot function it needs to be powered
up it needs to be controlled by a
microprocessor normally and it provides
cellular connectivity and later we
explain to you how we smarten the
modules up by integrating Java there so
today we have installed we've been doing
Java since 2003 or four on the board so
we have installed base of Java in the
market on the modules that is a bit shy
of 10 million I would say and
predominantly the adoption was in the
enemy during space where you have a
smart hub where you want to filter
aggregate data that you provide to a
back-end also in the medical space say
home home patient devices that you have
next to your bed like for
apnea problems when you have a breathing
disorder or sleeping disorder to monitor
your breath was one of the master
projects that we did with Java where we
also want the Duke award and the module
was awarded the best m2m module in the
industry two years ago our customers are
a wide array of all type of integrators
it can be it can be a very small company
that has a very innovative idea it can
be Porsche who integrates the car in
order to enable stolen vehicle tracking
applications everything that you saw
this morning the big truck mining
machines caterpillar a vast array of
Fortune 500 companies are our customers
in order to provide any type of wireless
connectivity to an asset which is
valuable to them so we were I said we
were former Siemens wireless modules
then we spun off from Siemens we became
an independent company and then Gemalto
who is the leader in the sim card and
smart card business day themself said
every business that we are doing is tied
to the population that is on this planet
so there are 7 billion people who can
have mobile phone or two who can have a
smart card or two can have credit a
credit card or two but the ceiling is
possible to be calculated so entering
into the machine to machine space
provides basically unlimited possibility
and that's why they acquired us who are
the market leader by the time in the m2m
industrial space in order to have the
region to that industry and now unlike
our competitors we have a very unique
positioning in industry because we have
access to all the elements along the
communication chain so we can provide
connectivity in the device we can
provide you with sim cards we have OTA
platforms so we are the one stop shop in
the m2m space and we have summarized
that another slogan confidence connected
which consists of four major parts
number one our industry expertise so we
are doing industrial machinery
connectivity for more than a decade
partnership is always a very strong
component of our business because
typically our partners or customers who
we work with have no experience in
cellular so they have a great business
on going and they want to make it become
wireless but wireless is not the
expertise so they need to find somebody
who can help them their number three I
actually I've surely started with that
one security so I mentioned before that
Gemalto provides the exit system to the
White House Gemalto owns the OS that
runs on the sim card that Steven
contains also the crypto engine and has
a huge array of patents in the area of
security also has gemalto acquired a
company that is called trusted logic
with their trusted labs so we can check
the sanity of any type of application
and one area of Gemalto is also mobile
banking so mobile transactions over the
air everything where you have a high
possibility for fraud intrusion or you
want to protect the privacy of the owner
that is jamel to score business and I
think machine-to-machine was not very
interesting to the hacker industry as it
was this very small niche market but now
that we at the inflection point where
m2m becomes their big thing in the
industry the hacker community will also
look at the space so we believe with all
the security that is inherent in our
portfolio and leveraging that into
machine-to-machine we have a unique
positioning and then another point is
simplicity simplicity of the solutions
like I said when you're not a specialist
in wireless connectivity and you want to
enter into that field you like to have
something that you are familiar with
that is easy to integrate and here's the
first point that
should remember for the latter part of
the presentation where Java makes a big
difference so in our portfolio like I
said there are wireless modules there
are mim cards there is the network
access there's the subscription
management and the enablement of
mobility services so mim is a trademark
that we own it stands for machine
identification module versus sim
subscriber identification module this
means it's a more rugged sim card when
our customers by modules from us they
want temperature ranges supported from
minus 42 plus 85 degrees Celsius or even
further without a degrade in
communication quality and in the past
the sim cards always been the weakest
link in the application so if you think
about a car car is shaking all the time
it can be very hot very cold in Arizona
there most of the car makers test the
ruggedness of the cars in Arizona sim
card start to bend and when you have
knows them you have no connectivity so
we have made the sim cards also super
rocket we call them in the network
access and subscription management 194 m
n also around this globe our customers
they buy their OT a plateau platforms
from us to manage mobile phones mobile
phone transactions ringtone download and
stuff like that and then we have
acquired a company in the end of last
year's called sensor logics out of Texas
and that is a platform where if you want
to start up a business in
machine-to-machine and you don't want to
do all the investment into a platform
you can use that and modular very number
modular way configure your application
like if you say you want to do a
geofencing application it's all there
you just need to configure it on on a
web page and then you can start your
business and transversal across the
entire portfolio there is security so it
is all m2m for those who had the
opportunity to join the keynote of this
morning there will be a repetitive
pattern in what you're hearing right now
but it's important for me because when
we started to talk with Oracle about
making our Java engagement bigger this
was our logic so if you if you look into
how the market predicts the growth we
say there's a statement 2011 in January
analysis Mason said there will be 2.1
million connected devices then nine
months later it was 24 billion then in
February of this year Ericsson came out
with a famous statement of 50 billion
connected devices and today we heard the
trillion number and whatever the number
is to us it is important that this is
the space where we believe all devices
should use Java embedded across the
board in order to simplify the adoption
of machine-to-machine and to get to the
infliction point by the market really
can explode so if there is 50 billion
devices then let's look at the hype
cycle from gartner about emerging
technologies and if you look at that
then you will realize that those related
to m2m like consumer telematics media
tablets home health monitoring or
machine-to-machine communication service
they are already over the hype so
meaning whatever the prediction is the
first hype cycle has been digested and I
think now we are on the slope of
enlightenment and we have to see how we
can reach the plateau of productivity so
for us m2m today I would like to define
when I say m2m what does m2a mean to me
m2m is the integration of a remote asset
into a business process regardless of
the vertical
realization anything that is not
connected we connected over the air and
it doesn't depend which vertical we are
talking about and the target setting for
today we should try to identify and
remove growth obstacles if we want to
grow into 50 billion connected devices
then we have to reduce the fragmentation
of the market don't some basics first
m2m is pretty much everywhere in our
daily life you see there's smart
metering where we are talking about the
reduction of waste of energy you have
either home device or aggregated device
that monitors the power consumption and
in case somebody's over-consuming
switches off or where you have
distributed contributors and consumers
in a in a network referring since your
your electric vehicle can be a consumer
but can also be a contributor to the
network as such as in a time when you
don't need to use your car and the
battery is loaded you can return some
electricity to the network and give it
to somebody else and that involves a lot
of questions like how do I know at which
point in time how much energy is here
how much energy is there who can spend
energy who needs energy and wireless
connectivity is a good answer for that
because you can connect all the sensors
and always know where is a where is a
consumer where is a contributor and then
match them together plus then the
billing system in the background that is
something that is inherent technology in
Jamel toes portfolio who does the
billing for the mnos so metering money
area security if you have a home alarm
panel you just plug it into your power
socket and you switch it on there's
wireless connectivity that for instance
if you if you run at ruler shop you will
ping your alarm panel all the time see
if it's still if I can still read it if
I cannot read it probably somebody has
jammed it i sell-- i sent the pool
is there tracking and tracing is the
most prominent one can be can be your
car can be a rental car can be a
container can be your kid can be your
pet anything can be tracked and traced
payment verifone POS terminals you swipe
your card you type the number there's a
module to verify your credentials with
the back end of the bank remote
monitoring and control so this one is
too is the rest of the industries or
vending machines of any type coffee
machines connected to the network
automotive there are different places in
the car but you need connectivity for
instance if you want the infotainment
system where you have location-based
services or content services on your on
your head unit display or emergency call
like in case you hit another car and
your airbag blows you send an automatic
emergency call to a back-end system and
they sent the medics provided that you
can transfer them the information about
your location while computing when you
receive DHL or UPS package at home
somebody will give you a big hand held
device to sign on at the moment when you
put hit the enter button the data is
transmitted to the backend you can check
on the internet that your process been
delivered router gateway wireless local
loop I just want to pick the gateways
here because they are very relevant for
Java a gateway is always a device that
aggregates information from different
sensors and sends it to a back-end and
then there is the m2m consumer space the
Kindles ebooks and connectivity into
notebooks so all this is technology that
either optimizes our already existing
processes enhance efficiency like for
instance remote meter reading you don't
need to drive and read the meter by
yourself or you can enable new business
model models that didn't exist in the
past
or you directly come connect to your
customer like if you're a car maker
today we saw the BMW on the screen this
morning if there is something wrong with
the oil consumption of the car there's a
message on the display say please see
your car dealer in that Street which is
only two blocks away from you they have
an open bay from two to three pm and get
your car checked so this is how you tie
in your customer into your business
processes so that different types of
machines and all those machines have
different things to tell you and we call
it the payload data or management data
and then on the other end of the chain
there is somebody who needs to do
something with the data for instance you
have a service level agreement
established with your customer say in a
leasing model your leasing forklift for
instance you want to make sure that the
forklifts are connected to the to the
power socket every night then the
customer calls you says at some point
look the battery's gone again can you
please replace it is it is the repair is
the warranty repair out of warranty
repair so you can over-the-air check
that the battery has not been treated in
the right way and you say ok there's a
violation of an SLA or there's a fleet
manager wants to see where are his cars
or there's a data subscribe or data
miner so the big data that we've been
talking about today and how is the
architecture typically so you have
excavator that you want to monitor then
inside the excavator there's a small
plastic box very rugged it prevents dust
and water from entering into it then
there is our module a sim card to
connect to the network and typically a
microprocessor to manage everything
that's on going in that box and then you
need the antenna to connect to the
network of course
you have a couple of sensors and
peripherals you monitor the temperature
you monitor the movement your monitor
the position and then you need also
power supply so this is typically how AM
to M device today looks and it's then
embedded into a machine the machine
connects over the cellular network to a
back-end so let's look into more detail
today we we have a microprocessor
controlled or microprocessor controller
microcontroller centric device
architecture and typically we have
dedicated devices and this is an
architecture that does not scale very
well you do one device according to your
use case and you do not foresee all the
changes that are happening like there's
a 2g to 3G migration or 3g to LTE
migration or today it's a excavator
tomorrow you want to have a forklift
connected but this is the typical
architecture today so you have some
circuitry to collect the sensor data
then you have your business rules you
want to do something with the sensor
data say your money tour the heat let's
take a simple example heat monitoring
then you need a protocol to speak to the
back end somehow you need to communicate
then you have communication control you
set up and establish a connection and
then you have the simple communication
functionality that is transmitting the
data as fast as possible or as power
efficient as possible and then typically
there is a database that is Oracle
powered where you store the data so
today the microprocessor or the
microcontroller and the memory is the
heart or the brain of the m2m device and
the modem that we provide the module is
used as a week all simple modem or
stupid datapipe it set up a channel
transmitted data close to channel you're
done and we believe that
m2m space can do a bit better than that
so if we're looking at the same picture
again and now here comes the benefit of
Java to our ecosystem this is what you
have seen just now microcontroller
centric architecture now let's think a
little bit different and say we have a
module that supports Java so you can run
a java application right on the module
because the module also has a
microprocessor and the module also has
some memory so why not leverage this why
why do you want to double that and then
this is what we call the edge to
enterprise or today I heard device to
data center so d 2 d or e to e or
however you call it the key is now we
have a consistently layered architecture
that connects your sensor data directly
with your back-end so since that was
very quick I want to show it to you from
a different angle again old architecture
sensors microprocessor memory a module
and the database
okay all right so by integrating Java on
the module you can get rid of the
microcontroller and the memory and then
the driver module takes control of the
application so dropping those two
elements out you have already eliminated
a few dollars on your build of material
don't forget that I mean this is the
most simple and this has been the driver
in the past for Java embedded modules
but I think today as m2m comes to the
infliction point of becoming the big
thing there is a bit more than only
reducing the core processor and the
memory so the key is now on your Java
module you can host the intelligence and
when we started to think about that we
always thought about formatting data
aggregating data and putting it in the
format that you need in the back end but
actually from speaking to some of you
also on this conference I realized that
the key will be filtering data you heard
Chad saying it this morning in the
keynote speech a car can produce a huge
amount of data but not everything is
relevant for the back end so the key
will be the ability of filtering that
data that is relevant for your use case
and that is a very simple thing to
implement as a java application right on
the module where the data is generated
so again example from this morning
because I liked it you want to track a
container that travels through
Afghanistan so typically the container
will receive a signal from a satellite
to do the geofencing as I'm in this
position right now and then use a
cellular connectivity to send that to a
back-end system Sadie a back-end system
right now I'm crossing the border from
Pakistan to Afghanistan for instance but
then there may be a area where you do
not want the module to communicate or
the application to communicate
with a back end because communication
produces traces right so and then you
need a bit smarter application and that
can easily be done in Java so I say okay
I'm entering an area where i should not
send data so I go into a sleep mode I do
not transmit data I keep storing my
positioning information and when i exit
that area I will then transmit the
entire data back to the back end and
that only works if you have a bit
smarter architecture than in the past
where you are continuously pulling or
pushing the information you are you're
putting decision making of a very
defined decision making on to the module
then beckoned interworking always been a
challenge because our customers want to
integrate their application in one or
several backends but they all speak
different protocols now I'm asking you
how easy it is to implement a protocol
based on Java very very simple and then
the advantage of it is if you have done
that for one time then you can reuse
that type of communication protocol over
and over again and then communication
control you can you can learn the module
to just communicate with a back-end at
the least cost of data transmission
times or you can you can schedule
updates where you say now I have this 1
million units in the field and I do not
want that they ask for update at all the
same time so you can you can simply run
a scheduling instance on on the module
and say this module I just update on
that day and and so forth to distribute
the there's the swarm activities so I
mentioned growth obstacles so why why is
the dedicated application design a
growth obstacle in m2m
the question is how much time do you
have for does your manager give you for
return on investment and in the cellular
space there between you and earning
money there are several steps number one
you need to develop your device then
taking the US market you have to go
through PDC up rule you can take up to
three months then you have to go through
a mno device level certification and and
here you can already leverage the module
certification that we have done with PDC
abhi and the aminos but it still will
take you a few month and then you see
their application to the market you can
only do that when you have all the
certifications approvals right and only
then will you receive customer feedback
about the functionality which means that
this may put you back right to the
beginning of your development cycle and
only then the volume business will start
so I I call that the m2m revenue dilemma
or the m2m revenue curve which means you
have a long long time for investment and
then the return of investment will only
come at a very late stage and the
adoption is slow because we develop a
module you develop your application the
customer tests it and it only at some
point will it then go into mass adoption
so very very long cycles and I want you
to look at this part where we have
statutory and regulatory approvals or
mno certifications that just simply
cannot get waived so why is why is Chava
so helpful in that context now that is
very simple to explain when we develop a
module the first thing we do is we we
harden the modem OS and the firmware
whatever it is it can be any type of
voice and then we built the modem
functionalities on top of that that done
we wrap it up and we can go to approvals
we go to regulatory and statutory
approve
we get the stamp and everything is done
for us and can be leveraged by our
customers and then we have done we have
created an abstraction layer because
Java is purely application related it
doesn't bring any harm to the modern
functionalities we call that the the
sandbox principle you can put your kid
in a sandbox it's clearly a clearly
defined area and it can do whatever at
once in the sandbox and we provide the
same sandbox to our customers and that
is in alignment with the strategy of the
MNOs and also the approval bodies in the
industry so that means now you can put
your application on the module you can
change your application on the module
and you do not have the regression with
PDC RB or AT&amp;amp;T or whoever the partner of
your choices for for the connection and
then the way we have done our Java
implementation is that you can run
several instances in parallel that means
you have your core application and then
in the background maybe you have a SLA
tracker that is logging the data about
how the modem is used and you can have
one instance that manages the
communication to the back end so the
device management client or you have
special vertically extensions say you
have a barcode reader application that
just scans barcodes all the time or you
can do customization if you if you do
not like the API that we provide it to
you you change the API to make it fit to
your application or you can you can Java
is perfect for security enhancements so
not only is Java itself very secure as
environment also does it provide you
with with crypto engines on the web if I
just think of bouncy castle torque that
you can download you can adjust to your
application need and then you make you
make your application super secure
or if you're talking about the BSI
profile that is now being put in place
in Europe to to protect for instance
metering data for privacy then you
implement the protocol based on Java and
make the communication super secure you
wrap it up in an SSL and and you're safe
and then on top of that you integrate
into your own back-end into a service
platform that we provide to you or a.m.
and o provides to you so you have total
flexibility and you can mix that as much
as you want there's basically no
limitation and the good thing is like if
you if you have encapsulated this
protocol stack and modem functionality
that is relevant to approvals and
certifications and you have the
abstraction layer to the back end
everything that happens here on the
chava layer you're free to modify it as
much as you want and make it fit to the
top where you have your own system or to
the to the bottom where there's the
modern functionality so we are we are
also member or driving force in one m2m
so for those who do not know one m2m is
is a group is a group that is formed by
seven standardization bodies including
TIAA and their relevant peers in Asia
and Korea Japan and China to define the
machine to machine API so now in here
you see the challenge already you have
seven standardization bodies that is a
big group if you have not only seven but
you have hundreds of different ideas and
it will take a long time to really come
to a standard that everybody can accept
now if you work with something ladies
like Java you don't care very much
because you are flexible to adjust to
the changes as they happen in the
standardization right so your future
proving your device and you don't run
into a dead end by hard coding something
that later you cannot maintain
then time to market and and and that is
that is really the key in
machine-to-machine today the time to
market is a big big obstacle for
everybody because for us to develop
module takes between 12 and 18 months
depending on the complexity then to
integrate it into a m2m application
typically takes between six to twelve
month then you take it through
certification so that means from from
the time that a new technology emerges
until you can find it then in a mass
deployment is about two to three years
in the car industry up to five years and
that is too long and we believe by using
Java that time can be shortened
dramatically so the reason is number one
it's much easier to find developers that
are familiar with Java then any type of
proprietary language right so today
there is I don't know I heard it nine
million ja Android developers hey
android developer is perfectly suited to
do a development also in java android is
built on java so and somebody who worked
on android understands or embedded
environments and can easily convert that
knowledge into machine-to-machine then
the available availability of java
classes means you do not need to
reinvent the wheel over and over again
JS r 1 70 71 77 for security just use it
on top of that add crypto engines crypto
sweets from bouncy castles org once you
have developed it and you migrate to a
new generation of cellular technology
just port your code so you don't need to
reinvent the wheel it's an investment
protection for you you do not violate
the device or module certification by
doing anything on a Java layer you can
reuse the code for next generation of
devices and like I already said
developers are easy to find so we had we
had an executive roundtable around noon
and we said one of the challenges is you
will find a lot of developers who
understand embed it you will also find a
lot of developers who understand Java
but to bring those two ends together
will be quite challenging and I think
what we are doing here is a is a good
facilitator because unlike in the past
where we said Java is an equipment
option so you have to tell me I want to
buy a Java module from you now we will
put Java embed it on every module
regardless if you use it or not and the
nature of a developer is that when there
is something available the developer
will also try it out and that will
enhance the adoption of Java on the
embedded layer much more than in the
past so conclusion we were talking about
edge to enterprise or device to data
center and I want to repeat it I said
the definition is of m2m is the
integration of a remote acid into a
business process regardless of the
vertical ization but now if you take
that one step further and you think
about everything connected IOT the
internet of thing or everything
everything connected everywhere then we
will we will need to migrate from those
pipe solutions to those smart hubs where
you have all the elements all the
sensors connected everywhere you may
have massive stores of data in the cloud
the huge Oracle databases and then the
flexibility to fit those use cases into
the into the existing architectures data
is generated by the sensor you package
it you send it to the back end what is
between the back end and the device
should be transparent because this is
this is only complex costs money takes
time and we want to
we'll help you reduce this complexity
shorten the time to market and make your
business cases start because at the
moment when our customers start earning
money our cash reserves are also rings
at the same time so now the edge is
always connected to the enterprise and
in in such an architecture now I
simplify it again you see that the m2m
module functions as a hub so a hub where
you have processing power you have
memory you have a Java Virtual Machine
everything non-proprietary very scalable
you have processing capabilities here
and you connect to the backend on one
side and you integrate the sensor and
the data on the other hand and all that
together makes them DM term application
and if you abstract it further that is
your domain because you need to decide
what type of sensors you want to
integrate into your back end this is
your domain they say this is my ERP
system this is how I want to store my
data this is relevant data for me and
everything in between here that relates
to to protocol modem dealing with mno
scanning certifications connectivity the
module the sim card OTA platforms all of
that you can have from us so this is the
ultimate simplification of the m2m value
chain and I want to conclude with with a
product launch that we announced two
days ago and I've seen some of you and I
have some modules also here so this is
our module we hope we are German so we
are not far away from the a1 but we are
at EHS five now so if you find a 5 and
any of our product names it means it's
Java powered so the EHS 5 is is the
smallest 3g module that is currently in
the market with LG a technology it's not
much not much bigger than a simple sim
card if you want you can never look
later
and here to put it into proportion even
though we have made it so small there
was still enough space to fit Java on it
so that means the EHS 5 comes with Java
embedded so you can do everything that
we that I explained to you just a few
minutes ago with that module starting
from now it's it's available and we are
ready to push the button and going
forward we will have Java implemented in
our modules of all different magnitudes
so you can have 2g 3g LTE and we will
have Java across the board that also
means if for instance you are you are
you're you want to do global business
you have verizon as a cdma operator in
the u.s. you work with Vodafone as a gsm
operator in Europe that all is 3g and
then you have a 2g operator in India we
have we have all the connectivity and
you build your application on Java and
you can just swap the cellular
connectivity you don't need to bother
you you write your application once and
it works everywhere the rest has been
taken care of by a competitive module
portfolio that supports all cellular
standards in all different types of
flavors that they are on industry so
this is what we are doing and we are
committed to this strategy and we are
very happy to work together with Oracle
on that because I think Oracle just like
ourselves has understood that there is
now the infliction point where this can
make the embedded space really grow
exponentially and then hopefully at some
point for all of us reach 250 billion or
the trillion or you count the zeros so
thank you very much this would be my
presentation and then I would be
available for your questions or
discussion if you want
okay we take them to does that make
sense to you
I tell you what for those who are not so
familiar with our industry maybe I tell
you what the difference is too to what
we have today so today in in our space
for the industrial machine to machine
there are three to four large players
that serve the entirety of the market
that is us and three inferior ones I'm
just kidding so everybody has his own
flavor of doing embedded and we believe
that this increases the fragmentation in
industry so everything that's
proprietary increases the stickiness
with a customer I understand that but I
also believe that in the end of the day
if java can really become the embedded
system then we can we can reach lot much
larger numbers in the industry and that
is beneficial so why why do I move away
from a proprietary to a non-proprietary
environment is to get the curve up to
enhance the adoption to make to lower
the entry barriers for those who want to
enter into the machine to machine space
and I think this is the key and an Java
is is perfectly push the position in
that space that is like Java was or is
the language for feature phones but at a
point the feature phones became much
smarter and they became smartphones and
they had very heavy oasis so that
probably will not happen in the embedded
space because the the smartness of a
machine is decided by or defined by its
very function and that's why I believe
what was Java in the feature phone space
will be the position of Java in the
embedded space without the risk of being
disrupted by something that comes from
the outside and the challenge going
forward will be to to minimize the
footprint of Java and this is where we
are committed to work with Oracle
to to make the smallest possible Java
profile with the maximum functionality
that is needed for the emitted space and
we have we have started this we have
we've been very successful with Java in
the past for those who wanted to use
Java now we give Java to everybody and I
promise you that when the people have it
in their hands they will also use it so
Java and the m2m space is the next big
thing because it just simply reduces the
complexity of the ecosystem ok thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
