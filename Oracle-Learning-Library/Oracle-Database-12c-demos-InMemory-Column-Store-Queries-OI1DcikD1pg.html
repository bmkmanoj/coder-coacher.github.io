for Oracle server technologies this is
the fifth demonstration of seven demos
about in-memory columnstore new feature
introduced in Oracle database 1200 -
this one illustrates how queries on in
memory objects and kahlan's data
populated with in the i''m column story
execute we will also show how fast the
queries execute against the I'm column
store compared to the buffer cache there
will be two sessions started we are
connected in session 1 there are two
tables fully populated in the I am :
store line order and dated dim the first
query is a simple one retrieving the
maximum value of the order total price
or values for this color are stored into
several IMC use in memory : units the
optimizer has to scan the single low old
total price Cullen only why the rows
tour format of the buffer cache has to
scan all the columns in each of the rows
until it reaches the or the total price
color the query also benefits from the
excellent compression ratio the elapsed
time is very short the explained plan
shows a table access in memory full
operation notice the addition of the
keyword in memory into the table access
full operation the keyword in memory
indicates that this operation is
eligible to have some or all of the data
returned from that step in the plan
coming from the I am Colin store if a
table is partially converted to a
columnar format due to ongoing
population operation or
due to a lack of space in the iron
column store queries are able to use
that partial in-memory version and go to
disk for the rest rather than waiting
for the entire table to be converted now
in session to execute the same query
against the buffer cache by passing the
am : store to bypass the i''m column
store set the in-memory query instance
parameter or session parameter to
disabled you notice that the elapsed
time is much longer than the time spent
to execute the same query with the i''m
: store the explained plan shows a
traditional table access full operation
back to session 1 a second example shows
a query projecting three columns of the
line or the table and selecting rows on
a selective value of low or a key column
the optimizer is fully aware of the IM
current store and the objects that
reside within it when it selects a plan
for this query it evaluates all the
possible access paths for example full
tables can index range scan index look
up followed by table accessed by Rho by
D and so on the optimizer will then pick
the plan with the lowest cost the cost
of a full table scan in memory is a lot
lower than the cost of a full table scan
in disk which means that an in-memory
table scan will be selected more often
in this case there is no index on the
column the L order key : in the where
predicate is compared to the minimum and
maximum range of values stored in each
amcu
in memory communic of the column and if
the value does not fall in the specified
range the I MCU is completely skipped
therefore I'm see one is pruned out
based on minimum maximum values and only
I'm cu2 containing the order key value
of 357 is scam here again the response
instantaneous the predicate information
in the plan table output shows in memory
access to retrieve the order key value
of 357 let's verify that min max pruning
occurred by looking at four of the ayam
common story session statistics in this
example there are 454 I'm see us
eligible for min Max pruning out of
which 451 did not contain any rows
matching the value of 357 and therefore
were never scanned the statistics also
corroborates the AIIMS can see use
predicates optimized then only three imc
use contained the value of the order key
for your information the min/max values
of each column in all i'm see use are
visible in the Videla I am color see you
view reconnect to reset session
statistics there are two ways to find
out if a query performed against the I'm
Colin store and not against the buffer
cache view the in-memory session
statistics or the query plan the session
level statistics report how the sequel
was executed session logical reads I am
is the number of blocks scanned in the
9cu all other statistics show that
columns were accessed from the I am
Colin store and that all blocks were
already populated from disk into the I'm
Colin store when the query executed back
to session to execute the same query the
performance is worse the plan shows a
traditional
all excess food there is no index on the
table all entire rows had to be scanned
to find the rows containing the value of
course all I'm statistics show zero
because the query fetched the data from
the buffer cache back to session 1
reconnect to reset session statistics
the I am : store has no problem
executing a query with a join on several
tables because it is able to take
advantage of bloom filter join the use
of a bloom filter is visible in the
execution plan the bloom filter will
appear in two places in the plan at
creation time and when it is applied in
the example when the tables are joined
yeah hash join the date dim tables can't
first the rows that satisfy the we're
close predicate for that table are used
to create a hash table during the hash
table creation the bloom filter is also
created based on the date key joint
color the bloom filter is then sent as
an additional predicate to the line
order table scan the table is scanned to
find the rows that satisfy both the
we're closed predicates for that table
the resulting rows have their join : no
order date hashed and it is compared to
the date key values in the bloom filter
if a match is found in the bloom filter
that row is sent to the hash joint if no
match is found then the row is
disregarded there were eight OMC use
eligible for min max pruning out of
which for did not contain any rows
matching the value of date key were
never scammed and therefore pruned out
then only for I'm see use contained the
value of date key still in session one
reckon
to reset session statistics we execute
the same query without the creation and
use of bloom filter for joins that
cannot use bloom filters performance is
still very good the plan shows that no
bloom filter is used the i''m statistics
showed that 197 is used were eligible
for min max pruning out of which four of
them did not contain any rows matching
the value of the hash join this means
that four of them were never scared then
193 imc use contained the values of the
dates still in session 1 reconnect to
reset session statistics the query
selects a row by its row yd how to know
that the operation retrieved the row
from an MCU and not from the buffer
cache or vice versa check first the
query plan it does not display any table
in memory access now display the table
fetch by row ID statistic value the
value shows how many rows are retrieved
from the buffer cache the I'm statistics
all show a value of 0 which means that
the lookup bypassed the I'm Colin store
still in session 1 we'll see how the
optimizer behaves when a query executes
on both an in-memory table and on no
in-memory table we create a non
in-memory table verify that the table is
no in-memory and we execute the query on
both the in memory and the no in-memory
tables the optimizer chooses to work
from both the buffer cache and the I'm
Colin store in different portions of the
plan this is the end of the
demonstration and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
