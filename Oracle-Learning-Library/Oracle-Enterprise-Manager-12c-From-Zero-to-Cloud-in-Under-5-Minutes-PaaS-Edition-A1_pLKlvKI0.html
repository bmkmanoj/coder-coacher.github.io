in this demonstration will show you how
enterprise manager makes it easy to set
up your platform as a Service Cloud and
service models please take a moment to
read our disclaimer well begin by
logging in as a cloud administrator here
we can see an overview of our entire
data center environment including all of
our targets monitored as well as
inventory and usage of our cloud
resources we're going to model our cloud
by going through the wizard driven setup
menu as you can see we support different
types of cloud delivery models including
infrastructure database and middleware
as a service depending on how you choose
to build your cloud environment a
combination of middleware and databases
the service delivers platform as a
service let's set up middleware as a
service here we can define zones grant
permissions for access established
quotas published services and establish
chargeback you can see that we have a
few clouds owns already defined the zone
can be any logical grouping of resources
for example geography based line of
business base or lifecycle base let's
create a new zone this will be a
development zone the placement
constraints below allow us to determine
how we share resources between tenants
we want to ensure that we get maximum
utilization of our resources without
violating our service level agreements
and we'll accept the defaults let's add
resources to our cloud in this
demonstration we're building a cloud
using physical hosts on which middleware
homes are already deployed enterprise
manager allows delivery of a cloud using
both physical and virtual resources this
allows you to utilize your existing
investments while delivering a cloud
let's add some resources we will select
a few targets from the list and add them
to our cloud next we need to define
developer permissions we can use roles
that are defined in an external LDAP
directory to drive access control in
this example we'll add our dev and QA
users we've now created a zone and added
user requests settings determine when a
user can request resources how far into
the future those resources can be
reserved and when they expire for the
purposes of this demonstration we'll
accept the defaults we also have the
ability to set quotas which are a very
important control feature in building
enterprise cloud quotas ensure that any
set of users cannot consume all of the
resources in our cloud by limiting the
amount of resources any given user can
consume in the case of middleware our
quota dimensions are memory in the
number of server instances that are
utilized let's create quota for our dev
users
I'll add the user we will give this user
a total of four gigabytes of ram end up
to eight service instances each instance
would have up to 500 megabytes available
now that our infrastructure setup is
complete let's create a new service and
publish it to the cloud as you can see
here we already have a few different
weblogic based services published we
could add these services to our new zone
or create a new service services are
defined to encapsulate the best
practices in your organization these are
certified platforms that you want your
developers to use let's create a new
service to allow a large instance of
weblogic let's give our service a name
and we'll select a deployment procedure
for this service a deployment procedure
contains the provisioning logic that can
take a golden image from our software
library and deploy it eliminating the
need for our users to do that themselves
we have some deployment procedures
available based on memory and heap
settings for weblogic we'll select a
deployment procedure that creates
weblogic with a 1 gigabyte heap size and
give it a description now let's make
this service available in some of our
zones for some of our users let's add
this to our dev and QA zones
we also need to give permission to
certain roles so let's give permission
to our dev and QA users so far we've
created a new service published it to
two zones and given access to the
appropriate users we could not be
complete and finish this wizard we can
see that our new service is visible in
the services table along with the number
of zones and users however we could also
choose to monetize our cloud by setting
up a chargeback plan let's configure a
new chargeback plan the chargeback
screen gives you an overview of all the
plans you have currently defined
chargeback plans can be based on
universal metrics such as CPU memory
disk and IO or service specific metrics
for example in the case of weblogic
based services you can charge users
based on the load or number of requests
on the application instead of basic CPU
metrics you can see here that we have a
number of chargeback plans to find
chargeback plans can be based on the
needs of your business so you may have
different plans for production versus
development zones or database versus
middleware zones or even based on
geography let's assign a chargeback plan
to our new zone will select our
development zone and assign it a plan in
this demonstration we created a new zone
added users to the zone published
services assigned quotas and establish
chargeback plans our zone is now ready
to be used by self-service portal users
to provision new service instances in
our cloud thank you for watching this
