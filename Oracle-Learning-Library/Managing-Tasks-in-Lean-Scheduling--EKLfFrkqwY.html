the prime tasks app for lean scheduling
first use the prime schedule app to
build a new project or imports an
existing project from Primavera p6 via a
p6 XML file gateway or p6 sync be sure
that the project has been scheduled
so durations and dates are calculated
using the critical path method open the
project and Prime tasks the project is
displayed on the work plan page lean
scheduling empowers contractors
supervisors consultants and trade
foremen the people responsible for the
actual work to break a project's
activities down into smaller tasks and
then to schedule those tasks themselves
they use weekly planning sessions to
arrange the tasks to meet each
activities planned finish date click the
Gantt icon to display activities on the
planning board activities are now
overlaid on the planning board click the
Settings icon to customize the display
use the manage views page to create your
own filter or change the planning period
select custom rolling timeframe to
specify the number of weeks before and
weeks after the current week that are
displayed
click the quick filters tab to select up
to three quick filters to display in the
view
to create tasks click an activity in the
hopper three tasks have already been
created for this activity click the plus
sign to create another type a name for
the task and then select the company
that will perform it companies are
maintained in prime for use across
applications assign a different color to
each company so their tasks can be
easily distinguished on the Planning
Board select a duration if you know it
will be more than the 1-day default
remember you can always lengthen or
shorten tasks when they're on the
Planning Board click apply
when all tasks are defined drag them
from the hopper and arrange them on the
planning board move tasks to a different
week by dragging them to a week listed
to the right of the planning board
adjust task durations right on the
planning board for example let's look at
the tasks for activity 2020 during
planning the carpentry foreman decides
that due to a structural issue closing
and refinishing the wall may require
more than one day so we can expand this
task this creates an issue however
because the task durations now add up to
six days while the planned duration of
the associated activity is only five
days the problem is resolved when the
telecommunications supervisor suggests
that his shop can prefabricate sections
of the cable and conduit off site
thereby reducing their on-site tasks
from two days to one click Save when you
are finished scheduling tasks for the
week
