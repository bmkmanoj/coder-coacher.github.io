Jim Leske I'm the lead of the
multi-language group in the in Java
tools and this talk is going to be a
little bit background behind this
project it was a little tricky to put
together because I was thinking that you
know with an existing language like Java
Script is really not too much you can
you can say that would be interesting so
what I'm going to try to do is focus on
specific things that NASA one does that
other like other versions of Java Script
that doesn't do it's our safe harbor
slide so the first thing I will talk
about is is the engine itself the
history history behind it talk about how
you would use Nass worn either directly
or as part of your java java code i'll
go run through some of the features that
are specific to java to NASA JavaScript
NASA morn and we'll do a few demos and
then finally wrap it up with a with some
final notes at the end there this is the
raging red rhino that's sort of our
unofficial logo Nassau it is pronounced
as horn not Nash horn not Nass forn but
neighs horn this is to pay homage to its
ancestor rhino which has been on the JVM
for a long time NASA one is the internal
project that was started about two years
ago actually two years ago in October to
develop a necklace script compliant
version language to run on the JVM it
started out as an experiment to see how
hard it would actually be to implement
JavaScript from scratch and it took hold
and the group's got a little bit larger
in the last year's we're following or
tracking addition 5.1 of
the script standard but we're also
tracking evolving changes in standards
so as new standards come out we'll be
updating an ass horan with with the you
releases as things change as I said NASA
horan is a clean database clean source
base it what doesn't take anything from
right now it started from scratch and
was primarily designed with 290 using
292 as it's a basis main basis it's much
smaller and significantly faster than
then right now and we're tracking the
performance of other vendors so that we
get ourselves up to the same levels what
you're seeing in some your browsers so
why would we want to do javascript why
would we want to do scripting at all
well we find that there's a lot of of
tasks or applications where it would be
appropriate or seems more appropriate to
do scripting than actually the full
implementation of something in a
higher-level language like like Java
itself it has a dynamic style you can do
things prototype things fairly quickly
it's a lot easier to develop something
in JavaScript than it would be to start
the whole process of developing a Java
program what it what's this JavaScript
does that other Java scripts don't do is
that gives you an access directly to the
rich Java libraries that are out there
there's a huge number of Java stacks out
there covering all kinds of things from
networking stuff to embed his system
stuff and we want to be able to access
that from our scripting language so
that's that's the big thing is that Java
nass weren't talks directly to a Java we
chose javascript / other languages
because it's as a fairly similar syntax
to Java but it's it's very different
from Java in the scripting capabilities
it's also the choice is driven by the
popularity of html5 currently and people
more more people getting involved in
JavaScript and we hope to attract more
developers or newer developers to to the
platform so which platforms are we
targeting well these are the three main
ones that we're targeting initially but
obviously there's other possibilities
like in the future the embedded mobile
market client-side and server-side in
the embedded side because we're smaller
and tighter and faster it's it fits
quite well in some of the small devices
that are out there actually we'll be
doing demo at the end of the talk here
where we're actually running an ass horn
on a Raspberry Pi board one of the
things you should consider about
JavaScript versus Java is that
javascript is a smaller pelo because it
you have a fairly small text item that
you can pass around over the network or
store in your application you don't have
to to download a whole jar so it works
quite well on the innovative systems the
client this the on the client we're
looking at different possibilities
showing a demo of it nessa aren't using
JavaFX there's also a possibility of
hooking into WebKit the web node object
in FX is currently project going on
where we're trying to integrate nass
horn in in this slide about the FX we
note that there's a tight integration of
NASCAR into Java and its really very
natural to use def X from NASA or maybe
even better than from Terra on the
server side there's obviously there's
already existing stuff that uses
JavaScript the GSP this business
processes that use JavaScript and
there's a couple of other projects on
the go within or Oracle which are bound
in JavaScript one will be demonstrating
here later is no jar and project avatar
which is server client side
javascript it's a to your advantage to
think of javascript instead of java as
an alternative to java because when
you're hiring people to do development
of server systems server-side systems
it's fairly easy to get people who are
working in javascript so if they could
work in javascript of both sides then is
its a mix of good investment or for
better investment and one of the nice
things to also is that if you think of
java as being somewhat static system you
have to build your application up well
in advance you know package it up and
download it or ship it to wherever it's
going to actually going to run the nice
thing about javascript is that you can
modify it once that product is shipped
so one of the things you could consider
would be using javascript as a
configuration language for your field
engineers if they need to reconfigure
your application in the field it'd be a
lot easier to tweak up the javascript
then would be just mess around with a
Java this a little bit further on no jar
but not a lot of people outside of work
will really know about this I just
thought I'd bring it up a notch a little
bit here no Jerry is Oracle's
implementation of note jas running under
NASCAR originally was started out as a
test bed to see if NASA horn would scale
up to handle nodejs but if you know
anything about the implementation nodejs
know it nodejs is actually a lot of
native libraries a lot of native code
whereas if it was running in the JVM it
needs to use Java instead so what we're
doing here with with no Jarrah is
actually in building up note jas but
using Java is the underpinnings of it
all to Java and JavaScript so Carly we
are focusing on the core modules but
then we'll be building up to be able to
handle larger larger units
this is give you an idea of status of
the project at this point we had been
focusing on getting our compliance up
right from the beginning because we
wanted to make sure that we had a good
solid version of java script so that was
our main focus so we we had this this
this creative compliance correctness and
performance in that order so we've got
to the point where our compliance is
pretty good this was actually the test
aside is randy's on Thursday so that's a
fairly current we're actually only
failing one tests and I'm sure by the
end of this week or the end of next week
that tests will be working as well so so
we will meet the compliance requirements
of the ACMA script bremen it wasn't made
the slight wasn't really made to make
the other guy just look bad because
they're really only eight or 12 fails
and they're not really anything
significant but it's just to give you a
sense of that we're up there with risk
them so so we're on track to deliver
this is it we're close to passing
hundred percent in the compliance test
26 to compliance test our task now is to
harden it up be able to scale it up to
bigger projects get the performance
levels up so you know still have a fair
amount of work to do but since we're
shipping with jdk 8 we do have some time
to get this right as announced yesterday
Oracle's planning on proposing NASCAR as
being in an open JDK project and that
should happen fairly soon so we want
people to come on board to help us
develop new technologies with NASCAR and
then also make improvements to to our
existing stuff so you can think of this
as being recruiting to add to join us
and as I say we're going to ship with
jdk 8 so this is a similar slide to
listen the keynote yesterday we've we've
started talking to different
organizations about joining us on the
nests current project IBM NetBeans
and Twitter so I have a couple people
are willing to come forward and talk a
little bit about it so Sam you want to
come up so sample eras with Twitter and
he did a little bit of goofing around on
the weekend we gave him a early release
of jdk 8 with an ass whore and installed
and can you tell us a little bit what
you did with it yeah sure so I've been
out you have known about this project
for a while because a friend of mine
works on it and it's I've been really
excited by you know at yahoo I built
white the YQL engine to do its server
side JavaScript performance with rhino
because of the ability to control
tightly control things but you know the
the actual performance of the Rhino
engine is pretty bad so the first thing
I did was with play around with Nas horn
to render mustache templates using both
the default mustache j/s library and
then also another one created by a
Twitter employee called Hogan jayus
which basically the idea there you
provide a template you provided backing
view code in JavaScript and it renders
out pages I was blown away one that
first of all everything just worked
there were literally I never ran into
actual like a correctness bug with the
nez Warren stuff which I guess that you
know that bears out their compliance
with 272 62 and then on the performance
side it was in in in the the most
challenging test it was more than 20
times faster than why now and I imagine
you know having actually written some
invoke dynamic code for mustache java
and knowing how you know what what's
left there to capture i think i think
we're going to see some pretty amazing
performance from these guys thank you
also like to ask John chicka le to come
up but John is with is the director of
engineering for netbeans yeah so we've
had a long relationship with netbeans
they were one of the very earliest
adopters
and maybe you can explain what you guys
did with it sure sure so how many people
saw the the project easel demo at the
the keynote last night you guys check
that out cool yeah we were very excited
to roll that out it's our new initiative
for html5 JavaScript CSS tooling inside
the IDE and specifically hooking it up
to Java services in the back end and we
completely rewrote our javascript editor
support off of our old infrastructure
and we rewrote it on top and a sworn
don't know how many of you know but um
netbeans actually uses java sea as a
library to provide all of our java all
of our java editor features so you
always know that when you get an error
in the Java editor it's the exact same
error that the compiler is going to give
you but we do the same thing with with
NASA warned we use NASA warned to go
through parse the the pages and provide
things like you know simple things like
an entation and cut coloring to more
complex things like we're factoring and
code completion it's really helped us
because as we all know javascript is a
notoriously hard language to build a
structure of because it defies structure
so much but we've been able using nass
12 to really build a pretty intelligent
editor that learns as you type all right
so as you are creating JavaScript to say
objects it'll recognize the patterns and
say oh hey that's an object a man and
provide you the correct the correct code
completion and so forth with it so we
were really interested in getting off of
an ass horn for a lot of reasons
performance legal and so forth
performance was a huge reason people are
very sensitive to the time it takes to
scan a project when you first open up
that project and get a scanning please
wait ya know and you got to wait for it
to scan a scanner scan well scanning the
JavaScript files with NASA with with
rhino is actually one of our biggest
bottlenecks and so we were we were
I have to say when we started we were a
little bit worried about performance I
was the number one thing that we were
worried about you guys totally blew us
away as well and and the other thing we
said wouldn't it be great to have an
in-house thing because boy you know we
always need to patch these things and
there's always bugs that we need to work
around and there's always these things
that we need to do to kind of get around
it and so it'll be nice if it's in in
house because then we can you know work
with it as we want but I'm pleased to
say we haven't had to apply a single
patch except for a little one to let it
be run on on jdk six we haven't really
had to do anything to it we've been able
to use it outside of the box so it's
been pretty fantastic experience thank
you John as John said describing about
the parsing of the JavaScript language
javascript is very painful language to
implement in a lot of ways so okay so
how would how do you use ness worm so
one of the more probably more obvious
ways of people using javascript in as a
tool you would use a command line
interface so we have this command line
interface that will be shipping with it
I called Nana's horn you can use it in
interactive mode or execute a file but
in factual fact that this is just a
shell to the way next one really works
underneath and that's using Jeff X
script now there was a talk just before
this one I don't know if anybody here or
attended that but I've guy from IBM was
talking about the use of Java X script
if you use you have X script to initiate
your nest warrant session you can do a
lot you can create your own Sheryl
specifically for your task or you can
actually embed Java JavaScript rate in
your application so if you have a text
editor application and you want to use
JavaScript as a way of reformatting the
way the text is laid out and your page
this is how you could do it it's really
very straightforward to do use if you
should look at Java X script
in detail it also gives you ways of
binding to to mass horn objects so you
can actually read and write properties
of objects it's a fairly powerful tool
to work with so want to talk a little
bit about the implementation of that
sort is actually one of the driving
forces behind it is that we wanted to
fit in well with the Java world we
wanted to make it you know use as much
as jabba as we possibly could without
actually having to going off and
reinventing things it's been to a big
advantage to us because the thing is
that we were able to pull up a working
version JavaScript really easily by
leveraging to have a fairly well but it
has also made it easier for Java and
JavaScript to talk to each other
programs to talk to each other objects
and arrays with in JavaScript with in
NASCAR and are actually a fairly high
level object that's actually ongoing
those ongoing changes in the
implementation so there's they're
somewhat opaque to Java users but it's
fairly easy to access the property since
by using the JavaScript binding
mechanism internally arrays use
primitive arrays so you should expect
good performance same similar
performance what you would get from from
Java we're experimenting with tagged
arrays as you as you know if you've used
javascript it's an untyped language a
variable X can have either an object or
reference to an object or it can have a
primitive value assigned to it so we
need to be able to work back and forth
so the tagged array is a way of actually
implementing a structure where we can
mix pointers in numeric values or
primitive values together functions are
implemented internally using method
handles so we're taking full advantage
of 292 s when you call a javascript
method it's going to be using 292 two
to invoke dynamic to get at that the
code for that method string numbers
boolean and the primitives are all
native okay so if you pass a java string
off into nasa warren it treats it like
one of the javascript string and the
javascript string goes back the other
way so there's one in the same same with
boolean numbers date regex and Jason are
special the special projects for those
two to mostly the game performance but
there's accessors 44 be able to give
that from the head from the Java side as
I said everything was based on using 292
for as much as we possibly could so
whenever you do a tour setter operation
either by direct property or by using
indexing whenever you make a call
whenever you create a new instance
that's all using invoke dynamic and what
that means is that at runtime when
you're actually executing that
particular section of code can be
replaced with whatever we want so just
to break it down a little bit let's say
say if you had an expression like VAR x
equals receiver thought property the
receiver can be an ass or an object it
could also be a java java object it
could be a javabeans object it could be
a J Ruby object it could be almost
anything and at runtime when we
encounter this we can look at the
receiver and say oh we have to call this
method or we have to invoke this curve
in order to handle the situation we look
up look up the best fit so in this
particular sequence we have you know
object is equal to a and B or the
property with properties a and B and
then the second step there is we wanted
to access the property be from the
object so this becomes a dynamic call to
get the property be from object so we so
then when that when that is encountered
we look up the B property and you
object and construct the method handle
that handles the extraction of that
value from the object so I'm buying the
call site without a method handle and
from that point on we don't have to do
any further look up we basically just
say oh we already know how to look up be
from that object so we it's basically
becomes as fast as accessing let's say a
see feel from a innocent a/c program we
also have to put a guard there because
the thing is if the object is coming in
changes we have to be able to deal with
that so if it was a an ass for an object
before and becomes a java objects or
javabeans object we need to be able to
adjust to that so we put guards in place
the handle and to deal with all this we
we use an existing library that's
actually was written by one of the
members of our team the library is
called Dinah link and what it's what it
is is a module system that allows you to
to create units that determine how to to
do the lookups and the bindings for
these dynamic calls and because we use
this mechanism it was fairly easy to add
Ness horn to look up java notice how
knows how to look up things on java
objects but it also has the possibility
of looking up things looking up things
for let's say jruby objects or Java Bean
objects or specific types like how to
treat treat a map object as though it
looked like a JavaScript object
so because of this we can we can do the
lookups fairly quickly fairly easily be
fairly Speights type-specific lookups we
can do value conversions handle any
overloading let's say if you have two
methods in the jet in the Java class
that there's a conflict in the arguments
we can handle that scenario and you can
do some special default handling makes
it very flexible so what aspect of this
would be something like something like
the no such property no such method
implementation so what we can do is we
can define a special property within the
global space here it could be in any any
prototype where we can say that if you
can't find the property this is how you
instead of giving us an error handle it
this way so this case we're in the
global space we were saying okay we're
defining a function that's that sets the
properties undefined and returns
undefined so you'll never get an error
if the property doesn't exist it'll just
always return and define so it gives you
that kinds of flexibility similar sort
of thing here with the J adapter a J
adapter is an object that you can define
how you deal with gets and how you deal
with sets so if you create a J adapter
object then the property doesn't exist
you can get it to look up that property
in the database as an example or look
for the value of the property on it on
the network you can you can adapt it to
do whatever you wanted to do
as I said we're fairly tied fairly
closely to to Java and so in order to
use Java you need to be able to access
packages that are in Java and other
classes or in classes that are in Java
it's fairly straightforward to get a
bare-bones class from scratch you use
packages dot and then the name of the
class java java x and javafx are all
built in so as global so you can access
them fairly easily so if I wanted to get
the integer class or say the utility
class or package I can just say you tell
equals java.util so that gives me the
detail pet package and thats a shortcut
that you can use within your code and if
you want to access the site of the
integer class you can just say integer
equals java.lang.integer and what it
will do is assign the integer class to
integer and you can access it directly
that way there are some Java as I
mentioned before some to have other
objects that are one in the same on the
on the NASCAR inside so we're instance
the integer we can use integer
internally so you can create a new
integer and then you can treat it as
though it was a digital value and you
can do arithmetic on
the main thing here is that because of
what Dinah link is doing and connecting
up with with Java you can treat java
objects as though they were JavaScript
objects so if I want to get the value of
a function or method from integer i can
say integer dot and this is the this is
assuming that I got into your class
before I could just call it integer dot
value of and then give it the string and
then it will turn an integer value if I
want to access the global max value from
integer just integer max value and then
a return safai okay java subclassing is
it possible to subclass java objects
just by using the notation of new and
then java class and an open brace and
then what add whatever properties or
override whatever properties that you
want to override in the in the
superclass so in this case we want to
override the run function in the timer
task so we just say property name run
and then give the function we want to
call so then we end up with a subclass
of timer task which will call this this
run that we've implied here we've also
set it up so that handles Sam
automatically so if it's a single access
interface then you can put the function
indirectly you don't actually have to
construct the object it deals with it
directly the same as the lines of
functions would if you're working with a
Java array it internally it's handled
just like the JavaScript arrays you can
extract values from it you can insert
values in the array you can also iterate
over objects in the array so the for
loop will automatically like to iterate
over anything in that array actually
will allow you to iterate over anything
that's iterable iterable you can handle
Java exceptions internally in your
JavaScript code actually this is
probably not a good example a better
example would have been I could actually
say catch instance of file not found
exception and it will be able to deal
with it there's a this is a tool that
allows you to import a whole bunch of
packages all in one fell swoop java
importer and once you've imported all
this packages then you can use the with
statement to actually apply against code
within the brackets there so in this
case hashmap is a member of the java
details package so you can x-ray access
it directly that way and finally one of
the features we added fairly early on
was the ability to write shebang scripts
style scripts in in nests horn so this
allows you to throw away your parole and
your Python and whatever else you write
in and actually write things directly
into have JavaScript so we added the
features of you know pound comments be
able to access lion Eric's and
environment args you can load other
scripts into your into your script and
you have here strings and be able to do
at the strings from within the
environment okay so at this point I'm
going to do a few demos some of the
things I talked about
just ignore the transition here
yeah I think that's probably okay can
everybody in the back see these screens
fairly well okay
okay so the first example I want to show
is since Sam mentioned mustache we were
just sort of scrambling around trying to
find some examples that we had
demonstrated and Sam was quite
interested in a mustache because he had
done moustache to Java so that came up
and we said well how are we going to
make this work for him so you can go off
and do this testing and so was pretty
straightforward it wasn't that hard to
do so so this is what a moustache input
would look like it would basically be
these mustaches around substitution
areas that in the text that you want to
work with and then you would also
provide well basically effectively
adjacent type thing a way of actually
generating the values that are used in
the mustache substitution so in order to
get this going what we did was just
created a little shell we could have
probably probably if we tried hard
enough we could probably have done it
for these NASA horn command line but we
just did implemented a little shell here
which all it does is secure i just want
to hide the high the navigation bar
whoops I goober what is I'm trying to
hide ya hi files uh good thank you here
we go thank you
okay so basically this just sort of
wraps it all up for us but the but the
interesting parts of this is that we
have we get a script engine manager and
in from the script engine manager we get
ourselves an instance of the Nazca lines
script engine so from that point on is
our engine that we're working with and
in the body of our code here we we fetch
a string mustache string which is
basically to load mustache source code
and then we evaluate clear cache and
then further on me load the files that
are template and data and then executed
so just to prove that we can actually
execute this if I can bring up worksheet
okay so I'm just going to see if we can
do this it's going off and executing
JavaScript and there to execute and
fills it in assuming that Sam's
benchmark was a little bit more complex
than that obviously okay oops so just
and okay next example I want to show you
is is this this one is little bit more
complex this is actually built on Jeb x
FX I was running through the examples of
gfx to implement and there's a lots of
cool things and I think you all
understand what's going on but I thought
that one that this sort of was you know
glitzy but not too complicated so that
we can actually do it with the fireworks
example so just what the fireworks
example is is a well actually well does
this run it and you can see exactly
what's going on here
ok so the fireworks example is basically
just a pitch in the background and then
drawing fireworks across the screen the
interesting thing about this one example
is that each one of those particles is a
JavaScript object NASA Warren JavaScript
skirt JavaScript object so the the
actual glowing and the movement and
everything is all done in JavaScript ok
now again we probably could have done
something in the command line but again
we brought a shell is a similar sort of
thing where we we would create it or
create a new manager script engine
manager then we ask it to create an
instance of s warran and then further
further on here we would actually read a
file that we execute so it's reading a
javascript file that Rick we want to
execute and the javascript file is this
one here and so this is basically the FX
program all written in JavaScript and
towards the bottom here's something
fairly interesting I think that this
sort of whoops ok dis sort of give you a
sense of what you can do this is using
the sub classing so we want to create a
subclass of java java FX application and
we need to override the india to start
in the stop function so this is how we
do it so this is the sort of the driver
for for actual application what also
things is fairly interesting about this
fairly interesting about this
application is originally it was written
in JavaScript it was sitting on the
Google JavaScript library but then the
FX team took it and converted into Java
to run as their examples but then what
we did was we took the jab and give her
to back the JavaScript's and it looks
fairly different than the original
the original Jabba script I did a little
bit of a compare but most important part
the logic is fairly fairly much the same
one of the things that you should know
here is like because we recognize beans
there's actually no child property in
route it doesn't actually exist there is
a getter a get child and a stepchild in
that class but because of the way we've
implemented javabeans it says okay I
don't see a child property there let's
see if there's a beans accessing
mechanism there and we'll take advantage
of that so you can write your JavaScript
code fairly naturally you don't have to
worry about the beans conversion it's
all all happens for you okay so the next
demonstration is is ness when running on
a Raspberry Pi board so you want to take
over
so here on here you me and Dave good see
if you can get to my car yeah my kids
are so here is the Raspberry Pi a little
on again coming yeah if you have to talk
about the fun in here I did I messaged
into the into the pie I you can see that
this is running seven you six Java Sea
embedded and and I just started this no
dejar with a program called fortune that
I don't which is a fortune server and
i'll show you this was code for that
it's very simple we just sorry you just
folks the fortune command takes its
output and hypes that output to the HTTP
response and we can connect to it from
the browser and you get us some random
torture
so this this fortune program is just a
standard node program here is another
one which is a little bit more complex
we
and this is a date server so this
program calls into Java to get the
current date with formats it using
another Java called and then sets up a
timer every one second it writes out the
the current date to the time so the idea
here is that you can call into any
pretty much any java api seamlessly and
then stream the results back to work
line it takes a little while to start up
and i'll show you two clients connecting
to it one is curl it's not ready yet now
and here you get the current date and
you get the same thing when browser the
browser will ends up cashing a few
responses so this shows up enough in a
little wife basically the ideas you can
call into any get the this Java appear
that it's calling into it could be a
JDBC API or any other enterprise Java
API I realizes the apt ketchup does it
bug it too
okay so that the point here is that it s
horn is fairly lightweight so it fits in
embedded devices really nicely and works
quite well so okay
you
yes so the no charge that's something
that's going to be shipped separately
yeah the actual the actual process
involved in a jar is still up in the air
but it should be it'll ship separately
but it'll be involved in a different
process so it's not the current thoughts
well I can't actually get into it much
but it's it should be readily available
so yeah runs and JT and runs in a decade
nodejs or known as Lauren generally huh
okay so currently we're doing well
recently we did development on jdk 7 but
we ran into some technical difficulties
that push this off to jdk 8 but the plan
is to get it back ported to jdk 7 we
won't go back as far as jdk six because
that would be technically really tricky
to do so i'll have a Q&amp;amp;A session the
second is let me wrap up here okay so
this is a follow up here is that we have
a good solid implementation it plays
well with Java we're tracking the ACMA
standards fairly closely so we're going
to try to keep on top of this is an
example we have typed arrays sitting in
the wings ready to go in soon as the
standard comes out it scales to a
variety platforms runs on embedded
client-server we're going to be making
the OpenJDK project proposal it's very
soon and we plan on shipping with jdk 8
we're also inviting you to become
involved with the with the open source
project once it becomes available to
help contribute to to the environment
there's a couple of other sessions
evolved the discussion of an s warran we
have a session occurred this morning
about the optimization
that we're doing in nests horn there's a
births of the feather tomorrow night sir
tomorrow afternoon for the java nests
quarantine the birds of a feather
shortly rate after that in the same room
I think for the node team node in and
actually some EE guys discuss dated
persistence will also be involved with
the polygon at the session and finally
attila is going to be talking about
Dinah link in the session on Thursday a
session on Thursday okay so Dave we have
the lights up look in the queue a
petition okay yes
I'll repeat the question when she says
it okay okay so if i have a java array
and it i'm trying to index in it into
the array invoke the VOC dynamic will
say C or to die no link will see that it
is a java ray and we'll insert code
which will do a java like indexing into
that array well it will give you a an
index out of bounds exception it
preserves the geminus of it yes yeah yes
uh it's it's that market is kind of
wrapped up right now in some ways but we
we originally started out as let's sort
of spin off from the Java X project FX
project where they had a language called
FX script and realizing that it wasn't
going to be quickly adopted we thought
well maybe we should fall back on
JavaScript so version we've decided that
I think of NASCAR as a client but then
as we started going along we started
realizing oh this has a ee applications
script server-side applications so we
started focusing on that more so than on
the on the client side and the sewer
project avatar and the no gr no jar kick
in but we're we're hedging our bets and
we're going back the other way so
there's currently somebody poking around
an integrating a sworn in to WebKit so
i'm not sure where that party is going
to go or how it's going to pan out but
it should be it's not an easy thing to
do because WebKit is massive we also
mentioned here that we're thinking about
in terms of writing applications using
java at effects so you could effectively
do a browser like application using
JavaFX so it's a little bit further down
the road but yeah it's possibility so
the dom api's are not implemented in s1
we don't supply them but there are there
are versions that you can download and
put in but they won't do any graphics
work you need to the graphic side of
things right so there is a tool out
there and I can't run what the name it
is which allows you to run and Java X
script script in a browser and all the
outputs is treated as HTML so you can
actually do HTML types things in
view so I've seen that around so yes yes
let's that's okay the way we've
currently structured an ass Warren is
that you can have one context per thread
okay if you want to if you want to run
multi-threaded you'd have to create a
separate context a separate context to
run it in on a separate thread so
there's no possibility of collision of
objects and if you want the two threads
to talk each other you have to use JSON
to to pass messages across now that's
our short-term goal and that's the way
that's when I'll go out the door but our
long-term goal is to basically focus on
that solution the solution for
multi-threading JavaScript ok yes
yes yes I don't know the Doug doesn't it
doesn't apparently right oh yeah not yet
we don't have a solution for that
there's the way overloading handling
works in a simple call is that you can
actually specify the argument types when
you try to access the property but we
don't have a simple solution to that yet
we're basically trying to handle the
sort of the typical case right now but
but you know that's something that will
we have to focus on or work on as we're
gone so yes
can you answer that one
you have to speak up
as long as the long as the package is
installed and no connect system so are
there any other questions yes sir yeah
yep nope yeah it should have been a
session ok so they think that the
question is a performance question you
it's I'm not trying to duck it but the
thing is that if we were to actually
tell you what her performances now it
wouldn't really be relevant to when we
ship right because the thing is that you
know we have time to move on with some
of the stuff are there are some issues
in the JVM that we have to work out and
once they we work that out where a
performance levels should be right up
there so and we were actually work quite
closely to the JVM team and that's sort
of there this isn't all all software
side it's basically have to as far as
the JavaScript disconcert we also have
to worry about the JVM and the
implementations of things in the JVM as
well so any other questions yes
sandbox it in the sense that it runs in
a separate right so when you execute if
you're executing multi-threaded you get
a separate context so there's no cross
chatter between the two things so that
they can interfere with each other's
objects but they also but they're
sharing the same memory space so that's
not a true sandbox right all permissions
are permission oh oh yeah so there's a
permissions file you can specify the
exact ya know you can see you can
specify whatever you want it's a very
fine fine grained security model so you
can basically you know right down to the
to the class and that you want isolated
so yeah basically you can say all of all
of i/o is basically off-limits if you
want yeah yeah anything else thank you
