infrastructure object storage hello I am
having a hard time staying ahead of the
demand for storage I'm looking for a
storage service that can help me store
my growing data durably and
cost-effectively
I have been hearing a lot about the
Oracle cloud infrastructure object
storage can you tell me more about this
service sure Oracle cloud infrastructure
object storage is an internet scale
highly durable and highly available
storage service it's ideal for storing
unstructured data data is stored as
objects in buckets
a bucket is a logical container that
groups objects together a bucket is
associated with a single compartment
which in turn has policies that indicate
what actions a user can perform on a
bucket and all the objects in the bucket
you can access the service via the
Oracle cloud infrastructure service
console SDK or CLI how can I estimate
how much storage I should purchase up
front you don't need to make any upfront
storage purchases object storage is
elastic you only pay for what you use
you can seamlessly scale your storage
footprint as your need to store data
scales you can store an infinite amount
of data in the object storage create
thousands and buckets per account and
store an unlimited number of objects per
bucket an object can be as large as 10
terabytes
wow you can really store large files
uploading a 10 terabyte file can take a
really long time are there any
techniques I can leverage to efficiently
upload such large files you can use the
multi-part upload feature to efficiently
upload large files you can segment your
file into smaller parts and then upload
these parts in parallel object storage
supports up to 10,000 parts per file and
a part can be as small as 10 megabytes
using multi-part upload not only
significantly reduces the upload time
but also minimizes the impact of Network
failures if a part fails to upload for
any reason you can retry to upload the
part instead of having to upload the
entire file
what about durability how durable is the
data stored in the object storage
data stored in the object storage is
very durable multiple copies of an
object are stored redundantly across
multiple availability domains in a given
region
data integrity is monitored using
checksums
any drop in redundancy is auto detected
and remedied immediately without any
customer impact what about security how
secure is my data in the Oracle cloud
infrastructure object storage object
storage supports server-side encryption
all data stored in object storage is
automatically encrypted data is uploaded
and downloaded from object storage over
SSL endpoints using the HTTP protocol by
default only authenticated users that
have explicitly been granted access to
specific resources can access data
stored in the object storage the surface
is tightly integrated with Oracle cloud
infrastructure Identity and Access
Management for an additional layer of
security you can encrypt objects prior
to sending them to the object storage
that gives you total control over not
only your data but also the encryption
keys that are used to encrypt the data
that sounds great how can I share my
data stored in the object storage with
others you can make a bucket public to
share data with others anyone with
knowledge of the public bucket name and
associated namespace can anonymously
read data stored in a public bucket with
public buckets you can also list objects
or retrieve the object metadata if you
do not wish to make a bucket public you
can use pre authenticated requests or
Identity and Access Management or iam
policies to share data these two options
offer a more secure means of sharing
data with others as compared to public
buckets
when do you recommend using object
storage some typical use cases include
big data backup or archive and content
repository big data object storage
offers a scalable storage platform which
enables you to not only store large data
sets but also operate seamlessly on it
optimized for high throughput you can
share the stored data widely with
moderate latency backup or archive
backup or archive data is typically
written once and read many times the
durability and low cost characteristics
of object storage make it a perfect
platform to store long living data
content repository the object storage
supports any content type images logs
and video you can reliably store this
data for a long time and the storage
scales seamlessly without performance
degradation you can also access this
content directly from object storage
that's great sure how about a quick demo
on how to use object storage
login to the Oracle cloud infrastructure
portal in the console click object
storage under storage
the object storage uses buckets to
organize your files to use the object
storage you need to create a bucket
first and then add data files
of the bucket name
the name cannot be changed from the
console the name can contain letters
numbers dashes and periods click create
bucket
the bucket is created immediately and
you can add objects to it and view its
details
this service supports individual files
up to 50 GB you can use the console to
upload files 5 GB or smaller for larger
files use the SDK or REST API
follow the prompts in the upload wizard
to browse
choose
and upload the objects
the object is uploaded and displayed in
the list of objects
you can find more information about
these features in our documentation to
learn more please go to the Oracle cloud
infrastructure portal you can sign up
for a free trial and get started right
