NetSuite 2018 one searches and reports
have existed as separate tools within
the NetSuite application each have their
own metadata layers different user
interfaces and authoring processes these
differences have led to challenges for
users such as inconsistency and how
fields are exposed within each tool and
confusion over whether to create a
search versus a report and vice versa in
NetSuite 2018 1 the next-gen analytics
beta previews a new unified query and
reporting tool that is currently in
development for NetSuite with next-gen
analytics you can create highly
customizable queries and reports using a
single tool with an intuitive user
interface this interface enables report
authoring through actions such as
drag-and-drop editing and has been
designed so that even users with limited
knowledge of records schemas in query
language can still create complex
queries and reports other features like
support for multi-level joins and joins
to custom records have also been added
to next-gen analytics pivot capabilities
enable you to create multiple reports
using the same source data while custom
formula fields let you include
dynamically calculated values in your
reports here's a more complete list of
features available during the beta of
note you can apply filters totals in
number formatting to your report you can
also save next-gen analytics reports in
your NetSuite account and share them
with other users features that are not
supported during the beta includes
standard reports based on pre-built
report definitions data visualizations
hierarchical fields and further pivot
capabilities such as drill down are also
still in development more information
about these features will be released at
a later date
please note that a limited set of
records and fields are currently
available in the next-gen analytics tool
our teams are currently working to
expose additional records and fields so
that they can be used in the new query
tool to enable next-gen analytics in
your account go to setup company enable
features click the analytics tab then
check the next-gen Analects box and
click Save after you enable the feature
you can try creating a report in
next-gen analytics by going to reports

report
the next-gen analytics user interface is
divided into three main tabs the data
tab where you select the source data for
your report and create custom formula
fields the criteria tab where you set up
criteria to refine the source data for
your report in the pivot tab where you
set up the report layout to summarize
and pivot your source data the data tab
displays the source data for your report
in the data grid on the right fields
that you can add to the source data
appear in the fields list on the left
this includes fields from any related
records you join to the report and any
custom formula fields you create in the
formula fields sub tab you can add to
your source data by dragging fields from
the fields list to the grid on the grid
itself you can sort the values that are
presented or change the order of the
columns that are listed access the quick
filters in the header contextual menu to
export your source data to a CSV file
you click the export icon to refine your
source data you create filters on the
criteria tab the criteria tab is set up
like the data tap with a fields list on
the left and a criteria builder on the
right like the data tab creating filters
is a matter of dragging fields from the
fields list to the Builder then setting
specific filter conditions for each
field you can create filters based on
record fields or custom formula fields
you set up for the report you can also
create groups of filters and change the
logic use to connect each filter once
your source data is set up the way you
want the pivot table enables you to
pivot the data to generate a report as
with the other tabs the pivot tab
displays a fields list on the left and a
report layout panel on the right
building report just requires you to
drag fields from the fields list to the
layout panel you can also add totals and
grand totals format the values that are
shown in the report and adjusts the size
of the report columns and rows
from anywhere within the tool at any
point during the authoring process you
can also share your report with other
users in your NetSuite account using the
menu icon reports shared in next-gen
analytics include any selections made on
the data tap criteria tab and pivot tap
