this video we will show what an
administrator needs to do to transition
their sandbox to the NetSuite domain
we'll use the choose role page to access
sandbox accounts and learn how to
distinguish between sandbox and
production accounts you'll learn how you
can use two browsers to work in both
production and sandbox accounts at the
same time we will also review some tips
for working in sandbox accounts that
have been transitioned to the NetSuite
domain then we'll go over zero downtime
refresh and what that means for your
users when you refresh your sandbox in
2018 one starting January 12th 2018
after administrators have refreshed to
sandbox users will access that sandbox
from the NetSuite domain in this section
of the video we're going to describe the
differences that you will notice with
the new sandbox accounts and will give
you tips for making the transition
seamless for your users On January 12
2018 administrators can decide when to
transition a sandbox account to the next
week domain the transition happens
automatically when the administrator
refreshes the sandbox to refresh the
sandbox account the administrator goes
to setup company company management
sandbox accounts
decide who will have access to the
sandbox account by default sandbox
accounts are only accessible to NetSuite
administrators but you can allow all
users to access the sandbox account if
you change this preference in the past
verify this setting then click refresh
sandbox a sandbox account is moved to
the NetSuite domain when it is refreshed
after the sandbox refresh is complete
the primary sandbox account ID is
appended with underscore sp1 meaning it
no longer has the same account ID as the
related production account the account
IDs of your secondary sandbox accounts
will not change access your refreshed
sandbox account by logging into system
NetSuite comm click your name and
current role on the right side of the
header to open the choose role page
in addition to your production roles the
choose role page now lists your roles in
all the account types to which you have
accessed such as development or release
preview accounts the account type column
indicates the particular account for
that role for example whether the role
is for a sandbox or production account
to switch roles click the role name you
can also log in to a sandbox account by
using the change roles list to look for
the account that you want sandbox
accounts have an SB logo beside the role
name you can tell that you are currently
in a sandbox account by the sandbox
logos shown in the header some people
like to have both your production and
sandbox accounts open at the same time
to evaluate the effect of changes you
can do this by opening a production role
in one browser and your sandbox role in
a different browser before doing this
make sure you have a default rural
specified in your production account for
example open google chrome and go to
system NetSuite comm and log in
you're logged in to your default role in
your production account switch to a role
in your sandbox account now open mozilla
firefox go to system NetSuite comm again
and log into NetSuite using the same
email address using the same email
address ensures that you are logged in
to your default role in production again
you now have two NetSuite sessions open
one in your sandbox account and one in
your production account to help
differentiate between multiple sandbox
accounts administrators can change the
account name to include the type to
change the account name go to setup
company company information change the
company name the name must be updated
each time the sandbox is refreshed users
can choose different color themes in
different account types to help them
remember when they are in a sandbox or
production account change the color
theme by going to home set preferences
appearance
you might notice a few differences in
sandboxes on the NetSuite domain there
is no concept of a primary sandbox in
the sandbox is on the NetSuite domain
all sandboxes behave like secondary
sandboxes since there is no primary
sandbox no sandbox will have the same
account ID as your production account
keep in mind that not all features can
be tested in a sandbox account some
features might have restrictions in the
sandbox account for more information
search for features available for
testing in a sandbox in the Help Center
now let's look at zero downtime refresh
once your account is in the new
architecture and you are upgraded to
2018 one you will see zero downtime when
you request a refresh with this feature
sandbox users will be able to continue
using your sandbox account even when the
administrator has requested a refresh
the refresh process now consists of two
steps the administrator requests the
Refresh and once the refresh process is
complete the administrator activates the
sandbox the administrator goes to setup
company sandbox accounts on the sandbox
accounts page and click refresh sandbox
a message appears to notify you that
your existing sandbox will remain online
while you wait for the refresh to
complete any sandbox users who log into
the account after the refreshes in
progress will see a notice indicating
that the refresh is in progress
after NetSuite completes the Refresh
administrators will see an activate
button on the sandbox accounts page
after the Refresh is complete
administrators have up to 14 days to
activate the sandbox before you activate
a newly refreshed account make sure your
users are ready for the switch data and
customizations that are not moved to
production before the Refresh is
requested may be lost
sandbox users will need to make sure all
their work is saved before you activate
the sandbox for more information about
the sandbox transition and zero downtime
