files you want to prepare and transform
as a single file with Oracle Big Data
preparation cloud service I can do just
that I start by creating a transform
using a single data file I can perform
repair and enrichment task on this file
first or add a second file before
preparing each of them separately the
intuitive user interface makes it
convenient for me to switch between
these data files I have created a basic
transform and made all the modifications
and enhancements required I am now ready
to include a second file to this
transform I select the file from the
data source where I had uploaded it
earlier I can tell the processing engine
that this file contains column headers
and that I want the transform to run
against a smart sample when the service
engine starts to process the new file a
banner appears about the mean or think
page and an Asterix remains next to the
drop down while the file is being
ingested once a file is successfully
processed I can view the contents of
either file by selecting its file name
from the drop-down I perform any
necessary data repair or enrichment
tasks to either file and then start the
blending process
in the blending configuration dialog I
add the blending conditions Oracle Big
Data preparation cloud service as an
underlying relationship discovery engine
that provides blending key
recommendations I view their confidence
course to get guidance on the accuracy
of these recommendations I can opt to
not use the recommendations and manually
specify the blending conditions by
indicating which column or columns from
each file match for the resulting output
I select whether i want the blend to
include only matching rows or matching
rows in addition to the rest of the data
from either the left f1 file or write f
to file from the column selection tab I
select the columns to be included in the
resulting blended file after i submit
the blend configurations the blending
process starts once the blend is
complete I view it and modify its
contents like any other transform I can
also add another file to this transform
and start the blending configuration
process again I can blend up to three
files into a single transform to learn
