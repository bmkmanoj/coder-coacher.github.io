run the reconfiguration wizard to
upgrade an Oracle WebLogic server domain
I created the existing domain with
WebLogic server version 10 point 3.6 the
target version of WebLogic server is 12
point 1.3
before you run the reconfiguration
wizard on an existing domain check your
applications to ensure that they are
compatible with the new version of
WebLogic server shut down all servers in
the domain backup the domain install the
new version of WebLogic server for
details on what you should do before
running the wizard see the prepare to
upgrade section of the upgrading Oracle
WebLogic server document
log into the system on which the
administration server runs I have
already logged into my administration
server machine which is running Oracle
Linux open a terminal window and
navigate to Oracle home slash Oracle
common slash common slash bin I
previously set up a variable for Oracle
home
execute the command reconfig to bring up
the graphical reconfiguration wizard
on the select domain screen enter or
browse to the existing domain location
you
then click Next
the reconfiguration set up progress
screen shows the Wizards progress in
applying reconfiguration templates the
upgrade is also validated
when this step completes click Next the
domain mode and JDK screen displays the
mode and JDK of the domain the mode
comes from the existing domain and
cannot be changed by the wizard the JDK
that was used when you installed the new
version of WebLogic server is
automatically selected as the JDK for
the reconfigured domain but you can
select a different JDK I leave the
default JDK selected click Next on the
JDBC data sources screen the data source
is defined in the existing domain are
listed in the lower half of the screen
select the data source or data sources
for which you want to change settings
once the data source is selected you can
update the values of its settings note
that if you select multiple data sources
the text varies among component schemas
might be displayed in certain fields
indicating that the current values of
those fields are different across the
selected data sources if you change the
values in such fields the new values are
applied to all the selected data sources
in this demonstration I select my one
data source
and update its database driver
and the database users password
in addition to changing a data sources
settings you can convert the data source
from a generic data source to one to be
used with an Oracle RAC database by
selecting either convert to grid link or
convert to rack multi data source
if you select either of these options
when you click Next additional screens
are displayed
when you are finished with data sources
click Next
on the JDBC data sources test screen
data sources that were selected on the
previous screen are tested if none were
selected on the previous screen you can
select them now and click the test
button the results of the tests are
indicated in the status column a
successful test is indicated by a green
check details are displayed in the
connection result log area if any tests
fail use the back button to change
settings for the failing data source
when all tests are successful click Next
this screen is displayed only if the
domain you are reconfiguring uses a per
host node manager the only type of node
manager available in WebLogic server
version 10 point 3.6 was per host so the
screen displays here use this screen to
select the node manager configuration to
use for the reconfigured domain the
resulting configuration depends on the
combination of options you select for
node manager type and node manager
configuration in this demonstration I
select the per domain default location
type so the node manager will be per
domain and the node manager home will be
under the domain in a directory named
node manager for the node manager
configuration
the choices are create new configuration
a per domain node manager configuration
will be created for the reconfigured
domain by using the default settings in
node manager dot properties you can
modify this file after the domain has
been successfully reconfigured migrate
existing configuration
the existing per host node manager
configuration will be migrated to a per
domain configuration for the
reconfigured domain this does not
include environment specific settings
for listen address
listen port start script name Java home
and log file you will need to set those
manually after the domain has been
successfully reconfigured
I select create new configuration
next I enter the node manager
credentials
you
then click Next
on the advanced configuration screen
select all categories for which you want
to update the domains configuration for
each category you select the appropriate
configuration screen is displayed if you
do not select any items on this screen
the configuration summary screen is
displayed next
I select all the options I am given so
that you can see those screens
then click Next
from this screen you can add delete or
clone manage servers you can also change
the settings for an existing managed
server in this demonstration I clone one
of the managed servers to clone a server
you select its row and click clone the
clone appears in its own row and you can
edit its attributes all applications and
libraries that are targeted to the
source server are also deployed to the
clone in addition data sources and some
of the other services targeted to the
source server are automatically targeted
to the clone see the upgrade guide for
details
when finished with manage servers click
Next
use the clusters screen to add or delete
clusters you can also change the
settings for an existing cluster
I do not change anything here so I click
next use the next screen to assigned
manage servers to clusters I select
server 3 and click the right arrow to
move it under cluster 1 then click Next
use the Machine screen to add or delete
machines or to modify the settings for
an existing machine I leave the machine
configuration as it is then click Next
use this screen to assign servers to
machines I select server 3 and click the
right arrow to move it under machine 1
then click Next
use the deployments targeting screen to
target applications for deployment on
servers or clusters note that
applications associated with the product
for which you are configuring the domain
are automatically targeted to the manage
server created for that product or to
the cluster to which that managed server
is assigned this screen is for you to
target applications to additional
servers and clusters to target an
application deployment to a cluster or
server in the targets area select the
cluster or server on which you want to
deploy an application in the deployments
area select the application then click
the right arrow
repeat this process as needed
when you are finished with deployments
click Next
use this screen to target surfaces to
the appropriate managed servers or
clusters services that are associated
with the product for which you are
configuring the domain are targeted
automatically to the managed server
created for that product or to the
cluster to which that managed server is
assigned in this screen you can target
services to additional servers and
clusters in the targets area select a
cluster or server in the services area
select a service click the right arrow
to target the service to the server or
cluster I do not need to make any
changes here so I click Next
review the detailed configuration
settings of the domain before continuing
you can change which items are displayed
by selecting a filter option from the
view drop-down list
you
if you need to change the configuration
click the back button to return to the
appropriate screen and make changes when
you are satisfied with the configuration
click reconfig to reconfigure the domain
the existing domain is reconfigured in
place its location does not change
this screen displays the progress of the
reconfiguration process during this
process domain information is extracted
saved and updated schemas scripts and
other such files that support your
Fusion Middleware products are updated
when the process completes click Next
the final screen indicates whether the
reconfiguration process completed
successfully or it failed the screen
also displays the location of the domain
that was reconfigured and the
administration console URL if the
reconfiguration process did not complete
successfully an error message is
displayed to indicate the reason take
appropriate action to resolve the issue
if you cannot resolve the issue contact
my Oracle support click finish to exit
the wizard
