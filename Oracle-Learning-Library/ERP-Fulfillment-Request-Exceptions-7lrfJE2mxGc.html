to enter a picking type fulfillment
exception on a fulfillment request
record in NetSuite you will also learn
how to resolve their exception and enter
fulfillment instructions then you will
see how to acknowledge the instructions
to continue with fulfillment of the
customer's order
there are basically three steps to work
in with a fulfillment exception the
store associate typically completes the
first and last step where as a customer
service representative completes the
second or middle step let's get a quick
overview of each step in the process
first as a store associate when we
identify a problem with fulfilling a
store pickup order we enter a
fulfillment exception then as a customer
service representative we contact the
customer about the order to determine
how they want to proceed with the order
in the last step back at the store we
need to acknowledge the customers final
fulfillment instructions to continue the
fulfillment process either canceling the
items awful fill in the items based on
the customers preferences now let's look
at each step in detail in NetSuite our
demo uses a standard NetSuite
application but you can also use suite
commerce in store to perform the sales
associate steps in our demo scenario the
berkeley store has received a
fulfillment request for two items a
mountain shirt and a trekking hat as a
store associate we open the fulfillment
request in next week's both items
ordered by the customer are visible
under the items sub tab we mark the
order in progress to indicate that we
will start fulfilling the order next we
start picking items from the store
shelves however when we go to pick up
the mountain shirt we realize that the
last available mountain
is listen a button let's go ahead and
enter a fulfillment exception for the
mountain shirt by entering the
fulfillment exception we have better
visibility on the status of the order we
can flag inventory problems in your
system and we can keep track of customer
feedback first we need to edit the
fulfillment request and switch to the
fulfillment echo section II tab select
the item and enter the exception
quantity in this case one note that
NetSuite won't let you enter an
exception quantity that's greater than
the requested quantity in the sales
order select an exception type at this
stage we can only select picking and
then select a reason and traditional
comments to help your customer service
representative resolve the exception
later
note that the exception type is
determined by the stage of fulfillment
the order is at you can also enter pick
up fulfillment exceptions when the
customer comes to pick up or collect the
order
NetSuite will only show you the
appropriate options that apply to each
item when you are done click Save
since you are able to pick the other
item from store shelves you can click
fulfil in the fulfillment request and
select to fulfill the trek in Hat
NetSuite creates a store pickup
fulfillment record for that if
everything is ok save the record
now in the fulfillment request the
pickup hold field is set to customer
feedback requested this means that
customer service representative
now needs to contact the customer and
ask them what they want to do the pickup
hold field is like a secondary status of
the fulfillment request NetSuite updates
the pickup hold field only when all
items have been picked or have a
fulfillment exception in the second step
in the process we contact the customer
to communicate the status of the order
and ask them how to proceed we enter the
customer's instructions on the
fulfillment request record when you log
in as a customer service representative
open the fulfillment request to view the
reason for the exception if the customer
wants to fulfill the item set the
instruction field to fulfill if the
customer does not want to fulfill select
do not fulfill in this case the customer
decides they no longer want the item so
we'll set the instruction to do not
fulfill since there is more than one
item in this fulfillment request we also
need to set instructions on all of the
lines in the request so let's set the
second line to fulfill after you save
the fulfillment request the pickup whole
field is set to customer feedback
received in the last step of the process
we view the final fulfillment
instructions and proceed with the order
now back in the store we open the list
of fulfillment requests we see that the
status of the fulfillment request is
customer feedback received click view to
open the request we can see that the
fulfillment instructions for the
mountain's shirt are do not fulfill so
we don't need to do anything further for
the mountain shirt however in order to
proceed of the order we need to
acknowledge the instructions click edit
to update the fulfillment request and
then for each item check the acknowledge
instruction
and save your changes at this stage one
item has been picked the trek in hats
whereas the other item has been rejected
in the mountain shirt the picked and
rejected columns show the quantities and
the pickup hold field is set to
instructions acknowledged since we have
fulfilled all items the customer was to
receive the status of the fulfillment
request is payment to keep the customer
informed NetSuite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
