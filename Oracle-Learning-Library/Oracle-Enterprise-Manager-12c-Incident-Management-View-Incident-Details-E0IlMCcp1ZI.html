hello and welcome to our Oracle
Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 12c
demo series this demonstration shows you
how to use incident manager to look at
an incidence details this demonstration
follows the create view demonstration
and assume the prod group incidents
problems view has already been created
okay so let's select our new view which
is the one that filters all incidents
and problems that have occurred for all
targets pertaining to our production
group the right pane shows you the
corresponding incidents and problems
let's choose the backup of database
failed incident maximize your window
here you can see the incidence details
when it was created on which database it
failed moving to the tracking section
you can see there are no owners assigned
to this incident so let's assign an
owner by clicking on acknowledge these
acknowledges the incident as well as
assigning the connected user as the
incidence owner you can add comments to
by clicking add comments here let's just
want other administrators we will look
at this click OK
now click manage here you can track the
incident in values ways you can set its
resolution status right now it is new
because the incident was just created
but you can set it to work in progress
for example here the ownership is
correct you can set its priority so
let's set it to medium for now as this
is just the test database you can also
choose to escalate the instance if you
want but right now we will not do it
once you are done click OK this is a
very easy way for administrators to
collaborate and make sure each incident
is given the needed attention not that
the guided resolution section which
helps you to perform actions and
diagnosis to resolve this incident so
let's find out more details as to why
this packet failed by clicking the view
backup job link on this page you can see
the job details you notice that one of
the job steps failed so click on that
one here you can scroll down to identify
the root cause of the issue so somewhere
in the arm and script that was executed
there is a syntax error you can then fix
the typo and resubmit the job later ok
so let's go back and add a look at the
other tabs click on the events tab
these page shows you all the events that
are part of this incident you can click
on the event here to get more details
about that particular event let's go
back again to look at the my Oracle
support knowledge tab this page gives
you information about that incidents
related most articles as well as the
Oracle documentation to help you further
diagnose and fix that particular
incident now let's look at the update
tab this page tells you what are all the
actions that occurred on this incident
for example the fact that it was created
acknowledged and we set a priority etc
etc now let's look at the leg to step
here the related events an incidents
page shows you all the events and
incidents that occurred within a 30
minutes time frame of your incident
these concludes our demonstration thanks
