instances of a slower composite
application would you like to deliver
urgent composite fixes for long-running
active instances Oracle so sweet' 12.2
dot one offers the new feature composite
instance patching which allows
compatible changes in a composite to be
applied to long-running active instances
and recover faulted instances after
patching the runtime change is
compatible with the composite
application can be made without aborting
in flight instances if a running
instance finds a patch then it applies
the fixes to the in-flight business
process without the creation of a new
revision to patch a so a composite start
a developer with the solar patch
developer role generate the patch to XML
file generate a sparse deployment
profile validate and apply the patch by
using W LST commands the soul patch
developer role in Oracle JDeveloper 12c
enables me to make only compatible
changes to the composites and B pill
processes when I work with the soul
patch developer role the JDeveloper
composite MV p-- l editors indicate
limitations to prevent incompatible
changes the patch xml is generated when
my changes are saved while updating the
composite application in the soul patch
developer role after saving the changes
i generate the sparse deployment by
using the WL st console which creates a
SAR file with the application files that
were changed after i generate the patch
SAR file i give it to the so
administrator to validate the patch by
using the WebLogic scripting tool
command the patch validation is
recommended to make sure that the patch
has been created correctly the solar
administrator executes the command to
finally apply the patch to the active
composite application running on
so a server in summary these are the key
steps to patch your running instance of
a server composite application I modify
the application by using the so attached
developer role in JDeveloper next as a
developer I generate a sparse deployment
profile from J developer or W LST and I
give the generated saw file with the
application patches to the so
administrator who validates and applies
the patch by executing the corresponding
commands on the W LST console for more
