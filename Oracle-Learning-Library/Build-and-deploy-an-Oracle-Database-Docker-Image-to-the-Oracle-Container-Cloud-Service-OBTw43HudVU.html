Oracle container cloud service today and
deploying the enterprise Oracle database
onto that service first off I'm going to
go to github and check out the docker
images we have there under the Oracle
repository on github you can see there's
a bunch of different Oracle images here
or daca files we can build your own
docker images if I look at the Oracle
database we can see here that there's a
readme and a description on how to build
your own database image to run on docker
and the various versions we support here
we've got a twelve dot 2.0 - one
Enterprise Edition and there's
instructions on how you can easily build
this and help us on how to build this
very easily so I've gone ahead and built
this image and I pushed it into a
private repository on docker hub and
from there I'm ready to go into the
container cloud service and deploy this
database of the container let's see how
easy that is first off we want to go
into our registries tab
so with container cloud service you
automatically have a connection to the
docker hub out of the box but if you're
connecting to a private registry you
want to make sure you have an entry for
that registry so we know how to connect
to it and pull down the database image
in this case so here we can see we have
an account for our OCC s account and we
can click on validate and go validate
that account great it's validating
successfully so now we should be able to
pull down that image and run it in order
to run an image we need to first create
what we call a service a service is
simply a template that describes how to
go run that image as a container in this
case we have the database image that we
saw before on docker hub we're pulling
the database tag with the latest and we
have a number of the different
environment variables that are defined
on that github page that we can provide
here you can see we filled in the
various different environment variables
that you need to go run this image we're
running this container on the following
ports here that you can see and now
we're ready to go run that image so
let's go do that
I simply deploy the database container
in this case I'm deploying one that has
no volumes attached click on deploy and
the container cloud service will go spin
up that image right from the docker hub
and we can see it's running we go look
at our deployments once you start a
service you have what's called a
deployment which is one or more running
containers and we can see that we've got
a couple running here we've got the one
that we just started and one we started
a little while back so let's go and look
at a running container in the container
cloud service here it is and I can drill
into that database and go look at its
logs and if I scroll down I can see here
right in the log file that the database
has been spun off successfully in the
container cloud service and it's ready
to use so very simple we went to github
we build the docker image we push it
into a private repository we wire it up
as a service and contain a cloud service
and we can run it and now we're ready to
attach it our applications and our
workloads to leverage this database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
