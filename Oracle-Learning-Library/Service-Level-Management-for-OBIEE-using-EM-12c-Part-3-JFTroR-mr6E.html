the cloud control 12c demo series
focusing on the best practices for or
upper bi applications management the
screen watch is a part of a series on
service level management or slm for 0
bie applications in part 3 will show you
how to use IM topsy to monitor and
create a report on availability and
propose metrics over a period of time
through service level management
capability slm includes three components
which are service level agreement
service level objectives and service
level indicators after SLA has been
created we can also review the dashboard
to create a report on availability and
performance of a UCG matrix let's start
off created a service level agreement to
configure the service level agreement go
to the service and drop down menu select
the service level agreement and
configuration click the Create button
and provide the name of your service
level agreement I'll provide the I slm
and you can also change the level
agreement period by clicking the pencil
icon and I'll change to daily and if you
want to help yours sl8 to run certain
period of time you can provide the
exploration date and also if you system
when I have a black out times in some
future time and if you want the service
level agreement to include your blog
time then click the includes a couple
times and select include time as met
click Next each service level agreement
can have a multiple service level
objective which will be configured in
this step so click create button and
provide a name of your service level
objectives so first I will create the
availability SL SL 0 and type SL on
availability and also that my expected
service level eighty-five percent and
warning alert level as a ninety percent
now here is a measurement window where
you can run the SLL or they monetary or
if you want it to have a different
measurement window click the Add button
and select different business calendar
that you wanted to run the SLO click ok
go to next
and each SLO has a service level
indicators so for the availability we
have a target data s up and click Submit
this time I'll create the province SLO
so name my SLO as performance and select
the type as performance and take the
default value for the expected service
level and warning order level and the
measurement window click Next so in this
step the surface level indicators click
the Add button and it will show all the
metrics that I promoted during the
creation of their service so i'm going
to select the cpu usage and if i want a
more i'll create them if i want to add
more services of indicators click add
and i plan to add memory usage and total
time for my performance indicators so
total time and as you can see the
comparison operator takes the value from
my critical threshold that I said that I
defined during the service creation once
I'm satisfied with the service level
indicators for my performance a service
level objective click the submit button
and you can see that the province SLO
has been created so under bi slm our
service level agreement I have a
creative ability a zero and performance
SLO and claim next this step or arm ask
whether we want to enable the service
level agreement now or wanna enable
later or just set it do not enable and
come back sometimes later if you want it
to enable if you click enable now then
you can edit the service level agreement
so since I wanted to enable I'll click
select enable now and click Next last
step is review of my config service
level agreement configuration once i'm
fine with my configuration submit the
creation of the service level agreement
so this concludes the creation of the
slm
after SL has been up and running for a
while you can click the acela dashboard
to see the data of the SLA so here I
have availability and performance SL and
it's sli for status for availability and
caprile metrics for the performance and
by going to genetic service and clicking
the information publisher reports you
can take a look at the more of
desolating related datas go to
dashboards and click them services and
SLA dashboard and check your target is
correct and click continue here you can
take a look at the service dashboard and
service level agreement click the status
will lead up to the more detailed
information and expand your dashboard
service and here's your own beacon it
will show the status and if there is any
downtime on the pie chart will show that
and if there is any components was down
you will show you here as well and you
can drill down to the down components
and if there is any instance or all or
it will show under down here and if you
want to check the SLO for performance
and usage metrics you can click or drill
down to each one of the performers on
usage indicators as well so let's see
what we have on the usage matrix and
here we'll see the data for the usage a
matrix of the matches that you have
promoted and if there's any others their
associated with the use of images it
will show under the alerts tab and let's
go back to our dashboard so the surface
dashboard and SLM provide a holistic
view of your service availability it can
give you a proactive way of measuring
your bi applications this concludes our
demo of the bi service and sln creation
in part 3 you have watched how to create
SLA and is related components by
utilizing the service performance and
usage metrics you can establish the SLA
for certain period of time and use
dashboard and reports to monitor the
compliance of SLA
we highly recommend customers to use slm
since the slm is a key tool for studying
measuring and monitoring the maintenance
of service goals through slm system
admin can be alerted when the desired
quality is not being met slm is also key
tool to ensure the key targets for
service success this concludes our demo
of creating the service level management
thank you for watching all three part of
Oracle bi best practices in slm thank
