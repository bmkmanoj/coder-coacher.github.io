the SFTP user account password for your
Oracle cloud service SFTP user accounts
are used to upload and download files
related to your Oracle cloud service
identity domain administrators can
manage SFTP user accounts okay so let's
sign in to the my services application
so you can view information about your
Oracle cloud services located within a
single domain be sure to specify the
correct identity domain when you sign in
on signing in you are presented with the
services page which lists all your
services within the current domain in
this case the trial a en1 domain there
are three services in this domain
database database to and Java click a
service name to view details including
SFTP details about that service from the
overview tab scroll down the page to get
the SFTP details that you need
specifically for this exercise what I
want to know is the SFTP user name for
the stat abase service I can use the
service SFTP user account to import and
export data tune from my service on a
related note each identity domain has
its own SFTP user account that SFTP user
name is used to retrieve your data that
oracle archives when you terminate your
paid subscription to an Oracle cloud
service so let me just go back and show
you compare that with this other
database service alright let's scroll
down to SFTP details remember that SFTP
user name for the database service
instance was trial 011 know that the
SFTP user name for the database to
service instance is trial 001 however
because both services are located in the
same identity domain the username for
the identity domain SFTP account
the same in this case trial of 62 there
is only one identity domain SFTP user
account for the domain so we can also
take a look at the Java service if you
scroll down to SFTP details of that
service you will see a different SFTP
user name for the Java service as well
okay so let's go back to the original
database service let's click on database
let's scroll down we are going to change
a password for the SFTP user name for
this database service in this case trial
011 click identity console click manage
users enter SFTP in search box to limit
your results to only SFTP users let's
scan the list to find SFTP user for the
database service remember the username
is trial 011 select the trials are 11
user and then click reset password make
sure you select manually change password
enter your new password and then confirm
your new password click reset password
and that's it as for exchange
successfully and now ready for use with
FTP transactions note that while you are
here on the manage users page you can
reset the password for any of the SFTP
user accounts in addition as the
identity domain administrator you must
supply the SFTP sign in details to your
administrators who will need access to
the SFTP server I'll show you how to
deal data export in another video but
for now that concludes our effort to set
up an SFTP user account
