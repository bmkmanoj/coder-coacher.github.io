my name is Martin cribbage and I'm a
software engineering manager for Metro
app services which includes the other
technologies like drugs bein jax-ws and
this talk is going to be about Metro and
sort of like the project update on
what's happening in Metro space and in
the soap based world I'll briefly very
briefly just describe what Metro East so
that we are all on the same page and
talk about where we are coming from and
what the current developments are what
the features that came in in recent
metro releases where and talk about a
little bit what our potential future
plans are where we would like to go with
Metro and a lot only that I would like
to also hear some feedback if you have
any ideas or have any requests or
thoughts on what you would expect from
Metro then I think this is a good chance
to to express them so before I go any
any further this is the most famous
slider joven it basically says that
whatever I mentioned and it encompasses
something in future then don't believe
me that much and it might change so it
can be incorporated into any contract
especially any dates or anything so
after that suburbs Metro Metro is an
open source soap Java Web Services stack
it includes Cyril or or is built from
several components such as jugs B which
takes care of the data binding part
charge because Java API for a
smell binding and jugs ws takes care of
the soap part of the runtime so the web
services web services part and on top of
that there are additional advanced
technologies built which are included in
Metro and they were originally called
this project tango then renamed to wsit
but the whole whole overall name for all
these is natural so it was that and
those include reliability reliability
transactions security metadata exchange
all sorts of WS specifications which
Metro is full of inherently from the
past or from the original I mean how
Metro project goals set up is that it
was set up as a with interoperability in
mind
and that includes mostly dotnet fault
but also additional web services tax
when Sun came went into Oracle that
includes also Oracle product so that's
racing now interoperable with not only
like within the web service
specifications such as WSI or our basic
profile or additional security based
profiles or so it also is tested against
the Oracle products and dotnet and as
such as the open source project is
developed under a glassfish us all so it
basically shares the same license CDL or
GPL you can you can decide which one to
use and
basically the whole websites are at
java.net so you find everything from
Metro and Jo Louden website on jihad mid
site from the briefly from the
architectural point of view metro or
jax-ws itself it's a fairly flexible and
pluggable so basically you can plug
individual components and replace them
and reuse them as required so we can
exchange for example the transport such
as HTTP PCP you can change a coatings
XML or fasting cassette then there's a
set of chucks WS technologies which are
pluggable and allow plugging additional
additional features there and on top of
that again is through pluggable wires so
implemented are implemented the ws star
technologies such as reliability
security and also sovereign for ease of
use we also provide tooling in the form
of netbeans plugin but this is not
required so you can of course
development or employment metro services
without that for some especially
security configurations we found it's
much easier to do when with through
clicking some buttons than then editing
the policy files so where did Matt SOCOM
I will not mention the any previous
releases just very briefly so that with
Java EE 5 and GlassFish 3 we delivered
metro to the dough which included the
implementation of the latest geography
and jax-ws specifications and with the
lighter metro 2 1 and 2 2 2 1 1 release
we added two other important features
such as high availability
which takes care of or which includes
reliable messaging and security and thus
is able to make sure that reliable
messaging sequences and secure
conversation sessions are highly
available and able to so the other
instances are able to pick up pick up
the data if any instance fails we all
need support for security policy under
three just additional revision of the
security policy specification with
Oracle coming into picture we extended
the transaction support by basically
reusing the one from web web logic which
was a very good addition to Metro and of
course we added more interoperability by
testing against Oracle products
especially in the security security
space some with Metro 2-1-1 all the
roles of several security improvements
such as adding support for proprietary
proprietary higher strength keys such as
and encryption algorithms such as
sha-512 and and so on these dunes are
not yet specified in the specifications
but so they are basically proprietary
but they are basically required for any
meaningful security implementations as
sha-1 is more or less deprecated from
the additional ones is the security
features it's a Policy Alternatives so
basically on client you can decide which
alternative to use the Metro 2.1 has
been aligned with GlassFish 3-1 so going
back like a year this was my slide from
jolin's was the previous feature future
also very where we wanted to go after
Metro 2 1 &amp;amp; 2 1 1 so the areas we'd like
to address or wanted to address was even
better alignment with WebLogic then
there were a couple of things that just
had to be done at some point you just
have to do them there's like a couple of
these things that is very like rolling
rolling before before you and you just
never had time to do them so we try to
try to address those as well
and we wanted to implement a modular
data binding feature laser key basically
add another data binding layer or
additional plug ability layer to jax-ws
so that it's even more flexible and
extensible and so risk recently this
year we published or released Metro 2 2
1 2 2 1 which included included most of
these plant features and I'm going to
talk about them in a while so module did
modular data binding more alignment with
WebLogic we extended Cherokee support
for to match basically the one from
GlassFish so said but there's some
drawback which which I mention later on
we had to drop support for JDK 5 which
actually was the oiled and where did
support for jax-ws - - a minor revision
of the spec improved or edit several
improvements to the security area and
from though you need to do those stuff
there's the apt library right and also
some stuff on documentation and these
these releases have been aligned with a
glassfish three-on-two
so Metro - - is included in glass 51 -
if you want to use Metro 2 - 1 you need
to download the standalone release and
install it on top of GlassFish so going
into the individual thanks or in do do
individual features one by one also by
the better alignment with WebLogic we
mean that metro and the individual
components are basically delivered to
multiple products or multiple frameworks
or whatever jdk GlassFish WebLogic we
release them a standalone we release
them as a metro or isis stand-alone sub
projects so it's kind of important for
us to have make sure that there's no
forked call basis but it's more or less
one code line and at some points we
release this we push out a release which
goes into into these products so with
that we can right now or we are right
now sharing the jugs be and try to stop
us implementations so it's basically one
one code line and also we are sharing
the as i already mentioned the
transactions implementation there's a
little star there because it's not fully
done it basically the same source but it
still leaves a two-place issue we don't
want to get rid of that in the future
and the other things from the other
thing from the alignment was to kind of
improve the running on WebLogic
documentation so when you take the metro
standalone release and try to make use
of its in on WebLogic so we try to
address that by improving the
documentation this is still an ongoing
process as well i want to need later on
but also if you have any other or if you
have any ideas on how to improve this
and also
let us know if you have any experience
with this so from the things that just
needed to be done you probably know if
you run if you ran WS import tasks or
whn or on JDK 7 that it prints all these
nasty warning that a PT has been
deprecated and should not be used
however to Chuck's B and Jack WS tools
they used a PT stay also we are
delivering to JDK and in JDK 8 a PT has
been removed so we had to make sure that
this code is being rewritten so if you
use a PT you should stop using it and
start using basically simple javac which
is included standard Java processing API
and that's also the reason why we
dropped the JDK 5 support because I am
stationed processing API or the jasa
269 api is not in present in JDK 5 so
other than that we try to keep things as
compatible as possible try to keep the
existing tasks or try to try to
implement and existing can tasks such in
such a way so that they mimic the apt so
I think most of the applications they
use them tasks and not directly called a
PC from JDK and they should not be
affected too much and there's of course
documentation on this how to how to
migrate to the new one so the other
thing just needed to get down is certain
not not that much coding thing but we
are here like on forums and that the
documentation still has a space for
improvement so the first step for that
for us was to migrate the documentation
to some
more meaningful format so forth the
child goes to dog book so right now we
are in dog group we can share the
recommendation we can edit it easily and
finally we also have a single HTML and
PDF versions of the documentation of
course this is ongoing process so we try
to clean it up but expect more
improvements in the future and of course
if you step into the documentation and
find something that your thing could be
improved and let us know it's just as
easy as an en email to go to a forum or
filing in issuing in JIRA or of course
just you know improve it yourself and
send us a patch to the documentation so
going to the little bigger features
included in Metro 2 - that was a
pluggable or modular data binding
through which we wanted to add an
additional layer of plug ability into
into jax-ws and Metro so this feature
basically enables you to remove or stop
using just the reference implementation
and instead use some other data binding
layers such as eclipse link Moxie which
is another implementation of juggs be
specification so with you have multiple
ways or multiple choices how to how to
implement or how to switch this moxy
support on is basically present right
now in jax-ws and in the metro builds so
if you want to make sure that all your
absolute of services or all the observer
is running with Knox we then it's just
like a big switch on the JDK so in case
of Goss you see this is how it would
look like
and suddenly the
you're jax-ws runtime will use will use
moxie
underneath the more granular way to
configure is through jax-ws proprietary
descriptor so there you have an option
to to specify the data binding at the
endpoint level
so either you specify the GlassFish dr.
chance B which is the tax the reference
implementation to be used which is the
default so far at least and then there's
a Eclipse think jugs B so when you use
that suddenly the moxie moxie will be
will be looked up and used and going
further there are multiple choices I
told you to configure this so the
dynamic one is to create a feature to
use the jax-ws feature away
so basically create the feature set it
on the endpoint and that's it and the
last one is a simple simple data mining
mode annotation which specifies to which
is the should make the code as simple as
possible it just mentions the sets the
data mining glare so just to show you a
little bit that it really works and does
something so I have a just a very simple
very simple web service here you see
this is visible so it's some kind of web
services web series I'm not going to run
it I just want to show you how the
mapping can be used so it returns beam
which is a constant customer which is
the data bound Chuck to be being which
is specified here and you can you now
see that I do have some
Eclipse link important using some
annotations which are not recognized by
default while the trucks be a reference
implementation so the mapping will not
be taken into account
so when I when I go into the really
complicated resolution I almost don't
see anything better so when I go to the
Wizzle there's this schema location in
the schema and
here see that the type for the mapping
for customer includes element first name
and last name and so what the mapping in
in the in this in this customer class
would like to do is to add another like
top-level elements to include it in to
include these two into personal info
personal info elements so right now I do
have a just a simple endpoint definition
without the data binding section so when
I deployed deploy this application and
reload so this is the this is the value
which I've been showing up but the one I
had
a data binding section and specify
eclipsing boxy binding and redeploy the
application so suddenly the de mapping
has changed and it includes the
top-level personal info element which is
the moxie moxie feature or usually which
uses the exact same XML path like mrs.
Verizon XML path annotations so just a
simple showcase of this there's a sample
in Metro so we can try yourself
just download Metro standalone and
invoke hunt and it will basically build
their build data binding Eclipse link
bound module for you
so with with the pluggable air we didn't
only so it doesn't only allow you to
plug different jugs be implementations
but is kind of more extensible and one
example is service data object so right
now this is kind of more like an
experimental or alpha stage but you can
get the plugins if you download jax-ws
or metrop stand-alone the service data
object is another sort of data binding
implementation or specification which is
supported by eclipse link and
you see on the slide this requires a
little bit more than just the annotation
it requires so that there's more
information pushed to the to the data
binding through the data mining config
instance such as you specify the schema
which are used for the data binding or
any other features which you want to set
for the data binding layer so I'm going
to deep dive into this one if you want
you can download the jax-ws and metro
builds and find the plugins there and
you can find it useful let us know so
that was the data mining layer and I
mentioned we somehow announced the JDK
supports right now the JDK is supported
our GD case 6 7 J rocket and also a
Ike's with some limitations and we had
to drop the JDK 5 sub looking for some
reason I mean a JDK fabric has been a go
out but in case you still need to use it
and use older versions of Metro all the
version of them jug's WS or jungle B
specifications if you require so that
goes that was for the Metro 2 2 &amp;amp; 2 to 1
which basically you can download a time
and if you download if you already
downloaded cost-efficient he already had
it and sort of talked about so it worked
what's the current work that came in
being in progress
so max research has been mechanized so
we have a first-class support home for
metro maven is the main repository for
binary artifacts all the bills and
basically everything called it Metro
build produces is is in my own so we can
find it there it's not right now only
for Metro but also for the project such
as jax-ws and we are trying to also
finish this with jugs be weary and
reincarnated jax-ws nylon plugins so
right now it supports the latest version
of charitable arrest and Metro and also
at its are all like fixes and
improvements into it so that it supports
the latest switches through the
configuration and supports multiple
advanced configurations like
improvements on specifying world wisdom
is low file where the weasel files are
like multi structure folders and so on
and we want to get further in you know
in this in with Jack's Bri and also with
judge Bri it's not or I would not
consider it that important because drugs
be has a contributor external
contributor Lexi who basically make sure
our maintains my own plugin on his own
so and that one is usually updated very
often with average activities so uh to
go further from the judge be point of
view to somehow minimize or I mean
improve the memory footprint when to
link is being done on also being able to
plug different implementations and again
make the implementation more flexible we
extracted so jaggedy one support so in
case you still need to use it you have a
possibility to use it but of course
that's not like recommended please use
just b2 or and anything in order just be
to to and the additional step was to
split the drugs B into several more
components so that implementation and
schema compiler are two different
things which do not depend necessarily
on each other so when you scheme a
compiler you don't necessarily to the
same runtime and also the other way
around also this has been separated so
the jxc
has been separated out from java
implementation so this should also
improve a little the little memory
footprint in some cases and yeah one of
the reasons for this is like jigsaw and
thinking about how to how to improve
modularity of these components in JDK
for mature artifacts this does not mean
much change right now we basically
delivery what we deliver may be what we
would like to do is to make more
alignment and well basically make sure
that whatever whatever we deliver
through metro standalone is also used in
GlassFish right now that's not
necessarily true we are-- bundle stuff
to the OSGi
big bundle and that goes to gosta so
that's something we would like to change
as well so the additional additional
feature for I mean that came lightly or
is available in lightest jax-ws and
metro builds is something that has been
requested also several times on the
forums and it's basically as external
web services metadata so what that means
is that you can basically deploy or
specify endpoints without specifying
annotations so basically you can you can
publish endpoint which implementation is
some third party or legacy code to which
you don't even have access to and this
way you can
as you see on on the slides you can
basically specify which class is going
to be the implementation and then
specify all the other things such as
which Java methods can be or should be
exposed as the web service methods and
like additional attributes such as for
example again another way how to
configure data binding to switch it from
the through this external web services
metadata several other areas where this
can be used also that you have one class
and basically you can you can publish it
in several different configurations and
bindings under what say several you are
as with different data bindings with you
can publish under different web services
different methods of this of this class
so that's kind of where where this where
this feature comes from it's kind of
fresh oh it's in the recent build so if
you download it and use it then let us
know and of write to the users forum or
to mangled mailing lists and would like
we would like to hear if you see
anything how this could be potentially
improved or if you find it useful so you
just time check okay so and the other
things that are just like like to
somehow you just expect them so we try
trying to constantly improve the code
line by using some tools for static
analysis and doing some refactoring to
improve the code and also continuously
deliver some performance stability
improvements into the into the code base
to make sure that the the latest
releases are
working I mean this is open-source but
that doesn't mean it's like this is
still my production quality code and I
already mentioned the documentation it's
not like cold or feature but we see this
like it comes often on the forum so
we're trying to improve on that
like not only by adding documentation
but also by removing some obsolete stuff
so but as well I mentioned if you if you
find any any specific areas where which
sure would be what's interesting or
which you think would be good to
emphasize in the documentation and let
us know it would like to really improve
on this one so that gives me that that
leads me to little future talk I
mentioned that we'd like to do more on
the alignment we're doing more on
alignment but would like to do even more
so again we are improving the
documentation on how to run Metron
WebLogic so that's one task
we'd like to finish the transactions
alignment which should be done within
GlassFish for time frame so it's kind of
not that much visible to to the tree to
you to developers but in case you share
the same code between WebLogic or
migrate from garfish to WebLogic then
you can experience it that it's kind of
feels good to have the same same code
base or you can expect the same things
in GlassFish or in WebLogic and we are
looking into some areas how to add some
features either to web logic or so Metro
and make things easier
in this space so I think again if you
have any ideas to make things even
easier we're happy to hear and think
about them additional thing from the
future plans I don't want to spoil too
much so there's a jax-ws dot next which
we would like to get involved into and I
know the discipline discussed for some
time but like the main topics for that
would be the bean validation which comes
in the forums
the async stuff then there are some
clarifications which make the developing
pro portable web service is kind of
complicated so that it would have to be
fixed and thinking about the additional
adding additional like for example mem
Tom and addressing these features our
specifications are right now edit the
jax-ws spec so we think that also others
would belong to that space I don't want
to spoil that much because looking an
hour and a half or so having a check as
WS dot next both with all together with
Chen where we want to go a little more
deeper into the individual areas and
also would like to hear the feedback on
if you have any to what you see as an
issues or what do you would like to see
in jax-ws dot next and what I what are
your thoughts on this whether we this
should really go or it should remain
stable as compatible as possible and so
on so not sorry
not only jax-ws but also we are looking
into W star additional like reviewing
additional and additional specs so from
those just picking the two WS eventing
and WS business activity I'm not
necessarily saying that this is
something that you can expect
time soon implemented in Metro but in
case you have any interest or if you
have any use cases for this for these or
maybe some other W star technologies and
also please speak up and we would like
to hear about those so the use cases are
the most important thing - it was right
now we don't see that much - like soap
is complicated enough already and adding
a little more complexity in that it just
have to be justified so that's why we
are just waiting a little bit in this
area so and that leads me to the end of
my presentation I guess we have still
enough time for questions or any
feedback if you have any comments like
for the Metro future jobs WS future
please let us know
useless
are there other
so Metro is such is able to use fast
infil set and like different encodings
and you should we be able to also and we
don't plan to implement any other but it
should be possible in case you really
require something specific okay
yeah so yeah so that's one of the
reasons why the fast infil site has been
in the case so that it improves the
document they'll transfer very much if
we have plans for rest so far well rest
is implemented as part of your project
Jersey and jax-rs
so that's enough we don't want to go
into that space it's like a separate
separate project there so and there was
one one
sorry I'm kind of having hard times with
you Oh
CSF interoperability we don't actually
test it we don't have it in our test
Suites
maybe they do they test later okay
we also maybe that can be another topic
too but at our yeah site so we can okay
this is okay so this is about server
side I think so and I don't I will not
comment any further percent because I
have the session very okay so if you're
interested to hear more you know really
like okay
mm-hmm
yeah I mean so we basically to look into
JIRA and think to any other into a fixed
all the issues that have been filed and
improved the plug-in to the latest
versions of the reputable so if you
haven't tried it for a while then I'll
really recommend it it should work and
if it doesn't then file an issue and I
think we should be able to fix it right
away
yes so basically it's also improved
Nathan playing right yes
any other questions comments ideas okay
no see exactly
why do we change so much the Maven group
name and artifact 9 well had to say well
there's one thing like for example we
came from Santo Oracle and suddenly we
should not use come son XML we there's
also several things at under Jie space
there's a new sort of recommendations
where where the Joey artifacts should
live and we should also reflect that so
I'm actually trying to keep the things
as it is at least for now for a while to
keep them at one place which is
basically for Metroid's or glass which
metro and for jax-ws it comes on XML WS
and not change not adopt these these new
guidelines but if we adopt and then that
there will be another another change of
the groove artefacts I have to say so
well this world is changing and I guess
you just we're trying to keep them at
one place but sometimes we just have
pushed to push somewhere else so maybe
one solution would be for us at least
for some time to push the artifacts to
both places but again that's like kind
of not that easy to do with maven it's
kind of complicated so that's why it's
hard to keep compatible in this place
carry another any other questions no so
yeah thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
