sales consultant and I was asked by my
sales manager to update the team's brand
revenue analysis the brand revenue
analysis contains a table view and a bar
chart my manager wants me to add the
quarter time component to the table and
then change the chart so that the
quarter detail can easily be read first
I must find the analysis I enter brand
revenue in the search field and then I
click search the brand revenue analysis
is displayed in the catalog page I click
Edit I begin by adding quarter to the
table view in the analysis I expand the
time folder and then I drag quarter to
the left of brand in the table
the time column is added to the table
view I need to edit the graph view to
see the new column in the chart I know
that when I added the time column
explicitly to the table view that it was
placed in the excluded drop target for
the chart a drop target is a placeholder
for a column in a view a column is
placed in the excluded drop target if it
has not explicitly been added to one or
more views to see the excluded drop
target I need to edit the chart I click
the Edit view button in the graph view I
know that each view has a different
editor
I can see that the editor contains a
preview pane so I resize the pain for a
better view of the layout area I can
easily move the time column from the
excluded drop target to the chart a drag
quarter from the excluded drop target to
the sections drop target I decide that I
want the time component to display as a
slider so that my manager can easily see
each quarter I select the checkbox for
display as slider while I am updating
the graph view in the analysis my
manager tells me to add build units to
the chart and then save it as a new
analysis because the editor contains a
preview pane I will be able to see what
the chart looks like after I add another
measure I expand the revenue metrics
folder and then I drag build units to
the measures bars vertical axis drop
target just below revenue
I click done I scroll to view the chart
I need to save the updated analysis so
that the sales manager has access to it
I click Save As I ensure that the
analysis is located in the company
shared folder in the name field I enter
brand revenue and build units I click OK
I've created a new analysis from an
existing analysis that contains brand
revenue built units and quarter I also
added a slider to the chart now my
manager and team members can easily see
how each brand is doing for specific
quarters thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
