management and over the next two minutes
I want to talk to you about what we're
doing and when you're building new
applications new generations of
frameworks and languages when working
with the Oracle database as a developer
I don't think there's probably been a
more exciting time we have access to new
languages new frameworks new source
control systems and a new community to
go through and work with us to solve the
various problems and issues we encounter
along the way or importantly we've never
had such a big audience to consume the
applications we put together as well we
can build applications working
collaboratively with other teams around
the world to make the next generation of
Facebook's and Amazon and eBay so over
the next ten minutes I want to quickly
go through some of the things we're
doing and what we plan to do in the
future as well so when i joined oracle
we built applications on mainframes on
large unix systems we use low-level
languages like c Fortran and COBOL and
those languages are still important to
the enterprise today however when we
built those applications we had access
to large teams we did rigorous
engineering we documented everything
extensively to put those applications in
play one of the benefits we had was that
we were catering for a very small number
of users inside of an enterprise it was
typically numbered in hundreds as
opposed to the thousands at that point
in time and we did very well at that
point in time and some people look back
at that as the Golden Age however things
changed and in nineteen mid 1990s as the
pc became the norm for most users inside
of an enterprise we have started having
to produce richer more interactive
applications and it's a large part this
wasn't really an issue we could
guarantee that the end users would have
the software on their desktop and they
ended up with a series of tools which
whilst it was due
were called to maintain they provided
that rich interactive and productive
environment that they were after then
everything changed and everything
changed in a revolutionary way we moved
from a situation we were occasion for a
small group of views as to one we were
building applications for millions of
users and these users expected the
latest generation of functionality they
expected to be able to access their
application not just on the browser on
their PC but also on their mobile phone
on their interactive television and that
resulted in a completely different
approach to the way we built and had to
be much more responsive we had to be
able to respond to those changes very
quickly as well now not only do we have
to build applications and if we did have
to do that in isolation it would have
been a difficult period but we also
started to work together we had access
to tools such as github which meant that
we could for the first time ever share
huge quantities of code with people
working around the world could work
collaboratively together to solve some
of the most difficult problems and some
of the most pressing issues in that
period of time and an awful lot of work
was done to actually resolve some of the
issues we had with between things like
browser and compatibility and so on and
that work carries on today we've ended
up with the situation where the modern
web today focuses on round technology
like html5 CSS and JavaScript to build
those very rich interactive applications
and that's been important to us and we
haven't had to work in isolation we have
had access to technology like
stackoverflow which enable us to work on
forums and collaboratively resolve
issues so things can change in a much
faster and fashion we've been able to do
too now when you're building an
application it's unlikely that you're
going to work in a single language or a
single framework it's true you'll use
the tool which best suits the property
you're actually in to resolve so four
issues which our mission sensitive and
very critical and highly performant
you'll likely to use tools like C and C
sharp and Java to build the highest
perform at all set that you can which is
able to fully exploit the end
nine hardware that you have available to
you if you're looking to build something
that will prototype a piece of
functionality or something that's likely
to change tell me that can be developed
in a very rich and expressive way you're
likely to use the new generation of
scripting language the ones which are
continually evolving Ruby Python even
pearl and PHP to build those and tall
sets Oracle has its own set of tools as
well inside of this space to facilitate
rapid application development as well so
oracle apex and our existing tools are
and the ADF frameworks that we use also
can assist building these rich and
application frameworks to the
architectures even recently have changed
it used to be the case and that when you
were building an application in the past
you'd have a large database and a large
multi-tiered platform as well a lot of
the rendering and logic of the
application would exist in the mid tier
recently the advent of JavaScript and
his emergence from just the browser and
to a situation where javascript is being
used not just in the browser but also in
the mid tier and inside of the database
in some instances as well has meant that
we've seen a movement from a stateless
based browser application to one that
contains a lot more state than it did in
the past it has a lot more interactive
capabilities it's become a thicker
entity in its own right to a situation
where the mid-tier is also shrunk in
size responding to that change on the
browser is become thinner more
interactive and the services it provides
have changed as well and again the
database now acts not just as a
relational store for information but it
may also contain documents in the form
of JSON information as well as the
standard relational structures and it's
true to say that we should see some
applications built which have a
different variation and different level
of interactively in a different level of
application logic existing in each one
every one of those tears and so we have
to have the flexibility to build
applications that are able to model that
as well
so javascript has become a really
important part in the way that people
are looking to build applications as
well as i mentioned javascript exists
not just as a simple tool for building
interactive and animation on side of the
browser's become an asset in building
the business logic that exists there too
and the same is true for the mid-tier
we've seen the emergence of technologies
like no Jas just meant that we're able
to do asynchronous callback and
processing of information in a more
scalable fashion we've ever been able to
do in the past and talking about
JavaScript an evolving language from 19
in the mid-1990s has evolved into a key
asset for building applications today
there's a significant number of
frameworks which make that process
easier than has ever been before as well
you can take a look at things like
jQuery and jQuery UI which enabled us to
manipulate and navigate through the HTML
document change things on the fly
communicate asynchronously over
technologies like Ajax to our mid-tier
as well as significantly simplified that
whole process for us tools like
angularjs support the concept of a
single page application and enable us to
go through and template and build
applications in a much simpler
declarative fashion aleve I've being
able to do as well these frameworks
along with technologies like and then
continually improvements in performance
of JavaScript have revolutionized the
way we're looking to build this
technology moving forwards and so from
an Oracle's perspective we're
introducing new technologies which will
also mean that we can simplify this
model too we're looking to ensure that
from oracle database perspective we
produce the richer set of interfaces and
drivers for the database today now that
might come in the form of supporting our
existing technologies such as
improvements that we can actually make
for Java and C sharp and a C programming
language and technology like pale sequel
as well and will continually improve the
performance
and compliance with standards inside
that space too we are also working with
our open source partners to improve
drivers for PHP and Ruby pearl and our
to ensure that we have the richest
interface and richest constructs support
those languages to those languages that
don't require native interfaces were
also spending an awful lot of time
working on new technology and from
Oracle's Oracle rest data services or
and what we're doing with Oracle rest
data services is providing a very rich
rest-based API to enable languages if
they choose to to work not over native
interfaces but over the rest based
service model and we're working to
produce a set of AP is that will enable
you to access and retrieve information
directly from the database via this rich
REST API without the requirement do an
awful lot of code in development work so
you can retrieve relational structures
you can retrieve Jason held inside of
the Oracle database or you can retrieve
data held inside of our ops no sequel
database over a consistent set of
services as well talking about Jason we
understand the importance of JSON and
the ability to service and deliver Jason
from the database too so inside of
Oracle Database 12c release 112 102 and
we're now able to enable you to persist
Jason structures directly inside of the
Oracle database and you can use that
using native interfaces native
effectively no sequel based interfaces
if you choose to you can persist that
Jason retrieve a JSON using standard
sequel constructs as well so insert
update delete but one of the real
benefits and one of the strong
advantages that we have with Jason side
of the database today is the ability to
go through and retrieve and exploit the
rich analytics that are available inside
of the Oracle database this means that
you can paralyze a you can parallel
query right power query
happy Jason held inside of the database
you can go through and access the rich
analytic operations as well giving you a
number of choices and capabilities
inside of that space now we'll go into a
lot of these details and capabilities
for the languages and frameworks over a
series of videos upcoming so thanks very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
