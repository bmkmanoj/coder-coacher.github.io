on oracle advanced security in oracle
database 12c my name is todd barker and
i'm the product manager for oracle
advanced security this is the first in a
series of short video recordings for
anyone who's looking to learn more about
oracle advanced security and quickly get
up to speed on what's new in the current
release to introduce this topic let's
talk a bit about Oracle's database
security defense in depth strategy it
consists of three main pillars
preventive controls detective controls
and administrative controls this
strategy provides strong controls for
Oracle databases and in specific areas
it extends to non Oracle databases and
to other related use cases Oracle
advanced security is in the preventive
area providing core data at rest
encryption and on-the-fly redaction
features to help protect the Oracle
database Oracle advanced security is
complementary to all of the security
controls shown here and it can be
deployed in tandem with other Oracle
database security solutions in Oracle
Database 12c Enterprise Edition the
Oracle advanced security option consists
of two main components the first is
transparent data encryption or TDE which
transparently encrypts data at rest in
the Oracle database for improved
security and compliance the second
component data redaction
is brand new in Oracle Database 12c data
redaction selectively read acts or rubs
out sensitive data displayed by
applications just before it leaves the
database in sequel query results for
those of you who are familiar with
Oracle advanced security you will notice
an important change in this product
packaging prior to the launch of Oracle
Database 12c
Oracle advanced security also included
certain network encryption and strong
authentication components as of the 12c
release all database network encryption
and strong authentication features
become part of the core Oracle database
for both Enterprise Edition and standard
edition in other words network
encryption and strong authentication now
are replaced with data redaction in the
Oracle
and security license this is a quick
look at transparent data encryption TDE
encrypts individual columns in the
database or entire application
tablespaces it protects the data where
it is stored whether in files on disk or
in backups effectively putting a stop to
attacks that attempt to bypass the
database go directly at the stored data
and pick sensitive information out of
the database files TDE takes these types
of attacks off of the table by
encrypting the data within storage thus
forcing would-be attackers to go through
the front door into the database where
they'll be subject to strong security
controls
in addition TDE provides built-in key
lifecycle management with assisted
encryption key rotation it supports
Oracle engineered systems including
Oracle Exadata and it is compatible with
applications by default we've listed a
couple of applications on the slide but
it's important to note that because TDE
does not alter the inbound sequel
statements or the outbound sequel query
results in any way it is compatible with
applications by default and it does not
require any application code or
configuration changes so that's a brief
overview of what is included with TDE
note that we'll be covering this in more
detail in a subsequent recording where
we will step through an interactive TDE
demonstration here we see a quick
summary of data redaction this feature
gives you the ability to redact
sensitive column data at the last minute
before it leaves the database in the
form of sequel query results bound for
display by applications it is an easy
way to reduce the exposure of sensitive
data in legacy current and new
applications without having to make a
lot of modifications to them you can
selectively redact based on runtime
context information that is maintained
by the database or passed into the
database by the Apps the exact redaction
behavior is determined by declarative
policies managed centrally inside of the
database dinner redaction is highly
transparent to applications because it
preserves the data type and optionally
the data formatting
we believe that this will be a very
useful feature for a wide range of use
cases including call centers and other
systems that work with PCI pH I PII and
other sensitive or regulated data we
will go into more detail on data
redaction in a subsequent recording we
will step through an interactive
redaction demo here you can see data
redaction and TDE working together to
protect data TDE encrypts the data in
database storage on the back end while
data redaction protects the front end
sequel query results these two features
are a good match for one another and we
anticipate they will be used together
often both of them can be administered
using the Oracle Enterprise Manager
web-based console or using convenient
command line interfaces pluggable
databases available as part of the
Oracle multi tenant option are another
major advancement in Oracle Database 12c
with pluggable databases you can unplug
an entire Oracle database move it and
plug it back into a new container
environment both TDE and data redaction
fully support pluggable databases they
help protect pluggable databases while
in transit and they immediately resume
enforcement when the database is plugged
back in in closing Oracle technology
Network and Oracle comm publish a lot of
useful information about Oracle advanced
security there are a couple of links
that you can browse to shown on this
slide here you can find a product
datasheet an overview white paper
published customer success stories and
much more the customer success stories
are particularly valuable they describe
many existing Oracle advanced security
customers who use this technology to
protect their critical data that
concludes this oracle advanced security
product overview as a next step please
join me for the next recording thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
