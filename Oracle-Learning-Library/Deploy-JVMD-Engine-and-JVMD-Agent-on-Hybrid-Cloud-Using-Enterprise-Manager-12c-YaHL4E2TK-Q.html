you
welcome to enterprise manager cloud
control 12c video series today we are
going to talk about Java Virtual Machine
diagnostic feature in enterprise manager
/ 105 GMD is one of the useful
functionalities in enterprise manager
crowd control that enables
administrators to diagnose performance
problems in java applications in
production environment by eliminating
the need to reproduce problem it reduces
the time required to resolve these
problems thus improving application
availability and performance in this
video we are going to see how to deploy
JVM the engine and JVM the agent on
oracle cloud jesse's instance to
diagnose first let's see how to deploy
JVM the agent on on-premise host from
setup menu select middleware management
and go to application performance
management click on the Add button and
select JVM diagnostic engine on the
deploy
diagnostic engine page for host select
the OMS host on which you want to create
a managed server use a meaningful name
to manage our for- over the sunport and
manage our ssl decent port select the
port numbers that are available i'm
going to keep the listed ports as it is
for oracle management server host
credentials in the management server
host credentials on the WebLogic domain
credentials enter the credentials of
WebLogic domain for EMG c GC domain once
all information is entered click on
deploy button to start deploying JVM the
engine on OMS host when you click deploy
Enterprise Manager submits a job to
deploy JVM the engine you are shown the
link for the job once you click on the
link of the job a job like this will be
shown here we see a completed job for
deploying JVM lynching once job is
completed jvm d engine will appear again
under middleware management application
performance management region
so this completes deployment of JVM
engine now let's see how to deploy
Jeremy agent GBM the agent is deployed
on targeted JVM in this case JVM running
on Oracle cloud it collects real-time
data and transmits it to the JVM
diagnostic engine this data is stored in
management repository and collected
information is displayed on enterprise
manager cloud control console for
monitoring purposes the communication
between JVM d engine and jimb agent can
be a secure SSL or non secure connection
to deploy JVM the agent go to middleware
target homepage and right-click on
domain name
go to diagnostics and set up Diagnostics
vision
on the wizard under select agent screen
for operation ensure that deploy is
selected expand all under select
weblogic managed server on which you
want to deploy tmb agent click Next on
target credential page for each WebLogic
domain specify a value for oracle
weblogic administration server host
credential and Oracle WebLogic domain
credential
you can apply and then click next on DVD
agents configuration screen select
configure hybrid cloud agent checkbox
available jvm d engines select other
then enter hybrid cloud gateway proxy
hosts
I'm hybrid cloud gateway proximo if you
are not sure of these two values you can
always check these values from the agent
homepage let me show you on different
window where you can find these values
you need to go to agent homepage where
jay says instance is running in my case
this particular IP address is of JCS
host and this is the agent running on
JCS host once you go to asian properties
page you see a property limp as
repository URL if you load repository
URL it has this particular IP address
which i am using as the post i am this
particular port number which i am using
as odd number for hybrid cloud gateway
proxy port once you enter these values
click apply and next
you
on the review screen reveal the
information you have entered and click
on the apply button to start deploying
jvm be agent on the remote host when you
click on the apply button Enterprise
Manager submits a job which looks like
this job when job is completed jvm d
agent is deployed on Oracle cloud JCS
instance now you can go to a home page
of JV md agent and start diagnostics to
go to jo md agent homepage go to
middleware targets then click on the
domain name
expand our target and you will see here
jvm agent running on one of the juiciest
hosts
you can monitor CPU usage are in my
usage availability and also go for
additional diagnostics like JVM
performance diagnostics and life threat
analysis from this page thank you for
