terms of set based programming and we've
just shown the loading and deduplication
is transformation I don't know how many
of you have actually ever tried to do a
bulk update on ten million rows or a
bulk deletes on ten million rows and
realize that it took a long time to run
and then you type ctrl C and then you
found you had to wait even longer while
it recovered and for that period of time
the data was offline and nothing was
getting done and at the end of the day
you probably still never even got your
transformation done your bulk update so
in reality is when we get to large data
sets the buffer cache becomes the
problem itself you can't afford to cache
all the data modify all the data in
memory inside the buffer cache and then
write it all back as well as The
Associated undo and redo the challenge
we get on this whole problem is that the
buffer cache just cannot push enough
blocks through fast enough and the
overhead the cpu cost of just
manipulating blocks into the buffer
cache and back out again one block at a
time usually an 8k block at a time
means that the database writer is
working really hard and the user
processes are working really hard just
to get the volume of buffers buffers
through so again for manipulating data
we need to start thinking about
transformation techniques that basically
redefine the object rather than modify
the object in place so if I was to think
about if you were to write a query to
redefine the data how you would like to
see it in the future
and then direct it into a table and then
you were to change the table names at
the end it would take a lot less time
than if you wanted to manipulate all the
data in place
and then Finn as an update or a delete
statement or a merge statement we're
gonna save a lot of time and effort and
redo and undo and all those sort of
things and you're going to be able to
take advantage of core database
parallelism techniques bulk i/o
techniques such that we read a megabyte
and we write a megabyte in and out at
the time rather than eight K at a time
we can get huge efficiencies in terms of
manipulating data and this becomes
extremely important as the data sets get
bigger and bigger and as the data sets
get bigger and bigger it may be the only
way that you can have effectively
manipulate the data in real time so
again we're going to do a similar thing
as what we did we're gonna run a race
and we're going to do 101 million rows
and what we're gonna do is transform
some data and one of those things I'm
gonna just start up the race and then
we're gonna talk through how the code
looked and how it was done again all the
hardware is identical but the thing is
to notice that we've coded at different
ways and we're getting a measure of how
the performance works so in this case
you can see the set-based technique and
this is why this session is on set based
programming is way in advance of
everybody else but again you can see
that the row by row and the array
processing is only using one CPU whereas
the homegrown parallelism and the
set-based processing is using a lot of
CPUs and you can see that likewise the
set-based technique has finished way in
advance of everybody else let's just
recap the times 26 seconds to manipulate
a hundred and one million rows one hour
50 - well sorry one minute 52 seconds
for the homegrown programming
parallelism eleven minutes for the array
interface and five hours for one row at
a time this is a dramatic way difference
in performance against five hours - 26
seconds as a means of manipulating data
let's just go have a look at the code
again if we look at the row by row
programming techniques
you can see that we've got a cursor loop
we're looping through the data replying
conditional logic modifying the data and
then writing it out to potentially two
tables again you can see that a lot of
code being written processing is done by
the row one row at a time and that's how
it's working well I won't show you too
much detail on the other two because I'm
sure you can guess what we've done on
race or two we've used bulk operators to
put and get the data grab the data as a
fetch case out of there out of the data
we've manipulated the data in a tight
loop one row at a time and using bolt of
operators to rake it back with the
manual power parallelism we've used that
or a hash function again to split the
data up amongst 32 query slaves so we
can get everything busy the last one I'd
like to show you really is the one we
want to look at and look at this asset
based programming and again you can see
that the code is a lot easier we're
using the insert technique and we've got
conditional logic associated where it
goes on but again what we're starting to
do is we know we're starting to build
pipelines okay so you can see that we've
used in fact the with clause here all
right to define a sequel statement okay
to define certain things from certain
days and we've also basically used in
this case some conditional logic ie a
case statement on the Select list to
figure out what walk codes were going to
be using to determine the next stage of
the processing and then the very simple
thing is we're doing a transformation
here and you can see that we're
basically using some outer join
techniques set-based techniques and
outer joins become an incredibly
important thing to learn when
manipulating sets of data so we can see
them being used here and we're doing
joints on this
to manipulate the data so again you can
see we're starting to build a pipeline
and one of the easiest ways to build a
pipeline that makes code that's readable
is to use the with Clause to have a
sequel statement okay and then we're
basically using conditional logic on the
Select list which would represent a lot
of the code you would normally associate
with a normal update statement but is
being manipulated by a case statement on
the Select list so you can see we're
again the set-based programmer here is
using a mixture of techniques to
pipeline rows that will be handled by
core parallelism through all phases of
the transaction
