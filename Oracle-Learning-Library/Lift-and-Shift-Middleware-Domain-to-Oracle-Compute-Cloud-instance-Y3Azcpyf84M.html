management video series today we will
see how enterprise manager helps users
move into our domain to Oracle cloud
using lift and shift capabilities in
enterprise manager 13c you will come
across this requirement every time when
you want to move the soil development
environment from compromised data center
to cloud during this demo I am assuming
role of middleware administrator who is
required to set up a development
environment on cloud which is copy of
development environment existing on
promises i am using enterprise manager
13 dot to instance and here is my own
provide so our domain this domain has no
value set for the site parameter which
means that is domain exist on devices
other domains which reside on cloud has
value Oracle cloud foresight parameter
indicating that daily side on cloud here
enterprise manager provides a single
pane of glass to see your on-premises
and cloud ascents on a single page now
let's see all available cloud resources
where these domain will be cloned I am
moving to Oracle compute cloud service
console here I see multiple compute
instances created for various purposes
but the one I am interested in his so uh
compute one we will use this particular
instance to clone so our domain from
on-premise data center to Oracle cloud I
also created database cloud service
instance to create so our repository you
can also see a compute associated with
dbcs instance here now let's get started
first step to clone domain he is to
create a profile of the domain profile
captures all configurations and binary
information of the domain and oracle
home and stores it in software library
let's go back to enterprise manager 13c
instance and go to so our domain which
is existing unpromising right-click and
so our domain and go to provisioning
menu and click on create WebLogic domain
provisioning profile on this single page
wizard enter profile name for example so
art well 21 provisioning profile inter
description if you want then reference
target is automatically selected from
the souls domain if you want to clone
database then you can export the source
so our repository as an arm an export
and import it into the target database
but in this case we are going to use a
fresh dbcs instance and creation of
phase fresh sorry cause you to using
enterprise manager now moving to include
arrival home option I selected this
option so that i can create oracle home
and domain together to achieve the
complete automation using enterprise
manager moving on to the next option of
include metadata this option is
available if you have any custom
configurations which you need to close
to a target so our domain on MDS and
opss repositories so you can check this
box and then copy the MDS and opss data
from source domain to the target domain
next you have to endure Oracle home
credentials click on the search icon and
select appropriate rifle home
credentials next you are to select
weblogic administrator credentials and
that's all you can click on the grade
button and create a profile we already
have a profile created for the
demonstration purposes so we will
to the existing profile let me click on
cancel and go to the existing profile
all the middleware pro provisioning
profiles are available under enterprise
provisioning and patching and middleware
provisioning here you see multiple
profiles available and we also see our
21 swap profile available here so you
consider this profile and click on
provision to create a new domain on a
computer service there is another option
which is more efficient to do is you
save all the provisioning parameters
into a deployment procedure and then
launch the deployment procedure whenever
you want to clone swore domain on to a
new host so I am going to use this
option a selected of provisioning sort
well to one domain to compute instance
and I'm launching the instance of
deployment procedure by default I am
landing on to the advanced flow wherein
I can see a so our Oracle home profile
being selected I see a working directory
I see a option to provision middleware
home and I selected this by default but
if you already have a middleware home
created you can skip this option and
directly create a domain next you see
the list of all posts where the domain
will be cloned and I have entered a
public IP of the compute instance which
we saw earlier so if we go back to the
compute cloud console and see the public
IP four so a compute it's a saying
public IP which has been entered as a
host target to bloom so ottoman next you
have to enter a credential to connect to
cloud host
this is a ssh credential we're in the
private key will be used to connect to
the cloud host and this private key
should be a matching pair with a public
key by which the cloud instance is
created in the next time you can see the
middle row options and you can entirely
change configuration for all middleware
servers machines clusters and domains
the default values are copied from the
source domain from which the profile is
created so if i go to servers i see the
default values for porsche and listen
addresses you can always change all the
sports machine names and clusters where
the service will be created so if you go
to machines you can change all machines
configurations
similar is a case for clusters and
domains if you want to change default
parameters you can change them here now
moving on to database where the soil
repository is created so starting 13c
enterprise manager provides you multiple
options too close or create so our
repository you can either clone so are
causally from existing database wherein
you can export our man based repository
and import it onto target database and
create a new sawar repository which is
exact replica of the source so our
repository alternatively you can also
create a fresh SWA repository by
providing a plain database and this
option i am using in this particular
demo are given a input type as database
target because my target database is
already promoted and discovered into
enterprise manager but if you have not
discovered it up a still now then you
can also mention the connection string
when an enterprise manager can directly
connect to database and run so very
positive creations of creation scripts
next you ought to enter the schema
prefix which will be used while creating
schemas I selected option to create
fresh schemas then I have to enter the
60 via credentials for the database to
connect to and then I am going to keep
the same password for all users which
will be created for SWA depository you
can also enter information about a lab
store you can also enter information
about web tears and load balancers
and finally you can also add in the
scripts that will be executed after the
domain is created now once all this
information is entered you can go to
next time and schedule the run of this
deployment procedure so you can run the
deployment procedure right now or you
can schedule it for some future time
Here I am going to keep the deployment
instance name as it is you can change it
if you want and then I'm going to keep
the schedule as immediately so that
Enterprise Manager runs this deployment
procedure right now I have selected
notifications for all the actions
required and if the deployment procedure
is suspended after prerequisite checks
at this time I can save this deployment
procedure and use it for the future
purposes I can also submit this
procedure and then the enterprise
manager will kick-start the creation of
the domain now we will have a look at
one of such instances which have been
successfully completed and a new domain
has been created on compute cloud
service I will cancel this submission
and move to the successful run of
deployment rosier let's go to enterprise
provisioning and patching and procedure
activity and here we see list of all
development procedures executed by this
particular owner I am going to click on
the successful deployment procedure and
expand all the steps in the DP
so here we get idea about how enterprise
manager tries to automate the entire
flow to clone domain from on-premise to
cloud instance as you see there is a
prerequisite check done for ports and a
shared storage then there is a transfer
of the scripts from sap software library
where in the profile is also transferred
to the destination host then they will
check about on product requisites so
checks for oracle home etc available
space on a destination host etc then
oregon home is created all the binaries
are copied then oracle home target is
discovered then the sequel scripts are
executed to create schemas and finally
enterprise manager starts provision in
the domain once domain is provisioned
you can see there is a post domain
creation tasks so if you have configured
any post domain scripts then those will
be executed here and then enterprise
manager starts don't manager followed by
an admin server and other managed
service once everything is successfully
started there is a clean-up operation
which is done by Enterprise Manager
wherein it gains up all the hosted
scripts now once this deployment
procedure is successfully completed you
can see the domain into targets
middleware page so we will go ahead and
see one of such existing domains which
has been created using this deployment
procedure you can see this so our domain
is created on Oracle cloud which is
indicate
side parameter here now let's expand
this so our domain and go to so I
infrastructure and see more details
about so I'm from
on the soy infra home page we see more
details about the Swan freh structure
and domain ninja this party girls wild
fry is created on Oracle cloud which is
indicated by this particular property
which is unknown annotated to the target
name we also see the IP address of the
computer service here this is the same
public idea of the compute service which
we saw earlier on oracle compute cloud
service console then we see all the
active service engines which have been
deployed as part of this cloning process
you can more to other tag and explore
how the soya infrastructure looks like
you can also refer to the other videos
for diagnostics and more details or
being and monitoring of the sofa
infrastructure this concludes video
thank you for listening
