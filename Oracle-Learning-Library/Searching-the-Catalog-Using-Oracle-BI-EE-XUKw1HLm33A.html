I'm a sales consultant and I want to see
what objects have been added to the
catalog in my company's folder catalog
objects include analyses filters prompts
dashboards for example monitoring these
objects can keep me aware of important
updates to analyses and so on my manager
has told me that a revised brand revenue
analysis should be available soon as
this is a key report that I use
regularly
I want to monitor the changes I know
that there are several methods that I
can use to find this analysis I can
explore the contents of the catalog by
using the catalog link in the global
header or I can use the catalog option
on the home page I can also use the
search box at the top of the page from
the home page I click catalog I click
the search button I know that I don't
need to enter a specific name for an
object to view all objects within the
catalog I enter an Asterix
in the search field I select company
shared in the location list and then
accept the default for type I click the
search button next I want to see which
objects have been updated most recently
in the sort list I select last modified
ascending I review the list of objects
now I want to find the brand revenue
analysis that my manager added to the
catalogue I know that I don't need to
enter the entire name of the analysis I
also know that the search option is not
case-sensitive I enter BR in the search
field
my manager saved the analysis in the
company folder within shared folders
because I previously selected this in
the location list when reviewing all
objects in the catalog I don't need to
select it from the list again I know
that I only need to search for analyses
and therefore don't need to include
other objects such as filters or
dashboards I select analysis in the type
list I click the search button now that
I am familiar with the search
capabilities it will be much easier for
me to keep track of changes to analyses
and updates to dashboards and it will
also be faster to locate content in the
catalog thanks for watching
