compute and within that instances click
the launch instance button on the
instances page note that you can create
an instance only within a predefined
compartment you will need to create a
new compartment or choose some
compartments that you have created
earlier the compartment is a way of
collecting related cloud resources so it
helps with the governance of your
overall cloud account
enter the name for the instance and
select from the options in each field
Oracle bare-metal cloud services is
hosted in Regent's and availability
domains a region is a localized
geographic area and an availability
domain is one or more data centers
located within a region this is the
operating system you want installed on
the instance
you can choose from the various Oracle
Linux or Windows options you can also
choose a custom image if you have
already created one a custom image is
one that you have customized with your
applications or configurations from the
provided image or the image that you
have brought to the platform here we
will pick a pre-configured OS image
shape types that start with the VM our
virtual machines shape types that begin
with VM our bare-metal instances these
are entire servers without a hypervisor
installed that are vented to a customer
the vcn is a software-defined version of
your traditional on-premise network in
the cloud it includes subnets route
tables and gateways in which your
instances run you will need to have
created a compartment and a vcn within
it before you create the instance
subnets are subdivisions within a vcn
subnets act as a unit of configuration
within the vcn you can enter the IP dns
and ssh key details as may be applicable
the public IP address is selected by
default
you have the option of entering a
private IP address - you have the option
of using a previously generated SSH key
from your local machine you can now
launch your instance
after a brief provisioning window you
will see that your bare-metal instance
is up and running upon clicking the
instance you can do all it details from
this page you can stop reboot or even
terminate the instance as required</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
