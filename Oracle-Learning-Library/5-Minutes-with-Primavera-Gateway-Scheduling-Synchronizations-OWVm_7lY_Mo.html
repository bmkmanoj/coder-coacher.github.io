hi this is Virginia Manning from Oracle
primavera today we'll show you how to
schedule synchronizations in primavera
gateway after synchronizations are
created to move data between
applications you'll need to determine
how often those synchronizations run
i'll show you how to schedule a
synchronization based on a time interval
run as needed or run based on a
triggered event synchronizations are
created to transfer data between
applications you may have data that
needs to be transferred on a regular
basis to do so synchronizations can be
scheduled to run at a specified interval
in this example we'll schedule a
synchronization to create projects from
p62 unifier click the edit schedule
button jobs can be scheduled to run
daily weekly or monthly for daily
specified to run the job a certain
amount of days of month for example if
three is entered the job will run on a
third six ninth and so forth days of the
month or select to run the job every
weekday next define the range of
reoccurrence select a start date when
the synchronization should begin running
and then specify when it will end for
the end date you can select to run with
no end date run after so many times or
select a specific end date
after saving the schedule notice the
next run field is populated with a date
the synchronization will run if you have
synchronizations that run as needed or
if you have a scheduled synchronization
but needs to run it in between schedules
click the Run button to execute the job
immediately you may have
synchronizations that you want to check
the data coming from the source
application before it's transferred to
do so click the run with review button
you are taken to a summary page to
review how many records will be
synchronized click on the business
object link to show more details of the
data at the bottom of the page after
review click commit to transfer the data
or click cancel to stop the
synchronization you may have a
synchronization that needs to run when
certain conditions are met for example
transfer activity data from p62 unifier
when an activity is added you can do
this by clicking run on event the run on
event currently only works for
synchronizations where p6 is the source
application there are two listeners the
p6 update event listener will look for
p6 fields that are changed the create
event listener will look for p6 fields
that are added the delay field
determines how long a synchronization
will wait to run when the event is
triggered for example the event is
listening for new activities and five
new activities are added instead of the
synchronization running five times
adding one record each time it will wait
the delay and run once with all five
records included on the parameters page
define what feels to monitor for changes
select a business object enter the
database field names and click Add row
you can monitor multiple business
objects by repeating the process in this
example the event is listening for new
activities or wbs to be created the last
page displays the summary of the event
after saving the event notice the event
listener field is populated with the
name of the listener meaning it's ready
to run whenever the event is triggered
to disable the event click the run event
button again
this time there is a disabled button
displayed when clicked and the event is
saved the event listener feel nailed the
sleeves disabled thank you for watching
