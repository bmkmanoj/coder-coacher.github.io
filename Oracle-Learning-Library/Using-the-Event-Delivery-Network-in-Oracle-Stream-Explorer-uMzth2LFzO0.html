use the event delivery network which is
part of our so a sweet infrastructure
with the Oracle stream Explorer in a
fraud detection scenario so let's login
to our stream Explorer here we see our
landing page and for this tutorial we're
going to use the risk and forge
management section of the catalog first
of all we're going to create a stream to
use with the event delivery network we
give the source name and a meaningful
description we will define a tag risk to
associate this source with this section
of our catalog and other meaningful tags
relating to this source artifact we will
select that source type which in this
case is the ed n next we will specify
the URL to connect to our weblogic
server on port 7101 and the associated
weblogic server user ID and password now
we need to choose a shape the wizard
here provides you with the available
events from the event delivery network
in this case we've selected the Ford
check request and now we flow directly
in to the expiration again we give a
meaningful name to this exploration we
will specify our tags in this case risk
to associate it with a section of the
catalog and other useful tags for this
exploration and there we will select the
edn event stream which we defined
earlier
and create now you can see our
expiration user interface canvas with
the relevant fields from the event from
the EDM now for testing we will firstly
use the composite that we provided as
part of that media package and we use
the test function to allow us to send
the data via a web service to a
composite which will in turn send that
event to the stream Explorer as we see
the parameter required to test was that
email address and now we can see that
event being passed to the stream
Explorer and we can send subsequent
events to test we also have a edn event
simulator to automatically generate
events for us here we see the events
flowing from the event delivery network
and some graphical information and now
we're going to apply some more
sophisticated fraud analysis
capabilities on this event stream first
we'll add a summary we want to take a
sum of the total amount will add a group
by of the email address so we now see
both the email address and the sum of
total amount we use the properties
capabilities to change the shape of the
event output stream by placing the email
first followed by the total amount value
now we use our time window because we're
looking for events from now in the
incremented time window of 30 seconds
sliding every five seconds of output and
finally we're going to add a filter that
for in that window we want to look at
the total sum of the amount if it's
greater than one thousand dollars so
we're looking for any user any customer
that is purchasing more than a thousand
dollars within that 30-second time
window if this is the case it is an
indication that that customer or user is
potentially initiating a fraudulent
activity here we can see now the total
amounts exceeding a thousand dollars and
again how we graphically indicate this
from the tablea data that you see here
on the stream Explorer you I finally now
we have identified this fraudulent
activity we want to send downstream
these events for further action on a
target in this case we're going to send
the event back to the event delivery
network providing the URL and user ID
and password we will get the definitions
in this case from the edn which is our
forecheck response we will leave the
default mapping capability to map the
output stream to the edn receiving event
type and we will stream finally we will
publish this application for further
usage by other applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
