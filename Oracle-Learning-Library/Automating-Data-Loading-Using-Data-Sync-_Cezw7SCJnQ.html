loading data using jobs jobs enable you
to organize schedule execute and monitor
load processes every time you create a
project data sync automatically creates
a default job that has a - job one
extension use the jobs view to see which
tasks ran when the job executed and view
email recipients who are added in the
Tools menu to be automatically notified
when a job begins and ends to schedule a
job that runs at desired intervals use
the job schedules view provide a name
select the appropriate job from the list
decide when to begin the job and how
often to run it another method for
automating data loading is to use an
external process create an entry in the
XML file which initiates polling by data
sync data sync listens for the signal or
trigger which can either be a relational
table or file in your file system the on
demand job XML file contains embedded
instructions for updating to create a
trigger using the file based approach
modify the on demand job XML file to
configure a signal using a file in your
file system you'll need to change the
name of the job to correspond to the
project and indicate the location and
file name of the trigger if this is the
first time that you are creating a
signal change the - one minute parameter
to a positive number to initiate polling
and then save the file you can either
restart the tool to make the changes
take effect immediately
or wait 15 minutes after reading the on
demand job XML file data sync
automatically listens and initiates
running the specified job based on this
trigger this trigger file should not
contain any data worth preserving
because Data Sync deletes the trigger at
the start of the job data sync creates
entries in the log directory that can be
used to debug or fine-tune additional
jobs that you want to run in the future
these entries are saved in a
folder that has the same name as the job
and contains several texts and log files
that can be used for debugging Jabra and
issues to other files are created and
saved in the job signal subfolder of the
data sink log folder one indicates the
start of the job and the other indicates
the completion or failure of the job
there may be times when you want to run
a second job based on the completion of
another job either from the same or
different projects for example load a
child tables such as order items before
the parent table you can sequence two or
more jobs to run using the same on
demand job XML file begin by creating a
second job in data sync edit the on
demand job XML file and then add the new
job to start upon completion of the
first one to do this update the name of
the signal to point to the successfully
completed prior job that is located in
the job signal folder now you know how
to automate data loading using Data Sync
