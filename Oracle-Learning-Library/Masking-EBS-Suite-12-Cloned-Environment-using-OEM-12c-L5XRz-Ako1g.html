Oracle e-business suite release 12 1 3
template for the daily Mass impact with
Oracle Enterprise Manager 12c we will
demonstrate the ease of use of
scrambling data and he was a sweet
application database even is this
masking template explaining details in
the foot is in the following must note
we were showing an example of the
masking process you can see from the mas
note relevant details of downloading and
setting up in your environment since the
primary focus of the masking template
was to mask personally identifiable
information associated sensitive data
we're going to start by showing some of
the unmasked data in the human resources
application let's lock him in in the
human resources application you will cry
up mr. pritter daniels and show from the
screen that her personally identified
information such as their social
security number age address phone
numbers or own production values it's
also important to note that a lot of
sensitive data in DB suite is stored in
what are called flash files these are
generic database views that may contain
a variety of different information
depending on local ization or others
factors they eat this sweet mask also
cover sensitive present insider
information they're stored in these
fields by development or localization
we are now querying up the ID of
Mysterio so we can find her again after
the masking process is complete let's
now return to the application and check
out all the data within the trading
community architecture application this
also contains names addresses phone
numbers and additionally personal
identifiable information which is used
to lab the system searching on City for
Redwood City we can see in the address
column that there is sensitive
information stored let's log out of
trained community application we also
know login names for the system known as
different user names are also going to
be masked for the most part however we
do have a mechanism which we will be
showing in the trans that allows for
exempt users that can be used for
testing the application after masking
here we can see an individual and then
we will search on Jeff frost which will
be one of the users that we will mark as
exempt in the masking application
example let's go ahead and exit the
application go to business suite
database in the e-business suite
database we need to ensure certain
prerequisites are complete one of them
is correcting the necessary privileges
to the user will be mastered once we've
granted the user the permission to mask
we'll go ahead and make sure that any
invalid objects are recompiled
once the number of objects before and
after recompilation is the same we'll go
ahead and show you the e-business suite
template comes in the format of a zip
file we will extract the zip file as a
first step and see all the files that
are included the prerequisite files that
need to be included before the masking
process as you can see here are listed
as well as the post masse including the
templates we had mentioned earlier on in
this recording that the ability to
exclude certain exempt users is built
into the process first we will need to
create the table that will contain the
exempt users here you can see the script
that creates the exempt users table
additionally we have the sample script
since we are using the demo database let
will insert certain exempt users into
the exempt table we'll utilize this an
insert the exempt user of Jay frost as
we had mentioned earlier on in the
recording notice Jay frost is included
in this exempt user tape the purpose of
your own needs you can create your own
script and insert or modify the ones
here log back into the database of
e-business suite we will first create a
table and then we will run the script
that will insert the exempt users into
this as an exempt table here you can see
records are committed to make sure we
will select from the table could ensure
that Jay frost is included what's the
accept users have been populated we'll
go ahead and run the pre generate sequel
script for EB suite masking
let's go ahead and do that now as you
can also see in the template the two
variants are included we will after
generating the Priebus suite script
determine which variant that this
installation is based on or in the
sequel script that tells us that this
eva suite is of jg variant now logging
into Oracle Enterprise Manager 12c we
are our targets and show you the
databases that have been registered here
you can see vision the database that we
will mask of e-business suite
application as a first step we need to
deploy the test data management packages
that are utilized by the data master
template on the create job we will see
deploy tested in management packages we
will give it a name and select the
target of the vision database you can
also see that we support several
accelerators in this case where will you
be using the e-business suite however we
have fusion and custom application in
the current release will give the
appropriate credentials and submit the
job to deploy the testator management
packages into the vision database
refreshing the screen we will see that
the job is completed successfully when
it completes successfully we will
navigate over to the data discovery and
modelling yeah we will import a template
for the application data model that is
provided with the zip template file
we'll select a database that we want to
associate this template with and then
browse for the template since it was a
JG model we will select the ADM with the
JG in its name importing Union just
takes a few seconds and once imported we
click on OK the MAS law clearly dictates
the fact that we need to validate or
verify in this case the IBAs templates
history associated with this database
that's a simple quick step away by
creating a job during the appropriate
credentials and submitting
we'll wait for this job to complete but
you may take a couple of minutes we can
see here all the applications that are
being introspected from within the Heba
Smith app business suite applications
refreshing the screen we see here that
we fast forwarded and it has succeeded
was it a succeeded going back over the
data discovery and having a look at that
application data model we see that now
that there are 204 let's go ahead and
edit the application all the tables have
been brought in in addition we can see
all the referential relationships that
have been imported let's have a look at
human resources here we'll notice that
human resources have several
relationships that are stored and have
been brought into the data model in
addition the template also specified the
sensitive columns the same in return as
the next step we will go over the data
masking definition and input the data
masking definition template that was
included in the zip template let's click
on import your name associated with the
application data model we just created
and saved and once that is being
imported we can go ahead and import the
actual data masking template that
contains the algorithms necessary to
mask the e-business suite sensitive
columns specified by the application
data model that we had imported earlier
on in the data discovery and modeling
click on continue here we can see the
data masking template definition has me
imported with 803 columns it's gonna
edit to show you what it includes it
includes the columns that are required
to be masked as well as the dependent
columns notice that they show a tenth
option at the bottom of the page
includes certain key parameters that are
by default utilized to provide
efficiency the Masen process also the
pre mastered in the postman script
section
these are all included within the
template to get you running and masking
your e-business suite environment the
next step is to generate a script
generate script bills the script
necessary to mascetti Business Suite
environment from the template this is a
one-time process but you would do
looking at the status I will fast
forward to when the generate masking is
complete here you can see it succeeded
we were trying back to our quality
management data masking definitions page
and few the script risk recently been
generated in the drop down will select
few script and click on go here you can
see the script that is generated you can
run this independently or you could run
it through Enterprise Manager in
addition have a look at the impact
report that we report after we've
generated the script it gives you
insight on any resources or limitations
that the script generation is found
prior to running the actual data
magazines next step is to schedule the
massive job in let's call a database so
what we can see in a few steps we've
imported the template that pre defines
the sensitive columns and the
relationship in the template and will
allow you to get up and mask your
e-business suite environment as quickly
as possible
so let's submit at this stage we have
started Masanori Business Suite database
we will now proceed with viewing
postmaster environment after successful
completion of the master process
after successful completion let's ensure
to recompile all the invalid objects and
make sure that there are no additional
invalid objects after recompilation you
remember that we previously determined
miss better dining was personal painting
number twelve
now let's go search for that person
logging in to our application since her
information is masked let's go ahead and
search based on her employing opera here
we can see her information has been
masked in the human resources see social
security number addresses birth date and
all the relevant information has been
changed such as phone numbers
additionally note that her password
detail has been removed
hence the information of miss peretta
has been sanitized
let's also down lock out of our
application in log binding to the
trading community architecture
application as we had identified
sensitive information in that
application allowing the customers
clicking on persons in performance
search on city based on Redwood City
here we can see that the address column
note that the information has been
masked
let's now also log out and then log back
in and let's look at the system users
insertion of the different users names
that been masked here you can see 8%
Israel as we mast and then searching for
example of J France that was exempt user
note that his information has remained
exempt from masking this completes the
screen watch on using Oracle e-business
suite template for data mass with Oracle
Enterprise Manager cloud control thanks
