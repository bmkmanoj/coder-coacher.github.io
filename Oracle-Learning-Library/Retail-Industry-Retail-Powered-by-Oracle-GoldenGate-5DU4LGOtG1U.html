integration one if not the leading
technology in this domain is Oracle
GoldenGate this moves transactional data
into big data systems in real time
without impact in the performance of
source systems it streamlines real time
data delivery into Big Data solutions
which includes Apache Hadoop Apache
HBase Apache hive Apache flume and
Apache Kafka and now facilitating
improved insight and timely action it
can be used to transparency stream this
data now directly to the stream
analytics platform
for our demonstration in the world of
retail we have an orders database table
that is being propagated with various
sales information that is streamed to
oracle stream analytics using our
out-of-the-box cdc change data capture
mechanism by kafka once in the stream
analytics platform all the trending
revenue by product category arranged
quantity averaged quantity by product
and much more is provided in real time
here we can see our Golden Gate
infrastructure actively processing
database tables additions inserts
deletes etc we can see the extract and
replicate processes that are all running
smoothly the information is formatted as
shown here with the opt i'p for example
showing whether this is an insert delete
or update operation and the related data
you
so let's jump into our Oracle stream
analytics user experience and firstly
configure our system settings as needed
one time only for the related SPARC
streaming caf-co runtime and also the
available historical analytical layer
infrastructure
you
we now create the required based
connection artifact for Kafka and we'll
call it GG CDC
you
next we will create another connection
through a later database reference
lookup called Forex dB
you
now we can create that associated
reference called product details
you
note that all of these artifacts are
globally accessible in the future by any
new pipeline application desired
now we create the stream for the Golden
Gate related table events notice the
stream type of Golden Gate which has
been specifically introduced to
understand the semantics of the data
formats arriving once a connection and
Kafka topic has been selected the actual
daily shape is automatically recognized
and shown from the information payload
any hierarchical data is automatically
flattened by the system
the resultant data shape can be
restructured as needed in this case we
would delete a non required field
okay our defense created and finished
let's create the pipeline application
called orders analysis using the defined
stream
a quick review of the spark master
console indicates the dynamic
construction and deployment of the
created based pipeline application
you
the live apple stream with the
identified shape arrives on the canvas
from the database table CDC with some
fields propagated and some blank based
on the transaction type
now we want to instantly understand the
business impact of this real-time
activity by adding a new query stage
we will set a new business impact value
and we will use the expression builder
to create this new column in our live
output stream with a default value of no
impact
you
next we will use a business rule stage
to change the business impact column
based on the Golden Gate op type
you
for an insert we can set a value of new
for a delete or all the status change to
cancel we can set the value to lost
you
we can also create rules to indicate a
sale revenue upgrade or downgrade
specifically monitoring whether the
after revenue value is greater than the
before value
you
okay so let's have a quick review of our
new business rules
you
okay with this new streaming analysis
data at hand we can create another query
stage to analyze the actual business
impact of the change data capture events
for a continuous sliding temporal window
of one hour using a group ID feature we
can select the individual business
impact values to get the various counts
you
by preserving all of the Associated
event columns we can combine with the
aggregated data
you
and our fingertips instant insight
valuable information
you
using the powerful capabilities of the
provided expression builder here we can
extract the minute from the operational
timestamp column
notice how code complete is always
available to simplify the definition of
your algorithm
you
we can then rename the column for
downstream usage
you
and goal at this point is to provide
immediate trending of our new streaming
data so we now leverage the integrated
visualization capabilities for this we
can create a line chart called order
trends with just the food parameters
including using the option to save as a
slice for later dashboard usage the
chart is visualized trending over a
minute period
you
more charts can also be created on this
or any stage in your pipeline so now we
will build a bar chart relating to the
business impact and related counts at
this point in time
you
next we create another query stage to
add more context to our current
streaming information called get product
data here we correlate join with a
reference in this case called product
details based on a common data field
called product SKU
you
this dream now feeds into a new query
group table stage after providing a name
notice how through the golden gate
integration the OP type values are
automatically understood and represented
next the system will automatically
reconcile the before and after data
using a single field name mapping
note that in respects to the database
tables this information can be
dynamically cached to eliminate repeated
database table interaction
you
now we have that representation
dynamically updated in real time upon
which any type of analytical query can
be performed so let's show a group
analysis showing revenue by product
category over a one-hour period
you
we can add another group showing the
average of revenue by the actual product
over in this case a sliding 24-hour
period
you
the live output stream canvas can be
easily manipulated as needed by for
example moving the column positions and
renaming the columns changing instantly
the output data shape results
you
as before we can now add a collection of
more visualizations let's kick this
section off with a pie chart
you
and then an a bar chart showing average
quantity by product
notice as before will we use the save as
a slice option
you
with this wealth of data available the
resultant stream can be sent to a
downstream application for further
action and for this we will use a target
definition which will automatically
understand the required data shape from
the last stage of our pipeline
you
the publish button will instruct the
pipeline application to be retained on
the spark clusters and push the data to
in this case the define Casca topic
you can now see that the pipeline
application is running on the cluster
with a name suffix of public
notice here in the Oracle stream
analytics catalog all of those
visualizations saved as a slice are all
now available for a new operational
dashboard called orders operational DB
we will use the default look and feel
for our dashboard
and once we click on the dashboard
artifact we can use the plus button
which will add the required
visualization slices
now we can see the real-time dashboard
which is easily rearranged as required
and we can save all of the additional
changes
you
we can copy this dashboard URL and then
perhaps email to the relevant personnel
and your company or simply render in
another browser window as shown here
you
so there we have it a new creative
powerful pipeline application integrated
with Oracle GoldenGate providing
immediate business insight to your
transactional data its trending and
whether you are gaining or losing orders
etc with the ability to visualize with
operational dashboards or take real-time
action based on the current activity not
in days or months 30 minutes
