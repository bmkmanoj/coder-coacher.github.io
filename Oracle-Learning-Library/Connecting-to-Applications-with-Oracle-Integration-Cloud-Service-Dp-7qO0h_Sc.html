have to be able to connect to these
applications it can take a lot of time
and effort to create the code to connect
to other applications integration cloud
service connections enable you to
connect with on-premise and cloud
applications to share data connections
are based on adapters and also include
additional information such as the
wisdom L and the security credentials
required by the adapter to communicate
with a specific instance of an
application you can create a connection
for every application instance that
participates in integration cloud
service integrations because there's no
hand coding connections simplify and
accelerate connectivity to any
application from anywhere and reduce the
implementation and maintenance cost of
application and data integration
adapters process messages and
communicate with the remote application
and abstract away the complexities of
transports and protocols they provide
automatic discovery of application
assets such as Business Objects and
services with their available operations
and they support standard and custom
objects they make on-premise and cloud
integration fast and easy you can use
the pre-built adapters such as the ones
you see here so for example you could
use the Oracle sales cloud adapter to
integrate your sales cloud application
or you can use the soap adapter to
integrate with any other SAS or
on-premise applications that are
reachable via soap or HTTP endpoint this
is a sample of what we have available
now and more will become available all
the time you can also build your own
adapters using the cloud adapter is the
key to use yourself or to sell on the
Oracle mark
place as you create connections you can
easily see how complete they are and
once complete you can always edit them
or clone them to quickly create new
connections so that's how easy it is to
create connections to connect to
applications now use your completed in
Connexions to create integrations or
look at that next
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
