right okay I'm Thomas guest speaker
today let me to Olivia upon myself I
being coding C++ for living sings 88 at
the time we were using a motif on unix
anyone done that before that's very
painful ok and then since 97 I put for
company called object space and you one
heard that company before okay we were
the first company that had a application
server called Voyager and also for when
Java first came out there was no
collection API the time we had something
called Java genetic library so I work
for the company and along with two other
consulting firms so after working
20-plus years in private sector last
year decided to join the public sector
and the first surprise that God is I
learned that you cannot download stuff
to government equipment that is why
today you see I'm using my personal
laptop so 300 our laptop i bought three
years ago from a mother so you might be
slow do you need mo so please I be
understandable I this is it the third
time I spoke at the Java one last time I
was here I expect to in 2010 I was
talking about comparison zxf and access
to web service firm works so as part of
the demo I'm using 6 f of the service
layer connecting to my back end pieces
layer let us know disclaimer here
because everything I wrote here has
nothing to do with my officer job so
just stay the law application the
application is similar very similar to a
very famous income tax calculation
software so you might find some layout
might be very similar to that particular
software but everything is timing javafx
and I use the latest packaging option
called native packaging to point to a
variable not wanna go
so let me point out before I forget so
if you look at the task manager you will
see the name of the processor is the
name I gave it okay so it's not a
generic Java or Java w so that's the
first thing about the native packaging I
personally I think that's the best
solution because no you don't have to
worry about now if you deploy Java into
the client vironment you need to worry
about how many JR is out there right you
don't have to worry about no I'm not
guaranteed to get to my correct JRE
because in native packaging everything
you need is packed together your
application is controlled and without
any dependencies on the outside world
and also you don't worry about if I
teper deploy this in a web web server or
application server now would it be
different versions of Java files no you
will have any class loader province
coming too because again here is self
content not only isolated from the
externals so now a little bit of
background about the UI as i mention i
started using suppress was a motif and
that was a long long time ago but
several things i started working in java
the first half i will i did is using
swing and design a golf club membership
system and the swing is very very
powerful but very tedious to use and
then in the late 90s i was able to jump
on the web applications and guess what
we have to create HTML stuff on the
server side any ship over that's also
very painful and after that it was
struts do that and it's okay a lot
better than creating HTML files byte
from scratch but still lot of limiting
factors and then after that idgaf was my
fair i was the one i introduced yourself
to one of the consulting firms i was
work for and joseph is a lot easier to
use compared to two struts but now i've
been playing with a job javafx I don't
go back to any of the previous
technologies and you see how easy it is
in the Indy application i'm i'm gonna
show the POC i'm going to show you so
with that let's no disclaimer i'm not
going to show you any code because ha
you really don't need to see any code
because it's so simple you'll be very
amazed ok so first I into this talk I'm
to first of all so talk about why no we
pickle with javafx business needs and
then briefly talk about the architecture
of the POC and then at the end I'm going
to give you a cookbook no this is what
you need to do very very plain and
simple now if you want to really do
javafx as a client these are the steps
you need to do you know one more thing
avocado mentioned I also work for a
company that creating applications for
hangout devices and remember at the time
that's in early 2000 any time at the
time tom was huge and windows ce e
blackberry and Symbian and for the same
functionality you have implemented four
times okay for palm with you see for
Windows CE we have to use video C++ for
blackberry and Symbian we have to use
Java and every time we have a new
platform we have to make sure and run
everything making sure that everything
is ok but if you survive X lot of stuff
are taking care of you by the Oracle
engineers this is why supposed to be you
just worry about your functionality how
you write your application logic and
we're about all the department you don't
you nip you don't need to worry about
how to deploy two different platforms
different operating systems different
browsers you don't have to worry about
any of those just focusing on for you do
best basically writing your new
certification so first let's talk about
the business needs this is a very high
level you states context diagram a
little bit background on this we were
asked to come up with design to replace
a legacy system a legacy Microsoft
System the use of space is about twenty
thousand users we have about sixty
percent of the users they have
internet access all the time the other
forty forty percent sometimes they do
sometimes they don't so we have note
three different categories of the use
cases here now the first one is no the
case measurement now we have to be able
to create case the leak case a sign case
two different agent to work on and then
we have the case handling basically when
the user does matter if they have
internet access or not they can handle
oh the case locally and modify the case
locally and then later on if they can
always check in and check out cases so
these are three different categories
obviously for case control basically
checking and check out cases and the
code for case management you have to be
have internet access right otherwise you
cannot really talk to the remote server
but for the kids entering power it reads
as a matter of us for those forty
percent of the users even when they do
not have internet access when I have
never access they can still work on
those cases so that's the premises so at
the time when i joined they were
thinking about a laugh I don't we create
two different you coffee go user
interface the first one is this tends a
long swing application the flat forty
forty percent that don't have an echo
access all the time and then we have a
web application it found that you can
identify what technology to use okay we
will use those for those sixty percent I
always have and never access and then
the third thing is no they need to have
some kind of database synchronization
software to keep the database on those
twenty twenty thousand plus clients in
sync with the server today's talk we're
going to address the first 2i have a
difference or each mode if you want but
we're not going to talk about it today
so so I say okay that's easy down this
many many times for the people for the
sixth but some of the folks they always
have net access no problem we let them
get to hit EU ir are hosted on the
server they can do anything anyone
because they always have never access
for the people i sometimes don't have
net access when they do without them to
create cases
TB cases and allow them to check in
check out cases okay perfect and when
they don't have anywhere access and we
just no gray all those options and then
allow us to allow them to work on the
cases they have it locally perfect right
major benefits no need to create
standalone so inclined you don't want to
do the same thing twice that's really no
need for that and we can simply see
switch whenever it's a variable by
presenting those options so when those
are forty percent of the users when they
do have narrow access we actually allow
those options to be enough selectable by
the user when they don't know it seemed
require it out perfect right everybody's
happy and center has control of the
application of server and decides when
to install the latest jcf applications
oh it's fun until my presented is I was
told that well you know what we have a
limitation we do not allow web server or
application server running on the laptop
no I could have known this earlier so I
don't have to spend all this time
creating a POC just two years later so
back to the drawing board and and when I
was here two years ago I did learn the
javafx at the time it was a scripting
language 1.3 although it's a scripting
language I do see the potential of the
javafx because again you don't have to
worry about deployment you don't have to
worry about different operating systems
don't worry about all those instead now
you focus on fire you do PES now
basically develop your GUI applications
you the basic idea is you write the GUI
one time and then deploy javafx many
many times in addition if we do that we
can stand the tip roast and a long jar
file we can embedding a web page using a
palette or we can putting a link so the
client download using web start or the
new swine's the native packaging that's
why i'm using in addition you don't have
to test all your vacations on different
operating systems
or different browsers if you do thin
client and yeah we know what's coming
exits no I we are going to get requests
in a hay King support using ipad now if
you don't do this in javafx yes you can
probably do it but it's probably won't
be as easy or straight for X here are
some of the features and the first thing
I think it's the most important thing is
the using of F XML idea it's very simple
you separate out to different tests for
the people who are very good at
designing using interfaces you used
allow them to use something like sim
builder they can visually layout
different widgets and then they can use
CSS style sheet and then basically
modify the screen to to come from two
coppers tender or whatever and you don't
have to touch it as a diver like myself
I'm not going at those by the way the
example I use is based on the logging
example in javafx a simple example so
the say sex i powered it so i can
activate something like that looks to
period so by having a different group of
users designing your interfaces
developers can be free only working
about how to make this work right you
provide methods and you hook it up and
then everything should work and if you
want to talk to the backend you call the
backing web services and that's that's
your focus separating of constant as
made possible by heaviness f xml and
another thing is if you change the
layout if you change the company if you
change layout key change the current
screen coloring scheme you do not need
to recompile file okay because again is
a standalone file it's not the java far
it's xml a very wide variety of your
controls and you have something very
cool i reserved when Jessa first came
out there's nothing like a tree browser
I think at the company I don't remember
what the name they can always that later
on and but you start with a rich set of
UI controls to begin with and the one on
the left this is Coco diem
basically a sliding window you click on
one and we'll show the counting of the
one you click and there's also a web
component by the way in javafx
everything is part of the scene graph
and it can be no it can be a group of
nose and one special components called
webview its associated with an embedded
web engine you can use that to basically
load a webpage and using the JavaScript
to connecting communicating with the
hosting web web page and it has a rich
html5 support you get a shimmer editor
to begin with you don't worry about how
to create one and it's right there you
can edit the content you can view the
history and in addition they have a you
can basically display a fancy clap like
that in SVG you'd have to write it and
it's written if you have it SVG code
like that I think about it's about 30 40
lines and you just use it just hook in
so now let's talk about the architecture
of the POC this is the very standard
enterprise architecture at the top of
the user interact with a presentation
layer in this case i'm using effects to
do the presentation layer and also this
analytical service layer here i use zxf
to basically provide communication
mechanism between presentation there and
business there in business there I just
have some very simple business objects
interacting decorating income tax the
idea is very simple I just have
different income brackets for different
income brackets I have a tax rate so
that's very simple it can be a very
fancy but that serve the purpose and
then persistently right now I just using
in married database so if you shut down
tomcat server and everything's come but
eventually I hope I can get a chance to
do jva to try out some neat products I
have something coming up talking about
it and then JP obviously you can persist
data to the database or we can read on
external services of
services a layer of storage as a service
you can use that too and then
horizontally you can have cross-platform
security all the kind of stuff so this
is from my 2010 presentation cellular
i'm using 6f the basic idea is very
simple on the proxy on the client side
you have a proxy so the proxy is
responsible to cover or java objects no
into some kind of xml and stick it into
a soap envelope shipping over the
network and then on the server side
there will be some server component
responsible to convert the xml back to
objects so like the server can use those
objects and then do any kind of
computation that's necessary to come up
with the resulting graph of objects
again converting back to xml ship it
over the network and the client proxy
will come right back to the objects so
the basic idea is very simple but
actually if I it does is a lot it frees
you from know you don't have to know
what server is running on iOS is running
on could be on Windows could be on Linux
we good on anything and on the client
side the top one is Java and the middle
one it's a ruby and the other one that
was the icon I was used for javafx
script 1.3 the point is now it's totally
in a platform-independent language
independent because again on the client
side you just know depends on what the
whistles is saying you know use any kind
of proxy mechanism to generate decline
objects you just deal with one mechanism
to do the mastering a mushroom it's
called XML beans this is very very very
simple idea if you have a waste a bitch
schema at the company I work for before
joined it the public sector is the
pharmaceutical company they basically
provide software to run pharmacies like
Safeway ever since I lost count chance
so whatever in the pharmacy industry
devil way step is schema and what you do
is instead of creating your own types or
your xml or your own schema you just
compare
waste avish a schema that's the industry
standard into a Java so oh the file of
the types you need is the oily defined
and then from that schema you can
generate xml requests you be converted
into Java using instant you be instances
of those types generated in the jaw and
then requests will be two in the one way
from xml java objects to xml and then
response will be reversed I think I did
a reduction in correct so that's the
service layer very very simple and using
6f how many of your views they accept
before okay it's so easy okay I saw
using I start using web service about
five years ago at the point was excess
and the access to and then once a bumpy
26 f I don't go back okay so here is a
some of the objects what you domain
since we are trying to simulate income
tax calculation program so we have the
taxpayer a special kind of person and my
dependents a taxpayer can have different
attributes for the written information
you can file single file jointly or
become stuff and then the dependent word
relationship with the taxpayer and also
indication if that dependent is living
in the same address at the st taxpayer
and have a bounty of w tools to capture
the wages for that particular taxpayer
and also the dependent the taxpayer
might have a side business I'm sorry
loyalty they might have purchased some
stocks that no payout royalties that's
what the list of schedules k is for and
then in addition most of the time if
taxpayer can't is I know if you want to
use standard deduction or using itemized
deductions if you use I don't let and
the mass deduction then you use
schedules a and also the taxpayer may
have some income investment income
that's captured by
19 ib and also other kind of income for
example like 1099 interests you might
have an interest from checking account
savings account or dividend if you
invest stock of mutual funds you get a
dividend and also you might have a side
business so you might have a correction
of a Schedule k that's scheduled c and
then the last one for the schedule c you
pretty much have a list of assets you'll
be most business we have a list of
assets you acquire and then you sell
those assets and you can depreciate your
assets you have a list of expenses or
it's just to make sure that i am not
just doing some hello world kind of
stuff so I pump in de Provence because
all together i have about 45 domain
objects so on the server side it's
relatively easy for the entry point
sofas are basically provide a list of
methods know the first one is the only
one implement it it's basically
calculating income tax and then i have
this text engine and i have two tier
implementations is wise for 1040 and
once for 1040ez these are the only 2i
implemented the tax rate on the lower
list is the one i just described earlier
have different income brackets for every
break I have a different tax rate so you
start to calculate and the text engine
factory were basically taking a graph
rooted on the text form and it depends
on the type of the form you basically
return a different text engine to
calculate the text so this is a very
simple written computation once you get
the return you're figuring out what text
engine to use and then basically for
that technology uter it through all the
incomes including then I denies w2's
royalties schedule sees a demo up and
then the dot the number of dependents
the duck know if it is standard
deduction if it is a domestic duction
and after that just return the text very
simple the persistent layer is that what
I plan to do next the basic idea behind
precision there is there's a mismatch
between their base tables and java
objects because then i want one mapping
so obviously depends on why you do
oh and what a the coconut database you
use you'll get different performance and
here I'm just throwing it up this is a I
have all these references in the back in
the reference so it's kind of
interesting on the left you have a whole
bunch of database products running in
embedded mode and you're right you have
the same set of the base running the
tender client-server MO as you can see
the ones on Excel Excel gdb it's
Lawrence is really not good in the
object DB is very good because it's this
then I using relational database they
just use flat files use proprietary
mapping mechanism so without having to
deal with database tables you'll see the
movements huge like 10 times next let's
talk about the client so this is what
the I pray the POC looks like at the top
I show the basic information about the
taxpayer and we have a tab a panel down
there the first tab is dependent which
you can add different dependents and
then income allowed to enter all the
1099 information and deduction allow you
to pick standard deduction or itemized
deductions and business allow you to
enter schedules see if you have a side
business and also graph will show you
the income bracket Parvati percentage of
example of the w2's and every different
place we have different size of pie and
also I show the comparison for current
tax year with last two years so just to
show you how easy it is to use in javafx
so it's really really simple I didn't
realize it's so simple so the first UT
Phi motto auto my objects and in my case
I just just use a proxy generator I gave
the address of the wsdl web service
definition language it generates all
those Tommy objects for me I don't
create any the second one design user
GUI screens using the simbu the
drag-and-drop different widgets on the
canvas and then making sure that I look
good
and then the third one create
contraption is insid here I have to
create view objects correspond to the
widgets already laid out in step number
two and once I have that also create
method steps for event handling the
reason is because in step number four we
need to go back to the same builder to
do the wiring so for every components in
the Java class you have to wire it up
connected to the UI widget you laid out
in step number two and also for eggs and
so for example if there's a button you
have to in there you have to specify
what method you want to call so that's
what I refer to as wiring and then once
you've done that you go back to number
five implemented the stubs making sure
the view objects and the model objects
that are in sync you pull the values
from the view objects to populate model
objects if you change the model objects
in the back behind the sink you want to
repopulate the view objects those are
done automatically once you've done the
wiring or in the second case you want to
invoke web services that's very very
simple and then once you've done that
you're testing the IDE and then you
tested appointment and again I can I
emphasize the importance of the native
packaging because once if you use that
option it pretty much for you test now
it's guaranteed to deploy because again
you living in isolated controlled
environment you are not going to be
influenced by external factors okay you
don't you know you don't have to worry
about five part are's it's the client
the target platform is using you don't
worry about the browser if the process
has to correct plugin you don't because
again everything you need is right there
hmm okay
unit-testing to begin with yeah yeah
it's javafx is just java again fbp for
javafx to it was a scripting language
which is different but it's just just
java yeah you're welcome so first if I'm
odd objects well oh okay by the way we
have to use eclipse so not by choice
that's the official ID web views so
using eclipse yes this web service
client a proxy generation in there you
pick know what what configuration you
want to use here I just pick up a CX f
you give it over the location of this X
F into the installation and then you
give it the UI of the web service
definition language and then boom it
generates all the mud objects for you so
here it's just a partial list of all the
mud objects I didn't touch any of those
except one I did add to stream method
for the asset the reason is because in
the finished piece in step I have to
allow the user to pick any existing
asset so to do that I have to provide
meaningful output so that's why I / ID
to stream method if the dome objects are
very very complicated alternatively i
can do what i can do is i can create a
summary object okay then just pop up
just put the summary object in the list
so you would spray the summary
information and design a GUI screens and
again it's trivial by being using many
of video editors by far this is the best
okay in my opinion drag and drop you
move it wrong and then it's a preview
button so without writing any code you
can see why your screen looks like okay
so
simple create control objects first
create view objects for everything you
have on the canvas you have to specify
here by using the at F XML a notation
the reason is because once you've done
that when you go back to the same
builder you can select from a drop-down
list to pick which component to match
with which you are widget and then for
the event handling at the beginning of
for example in the paradigm i'm using is
for everything that says more than one I
just have a table and I have different
fields to allow entering different
values for that particular model and
also i have an ad and ever delete so
once they enter all the values in all
the fields require they press add the
value we pop into inserting to the table
if let's select any entry in the table
and then hit delete and then you get rid
of that so for me to do that I have to
create the method step to begin with so
our next step I can perform the wiring
tearing this the wrong time hey if the
user click on this button I want you to
invoke this method so for example the
first method will be invoked when the
user enter all the information for w2
and then click the Add button so you
will you involved is at w2 method and if
the user select an entry indeed every to
table and then click the delete then
delete able to will get invoked as you
can see the the paradigm is very simple
but I mean it is no brainer you just
have a step here now photo for the
wiring part there is a limitation for
the FX every screen you can only have
one controller basically the place you
have the tick theoretically all the view
components so in this case although i
have fault i have five different tabs
and there are different components on
lost five different tabs i have to
declare all of you for those view
objects in the same class so in this
case you're the first half on the top is
no you first you have to pick the
controller in this case I pick the main
controller and then once you pick the
controller you will populate the drop
down to allow you to
four components those are the components
had that they have the EDF xml and
notation so they will be populated in
this drop-down box you can only pick
from whatever it's there you pick that
and then you can do other fancy stuff
and another thing is no style sheet you
can pick if you have multiple CSS style
sheets you can pick one and then
associate for example in this case a
table the style sheet for the table to
particular table statue for the button
to particular button you can all do that
in here so there's no coding coding
required no everything is done here
you're free you don't have to deal with
that I don't like to deal with the
answer so for the button in this case
ice click the button for the dependent
table so in this case first of all I
pick the button associate that with the
the effects ml a view object i have in
my controller and then once i do that
and you will allow me to pick what
method i'm going to use in this case i
just picked the ad dependent and after
them and don't worry okay I not only
were they the GUI widgets with my view
objects also were the event handling to
my method in the class so let Warren
Paris done and once you have done that
you have to go back to implement of
steps so here is a very very simple so
for a dependent i need the first name
last name social security number giving
the same address and date of birth and
relationship relationship is enum and I
map it so that it can be a drop-down
list to pick and then delete dependent
is very simple I just delegate it to
something called dependent controller I
don't like to have big files big classes
so what I do is for every tap I have a
separate controller to deal with the add
and remove portion of diff Oh of the UI
so I have a main controller which has
all the view objects I have the or even
Henry method
now for avenging her methods for
different tabs are dedicated to
different controllers one for every tap
and for web services it's also very
simple you get a proxy and from that you
invoke the method and then after that
you do whatever you want in this case I
just know simply display the calculated
income tax in a dollar box and then the
user can can say okay and then just that
the robot just goes away ok any
questions over cool let's look at the
demo I just have a tomcat running here
so any time when anybody call the web
service I have you will bring out the
object graph in the two three meter so
you will show what's being populated so
first of all okay so let's say we have a
John Doe everything else is not
important let's say income let's say he
made three thousand dollars and employer
working for american airline I don't
have any verifications but you got a
idea oops I think I need to okay
ok so now I only have one entry if I
look at the graph ok you will show that
all my income is w2 ok and and you won't
believe how easy it is just to display
this graph I just have some data
populating in some form and then just
give it to FX with you our control and
I'm done and and here is a bar graph is
comparing the last two years is there 10
data and then comparing the current with
the last year so once i have that i have
an income i can just take a river in
context ok so this tells me that I Oh
about three thousand dollar income tax
as you can see on the Tomcat I basically
bring out the object graph using the two
three methods on all those domain
objects very simple nothing fancy now if
I go back and say okay guess what I also
made the great deal on google so
so Rev forgot my reading glasses that's
why sometimes I cannot tell what is what
let's just try something new happens ok
so now if i go back to graph you will
see now everything is done is everything
it updated very very simple because
again here we're dealing with events
right everything went change the tab I
Cakir everything so everything is up to
date and now if i calculate the text
again you'll be different so now i
already more so you got the idea so it's
it's a canine versus how easy it is to
have all this and for the business I can
do additional stuff but I mean so for
example i have paid three hundred
dollars for this thing
so once i done that i can say i want to
sigh so the same budding i saw three
four five hundred dollars
and here you can only pick whatever SS I
have so by having the word in the model
I have in be in the asset and then you
will populate the drop down so I can
pick this ok so once I've done that at
the graph would change again so you just
give you a simple reference I I finish
the UI poaching flowing about two weeks
for this in comparison when I DDGS f at
least double maybe triple the time in
jsf have 15 different screens and the
the face is comfy I XML it's a mess
although i'm using a tool that allowed
me to drag-and-drop different pages and
then wiring that way still it's it's not
trivial so I would say again another
thing is this is literally no learning
curve if you use FX because it's java i
mean if you are a java programmer to
begin with you know how to use effects
already the only difference is hey you
can all throw a lot of work yeah i don't
have to worry about screen designs no
two people that are really good at this
and then you provide them a list of
components so they can worried things
into from the UI widget into the view
objects and you tell them if you want to
invoke the method they can worry left to
if they don't do that you can wear
yourself other than that it's
straightforward so lastly what's next
the third thing I learned in the
government is just because something is
good they are lots of merits there are a
lot of advantage tell me you can use it
so I'm going to submit this and hope
that you will get approved so we can use
it and also I'm hoping that I can get
some time to work on the tape persistent
layer obviously on the client side
instead of using something standalone we
can use a something like java TB as
embedded is in jdk and then for the
server again this is a big rich
going to see if we're going to appeal
the object DV because it's so fast and
those so business there may be using
something called Drew's know instead of
have all the income calculation logic in
the code maybe we can have some business
rules defining those know those stuff
not just a saying illustration sometimes
sometimes you can give give some ideas
but sometimes you have to create a POC
like this so that they see oh okay this
is not smoke and mirror this is actually
something that's working and so other
than that here's the list of references
you can click on those it I would lead
you to different websites and different
articles except some of the ones that
number two is a book number four is the
presentation i gave in 2010 and okay
this is all i have today any questions
yes oh it's just how how do you handle
variation in java
okay uh remember I mentioned the wiring
no one said once that happen you have
the packing method in there in that
method you can validate it yeah because
again everything is on the client side
we're not sending anything back to this
story yet again this is a very simple
POC if it is a if you are going to make
your production i would say at least
three three times more effort just to
make everything know doing the right way
not now right now that nothing will yeah
any other question yes yeah yeah
different java class no because like i
said because here i only have one page
right so for one screen you can have one
controller basically that's the place
you come to define all the view objects
so different controls i fight you in
controls one whiskey contouring the
functionality of those different tabs
yeah correct correct so if your module
screens obviously marvel controllers but
for the same screen doesn't matter how
complicated you your view just are you
can only have one control yeah in our
question thank you for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
