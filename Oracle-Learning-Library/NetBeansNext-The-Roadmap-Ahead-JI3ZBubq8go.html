product manager for netbeans and I've
got with me here John Jack areli
director of engineering tinu and she's
the program manager for netbeans now
this is a buff right so I'm we hoping
that this is probably going to be a
little more informal in the way we want
to do things live more interactive if
it's possible it's k it can become quite
interesting when it gets interactive so
we might have to retake some time out
sometimes in case we have to and see how
it goes now we're talking about NetBeans
the road ahead and from my perspective
you know when you talk about the road
ahead it's a bit of a journey and this
journey pretty much involves people now
from our perspective you know it all
involves a community so you know just
curiosity how many of you were here on
Sunday morning for the netbeans day all
right okay and the keynote the I guess
you all stay back to the keynote fair
enough so we did touch upon a little bit
about you know what we want to do in
that means and I kind of indicated with
talk more at the boss so thank you for
coming now before I get ahead a legal
slide but honestly the key thing here is
you know we are talking about roadmaps
and we are talking about things that
could change right so this is what we
have as the information we have today
and we don't even know for sure when
we're releasing 73 bit i'll let you ask
one we're going to release NetBeans yes
yeah isn't it it'll be sometime this
week sometime sometime this week so
that's that's let's get that out of the
way now from my perspective when we kind
of talked a little bit in terms of you
know when you're doing this journey
together really I think before we start
talking about exactly what our plans are
what influences our plans right what's
the objectives that we have and kind of
for me it sits around these things it's
about supporting the Java platform
that's kind of a number one objective
it's supporting the Java platform it's a
button from an IDE perspective
it's about getting the day one support
for the platform and so on and so forth
it's also about end-to-end development
and then 10 development is you know is
going to involve things that might be
complementary technologies and things of
that sort so you know you have the Java
platform you want make sure you can be
productive in it and that might be
technology areas that are complementary
to it so we got to kind of tackle that
as well and it's also about emerging
technologies and I kind of want to kind
of profess that and it perhaps people
have different opinions as well that
it's about emerging technologies that
are complementary to the end effect the
Java platform itself in the ecosystem
that helps you know you you have html5
you know all that stuff is good but it's
best when you can leverage all that all
the things that you've already done with
with the backend and services and
consumption and services so it's about
emerging technologies that kind of help
you you know always also leverage what
you already invested in so that's pretty
much kind of the motivation now clearly
the big blue circle indicates the Java
platform and a lot of that kind of we
have to focus on now to kind of talk
about the objectives how do we meet our
objections what what defines the
strategy there are certain influences
right it's clear there are two things
that really come about that's the Java
platform roadmap yeah we we all have
some discussions with the Java platform
and that in essence doesn't mean it's on
the Oracle because a the Java platform
is also built the roadmap is also
influenced by the community right so
there is a community influence over
there but once that is all kind of
boiled in we've got to look at it and
say okay how do we support that that's
kind of well baked and it's that's I
guess it's a little more clearer because
people have some kind of idea about
where things are going and there are
industry and technology trends right so
when I say that gets in we've got to
look at okay that's fantastic and what
else is happening that can influence
that can we address it perhaps we can't
perhaps you can but you know we
look at all of those things and that
kind of pushes into our roadmap so
fundamentally there is a whole aspect of
making sure that we can understand
industry technology and trends I think
I'm going to kind of obviously the Java
platform stuff if you were the keynote
you see that there are always those
discussions ongoing if you see in the
keynote you know Hassan's got those
information up there but the NetBeans
support cuts coming for the future
versions london ii and George everybody
that came and talked and there's a lot
of specific ideas of what we want to do
so that's kind of care but in terms of
how do we address industry technology
friends of course market analysis there
are lots of analyst data we try to get
our hands on the lots of survey data we
try to get their hands on we look at it
but there's a lot there's one key thing
about v OC and then really it's about
voice of the customer and community
engagement aspect of it and I think
there are certain aspects that you know
when we start looking at what defines
the roadmap we also define how do we do
that right what is the engagement model
to talk a little bit more about that I'm
going to ask to you to kind of take over
sure is the Sun it is also ok thanks ok
so we have a few ways that we interact
with the community to collect feedback
naturally we turn to our forums and our
mailing lists and we have a bunch of
social media channels and we interact
with the community this way we encourage
our users to file bug reports are FES
requests for enhancements to vote on on
these issues because the higher number
of boats we a particular issue or
feature request has the more we're going
to give it priority in in the work that
we do but there are two other programs
that have or two specific programs that
have a significant impact on the work we
do in our road
app respectively one of them is netcat
which is the NetBeans community
acceptance testing program yeah our
people familiar with netcat how many
people many people how many people here
have been partly metcap great oh come on
oh yeah that's familiar ok I'm really a
part of netcat how many people have
participated in that guy all right ok we
love all we love you perfect right so
for those who don't know what netcat is
well against the accept community
acceptance testing program and these are
volunteers that are drawn from the
community at the start of the beta cycle
of our releases to help our engineers
we're testing and filing bug reports and
things of that sort and I mean that cat
is proving to be an invaluable resource
in the work that we do and to date I
believe they filed over 7,000 yeah
that's what I reports right so we love
our netcat folks and actually going
Homer who is in the audience uh you know
say hello one yeah so he's actually one
of our a long time netcat participant
and you know we thank them at the
community event yesterday so another
program that that we use to gauge
community feedback is all rather are our
user satisfaction surveys and with
netbeans 70 and seven that one we
launched these surveys to gauge the
response from the community about what
they thought we were doing well and
areas in which we could improve and in
the next couple of slides I think where
you're actually going to see results or
aspects of result of this of these
surveys so okay yeah yeah yeah yeah okay
just before i get into that perhaps let
me ask how many of you have actually
voted on bugs all right and i'm going to
ask and did your bug get fixed us yeah
that's genius no okay you fix it
yourself there we go take the law into
your own hands right okay so point2 no i
mean i think it's it's really important
that we get that feedback now that i
have obviously there are times when you
need water don bugs and and there's
there's been probably no action on it or
it's not been fixed and so on and so
forth and again we do take that into
account we have to go through a
prioritization process ourselves now
clearly one angle of it is is to kind of
see if it is their ways we can actually
improve that program to get that benefit
on and have those discussions there and
we looking at it and we want to look at
it we want to see if that potentially
can improve but but don't stop because
you know you feel that your you know
your wood has not been acted upon
clearly it has been recognized and we do
look at it and we look at a data way
where I'm thoroughly yeah that there are
times when we and many times I guess
when we have to say look you know let's
defer it and things of that sort and
that Massacre I was line wrapped right
so so being able to wrap the line at the
end of the editor it seems like a really
simple thing required us to rewrite the
entire editor parsley the entire editor
painting infrastructure and and up until
the time when PHP became really
prevalent inside of NetBeans people were
requesting and voting for it but it was
just like this is going to be too
painful for us for the amount of you
know for for how hard it you know for
for the amount of people who are using
it once the PHP people became thirty
percent of our users basically it was
like yeah the PHP guys do do this all
the time and want this all time it's a
lot less prevalent when you're writing
Java code I think to wrap your lines so
yep so that that's clearly some of the
things so and and also so the Saudis
have you did and I know I went through
this all yesterday was it something yep
she already seemed like a couple of days
just for the benefit those who not want
their quickly run through it you know we
we ask these questions about the overall
satisfaction and if you ask questions
specifically pertaining to the things we
did in that release
right so and we asked for some more
vocal feedback in terms of textual
feedback or what you want to see now the
key barometer for us is really the
recommendation index and that's like you
know if you guys are using it or any
product I think the success measure is
whether you can actually say hey you
know come on i would love i love it so
why did you use it if you were able to
kind of get that message or people that
you know that would mean that the
products doing something well there so
in a sense this is the most important
thing and for us it was good to see 89%
saying they would recommend although I
think there's definitely room for
improvement and what's kind of
substantiating inside digging into the
data points and as I mentioned on Sunday
the key data points that we came out and
that's what I'm presenting here well
look a lot of things a lot of
improvement was possible as it looks
like in the performance space and that
kind of makes sense because if you have
too many features but if your
performance to know that I don't think
it really sticks I mean I'm again if I
would say we have to make anything
features but if the performance is not
really good that's probably a
showstopper for you would you agree yep
okay so I see a few nods and that kind
of was indicated here we had having said
that I'll emphasize these aren't good
numbers right i mean this is your
satisfaction compared to previously
listed sixty-five percent said most at
ease more satisfied so if you really
look at the negatives there you know
twelve percent or less than fifteen
percent 50 pills to the less but i would
love for that number to come down i'm
not saying i have any scientific data
bday I think anything under ten percent
is a good strong challenge there I won't
make it even smaller so the sample room
for improvement and we did the same
thing with seven dot one the actual
recommendation in index actually
improved right so from eleven percent
saying no we had nine percent we had
actually two thousand 196 responses when
what I loved about the fact was we hit
about 2,000 responses on the first day
itself I remember chatting that wow it's
like you know people had really started
using this particular version and we got
the feedback in and I feedback hell
the the numbers were pretty much similar
with again a little bit more and now
keep in mind with seven dot one you're
also comparing with the previous release
with seven dollar as well so it's not
just in comparison with the old ones
it's with the more latest ones and the
numbers are still fairly good but with
room for improvement so from a roadmap
perspective we did seven dollar and we
went through that details yesterday so
I'm not going to go through a lot em go
through the seven dot to feature set
anyway but we improve performance we
worked on it and I think we expended a
lot of brain cells capital on this one
and I'm hoping we have some left for the
rest of the features coming up there's a
hell of a lot of work that we did on the
team that on smarter project scanning
which helped with the performance and
there are lots of interesting data
points we got we started getting up to
65 / sending improvements in in the
performance start at times and things of
that sort a lot reduction in redundant
scanning so on and so forth and we got
data is like silver peace dollar org
saying they could open a project a large
project you know something that took
them over two minutes and 30 seconds or
so opening what was it is a large male
is a program went down to 40 40 seconds
something that I'm two minutes and 38
the data we we had justified it and what
we're not stopping so one of the things
that we recognized was that we have to
keep the bar high for performance and
John mentioned the next thing that we
want to tackle that's going to be part
of all of this thing is memory um erases
yeah you want to a little bit more about
that sure I mean just you know first the
biggest complaint that we heard was
about project scanning about project
scanning blocking you know people so you
had to wait and for the scanning to
finish before you could continue so we
made it a parallel tasks so that it
would run off the previously cache data
and let you keep working off that data
while it was doing a new scan and we
also just optimize the scan quite a bit
so the next complaint that people have
is that we use up to
memory the memory footprint is too large
on netbeans arm and indeed it does seem
to shoot up to a rather high with a
surprisingly small amount of activity in
the IDE so that is the next frontier for
us and I've set some very aggressive
targets with my team and hopefully we
can achieve the same results on our
memory consumption that we've achieved
with project scanning and 70 so can ask
questions like to turn that around a bit
who's here is really happy and satisfied
with the memory you know performance of
the NetBeans IDE yeah oh wait or Never
Say bras good yeah all right that's good
yeah so anybody had problems either with
clients or students or whatever is
saying that NetBeans takes up too much
memory yes so it is this mostly because
down in down in Brazil we've got lower
powered machines in the universities or
sorry we didn't get we two men catch
that too many modules 2mon okay okay
uh-huh other people of bed yeah with
static code analysis they're getting out
of that om ease right anybody else hum
yeah
ok so the NetBeans platform apps taking
up too much too much memory ok mm-hmm
all right well this is our next big
thing this is there
module base right right I mean in
netbeans so NetBeans IDE itself has the
dev builds have this profile me now
application functionality built into it
so that you can you can profile the
running profile the ID itself like when
it hits things it's also got built-in
built-in checks so that if you if the
the execution thread gets frozen up for
more than a certain amount of time it'll
give you a little warning and say we've
detected some slowness and then you can
grab a heap dump from that I'm not sure
how you can do that inside of a platform
app but if it's in there then it should
be exposed belen side of a platform app
but we need to ask John do you know it's
in the platform as well yeah
see okay to repeat it you sinks in 7.1
we beheaded yeah huh you have to put
their memory to a bar in but you can do
that for your def builds and stuff and
you know while you're while you're
developing it or and then or you can
make it an option to turn it on and if
some of your customers are complaining
that they're seeing this a lot say okay
turn this on in the next time you see it
hit that and send me that send me the
report yeah
there's a command-line switch that you
can use also in production right okay
okay yeah I mean what I what I've heard
is from education you know the people
I've heard it the most from have been
you know edu you know universities and
so forth usually in you know eras areas
either in Africa or you know so I Greg
you know some of the people who were in
the Egyptian university program we're
telling me that that it was difficult
you know now I should run fine up for
good yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I am from
India but I haven't lived in India for a
while now so I can't really say I'm
representing immediately but I still
know that you know in many of these even
in corporate entities right the junior
level developers don't get a massive
system to work on they just you know I
will and that's what we let's gather
that's what we say that's okay but but
yeah you do have some older profile
system still in the in the workplace
yeah yeah so okay um I pray spectrum
yeah I put thank you so what so one of
the things I want to leave Vienna so as
part of the you know the road ahead
thing is keep in mind that's that's
that's going to be prevalent aspect of
what we're thinking to do in the next
one so I mean features yes but we are we
want to focus on memory so that's that's
going to be there as part of our efforts
moving ahead mm-hmm so got a few slides
yes you should probably be very familiar
with the 703 thing by now right we
announced you know the previewed easel
that was shot at keno we should have
showed it at the netbeans day and and
really there's there's the you know does
it that's really the foundation once
again it's going to be from a roadmap
perspective what you see in easel is
really the foundation for what we would
like to do and perhaps start thinking of
doing right so based on based on some of
the newer things that's coming EE 7 or
in the ee space and so on and so forth
so that's good and we probably have a
quick look
some additional aspects of it very soon
there's also a public cloud work that
we've done we should be having those
available shortly on students work
public cloud comes out we'll have same
day support for it as well so that
that's going on and there's a me 302
updates that we put into that and the
end that and embedded of it so I think
you know we will follow what the focus
of the platform org it Pat for marks are
right now the big things are obviously
as you could probably tell by the large
collection of little boards and gadgets
and things at the keynote embedded and
and m2m is a huge deal and so we're
going to be focusing heavily on that
html5 is a huge deal so we're going to
be focusing on that and how that ties
back to the server either through avatar
just calling directly some EE 7 since
server architecture you know we'll be
focusing on avatar will be doing rolling
updates to support the Oracle cloud as
we go forward and then any other updates
and the specs so those are you know when
when you go when you think back to the
slide you know where where the road map
comes from and one side is the platform
that's our platform direction right
there and then the other side will be
mostly dictated by you know kind of
Savin our ears to the ground listening
to what you guys are telling us and what
the latest trends are and I want to add
to that yeah if you look at back in 702
there are a few things that we already
started working on with respect to the
vo see that we got a lot of the VLC that
we got in terms of we said okay what
kind of features you want static
analysis was quite prominent over there
right could you bet there's a lot of
people saying hey we want better
abilities to kind of figure out how good
our code is and that's something that we
picked up from them you said okay we'll
be good something if we can do something
we're that'll be useful and we got to
find bugs integration that we walk
through in detail yesterday or in some
detail yesterday thanks to get Ian and
and and and to again to some extent
the html5 supporters a fair amount when
we talk about html5 let's be honest a
lot of the foundations of one a better
JavaScript editing capabilities better
CSS the core stuff those were feedback
that we got prominently as part of these
surveys so we've already addressed some
parts of that and we will you know after
we go through this platform oriented
kind of roadmap we will talk about
features again that that we were asking
for and how we can tackle that so keep
that in mind so that from a from the
industry trends perspective those are
the things that have already gone in in
in 27 or two and now coming in 703 yeah
can we actually can we ask if people are
satisfied with the ways that they can
you know interact or give feedback to
the to the NetBeans team because every
once in a while we know there are people
who say well I filed this bug and no
nothing ever happened does anyone listen
and you know we have things like the
survey and netcat and our social media
channels but you know it I'm curious to
know from from people in the room if
they feel that they have good access to
to the netbeans team at least to get
there as part of net get right
acknowledged 9 I grew and others non
help
yeah we do we do we do yeah the future
and that means IDs tied to the platform
so the baffled absolutely important for
us yeah
we don't have any i mean we're using
bugzilla right now and you know i
personally like gyro better than
bugzilla for sure um but not so much
better than I would go through the
migration I mean frankly do you miss do
you miss having jireh I mean is it a big
deal yeah
right right i mean we hear the same we
also hear you know are there any plans
to get off of mercurial and get on to
get ssandsk it is you know more more you
know popular than mercurial or so oh i'm
seeing some booze in the back not
everybody's a gift fanboy but now we
there's no plans to yes right right
mercurio was supported by NetBeans
before get what we had to because you
know we have all of our sources in it
right yes I'm sorry I know did you get
like to get off my google is it sorry
did he sell off or on off nike mercurial
yeah yeah hmm Wow um yeah mercurial has
been good to us I think you know it's
allowed us to do a lot of things that
that definitely CVS and subversion
didn't last you internally it's allowed
us to chunk out our build infrastructure
per team so what we have is each team
has its own as its own build repository
and those are isolated from the rest of
the changes so each team can be a lot
more aggressive in checking in code
because they know the only people's
builds they're going to break are the
people let's sit next to them and those
people will just lean over and punch
them which is nicer than getting a call
from your EVP that you broke the build
any plans to provide language support
for Skala so there's a community
contributed scala plugin that's really
quite quite good right better yes it's
resounding a resounding recommendation
yeah yeah so there is a if you go on the
update center there's a plugin that
provides support for for scholar that I
think the Eclipse one is much better
right well like I said it's not
officially staffed right you know so
it's it's it's a community effort
whereas I assume that some of the
developers who actually do scala
actually provide the plug-in straight
442 to take lips right and how many of
you are actually looking at scala are
already working with it okay yeah want
to see so you have a question
right
right
correct something
right right so the question is you know
write once run anywhere it doesn't
really work when you get an app servers
because you have all the app server
specific metadata and so forth yeah I
mean I don't know how much there is that
we as an IDE could do about that I
suppose we could have some automated
tooling where if you wanted to migrate
from say jboss to glassfish we could
sniff the jboss specific config files
and try to convert those to the types of
things that that the GlassFish would be
expecting we haven't done that so far we
haven't had a huge amount of requests
for it but as for being able to write
code that inherently is portable across
app servers we just haven't seen abuse
case for that I mean most people are huh
cloud is that is the use case for that
yeah yeah
right right and I'm just I guess this
question from my standpoint as you know
the theory behind all of it is okay
you've got these standards and you're
right into the ee 6 pack and so on and
so forth and a bit all of these
containers then have their own layers or
perform performance optimization and
things of that sort right I use it are
you what is the problem there that is
you know you're doing these tweaks for
those specific containers or is it at
the spec level that you're let you have
in the breaking
No
well
it's too
bye love to actually have this
conversation
oh that's great
right right so right so right so for the
rest of the audience what you're saying
is that you had an issue with the secure
cookies kind of thing that what you did
think right yeah I think we should
probably see you know not to have this
conversation with the e non Ã¨ team that
service yeah it is yeah okay well
probably on the data for the discussion
okay okay thanks haha collaborative
testing so how would what would
collaborative testing look like yeah
yeah and stuff yeah so does a bit of
history nerd me I don't know whether you
were familiar with it but we did put in
some kind of file sharing capabilities
and things was a wild back no beans it
actually came from sun java studio
enterprise right and the concept there
was kind of to start engaging this kind
of peer reviews and so on and so forth
so people could actually look at code
chain make changes on the fly and have a
look at it now do we want to go I think
there are two things that happen one is
to really build out that whole spec we
had to make some investments in the
infrastructure side of it you know some
shared repositories and so on and so
forth and eventually that decision was
kind of taken off so I don't know John
but you know in terms of how we dropped
out of the NetBeans busy probably an
aspect of a resources to some extent and
be anything you know yeah there were a
lot of reasons but I people really liked
the the ability to work on that but but
there were a lot of problems with how it
was implemented and so forth so peer
reviews so anybody remember connected
developer and are keen eye support right
so
yeah Jake exactly JP helped write it so
you know when when Kenai was was a
public project that we that son was
pushing we put in a lot of a lot of
infrastructure there for how to share
projects and be able to see your
dashboard and so forth and then a keen
eye turned into java.net or morphed into
the back and behind java.net we put that
in we left it in there but java.net
itself doesn't provide code review you
know capabilities so we looked at it
it's actually rather simple to write a
UI for code code review and so forth
what's difficult is to find where you
going to store it what's the repository
right so we looked at it we're like
should we you know abuse you know like a
bug tracker and use that as a data
should we have our own metadata should
be local should there be a server piece
what should we do what we decided was do
not do anything until we were linked up
with with kind of forges or SCM systems
that supported it and then just go
through that right so there's a couple
of things that we looked at one is as
the cloud story evolves as that the
Oracle cloud story evolves there will be
you know ALM tools inside the Oracle
cloud story and as soon as those and
nappies will support those from day one
and as soon as those offer code reviews
will offer it through that the other
idea we've kicked around is but we
haven't had the resources to work on is
should we provide the kind of
connectivity that we have with java.net
should we provide that with github right
so that you're not just doing you know
get clones and so forth but you can do
your pull request and everything and do
your code reviews and so forth from
inside the IDE something we've looked at
but we haven't had the resources to
bubble it up to the top and actually
implement so basically that's on the
radar in terms of what we wanted
okay i want to bring the initial thing
the reason why some of the earliest
opt-in work was like we realized a lot
of infrastructure investments that need
to be made and now with the cloud that's
kind of you know something that we can
leverage and so that's something we want
to put on the radar map yep that's a
good point by the way how many of you
would actually be you know like to use
something like that you know these kind
of peer to peer reviews and you know a
file sharing so on and so forth okay all
right okay alrighty so let's go Ne in
terms of time we're going to quickly run
through some of these specifics you so
that in terms of release is the way we
look at it is ok we have these big
bucket items right that are kind of a
line with a java platform and then we
look at all the industry trends and
influence that we can at least address
and see where we put on the roadmap and
that is probably a decision that's a
little bit more focused on from you know
in a in a particular release and see
what we work on so there's the next
release would kind of the big release
was kind of focus on EE 7 support and
we'll go to that in detail and then we
have a big bucket for the eight support
and the nine support so that's you know
targeted with the Java platform you've
seen the roadmap yesterday and obviously
there will be something between jdk and
jdk nine we're not going to go two years
without a release it's just you know at
planning for anything that's longer than
18 months away is kind of a futile
exercise inside Oracle and alter it out
yeah
that supports lambdas no there should be
there should be a developer preview
issue no no there should be a developer
preview already that supports lambdas I
was surprised they weren't in the slides
but I know we internally we have a build
that already supports the the current
version of lambda so i'll make sure yeah
he's the guy who works on our lambeth
support so there you go
yep basically we have built of NetBeans
that suffer some dust on continuous
builder but it's not like formalized in
some download page nothing like that
it's just builds and commits I'm sorry
right that's it yes it's public it's
okay bedtime to Nadine's look yeah what
talks with Brian gets and we'll make
sure that we will put up a link to a to
a buildup on the on the thing I I know I
wrote some emails about it before top of
one but things were kind of hectic
they're kind of crazy so it obviously
didn't make the cut all right so we get
into some more details of features that
are not tied to the Java platform little
later on so the rational 47 dot 3b you
see was that so you know that we had a
lot of people asking for better
JavaScript keeper editing capabilities
better html5 support and so on so for me
to focus the cutting edge and the
foundation so we walked through all of
that you know that I guess some of the
questions that we have is you know we
approached this way where it's more cord
centric right i mean rather than WYSIWYG
aspects of things of that sort and
that's there's a kind of interesting
questions that we tend to get all right
if you are doing all these kinds of web
client developments do we really think a
WYSIWYG is a good kind of tool for
professional web sites what's what's the
answer do you like wysiwyg no thumbs
down up there because we're not doing it
right first time we've gotten applauded
for you're not doing
yes was much easier than having to get
applause for it actually doing stuff
good stuff yeah exactly well I mean
especially and you know the thing is in
a well-structured well-understood
environment that you own it's possible
to do wysiwyg and actually make you
somewhat productive in it so you know
the GWT guys have had some success with
with with it ADF the NJ dev has had some
success with with doing out with doing a
WYSIWYG and so forth you're looking at
HTML and JavaScript right now it's the
Wild West out there there's no you know
we have a hard enough time just
providing editor features for all
everybody's favorite JavaScript
frameworks you know much less we're
going to we're going to do WYSIWYG that
actually does what you tell it to do and
produces code that that isn't garbage
you know it's just it's a fool's errand
and we'd rather just not chase it you
know so so that we've really focused
more on you know in the editor and then
tying the editor to the browser so that
you can preview what your rendered thing
looks like as your coding it but you're
still the one who's coding it yep cool
how much how we do the time is so we've
got another five minutes five minutes
yep okay let's run through some of this
so e seven let's go to the slide where
we say what we're not going to do okay
so you know you got applause last night
if it works it means nine right it's
pretty common kind of things and then
here's a top feature request this is top
feature requests that we're not doing
actually all right so these come up
again and again and again so visual web
is up there again right you know we had
visual web and there and people were
very upset with us when we canceled
visual web visual web was again one of
those things that was it was jsf it was
tied to a specific component set right
which was the Woodstock component set
and in the long and painful death spiral
of Sun
it Woodstock was one of the the first
casualties right and when they cut the
component set it was like but we can't
build this tool without a components
that we looked a little bit at changed
we swap in icefaces or some other
components sets for it but it was really
became obvious very quickly that that
too it was written specifically to work
with with Woodstock so so we asked it
and people keep asking for it back and
we're not doing it basically yeah well
well not all that's not true the not
that all Java guys don't care i mean i
think there's a large class of
developers who are corporate developers
who work in frameworks who actually do
expect this type of this type type of
functionality we have a tool for those
people it's called jdeveloper right
netbeans does not yeah yeah ADF faces
looks works great you know and and
jaidev is the is a great tool that we
put significant investment into getting
that that workflow working perfectly for
so you know we don't see the return on
investment in putting that much work
into doing it in in netbeans as well so
an ADF just released the community the
essentials ADF essentials which is a
free not open source but a freely
available a version that anybody can use
so UML's the other one how many people
use you amount how many people want you
amount really really have he's got to
anza hey that's all kind of one is fine
so I guess the reports of UML's death
were greatly overstated first iuml is
one of these things that what we really
want to do is we want to grab J
developers um oh and put it into net
beats that's what we want to do we don't
want to build another uml system we want
to grab j developers and put it in
methods
people hate it people can yelling at us
about it that it was there was it was
broken and it didn't work and the
performance was awful it huh 625 Charlie
I'm gonna I'm gonna pick say no do it do
it you p or that almost from Sanjay was
to the enterprise yeah I look having
said that he takes you ever noticed he
used to work outside job yeah I used to
imagine I was a response for bringing
you a medal in Tucson Joshua enterprise
so I'm keeping a little silent so we're
in the white went out he's got a lot of
work on getting large parts of NetBeans
inside of jaidev that's just because of
licensing reasons it's the easier path
to go we've got some and also netbeans
works on a much looser and freer release
schedule than jaidev does so it's a lot
easier for us to to you know to be able
to do efforts like that but we are
looking at bringing code the other way
and perhaps good the top thing on my
list is uml but we really don't have the
resources to staff another you you know
uml project you know built from scratch
but that is you know the fact is look
that is Yuma within a team's this thing
so you know yeah I mean you can't go and
grab you know jdeveloper news J
developers your mouth okay says no all
right that's interesting because we
heard nothing but complaints about our
you amount it was used very widely but
we heard nothing but complaints about
the the performance and the you know the
lack of undue and so forth and I was a
big motivator for us dropping it we felt
like if we couldn't do it right we were
going to do it at all
yeah the ones okay right so the squeaky
wheel there was a squeaky wheel getting
the getting the worm that for every
person who was complaining there were a
hundred happy users out there nope right
so you're already in a bad mood when you
open up our tool because you have to do
uml and then you hit that buggy I are
never easy yeah okay so how many of you
would be satisfied with a lightweight
you a mess up whereas in you know just
kind of class diagram kind of thing
rather than the full one full blown
not a lot of good you in multan so what
are the best tools out there right now
arrow um out what other tools are people
use them for uml right now visual
paradigm that it's a monster your ass
it's important yeah okay huh magic draw
yeah okay yeah right they were possums
dia dia aside in UML but that was part
of that was the open source version of
yeah all right okay yep random yep I
think we need to we need to keep moving
down the path of trying to get trying to
get um elf you know to not write a
function but some functionality like
three four times you know one fresh one
for each ide so we're going to keep
moving down the path of trying to get
uml get features like uml from jaidev
into netbeans you know if that becomes a
dead end then you know we will take a
look at it because it's obviously a very
highly requested feature so it is it
does come in on slow mezcla and then
android/ios what can I say we have an
Android project we have an android
plug-in community developed android
plug-in on the on the update center that
people seem to be quite happy with you
know this is not a you know a big driver
for us right now although what i can
tell you is that with project easel
probably the first thing we'll do once
we get the basic stuff done is throw
phonegap support in so you'll be able to
phonegap as a javascript library that
lets you take html5 applications and
package them as native applications for
the phones so instead of writing things
in you know either you know objective-c
or in Android you can just write them in
html5 wrap them up throw them you know
so that's probably the first thing we
will do once once we get the initial
release out so that'll be our story for
those devices but we won't be doing
native phone development yes
ezel ezel all the way ezel all the way
you know I think it's I think it ok so
first of all the java wars are done the
java wars are over like I now I used to
work in a company where we did netbeans
and it was NetBeans against the world I
now not working a company where we do
NetBeans we do Eclipse we do jaidev we
got pieces of Eclipse inside of NetBeans
we got pieces of NetBeans and Senator
clips and my job now is not to make
NetBeans successful it's to make Java
successful so I'm less concerned about
the whole switching thing than I used to
be having said that it's become pretty
obvious and you know I'm biased and I
think just by the fact that you're here
you put a lot of love you look will
agree i think NetBeans is better than
eclipse you know I think we got better
e6 support I think we got better editor
I think we got better all this and what
we've seen is when you got companies
that are very entrenched and they've
written their custom plugins and the
whole team is on that maybe they got
their project XML checked into source
code and so forth right having a five
percent or ten percent better editor or
you know even a you know in the case of
things like restful webservices hundred
percent better you know support is not
enough to break those people out of the
development practices that they have now
giving them something that they
completely don't have is and that's what
I think project easel and the advanced
html5 to leah's goodness you John are
going to stall I think we run out of
time we can't continue the discussions
informally outside but thank you once
again for your time and please keep this
feedback notion Toria thank you very
much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
