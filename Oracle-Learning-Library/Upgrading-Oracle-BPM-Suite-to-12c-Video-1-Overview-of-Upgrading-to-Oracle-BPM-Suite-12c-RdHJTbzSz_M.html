curriculum developer in the server
technologies curriculum development
department at oracle and i'd like to
welcome you to this overview of
upgrading oracle business process
management suite 212 c specifically 12
13 this is the first in a series of
eight videos describing the upgrade
process in this introductory video will
give you a high-level overview of the
upgrade process we've broken the upgrade
tasks into three general groups those
that you perform before the upgrade the
upgrade tasks themselves and the tasks
you perform after the upgrade will take
a look at each of these in turn before
we begin a few words about this video
series first it is targeted to
experienced 11g users and is part of a
larger offering of user assistance which
includes these videos Oracle
documentation including online help and
the Oracle forums if you have previously
upgraded one 11g version to another be
aware that the upgrade process has
changed significantly for 12 see our
goal in these introductory videos is to
show you a typical upgrade from start to
finish using a particular topology so
that you get an impression of the
overall process will show you the tools
to use and point out some important
things along the way but in these short
videos we cannot cover everything so we
also want to impress upon you the
importance of reading the documentation
thoroughly before proceeding with the
upgrade if you run into any problems you
can turn to the forms as well it is
essential to read the documentation
starting with the upgrade planning guide
and the interoperability and
compatibility guide not every
installation can be directly upgraded
12c there may be additional steps you
need to take to bring your installation
to a state where it is ready to be
upgraded these guides describe which BPM
versions can be upgraded which database
versions are supported what operating
systems want to apologies and much more
the guides also describe the additional
steps that may be necessary if you are
using an earlier version of BPM or are
running 11g components that cannot be
upgraded to 12 13 it's important to
understand and complete these steps
first so you don't try to upgrade an
environment that is not upgradable after
reading the documentation and performing
any necessary tasks you'll need to
backup your existing environment after
your backup is complete there are a
number of other tasks to perform at this
stage for example you should create a
test copy of your production environment
a clone of your environment and upgrade
that first to identify and resolve
potential upgrade issues you should
purge unused instance data to save time
during the upgrade and much more if
you're using a file based policy store
you'll need to take steps to create a
database based repository because BPM
12c does not allow file based policies
doors next you'll need to install the
12c software in a folder that is
different from the folder in which the
11g software is installed if you are
using so integrated product distribution
such as Oracle HTTP server or Oracle
Service bus you'll need to install those
as well so that's a quick overview of
the tasks to perform prior to the
upgrade preparing for the upgrade is
perhaps the most time-consuming phase of
the upgrade process but good preparation
is going to be critical for your success
we'll talk more about the pre upgrade
tasks in the video titles you see on
screen performing pre upgrade tasks and
installing 12c software the upgrade
process
self can be broken down into four main
subtasks creating database schemas for
12c up grading schemas and instance data
reconfiguring the 11g domain and
upgrading the domain configurations
let's go into each of these in a little
more detail the first step in the
upgrade process is to use the repository
creation utility or RC you to create new
schemas that are needed for 12c next you
use the Upgrade Assistant or you a to
upgrade your existing 11g schemas to 12c
and to migrate the instances that were
in flight when you shut down your 11g
environment after active data migration
is complete the upgrade software
automatically starts migrating closed
instances in the background if you have
a lot of closed instance data this could
take a while and there are tools you can
use to schedule manage and monitor this
migration we'll talk more about this in
the post upgrade video next you run the
reconfiguration wizard to reconfigure
the 11g domain which accomplishes the
tasks you see listed on the screen note
that if you are upgrading a BPM domain
with bam there is a special set of tasks
you need to perform because BAM has been
completely redesigned for 12 see these
tasks are documented in detail in the
upgrading solo with oracle business
activity monitoring section of the
upgrading so sweet and business process
management guide finally you run the
upgrade assistant again to complete the
upgrade of the 11g domain to 12c by
upgrading several components including
the ones you see listed here note that
the 11g domain upgrade is done in place
the domain remains in the original
folder structure but points to the 12c
home to
directory so that's a brief description
of the upgrade process itself you'll
learn more about the upgrade tasks in
each of the four videos listed here
after you complete the upgrade tasks
you're not quite done there are still a
number of post upgrade tasks to perform
and then the all important task of
restarting everything and verifying that
the upgrade was successful let's take a
quick look at some of those tasks for
example if you have any customized
startup scripts or configuration files
you'll need to reapply those
customizations because the upgrade
process will have overwritten them
similarly the upgrade process doesn't
preserve file ownership and permissions
so you'll want to make sure they're as
you want them to be recall that when you
upgrade the 11g database schemas and
active instances the Upgrade Assistant
starts up a process to migrate closed
instances you can determine if the
migration process is complete and if
it's not you can schedule the migration
process to run during off-peak times you
can start 12c and run your applications
without waiting for this process to
complete but you'll want to understand
the pros and cons of doing so we'll talk
more about that in the video covering
post upgrade tasks at this point you can
start up the admin server node managers
and managed servers along with any other
components in your environment when your
servers have been restarted you can
access your applications and verify that
they work as they should in-flight
instances should be visible and
actionable closed instances should be
visible and you should be able to handle
recoverable faulted instances so that's
a sampling of post upgrade tasks as
we'll see in the last video in the
series the exact tasks that you perform
will depend on your environment
the components that you have installed
so that concludes our survey of the
steps in the upgrade process just one
more thing before we go in the upcoming
videos will be demonstrating the upgrade
on an example topology let's take a
moment to get acquainted with that
topology first we have two hosts each is
running a version of Linux certified to
work with 12 c each has a jdk certified
to work with 12 c each has a weblogic
server so a sweet n BPM suite 11g
weblogic server node managers and a
domain named BPM domain one host has an
oracle database whose version is
certified to work with 12 see the other
host has the admin server running in its
domain both have managed servers and
those managed servers are clustered
finally each has a standalone instance
of Oracle HTTP server as a load balancer
we chose this topology because it is
simple but allows us to address many of
the tasks you'll need to complete in
your single or multi host environment
that concludes this overview of
upgrading to 12c you are now ready to
proceed to the next video in the series
where you'll learn about pre upgrade
tasks I'm Rosie pillar thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
