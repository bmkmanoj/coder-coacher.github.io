affected by certain demographics begin
by creating a project and adding the
first data source columns that contain
numbers are assumed to be measures such
as store ID however you need to treat
these columns as attributes review the
column characteristics hide the columns
you don't need and add the data source
to the project for data elements are now
hidden in the data set make sure that
the aggregation method for units and
revenue is set to sum and then add the
data source to the project switch to
visualize mode to begin building
visualizations select the first data
element and then use the ctrl key to
select other relevant columns drag them
to the canvas and begin exploring the
data by swapping depot name with item
type by positioning the mouse over a
value and using the right-click menu to
sort the data you're able to view the
highest values first our marquee can be
created by dragging the cursor over
specific values and right-clicking
inside the marquee area to keep only the
selected values now that you are focused
on exploring the highest
revenue-producing item types you want to
extend the data by adding demographics
the demographic detail is in another
spreadsheet upload the demographics
details and switch back to visualize
mode next take a look at the connections
in the source diagram a connection by
zip code is made with the other source
automatically now begin to examine the
impact on revenue by selecting the
education demographic data element drag
average education to the trellis rows
drop target
it looks like the highest revenues
generated are for those who have
achieved an education level of 15 years
you'd like to see if the revenue goals
were met for these item types as well do
this by adding the target revenue
datasource to connections are
recommended review all the
characteristics and include a third
connection that matches store sales with
target revenue based on dates verify the
match and return to visualize mode now
create a revenue calculation for the
daily sales vs. target revenues
double-click data elements and operators
to create the expression and then
validate it both measures are from
different source
add a second visualization to explore
revenue variances by copying the
existing visualization and selecting the
location on the canvas to paste it
delete average education and Depot name
from the chart replace revenue with
revenue variance from the my
calculations folder an item type with
order date focus the visualization on
2016 by adding a marquee and keep only
those values the filter is applied to
both visualizations you notice that for
most of this time period target revenues
were below expectations now that you've
finished save the project based on this
exploration you now have a better
understanding of the revenue generated
for specific item types in this video I
showed you how to create a project open
and blend data sources swap columns
limit data and create a calculation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
