four short videos that explain about the
sample otbi dashboards and reports that
I've posted on customer connect my name
is Caroline gladwyn and I work as a
solution consultant in the Oracle UK HCM
team in this second video we'll be
looking at how the dashboards are laid
out and the prompts that they use will
then be looking at how charts and tables
are displayed before finishing by
looking at some drill to detail reports
with the use of some multiple views so
at the end of the first video you'll
have been in a position where you will
have imported the content and configured
it to your own data the purpose of this
video is to have a quick look at some of
the display options that have been used
to give you some ideas for the reports
and dashboards you'll be creating you'll
have noticed that all of the dashboard
pages have a standard format so down the
left-hand side we have a dashboard
prompt and we have the ability to reset
the values using the button at the
bottom on the right hand side we have a
textual title and then below that we
have a number of metrics and reports
that give further detail about the data
let's have a look at how those dashboard
pages are set up if I choose edit
dashboard then we can see the basic
layout so you can see on the left-hand
side here I've got a column and I've
specified this as having a fixed width
so if I go to the column properties you
can see that I've fixed it at a hundred
and eighty wide within that I then have
a section and what I've done with that
is I've actually formatted the section
to have the specific background color
that matches the rest of the BI page
that's optional whether you want to do
that or not the other thing I've done is
I've said that the section is not
collapsible which means that that
content will always display on the
dashboard page and then within that
section I've put the prompt and it's the
same on all of these pages the same
structure is used if we have just a
brief look at how the prompt has been
set up then we've taken advantage of
some of the options on the functionality
for the prompt
so here we can see the different columns
that are selected in this particular
prompt and I haven't selected any of the
new column checkboxes
so the prompts display all the way down
the side of the page I've also chosen to
have the label above the prompt and the
way that we do that is by using the
properties on the display and choosing
to place the label above the prompt
that's also where I specify the title
which I've just put a selections I've
also said that the width of all the
prompts should be fixed at 120 to make
sure that it doesn't scroll within the
fixed width column the final thing I've
done on most of the pages is for each of
the items within the prompt as I've
specified that its values and available
values should be limited by all of the
other values in the prompts so if for
example I picked a particular business
unit it would only show me for example
the legal employers or the locations or
the person types that reflect that
particular business unit it's very
useful in guiding your users to make
valid selections to have that limit
values option switched on so that's how
the dashboard prompts a setup let's have
a look at a couple of other things in
terms of the dashboard pages at the
moment they haven't got any links on any
of the reports to allow the end-user to
for example export the data or maybe
publish it to a briefing book it's very
easy to switch on those dashboard links
if we come back into editing it we can
choose the Edit tools option here and
choose dashboard properties and within
the dashboard properties one of the
things you can select are the dashboard
report links so for example if I want an
edit a print and export and an add to
briefing book option below every report
on the dashboard I simply switch them on
here click on OK ok again and now when I
save and run my dashboard it will have
those links displayed it tends to be
personal preference whether you like to
have those links available or not
but that's how you add them if you wish
to deliver that to your end-user so if
we have a look at this headcount by
gender report this is using something
called
for layout and if I edit this report we
can have a look at some of the
attributes that have been set so here we
are now within the editor within the
compound layout and if I go to the
properties button you can see here that
I can specify the actual size of the
chart I can also decide whether or not
there's a legend and in terms of the
style this is where I can pick the fact
that the style is a rectangle and that
gives that flattened look to the colors
I've also chosen to not display any
lines in the plot area by just
specifying that they should be white and
finally I've chosen to show the data
labels all the time the way that I do
that is using the titles and labels tab
and coming down here to the data markers
option and switching that on to be
always available so that gives us the
look and feel that we have on the
waterfall charts the bar charts and the
pie charts so no gridlines the numbers
always displayed and the flat look on
the colors you'll notice in this report
I'm also taking advantage of the column
selector and I'd recommend that you
become very familiar with this option in
building reports because it allows you
to deliver a whole load of flexibility
in your reports you may have some users
who want to look at this data by gender
but you might have other people who want
to look at it by some of these other
attributes and by using a column
selector it reduces the number of
reports you have to create and maintain
now the other thing we might want to do
in terms of charts is to actually
control the colors based on the data
that's being displayed and one of the
reports in this sample actually uses
that technique so if I just go up to my
favorites and choose the performance
document status summary report I can
show you that example the idea behind
this report is that it allows us to page
through different business units and see
the current status of the performance
process but what I want is irrespective
of how many volumes I'm displaying I
always want for example the completed
status to show in green and the in
progress status to always be this lilac
color if I page through the report you
can see that that's what's happening as
the data gets read
now in order to get the chart to display
in this way what we need to do is we
need to go into the properties of it and
the setting that you need to look at is
the style tab so here we can see the
style and conditional formatting option
if I click on that you'll notice that
I've set up some conditional formatting
and that's based on the performance
document status so here we can see an
example of how I can closely control the
colors being displayed based on the data
that's within the report you may want to
update these for your own values or you
may just want to use this technique in
other reports that you're creating now
moving on from chart displays there are
a couple of things that we've done in
terms of the textural information so
again let me open up another favorite
report which is the career statement
report this is available on the profiles
tab within the dashboards now within the
career statement report what we've been
able to do is to update the definition
so that HTML data displays without all
of the tags and the way that you can do
that is by going to the criteria tab and
updating the column properties so you
can see here my career statement if I go
to the column properties and go to data
format I simply have to override the
default and tell the system to treat
that text as HTML and then the
information is displayed without the
tags being visible now the other thing
you can do on textural reports is to
enable right mouse click to your
end-users on the right mouse click there
can be different pieces of functionality
depending on what options you've enabled
so if I come up here to my analysis
properties button we can see the second
tab is called interactions and I can
check the box at the top to make
available all of the right Mouse and
interactions that are available in the
system or I can switch them on and off
selectively these drive what a user has
available to them when they're looking
at a report and they do a right
mouse-click so here for example I'm back
in my career statement report
and if I do a right mouse-click we can
see that I've got certain columns
available to me to then interact that
with that report in the way that I want
to the final thing I'll show you in
terms of some of the tabular information
is an example where we've replaced the
data with an icon to reflect some kind
of conditional formatting so if I open
up this report here called the languages
report then what we've done within this
report is replaced whether people can
speak or read or write a particular
language with an icon so here we can see
we've done it on the first column which
indicates whether or not there are
native of that particular language or
country the way that we do that is by
again going to the criteria tab and
updating the column properties on that
native column so here we see the column
again we can go to the column properties
this time the conditional format and we
can see here that I've simply defined a
condition that says when native is false
for example then we basically put a Red
Cross and when it's true we'll put a
green tick there are lots of images
available to you to include in your
reports to reflect different conditions
that you might want to highlight so it's
not necessarily just traffic lighting
but you can take advantage of some of
the other images that are available by
bringing them in using this conditional
format tab so that's some examples of
some of the things that we've done in
terms of charts and tables I would
definitely recommend that you explore
all of the reports that are provided to
you to have a look at some of the
different styles of layouts that are
available to you so just to give you a
couple of examples that you might want
to consider here we can see a pipeline
funnel chart so this is a display that
works very well where you're moving
people through a process and we can see
here the different stages of my
succession planning process and how many
people I've got available to me at
different stages in that and again I can
choose to use the play option at the top
now for any of you unsure how to create
that paging option at the top
simply by dragging the item into the
sections of the report and making sure
that you switch on this button called
display as slider as well as a funnel
one of the other displays that you might
want to think about using is called a
trellis chart and this tends to work
very well where you have a high volume
of data to be displayed so here if we go
back to the summary layout on our
competencies that we actually looked at
in the first video then this report is
displaying the total number of employees
that have the different types of
competencies and then the second trellis
is actually showing those same people
but this time split down within a pie
chart by their different levels of
proficiency so both of these are created
using the trellis option we can see here
it's available in the views and we can
use either simple net or advanced again
I would recommend that you have a look
at this display type where you have this
style of requirement for displaying a
high volume of data but in a simple
format that makes it easy for people to
understand that completes our look at
how tables and charts are displayed
within the sample reports to finish off
this particular video we're just going
to take a brief look at some of the
drill reports that are set up within the
environment and also how we utilize
multi-view reports to provide different
displays within the dashboard so just to
pick up that first point you can see
here that within this competencies
report i've actually got four separate
compound layouts now many people don't
know that you can actually create
additional compound layouts so here we
can see an example and if I wanted to
add another one then I simply click on
this create compound layout button and
it will add an additional tab onto the
screen and allow me to drag any of the
content that I've got defined within
this report into this particular layout
so here you can see it's defaulted
adding me the title but I could for
example pick up one of the charts and
drag that in to give me a different
layout from the ones I've already got
but why would I want to do that well
it's very simple if I just go back to my
dashboard view so let me go back to my
sample dashboards and let me pick the
skills tab on this report or on this
dashboard page it looks as if I've got
lots of different reports all grouped
together but in reality all of this
information is coming from a single
report so I only have to define and
maintain a single report what I've done
within the dashboard page if i cannot--
it is I've chosen to display a different
compound view each time I've brought
that report on to the dashboard so here
we can see competencies with highly
skilled summary if I look at this one
and choose show view that one is showing
the summary layout the same report is
displayed below it on the dashboard but
this time if I go and show the view then
it's showing me the breakdown view
similarly as I carry on it's displayed
for a third time but this time it's the
detailed layout view so it basically if
you have data which you want to display
in multiple ways on a dashboard all at
the same time then by far the best way
to do it is to create a single report
create three compound layouts bring it
on to the dashboard page three times and
then define each entry to point to one
of those views and in that way you're
only creating and maintaining a single
report now I mentioned that we were
using drill reports so let's have a look
briefly at how those are set up if I go
into my headcount metrics drill report
this style of report and all of the
metrics on all of the different tabs are
actually using a layout called
performance tiles which can be very
useful where you want to simply display
a single number for your users to have a
look at so here we can see the detail
behind that now the way that the drill
report is defined is by creating the
detail report that you want to navigate
to first so this is at
the headcount metrics drill report that
I want to navigate to what I then need
to do in the high-level summary report
is to define that I want to drill to
that particular place so here if I added
edit my summary report called headcount
metrics then you'll see that on each of
those metrics I've defined a drill path
to that detail report that we were just
looking at so here for example on the
full-time equivalent if I look at the
column properties and then the
interaction tab then here is my drill
defined it's defined as a drill
- oh it's defined as an action link and
it's called drilling - another piece of
bi content so here we can see I'm
navigating to BI content I simply pick
the drill report from the catalogue and
then this report will interact in that
way for the end user so if I come back
to my dashboard then we can see that
information and the drill being
available now just before I do that and
go back to the dashboard one of the
things that's useful to be able to do on
or any of these metrics is to have a
zero displayed instead of a null value
if there's no values to be returned so
here we can see on the data format tab
that I've actually defined a custom data
format the first part before the first
semicolon shows how the data should
display if it's positive the second part
is if it's negative and the third part
is if it's null so that can be a helpful
technique if you're providing dashboard
prompts where people may end up with a
selection that returns zero rows if I go
back and just briefly show you that in
action I'll open up the sample otbi
dashboards one final time and here's my
organization page here are my metrics at
the top and I'm able to then click on a
metric be provided with my drill path
and for example here see the detail
behind those 33 part-time workers so I
know exactly who they are what jobs
they're in what assignments they have
and what their working hours are and as
I mentioned earlier because I've enabled
the right mouse click options I then
have that available to give me
extra flexibility so that completes this
second video hopefully you've got a good
understanding now of how we use the
techniques available within the BI
platform to deliver the charts and
tables that you see in the sample
dashboards you should also understand
how the drill reports have been set up
and some of the options around
displaying a report multiple times on a
dashboard page but pointing to different
views of the data you're now ready to
move on to the third video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
