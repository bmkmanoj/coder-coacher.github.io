individual host with you the host target
information CPU memory and network
utilization we show you where you can
find information about monitoring your
incidents compliance how to check if
there are alert log files and also how
to view targets related to this hosts so
other targets which arm this host and
finally we navigate to the all matrix to
monitor an individual host we first need
to navigate to it we can do that in a
number of different ways this time we go
from targets to all targets and use the
search functionality so as we knew that
one of our hosts begins with a m12 we
can enter it in the search target field
and click enter and now our targets are
limited to those who have m12 in their
name on this target overview page you
not only see the host itself but also
the equivalent agent and other
information another fact that this page
shows is that the OMS and own are our
targets themselves so here I could
access the Oracle management service or
the database instance which hosts the
OEM are but we want to go on and look at
the individual hosts the m12 example.com
on the hosts home page you have a number
of different sections that we were with
you but before we start we click the I
icon the information icon and get an
overview of information like that this
host was 100% available the agent which
it is using the operating system here
you see information about the CPU and
memory usage below it file system and
network usage
you can see for example on the file
systems and networks that the network
write operations were consistently more
than the read operations scrolling
further down you see that on this host
we did not have any incidents or
problems and also you can see that we do
have compliant standards in place and
that the last evaluation date is shown
here scrolling back to the top if this
particular layout does not help you
works title that much you have a chance
to personalize the page by clicking on
this icon and reorganizing the layout as
well as choosing new elements we will
not do that now because it's covered
elsewhere and look instead at the
summary here we see the status
Diagnostics information configuration
information for example the size of our
file system and below it job activity so
you can see that there are no suspended
executions or problematic executions
often you're monitoring tasks will also
have to do with checking the health of
the host and also the applications that
are running on the host to do so we
select host and first look at the log
file alerts if there are any and in our
test system we do not have any so we
return to the host next we want to also
gather information about the targets
that rely on this host so we select host
related targets scroll to the right to
see the information applicable to those
targets information such as the
availability if the host is up or down
alerts that exist policy violations
compliance score which type it is the
last load time
so here you can see the policy
violations and if we had any we could
click on the link to take corrective
actions to resolve these policy
violations similarly with the alerts we
have an alert here and we can click the
link and it navigates to that particular
problem we return to our previous screen
and back again on the related links
screen you can also see that there is a
remove button removing targets from a
host might become necessary when a
monitored target is actually removed
from the host or the management agent or
the hosts are no longer in service
our next tasks is about storage details
we want to review them so we choose host
storage details and on this page you
have information about the overall
utilization the overall utilization
includes over this free space what is
allocated what is used on the right you
see that we have space used by a
database and that it is coming from the
local file system at the bottom part of
the screen there are tapped pages for
more information so for example if you
want to see more details about the
databases you can click the link and see
the current size of the database and how
much of it is being used at the bottom
of the page there are related links to
the storage history now that you've seen
how to navigate to the storage related
information and found the size of our
database the next task is to view the
monitoring details of the metrics as you
can see from the hosts drop-down there
are really many different tasks that you
can do from this point
