Oracle's K splice technology this
tutorial will demonstrate using Oracle's
unbreakable Linux Network web interface
to subscribe to the case splice channel
using the yum utility to install the
case ply subtract software package using
the up track utility to install case
splice kernel updates and also the use
of the case splice web interface for
this tutorial I'm using a virtual
machine in Oracle VM VirtualBox
I have Oracle Linux 7 installed on this
virtual machine I'm currently logged in
as the root user and the system is also
registered with uln if I type in yum
repo list it says the system is
receiving updates from you all in refer
to the uln video tutorial for
demonstration of registering the system
with uln you can also see that this
system is subscribed to two channels the
unbreakable enterprise kernel release 3
for Oracle Linux 7 and also the Oracle
Linux 7 lightest Channel I'm already
logged on to uln I'll open up my browser
window here
and you'll see that I have a system
that's registered it's called uln -
video - demo I'll click on my system
name to manage my subscriptions so down
here in the middle you can see that I'm
currently subscribed to two channels the
Yui K released three for Oracle set
Linux seven and also Oracle Linux 7
latticed I'm going to click manage
subscriptions and you can see that I
have some available channels here and
one of which is K splice so I'm going to
subscribe to this case Fleiss channel by
selecting it here as an available
channel click the arrow key to move it
over to my subscribe channels and click
Save
subscriptions and it will tell you up
here at the top that the subscriptions
are saved so now I'm going to click
channels and this is a list of all my
channels but I just want to see the
channels for Oracle Linux 7 so I'll
select Oracle Linux 7 from the drop-down
box and you can see here that the case
splice channel has 20 packages so I'll
click on this package link
you'll see the available packages for
this channel one of the packages here is
a client for case by subtract reboot
list kernel update service this up track
here version 1.2 20 20 - 0 so this
package needs to be installed and now
that I'm subscribed to this channel I
can install this package just using a
yum command so I'm going to minimize my
browser window
now I'm back to my terminal window and
if I run yum repo list again you'll see
that I now have three channels that I'm
subscribed to the que spice channel is
has been added so I can install that up
track package just by saying yum install
up track
so this goes through a little effort to
find that the dependencies and it's
going to install the up track package
but it's also going to install three
dependent packages so I'm just going to
click yes
so you can see that the package was
installed as well as the three dependent
packages I'm going to open up my web
interface again to the uln
and I also want to point out some other
packages here there's all of these
reboot lists updates for case fly
subtract reboot list kernel update
service so there's all these packages
here for different versions of the
kernel there's some 310 0.1 23 versions
there's some 3.8 13 - 35 versions
there's also some 3.8 13 - 44 versions
I'm gonna minimize this again this
window and run a command you name - are
this tells me the version of the kernel
that I'm currently running and it's 3.8
13 - 44.1 dot 1 and if I open up the web
interface again you'll see that I do
have reboot 'less updates for this
kernel 3.8 dot 13 - 44.1 dot 1
next I'm going to access the K splice
web interface I'm going to open up a new
window on my browser URL is HTTP colon
slash slash up track K splice com so the
oracle case by system status window
appears says this interface is now using
oracle single sign-on accounts for
authentication and i have a single
sign-on account so I'm going to click I
am ready to log in with my Oracle SSO
account so I enter my username and
password
click sign in you'll see on this screen
your email is associated with multiple
case biased accounts this probably won't
be the case for you but I do have a
couple a couple of accounts so I need to
select one and I'm going to select this
one down here and hit submit the system
status window appears the access key is
blacked out for this example but you can
see I have one active machine is out of
date
and this is my machine down here I have
zero installed and there's one update
available auto update is set to no this
is a configuration parameter in the up
track comm file if you set this
directive to yes then case bites will
automatically download and install the
updates using a cron job gives you the
kernel product you ek3 the original
kernel the effective kernel and the
version of the up track package that we
installed there's a couple links down
here installations instructions and
removal instructions you can also set up
groups you can create a group and then
put machines into different groups just
for management purposes so I'm going to
go ahead and click the link to my system
here
and now gives you the status window and
you can see here that there is one
available update and no updates have
been installed some information here on
the Left also hostname IP address last
reported the version whether auto
install is set to be on kernel
information about the kernel those type
of things you can deny a machine from
from receiving updates currently it's
set to allow updates so it says there's
one update available I'm going to bring
up the terminal window clear my screen
here and I'm going to run some up track
commands if I run up track show it says
there were no updates installed and that
corresponds with what's shown here on
the webpage no updates installed if I
run the same command with a - -
available flag it tells me that there is
an available update which again
corresponds with what's on the webpage
to install that update I run up track
upgrade and I can use a - wide to go
ahead and apply that upgrade immediately
tells me it's going to install this
remote denial service CVE and it's
installing it right now it's done it did
not it did not change my effective
kernel I'll show you that my original
kernel version and my effective kernel
version is still the same but that's
because there was only one update if
there was multiple updates that were
applied then the effective kernel would
be would be updated as well if I
minimize this now and if i refresh my
screen now it says there are no updates
available and then one update has been
installed I go back to list my machines
it gives me the same information here my
system is up to date one has been
installed
I open up my terminal window again and
clear my screen if I run the app track
show available
it says they're not available if I write
up check show it shows me that there's
one that one has been installed if I
show the kernel version with the you
name minus R this is the original kernel
version if I run the up track you name -
our command this is the effective kernel
version again there's a lot of updates
applied the effective kernel version
would have incremented as well you can
remove updates if I still attack remove
notice it says please specify an ID or
use the dice - all argument to remove
everything so if I want to remove that
specific update I would have to include
the ID which in this case was C wy 8 4 9
XP
and then you're prompted if you want to
go ahead and discuss say no so this
concludes the demonstration of que
splice it's a method of allowing you to
apply updates to kernel without having
to reboot thank you for taking the time
