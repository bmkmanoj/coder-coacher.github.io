in Amazon Web Services that allows users
to pipe cloud trail log data from one
account to another account s3 bucket
there are many reasons why you'd want to
set up centralized logging in your
environment from an information security
perspective you may want to limit access
to the logs from the users who created
them in this walkthrough you'll set a
cross account logging between two AWS
accounts and create a cross account role
in this example the name of the account
that sending the logs will be called
source and the account that's receiving
the cloud trail logs into its s3 bucket
will be called target at this point in
the configuration it's assumed that the
cloud trail an s3 bucket on the target
account are already enabled
let's first configure the AWS target
account for this start two different
browsers this is required because AWS
sessions cannot overlap so you cannot
navigate between two AWS accounts in the
same browser even on multiple tabs here
we are using Chrome for the target
account and Firefox for the source
account in browser one open the AWS
management console for the target
account the one that receives Cloud
trail logs in browser to open the AWS
management console for the source
account this is the account that sends
its cloud trail logs to the target
account let's start with a target
account this account is configured first
because the policy on the s3 bucket must
be modified to allow the sauce account
to write to it when you create the cloud
trail in the source account you'll have
to name the s3 bucket unless the policy
has been modified the Cloud trail
creation process in the source account
will not recognize this s3 bucket in the
target account and will therefore fail
the target accounts s3 bucket will need
to have a policy statement to allow the
source account Cloud trail service to
put its log data into it
from services in the target account
navigate to storage and select s3 when
you select the bucket
navigate to permissions
and then book it policy here you'll see
the policy make a copy of this existing
policy in case you need to revert to a
working copy of the policy later look
for the policy statement in the action
of s3 put object below that you'll see a
resource statement with the targets
accounts account number you'll need to
add an additional resource statement to
include the source accounts number save
it and if there are any syntax errors
AWS will state that the policy contains
invalid JSON if this happens try and
find the error or cancel your changes
and restart or revert to the original
policy you copied earlier for every
other AWS account you'll repeat this
process of copying and pasting
additional AR n statements and updating
the account number save after each one
to ensure that no syntax errors exist
now that the target accounts s3 bucket
has the correct policy statement to
allow the source account to send the
cloud trail logs across account role
needs to be created for the target
account Oracle Cosby cloud service
relies on each AWS account to be able to
read its own cloud trail logs to do this
each source account must assume the
cross account role to receive the
correct entitlements to read the s3
bucket navigate back to services and
under security identity in compliance
select I am from roles create a new role
and select another AWS account
this allows I am users or roles you own
to assume this cross account role
assuming the cross account role grants
the appropriate entitlements to the I am
user or role in order to read the s3
bucket enter the source accounts account
number then navigate to the next screen
from where you can assign the
permissions select the s3 read-only
access policy
give the roller name and then create it
select the role you just created in
rolls open the trust relationship screen
this is the control that AWS uses to
ensure only recognized source account
users and roles can assume this role on
the target account now edit the trust
relationship you can see that the
principal is set for the source account
and the access is route to a dear to the
information security policy of least
privileged access you'll want to change
this to the AR n of the I am role in the
source account that will be used to
monitor the source AWS account edit it
in the same way as you did for the
policy on the s3 bucket for the source
account instead of adding a resource
statement which is what you're accessing
you'll need to add a principal statement
which is who is accessing the resource
for each source account you will need to
add a line remember to use square
brackets and commas appropriately then
update the trust policy
now the target account configuration is
complete it's time to configure the
source account login to your source
AWS console to enable cloud trail
navigate to services and under
management tools select cloud trail give
the cloud trail a name notice by default
it's enabled for all regions and is
capturing all events select no for
create a new s3 bucket in the s3 bucket
field enter the name of the target
accounts s3 bucket and select the name
of the Bukit s3 bucket names are
globally unique and it is important to
be exact
if AWS throws the error book it doesn't
exist choose a different bucket this
means the policy on the targets s3
bucket is incorrect so you would need to
go back to the target s3 buckets policy
to ensure it is configured correctly if
you used a log file prefix to change the
default location of the cloud trail logs
make sure the policy AR n has the right
path in the target accounts s3 bucket
policy create the cloud trail this will
take you to the cloud trail service you
will see the cloud trail you just
created and the name of the s3 bucket
its piping is logs to choosing the cloud
trail name will take you into the
configurations page where you can
validate the settings of the cloud trail
here you can edit the configurations
disable the cloud trail or delete it
altogether
congratulations you've configured cross
account logging thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
