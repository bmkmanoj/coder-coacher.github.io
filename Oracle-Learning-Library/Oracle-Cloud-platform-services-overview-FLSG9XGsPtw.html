platform services offered by Oracle
cloud first let's understand what is
platform as a service or pass pass
solutions are developed in platforms in
which the development tool itself
resides in the cloud and is accessed
using a browser with bass developers can
build web applications without having to
install any software on their computer
and then deploy those applications
without any specialized systems
administration skills Oracle cloud
currently provides two past offerings
Oracle database cloud service and Oracle
Java cloud service let's learn a little
bit about these services the database
cloud service is built an Oracle
database technology running on the
Oracle Exadata machine the database
cloud service has four main components
Oracle database 11g r2 Enterprise
Edition Oracle application Express which
is used to create and deploy all
varieties of applications in a
browser-based environment restful web
services which allow access to the data
in your database cloud service through
simple you are eyes packaged
applications which is a set of business
productivity applications that are
installed with just a few clicks see the
video titled install a packaged
application on the Oracle cloud videos
youtube channel you can provision a
complete database cloud service
environment in a few minutes and
immediately start to be productive the
database cloud service includes simple
administrative tools that allow you to
monitor usage and add and drop user
access now let's talk about our next
platform service Oracle Java cloud
service Oracle Java cloud service
reduces the complexity associated with
the deployment and maintenance of
enterprise Java applications it enables
you to create Java cloud service
instances quickly you can deploy your
applications to a service instance then
secure and manage them without worrying
about the underlying infrastructure for
more information see the video titled
deploy an application to Oracle Java
cloud service on the Oracle cloud videos
youtube channel once you activate the
Java cloud server
and download the Java SDK you can
prepare applications for deployment to
the service access applications deployed
on the service and monitor and manage
the service using the Java cloud service
control so that was an overview of
Oracle cloud platform services for more
Oracle cloud videos see the Oracle cloud
videos youtube channel for more
