session this Java robotics and
automation using is the general purpose
robotics and automation software
platform I've been here come in the job
us for a while and I know in 2006 we had
like one of our autonomous ground
vehicles here and and over the years
we've had other weird creations and this
year and a session that I'm giving
tomorrow I actually brought a smaller
bot that that is actually more
programmable bye bye bye you know most
of us because it's very difficult to
procure a of a car and retrofitted and
not to mention the dangers so so this
talk is going to focus about the broad
brush of applications that are possible
including things that that that we can
do is sort of tinker's as well as you
know for commercial purposes so the
first part of this i'm going to talk
about the robotics and automation market
first of all i know this is kind of like
a this was kind of tagged as a business
/ architect session how many of you ever
actually are developers developing day
to day ok so about half and then the
rest i assume architect business side of
things so i will have some some sort of
pseudo code in here but i have a session
tomorrow which is all code basically and
we've got got a little robot here that
God willing we'll we'll run around and
and do things appropriately so I'm going
to talk a little bit about the robotics
market so i'll talk about that just very
quickly talk about java and this
complementary solution to using java for
building robotics and automation
applications faster and talk about how
some of this has been vetted with some
real world examples that i'll show you
so we'll go through the market Java's
use is building blocks i'll talk a
little bit about target environments
hardware
our devices I oh and some at the end
we'll talk a little bit about benefits
and and some of the pros and cons so
it's always great to have these hockey
stick charts that show what what these
are put together by marketing people
after years of intense study and they
always tend to come up with the same
picture which is this hockey stick curve
which just shows explosive growth but I
actually tend to believe this these are
different outlooks for the robotics and
automation market primarily robotics
over the next over the next you know 10
15 years or so from different groups
this was from I believe the you a UN
group that projects that the global
market for robotics personal and service
robotics which is actually just a small
portion of robotics is going to be at 51
billion by 2025 this group over here
from the Japan robotics Association
talks about the total this doesn't
include defense and that number but 66
billion in 2025 and so you see some of
these other projections and and none of
these really include defense-related
robotics which as we know is is also an
area where there's they're spending a
lot of money so this is a slide that I
sometimes use to make the analogy
between popular robotics and popular
computing and you know when back in sort
of the 70s when when you know wrote
computers were first starting to enter
the home you know we went from these
large-scale mainframes that only in
industrial and organizations or
researching organizations could afford
and then you know the 70s we have
popular computing and now you know we
have computers in the home and the
workplace in business and it's very
pervasive and you can kind of see the
same analogy
happening really right about now now-ish
you're seeing more consumer or popular
grade robotics you know in the form of
low-cost consumer grade robot vacuum
cleaners lawn mowers i robot has done a
lot in that space so that robotics is
sort of making the jump from only from
the world where only the large
industrial and research organizations
could afford to you filled robots to
something that's more affordable for for
consumer or popular use and that's do
too many things at convergence of
process you know processor speeds it's
easier to to put you know have more run
on a robot now that whereas previously
it had to run on a mainframe the
algorithms and and you know memory
storage and all those Moore's Law
artifacts have made this made this
viable so but there's still some gaps
that you know and it's still a complex
problem and and when you look at a
robotics application you've got
different types of sensors these are a
lot laser sensors here and myself a
little lead here we've got GPS sensors
that's an antenna on the right stereo
cameras different types of actuators
different types of embedded processors
program logic controllers user
interfaces and there's just this gap
between you have this application that
you want to build and knowing how to
field it and so you've got a lot of
these stovepipe architectures where
people will develop everything from the
ground up for their application and then
but that doesn't translate necessarily
to the next application and so you've
got all these different layers you've
got you know communications but with
with these devices you have to send
information maybe make some measurements
and analysis use that
to control and actuate motors spin
wheels turn steering wheels and that
sort of higher levels create these you
know sequences of actions and that you
know combining those into four flick in
the mobile robot space maneuvers a
maneuver is a sequence of actions like a
self parking maneuver and then
coordinating these behaviors how do you
you know you don't to be self parking
when you're got forward collision
avoidance on the highway and other some
prioritization scheme and and so there's
coordinating all this and and then
creating what is ultimately your
application so there's a big gap in and
going from this these devices to an
actual application and there's and
there's a wide target space you've got
all kinds of mobility platforms is it
skid steer is it Ackermann steering
based is a two wheel for we all six
wheel mote I directional all kinds of
sensors light our radar different types
of actuation methodologies DC motor
stepper motors servos control algorithms
I oh you know analog and digital i/o
processors you know our you're running
on an armed environment there you're
running in a microcontroller can you run
into microcontroller with Java operating
environments applications and then
there's also another problem with a lot
of the times because it's sort of on
this cusp of crossing the chasm from the
research and high high expense world to
the more affordable consumer world I
think you see you still see a lot of
specialized and proprietary solutions in
terms of hardware on Io and certainly
software and portability so there's a
lot of reinvention people are building
building from scratch the stovepipe
architectures that I talked about and
it's a complex problem I mean that
there's limited tools support you know
there's a certain level of capability
required for you know what is slam you
know simultaneous localization and and
and mapping you know what is that and
you know that's not necessarily taught
it's not something you pick up while
while reading you know a trade magazine
/ say so so there's there's a lot of a
lot of hurdles to hurdle so this you
know about um 2001 I started to work on
a platform to address some of these gaps
and taking this building block solution
approach where we want to use a high
level object-oriented programming
language some of the languages that have
been used in the you know if you were in
the 80s or 90s reading about robotics
there were still some proprietary or
some some custom non-standard
programming practices and languages
being used and so not necessarily in
every case you know leveraging available
object-oriented languages I think it's
very important to have a general-purpose
programming language for a lot of
different reasons one to harness
existing knowledge if you use a language
like Java for example there's a large
community of Java developers a large
community of third-party both open
source and commercial source support and
and to have a solution that can also
have higher level in addition to the
programming language there's a need for
higher level libraries to encapsulate
common things that you do across these
robotics applications be they are based
ground-based or just within sort of
ground-based vehicles there's common
libraries that are that come in handy so
that's the building block approach it
also needs to tailor itself for
different operating hardware and
operating environments be independent
and scalable and and and leverage the
improv I'd you've with the ability to
talk to these very these various devices
that are out there are different lasers
and and sensors or different types of
sensors so Java as the programming
language in terms of why this is good
some of the typical responses for why
Java apply here as they apply everywhere
its high level and object oriented and
that gets you all the benefits that you
know a rehashed it's it's it's it's
simple to use its general purpose common
commonly the most cops still the most
commonly used programming language
according to at least one non Oracle
report that I saw so so I think it's
still it's it's out there there other
languages that have gained popularity
but it's still widely widely popular and
again wealth available expertise tools
and portability across operating
environments out of them out of the gate
so here's where we look at where max
closes a gap if you will you've got an
application you know you want to make a
robot go from point A to point B well if
you just take the Java libraries as they
are there's nothing in there that's
going to let you do that per se so you
have there's a bunch of code that has to
be written and and you know we've got
common-sense plan act code sort of at
this level we've got specific drivers to
now plug in kind of like a printer
driver on the internet you've got a
laser driver or our radar driver or some
other type of way to tie in a device and
then higher level frameworks that might
be suitable for but aren't general
purpose across all robotics applications
but our general purpose across a subset
like unmanned ground vehicles you know
so that you wouldn't necessarily have
that at the common level here because
you know that these would be things that
don't apply to unmanned air vehicles or
what have you or even small indoor
robots so this is a crazy slide that I'm
going to just get past because it's very
there's a lot here but but this is this
is kind of max also in a nutshell we've
got the architecture there's a java
virtual machine or operating systems
hardware platform we runs a top java
we've got general-purpose building
blocks there's this hardware abstraction
layer where we you know so that we can
you know talk to different types of
sensors without changing application
code its comprehensively configurable
and that just about all the objects can
be can be made to be configurable
objects it is container base we run it
in a container very lightweight
container but you also can run it as a
standard you know POJO you know type
programming model where you're just
making calls on to these reusable these
reusable objects if you have a question
or yeah that's a very good question and
that might be a good segue for this next
slide because actually you do have no
okay so you do meet there is I do talk
about profiles here there is it there is
a there's a common set of libraries that
are useful across all platforms but it
represents the lowest common denominator
and you can run in like cldc Java ME
environments you can run an SE
environments and you can run in some of
the real-time environments so Java RTS
or RTS j and those are profiles of it
but they use the common common libraries
so i just threw this in recently because
i thought it was I guess a good way to
drive home the pros and cons of building
blocks but this may be may be tedious
but so basically without building blocks
what are you doing you're writing code
that's going to send first you got to
load your rxtx or java calm if you can
find it library to be able to write some
write a read a command from a serial
port because you've got a lot of devices
that still that you still talk to
oversee reports a lot of these lasers
and GPS devices and a lot of serial port
stuff in the robot world so and then
you're going to write code the pole and
maybe wait for a response read a header
check the response header for integrity
you're basically packet izing and
parsing this thing then you're going to
read maybe an analog voltage value from
it if this sensor represents a a like an
infrared sensor that tells you the
distance to something you're going to do
some conversions you're going to you
might map it to some some voltage value
because you've got this raw data value
you're going to manage reading and use
and use of this now as it's a it's a say
it's telling you this current steering
angle on this example and you're going
to get the difference between the
desired in the actual steering angle and
then turn a steering wheel in this
example based on this difference so with
building blocks you know while in a
control loop you're simply invoking
something called you know steering
control action which you know would be a
something and say the maxi GV framework
library so you you register your sensor
you register your your controller you
tunes tweak some parameters and then and
then you know you don't have to write
this tedious control loop and the
parsing logic you can focus on okay out
of the gate i'm i'm turning a steering
wheel on an acronym based robot which
may be a car it may be a small two wheel
or four wheeled device with steerable
steering wheels or you can still roll
your own control algorithm you could
just read the steering angle from the
sensor this is what this you know with
the what the control module would do
read the steering angle from a sensor
compute the difference between the
actual and the desired and then invoke a
left or right operation on it based on
that so that's an example of how you
save time with using building blocks so
this is just rehashing the answer to
your question we've got max common which
is lowest common denominator across
profiles ninety percent of code in a
typical application may reside in there
and then we've got some
we've got max standard for running on SC
real time job RTS at RTS J and Max micro
for Java ME and any available targets
you may have some specific targets
because there's a lot of none there's
some you know non-standard things that
are still in that space that you need to
commonly do so we've got wrappers around
those common things like like talking to
analog inputs for example Java ME
doesn't have an analog input class or
something that with an adapter model so
we've got that and we adapt to you know
the agile microprocessor which is if
you've heard of that that's a low level
controller or the fidgets boards if
you've heard of those so and this is the
target embedded hardware that we
typically deal with of course x86
increasingly arm I just mentioned agile
they have a really nice java it's
actually a JVM in hardware little
microcontroller there's all kinds of
discrete i/o analog and digital inputs
and outputs relays periodic post inputs
and outputs and you know counters from
from wheel encoders pulse width
modulator all sing you know the control
of a motor and then all kinds of i/o
computing i/o types like rs-232 it's
very popular Ethernet can USB I to see
these are all things that need to talk
to Ethernet of course is embedded in
Java so you've got those libraries
readily available but but Java Java
serial ports for example is outside of
the scope of Java you know how you know
can certainly the industrial Ethernet so
these are all libraries that have to be
created outside of the standard Java
platform so and then target operating
environments we typically you know linux
windows and mac side it should be mac OS
x 44 development most commonly we've run
on solaris quite a bit
there's a real time operating
environments like linux solaris qnx and
vxworks and a bevy of what i call some
oddball things that just come our way
that can cause misery because we have
you know it's a customer required
platform and we've got to find a JVM
vendor who will support it and get them
to pay a lot of money or something so
did this this is where we get into the
the hard part 2 of Java same thing with
microcontrollers I mean you've got a big
robotics community out there that likes
to take an Arduino which is a twenty to
forty dollar microcontroller and and and
within a few hours or a day they're up
and running able to do something well we
should be able to do that in the Java
world java was designed to be to be to
span these different these different
levels and there are some some there's
the some control microcontrollers like
from this company agile there's some
linux based not really microcontrollers
but embedded systems from companies like
packed ron and they have an arm based
system and in the fitness group fidgets
and then again a bunch of oddball things
in the space that you have to deal with
so this is where we spend a lot of time
you know just trying to try to map
sometimes our you know what we'll use
what what standard platforms we can use
but depending on certain requirements
you know we end up having to spend extra
time working with vendors to to enable
to support these other real-time and
micro level environments and that's
that's where there's some some heartache
and then some driver examples you know
lidar lasers that emit beams and tell
you the range to where things are very
popular radar GPS inertial nav cameras
RFID these are all common common types
of sensors that we support with drivers
and then we've done some frameworks a
couple of frameworks you know there's
many more that could be done but we've
happen to done a lot of detection of
measurement where we're detecting
vehicles a couple years ago we were here
we're showing you without our project
with the Pennsylvania Turnpike we're
detecting and measuring vehicles using
sensors people in this max UGV that we
used in the darpa grand challenges for
for unmanned ground vehicle or in this
case autonomous ground vehicle controls
so there are some common libraries there
so these slides will be available i have
like 50 slides on i'm not going to be
able to go through all of them but i'll
give you an example here I think this is
an interesting one of okay here's here's
what you have to do without a framework
so for a self navigation so you're going
to read a current GPS position from a
sensor and then you're going to read the
next desired position that you're
supposed to go to from some route plan
and then you're going to compute the
desired direction that you want to go
based on the difference between the
between where you're currently going and
what women want I mean I'm jumping ahead
here you're going to compute the desired
direction from the current desired GPS
point so there's the desired direction
you're down there on your down here and
you want to go straight up and then you
want to read your current heading from
your inertial nav system and it's
telling you you're going 10 degrees west
of north so you're going to compute this
heading distance you're going to the
difference from a current desired
direction you're going to read the
current steering angle of your steering
wheel in your car and you're going to
compute the steering difference the
difference between your current steering
angle and where you want to go and you
get a heading difference then you're
going to turn the steering wheel left or
right based on on this difference and
you're not going to gun it all the way
left or gunner on the right you're going
to put it into a little control loop so
it does it smoothly so it gets to that
point in time but so with a framework
for example just by config
duration files we associate a position
sensor with our nav controls object a
route plan with it a heading sensor with
it a steering sensor with it and
steering actuator with it and in a
control loop you know which is also
configured we it simply invokes this nav
control action so you can have sort of
just using configuration files some self
navigation for an application quickly
and again focus on the big things like
for the urban grand challenge and urban
challenge we didn't want to spend a lot
of time on on you know figuring out
which way to turn the steering wheel we
wanted to try to get towards the complex
things like detecting lines in the road
and and or you know detection of
obstacles and and and in inducing
maneuvers that that that enable the
robot to handle these ret wide variety
of situations that the bot would
encounter so these are kind of some of
the building block benefits right you've
got rapid robotics and automation
development more rapid device immobility
integration rapid higher-level
development rapid and scalable hardware
integration across different platforms
and and I'll talk a little bit about
this turns the end of the talk but you
know this platforms we've been working
with it for 12 years and so we wanted to
prove that it scales from complex to
simple applications and vice versa and
wanting to run in a wide range of
environments so now I'm going to just go
through a couple of these real-world
examples first was the 2005 DARPA Grand
Challenge is everybody has anybody not
heard of it or so it's I guess well you
know well known there with that that was
our our entry Tommy a silver egg shaped
doom buggy for sixty thousand dollars we
built Tommy is probably ten
man months of software development time
so we were on a we were on a tight
budget so we you know we were competing
with with you know excellent teams and
but you know certainly some teams have
had many resources but so we had to take
a different approach of bull and really
the idea behind us getting involved was
this show hey we can use this platform
to help us develop a complex application
like this faster because we're not
developing a lot of stuff from scratch
so you know we did the onboard controls
the steering the throttle brake and
shift the GPS and inertial nav based
navigation and we used lidar and radar
for for obstacle detection and then
using it you know we had diffuse the
data from a couple different lasers and
detect positive obstacles like other
cars or negative obstacles like cliffs
for example and in walls and grass so
that the car wouldn't just sort of
stopped because there's some high grass
like how do you do that that that was a
bummer it got stuck on a hey Bill I mean
a lot of people did but you know these
are the kinds of things that that you
learn so that was one application a lot
of fun well no it wasn't it was horrible
now it was fun it was um it was a bit
good time I think there's a video oh
yeah so anyway this was Tommy jr.
fielded for the 2005 urban challenge
this was a long-range longer long-range
high-speed agv city driving challenge so
you're driving in a in a mock city
amongst other cars you have to detect
now the speed in the direction of these
other with the Grand Challenge
everything was static the obstacles
didn't move and the urban challenge
things move so you had to detect not
only that they're there but where
they're going and how fast they're going
because you may have to follow behind
them or yield to them at an intersection
and know that they got there first and
know that they're moving forward to go
into the intersection so there's a bunch
of different maneuvers you know passing
vehicles parking rerouting u-turns
merging in traffic and and in creating
an optimal route plan because you're
given it was kind of like a little maze
you've got here's here's the map of the
city and here the checkpoint that you
got to get to and here you are now
figure out your your route and then they
block your route along the way this was
actually at javaone when it was in
follow me mode in 2008 maybe so with
James Gosling's keynote and that was a
lot of fun we idle it low so that in
case something went wrong I'm not
talking about safety but safety is
implied in all of this always have a
nice top button ready link bolt so I've
had the pleasure to work with new young
rock legend he's got a took a 59 lincoln
continental turns it into an
extended-range electric vehicle we
started to work with him to drop in some
controls for gathering telemetry data
and and broadcasting out to the web and
as he saw how quickly we could do things
in Java like literally we'd go to the
shop and have stuff up and running
quickly he's he got he started to get
interested in finding out more about
what could be done and so once once he
found out that we could do autonomous
vehicles he totally glommed onto that
and says yes we I'd that my car needs to
be autonomous so so we are commissioned
actually and sponsored by Oracle to to
make that autonomous and we've done a
lot of work on that the car
unfortunately had a fire about to eat
was involved in a fire two years ago and
so it's being it's been rebuilt and that
part is taking a lot longer so but we
are in the
with autonomy there's some other things
we you know we had a polaris ranger this
was a tele application to very
compressed schedule you know six months
we had to get an eight get this atv
drop-in actuators there's a little box
on the back on the website our website i
think you can see it's like a little
Jack in the Box there's like this
scissor lift that comes up we were never
told what would be on that scissor lift
we just assumed it was a giant you know
bunny or something but it probably
wasn't and but but it but you know we
did make this six-wheeler autonomous
fairly quickly leveraging the same
libraries and that we had used for the
Grand Challenge so then there were some
other examples an autonomous harvester
we took a go-kart modified that now
these are some of the smaller robots and
that we've been working with and I'm
actually writing a book about what I'm
trying to we're going to we're open
sourcing max so that we can get it out
there let everybody use it as they wish
and and modify it as they see fit and so
I've been I've been writing this book
for the last three years because it's
I've been busy with other things but
these these are the fight these are sort
of five of the robots that we're going
to feature in the book and i'm going to
i brought rumbles here which is I think
the coolest of the five to the
conference and i'll be talking about him
tomorrow and but the but the idea here
is to take the same application put
similar sensors but lower this is a
fifty-dollar mobility platform this is
200 200 1500 5000 so we'll be putting a
look you know Raspberry Pi you know a
little better processor you know the
pact Ron Jade board you know will show
scale in terms of all the different
things and but it would be the same
you'll see that the same application
runs all five with you know just
tweaking of configuration
both so there's been some other things
that we've done in terms of you know
kits and some of this is just a really
show okay what's you know jot that you
can actually use Java to earn money in
robotics and automation now as well you
know they're not a lot of new young link
bolt cars out there to work on there you
know and they're not a lot of their no
more DARPA Grand Challenges right so
those are showcased projects so and
that's fun stuff and there's not a lot
of not a lot of money and selling you
know fifty dollar hobby BOTS so you know
how do you know how you know but there's
still a real use for Java now in
commercial automation applications and
these are just some examples we
developed for these lasers a software
developers kit that makes it easy for
the people who want to write
applications using this laser which is
hard to talk to and make sense of it to
give them this higher level API and to
talk to the different lasers you know a
lot of companies got locked into older
versions of this laser and then you know
the same application code that talks to
the older version can run now with the
newer version because all that
translation is handled underneath the
hood you're getting these points objects
as opposed to you know laser specific
data a fusion we've done some work using
data from GPS with with lidar we've done
a lot of light our work there's been a
lot of commercial work in that area and
so for example what what we do is is we
call max geo range you've got these
lasers say on something either a moving
vehicle or in this lower right-hand
corners case an actual helicopter and
you've got GPS and inertial nav and as
the thing the car or the or the air
vehicle is moving we actually have this
air vehicle here at javaone one year or
two 2007 maybe
and as it's moving the there's an
autonomous video there we are we are
mapping each laser point to a GPS point
on earth and that was just showing a
gimbal as well where we could also map
you know know know where the angle of
the laser is because basically this
laser has a sweep like this inside and
so when you move it it's sweeping up
like this and you're getting this
three-dimensional point cloud it's kind
of like a very expensive Kinect sensor
but you know industrial grade and and
commonly used a lot of commercial apps
so there's another video oh yeah this is
just showing putting some some laser on
a car and scanning other vehicles we
were doing this before Google did Street
View so and with what the mapping
mapping company and it's you know it's
useful these are some these are things
that that aren't as sexy per se as you
know link fold or or a grand challenge
but but they there's there's real
commercial demand a need for this so
vehicle measurement we've been we've
been pretty deep in this there you know
the question is how to use lidar
overhead these these on these open toll
roads you've got these in ground loops
that are detecting cars so laser is much
better at detecting vehicles then these
in ground loops much more reliable and
it's more maintainable you don't have to
dig up the pavement you can go up and
pop a laser off and replace it and and
and so there's a big push
internationally but also here in the
states to towards the slide our based
vehicle measurement and so we've
developed a framework for it and we've
actually fielded this too on the
Pennsylvania Turnpike and we were here
in 2010 with a demo of that but
basically you know as vehicles or travel
underneath these gantries where we're
detecting a vehicle separating them if
it's a trail trailered vehicle we know
it's a that's one big vehicle we're
doing environmental noise filtering
because its nose and it rains and you've
got to get rid of those points we can
calculate the speed of these vehicles
more accurately than anything else
here's an example of some noise
filtering we're not known for our video
skills but this just shows of sort of
before and after and and you can see you
know how that could cause problems
because we're also using this to trigger
cameras to tell them when to take
pictures of license plates and so if you
get some spurious noise you're going to
get you know a wrong trigger and it's
also used from way emotion we're telling
them when these vehicles are on these
scales that they've gotten the ground
for these tractor trailers so that these
tractor trailers can be traveling at you
know highway speeds in this open tolling
environment and get weighed as they're
traveling without pulling over and
waiting in line because we say you're k
you've the trail out the tractor trailer
is on on the scale during this time
period and so they just calculate the
the weights that they get from the
different axles and away they go so
there's a big demand for this and we've
been doing a lot of work in that space
we does something similar with product
measurement where we're measuring here's
a really poor quality video but I'm
embarrassed even show up but this just
gives you an idea but we're measuring a
box here but but we've actually done
this in environments where we're we're
using the lasers to to measure products
the area volume like alpaca alberta
pacific up in canada had an application
where there wanted to measure woodchip
volumes and and so and so that's it's
another example use and we've also been
heavily involved with people detection
using lasers to detect people and
breaches for security applications we
were here last year with a talk on that
where we also can can you can we can
detect when someone's in a zone and if
they came through a gate we're wearing
an rfid tag we say okay they're allowed
if someone else comes into the zone and
was not wearing an rfid tag we know that
they're unauthorized so this is useful
in retail applications among others so
right now I'm just on the tail end last
couple slides here just close up with
some some comments so these are some of
the so there's a lot of advantages
clearly but some of the some of the
pitfalls are as we talked about a little
bit that well code written for Java SC
is not easily portable to the micro
level so you know cldc for example you
know we have developers here like well
why don't you just use an iterator you
know why using enumeration well because
iterators barn in cldc 11 so so and why
don't you use you know this you know
generics or something and and so i know
that there are some translators to get
you from java five-level cement syntax
to and semantics to this lower common
denominator but we try to keep the mic
the carmax common common so that it can
run in these different environments so
that's a pitfall it's very limited Mike
true microcontroller support what's a
Mike you know microcontroller like an
Arduino or a itachi microcontroller that
the use and bots are like some of the
microcontrollers that they use in engine
control units and automobiles and
there's there is limited real-time
support there is support but you know so
there is support for all this but it's
just more limited than in other other
fields and that's why those fields tend
to use you know Cee and other other
languages but I think what we've done
over the years is show that you can't
that you still can do it is possible
we've done real time job applications
and we've done microcontroller based
java applications
and of course there's always been this
lack of these higher level libraries
because it makes it tedious so we've
tried to overcome this with with by
building by taking this building block
approach leveraging this lowest common
then I made our platform with these
different profiles and also creating
some to make it useful if it's just a
platform of platforms like a plot it's
like buying a video console without any
cartridges or anything so you know we
have to create some cartridges drivers
and frameworks to make it to make it
useful for for common things but it but
it's it's open so that you know people
can write their own drivers and do their
own things with it so you know the
overall benefits are there's
dramatically fewer lines of code to
write I think if you come to my session
tomorrow I'll show you the code and
you'll see how little code can be
written and how you can also dive in and
if you've you know and and write your
own custom modules we you know we're
leveraging tested and configurable code
and it allows us when we're writing
applications and to focus on application
logic and algorithms like we did for the
Grand Challenge versus low level stuff
so all the benefits for higher level
right to key you know time to market
lower total cost development and all the
other things that you want to tell your
management so that you can get to play
with robots using Java so the path
forward I mean we want to make we are
making max available for open-source use
the reason why we haven't well I'll talk
about that but the we want to also
continue to partner with and support
device and microcontroller processor and
hardware suppliers because we think
there needs to be more of those I'm
partner with the end support real-time
and micro JVM vendors because we think
there needs to be
more of that so for 12 years you know
we've designed this with complex and
commercial real world applications in my
night I came from me a world of enter
you know I was well actually I used to
do some autonomy in the railway but
between that time and this time you know
time when I got involved with this
endeavor I worked in the enterprise java
space and I so I got exposure to a lot
of open source and some open source as
they call it right so so the so I didn't
really want to I wanted there was a
desire to prove that it's scalable and
commercial first versus models of
fielding something pedagogic and simple
and then you get you get to use it and
then you realize that there's a long
haul or some brick walls in some cases
impossible to go from that hobbyist
grade thing to something commercial or
something real you know that that
someone's going to buy and this is
especially important for robotics
because there's mission criticality here
this isn't this isn't these aren't
websites that if something goes wrong
you know you may lose revenue and that's
terrible but you know in some cases with
robotics you you know you may lose limbs
or or you know lose equipment or you
know cause other damage so there's a big
safety concern here so I want wanted to
spend time on on on proving this first
and and and before we went ahead and
just sort of threw it out there and so
but you know now is the time we're
trying you know we are we have resource
limitations but we're trying to get it
out there as soon as possible an open
source form you know i'm writing this
book we're going to share and we want to
evolve this platform and you know like
to all c java pervasive in this and
what's going to be an emerging market we
think so oh that didn't line up right
but
how did that happen so yeah there was a
web link maybe I didn't save but I think
its Manning com / / own that that's the
early access edition of the book they
have all these sort of old the themes on
their books have all these old like
characters from the 1500s and 1600s so
they let they gave us a waiver and they
used that thing which I don't I don't
know if what it is really it just looks
like a robot but there's more
information like I said I have a session
tomorrow at eight eight o'clock or 830
something like that robot real world
robot programming so that's um that's it
so I guess we have some time for
questions
when even
estimate for when they open source stuff
might be
it's uh I we were really trying to have
it by the end of this really trying to
have it by now it's looking more like
realistically the first part of next
year just because we you know it's just
I mean it's we can put it out there but
you know we've got to document things
and it's a couple more things and and
and not make it ms not making a
miserable experience I mean we'd be
happy to just put it out there but and I
that was kind of my attitude like well
hey let's just put it out there and then
we'll tell people are going to document
some other parts of it will give some
examples now but you know we have guys
the company think that that's a bad idea
and they know better than me about open
source so I don't know what do you think
should we just put to good question so
we just put put it out there and let
people download it and with like a
warning you know this may burn your eyes
alendar alpha you know I I would rather
just put it out there but and put with
some sample code but then you would only
be able to run those specific samples
with you know because they would be
known to work and then but getting
outside of that you know but I figure a
forum and putting it out there I don't
know any thoughts on that is it good
better to make a first impression but
been 12 years
any question yes
Fortran do we have any support for in
traditional industrial robots we have we
have not worked with we did some work
with GE fanuc a while ago and some of
their industrial arms but a lot of what
we've done has been focused a lot of the
applications have been focused on mobile
robots however all of the libraries in
here are so we haven't built very many
examples we had one project a while ago
and it was preliminary and but it's a
you know we've got transformations and
and things to do like you know
coordinate arm transformations and and
you know you're you can control
individual actuators so it you could
certainly control it would certainly
serve as a basis for that but we don't
have some of the problem that probably
that would be more of a framework
another framework on top of this but um
but but there's none o the sensing and
the controls all apply to the kinds of
things that are on those industrial
robots yes
p SJ there you have
well we worked with Java RTS for a while
and we were RTS licensee and and that is
right now sort of in limbo think in
terms of its support so we have you know
work with some other you know like for
example we had to run on qnx for
customer and so there's both a kiss and
a tee go they both have jvms that run on
qnx but there's like not multi-core
support for example force up for some
things or you know there's just things
that aren't aren't fully fleshed out but
but there's a boat boat so we are
working with them on that and that
that's that's fine we're working with
akos quite a bit and in their great and
and but it's it's it's it's a very small
sort of space and would love to see java
RTS sort of come back into the into the
fold so thought that was a great you
know we had tremendous success using it
and so and it's good to have more more
more more competition out there but a
kisses is done a very good job and and
and you know we so we're happy with with
all the all the different you know with
what with what's there we just think
that you know there needs to be more
it's not like the level of support that
there is for java SE for example but you
know everybody who is supporting it is
incredibly and talented smart and and
works very hard so there is that you've
got just this you know high quality
support but but you know limited limited
resources and bandwidth yes
I'm going to support um this is so the
question is how much algorithm level
support do we have like do you have do
we have machine learning this is this
platform is more you know it's more of a
platform for some of the lower level
tedious stuff right we do have some base
like in max ugv for example which is a
framework we have what we have this
maneuver framework which which is kind
of this rule based rule engine based
framework for selecting based on the
state of the vehicle which maneuver to
trigger for a robot so if that's cut we
have some rule based stuff effort for
for both maneuver control and four and
four sensation of things like
determining whether something is an
object or not there's some rule based
struck frameworks in there so machine
learning would be an example of
something that would be a great sort of
add-on or framework on top of this as
opposed to something that would be
necessarily baked in per se because of
its its nature yes
fell apart
so are all these different object
so the question is there's a lot of talk
about driverless cars and and are any of
these institutions that are creating
these vehicles is there any commonality
common frameworks and actually happened
to be I'm the chairman of the sae
standard for all on road autonomous
vehicles so you know all the major auto
manufacturers the research institutions
involved with this including Google are
part of this committee and and we don't
talk about implementation per se in a
standards committee it's kind of a
potent but the but what I see is what I
see generally in the in the world is is
that especially with the im's I mean
there's a there's there is no real
sharing it's just you know developing
proprietary solutions for for driverless
vehicles but I think there could be a
component market but it's it's very you
know it's very young and and there's
just tremendous liability involved right
so if you use something from another
vendor and you know and there's an
accident who is responsible and so it's
it's it's tougher in that sense
so I don't see a lot of sharing their
alright well thank you very much i will
i am around at the conference i have my
contact info there and again if you want
to drop by a talk tomorrow and look at
some actual code and look at a robot i
encourage you to do so should be fun
hopefully he'll work it's either
spectacular disaster or miraculous
operation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
