integrate applications there are so many
things to consider and take care of
integrations connect to applications and
define how they interact with each other
they include a source connection for
requests sent to integration cloud
servers and a target connection for
requests sent from integration cloud
service to the target integrations
define the flow of data and data mapping
between these two connections this is a
SAS to SAS use case showing an
integration cloud service
the Acme sales cloud instance is the
source and the Acme right now instances
the target this integration creates an
organization right now for any account
creation in sales cloud there's a
request and response as well as fault
handling all with data mapping in
between this use shows integration from
a web service to a SAS application it
uses a get operation from right now to
retrieve organization data from right
now based on the identifier passed you
can also use integration cloud servers
to integrate your on-premise
applications with your cloud
applications for example your HCM cloud
service may need data from a legacy
on-premise application the legacy
application is exposed as a web service
endpoint so you can use the soap adapter
to create the connection typically you
use soap services to connect to SAS or
on-premise applications with which you
want to integrate when you build an
integration you select an integration
pattern the use cases we've looked at so
far use the Met my data pattern where
you drop source and target connections
onto a blank canvas you use this for
real
times synchronous message exchanges
between two applications or for
asynchronous or one-way fire-and-forget
integration patterns you can also
connect your source application to
publish messages to the integration
cloud service messaging service or you
can add target applications that
subscribe to receive messages from the
integration cloud service messaging
service here's an example of the
publish/subscribe patterns when you
create an account in oracle salescloud
it publishes the account information to
the ICS messaging service then services
that are subscribed to the ICS messaging
service will receive the account
information so creating the new sales
cloud account will cause the creation of
a right now organization and another
loquat account
creating integrations is easy ICS takes
care of the connections to the api's and
lets you simply select the operations
from the endpoint that you wish to use
here we're using a soap endpoint and
choose to use the update operation for
the request then you use the mapper to
specify how to map data between
applications we'll cover this in more
detail in the next lesson once you
create an integration you can clone it
to create a new integration quickly and
export it to a jar file to import into
and use in other ICS environments you
can also create packages of integrations
and we'll talk about that in another
lesson so that's how easy it is to
create integrations for your
applications
