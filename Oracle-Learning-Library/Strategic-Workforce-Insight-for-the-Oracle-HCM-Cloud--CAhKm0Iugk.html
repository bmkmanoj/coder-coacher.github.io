Oracle HCM cloud as the head of human
resources I need to keep a close eye on
every aspect of our most important
resource our people we have a leadership
meeting coming up with the heads of each
division an OTB I enterprise helps me to
prepare by providing me with insights
only HR can deliver I can see right away
that there is an uptick in nutrition for
the entire organization and that the
attrition rate for top performers is
slightly higher my organization uses
Oracle's 0 TBI product that's available
with Fusion HCM but 0 TBI Enterprise
helps me go even deeper with extensive
historical data and it combines my
fusion HR and taleo information into a
single view I can see rapid growth
occurring in the vision industries
division so I will make sure that the HR
partner for this division has the right
plans in place to handle onboarding and
talent development throughout OTB I
enterprise I can change views quickly
and see my work force by different
dimensions I can also readily compare
different departments to each other and
to the overall company performance it
looks like manufacturing within the
vision industries division is
experiencing high attrition relative to
other departments I'm going to drill
into this division to learn more in the
head count overview topic for vision
industries I can get a broader sense of
games losses and growth within the
division looking at the losses for this
month in manufacturing I can see a large
proportion of the employees or leaving
due to retirement or for better
opportunities if I switch to the jobs
family view it looks like we are losing
many product design engineers a key part
of our workforce
at the leadership meeting I need to be
able to bring perspective on the
potential impact to this organization
and present a plan to address what we
can do to retain our workers I want to
see how we manage and develop talent
within this division I can see already
that there have been few promotions over
the last 12 months a warning sign that
the people leaving for better
opportunities aren't seeing options to
move within the organization looking at
how we pay for performance it's clear
that manufacturing and finance have
higher than average performance overall
yet the average compensation is below
market this could be compensation policy
or execution in any case I know to raise
this as a red flag in the upcoming
discussions since I noticed that many
workers are retiring I need to get a
proactive look at how many workers are
nearing retirement age so that I can
help the business prepare for the future
with advanced analytics like a
projection of workers that may retire in
the next five years we can ensure that
we are ready to replace key workers with
important skills through recruiting and
development initiatives here I can see
two important jobs in our organization
internal support and product design
engineer will see high retirement
attrition three to five years out I feel
like I understand what's going on with
the vision industries division now and
that I can formulate a solid action plan
for helping them retain their key talent
and start to prepare for a wave of
retirements going back to the corporate
level view I need to get a handle on the
employee movement across the
organization I need a comprehensive look
at employee movement in and out of the
divisions something I know takes a
sophisticated system like 0 TBI
enterprise to interpret transfer events
and reorganizations OTB I enterprise
gives me the information I need to be
informed and speak to overall movement
in the workforce hires exits and
transfers between organizations I'm
almost ready for the upcoming leadership
meeting but I really want to bring the
message home to the other leaders in the
room 0 TBI enterprise enables my
organization to construct powerful
collaborative storytelling application
let the data do the talking using the bi
mobile application designer I can share
my findings with other leaders in the
organization during the meeting and on
their own mobile devices OTB I
enterprise helps me to position my HR
organization in a central role to build
business strategies that are focused on
our most important assets our people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
