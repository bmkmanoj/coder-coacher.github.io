has decided to modernize their sales
ecosystem by subscribing to
salesforce.com for their customer
relationship management requirements
this means that they now need to
integrate the data in salesforce.com
with their on-premise Oracle e-business
suite they've chosen Oracle integration
cloud service or ICS as their strategic
platform for this integration this demo
illustrates how an opportunity can be
converted into an order with just a few
clicks
using ICS as the integration platform
after Bob the sales rep logs into
salesforce.com he creates a new
opportunity in the system
he enters information for the
opportunity and adds the associated
products to complete the opportunity
configuration next bob creates a quote
for the opportunity he provides the
relevant details after he saves the
changes Bob can synchronize the quote
and the opportunity to enable
bi-directional sync of quote line items
and opportunity products now the quote
configuration is completed
Bob presents the quote to the customer
and after negotiations the quote is
accepted the opportunity's closed which
triggers the creation of a new sales
order in e-business suite Bob can check
the details of the sales order for
example he can see the order number of
the sales order in e-business suite
right here in salesforce.com
now when the customer calls Bob for
details on where the order is he calls
the order management team and provides
the order number in e-business suite
with that the details of the order can
be retrieved immediately now let's take
a look at how you can build this
integration using ICS quickly and
without any coding James integration
designer of vision incorporated logs
into the ICS web console this console is
the one-stop shop for designing
monitoring and managing all your
integrations from the landing page James
can perform one of the following tasks
creating connections to various SAS and
on-premise applications building
integrations between connections or
monitoring transactions through the
dashboard James starts with the
connections Oracle integration cloud
service provides pre-built connection
these include connections to SAS
on-premise and social applications and
more here
James builds a new connection from
scratch to first configure the
connection to the e-business suite using
integrated so a gateway web service he
specifies a name and a version number
for the connection configures the wisdom
file in the connection properties field
and tests the connection to make sure it
works fine James then creates the
connection for salesforce.com and
configures credentials using the
provided salesforce.com account
information James then moves on to the
integration the landing page shows all
the integrations that James and his team
have created Oracle integration cloud
service provides pre-built integrations
to integrate between various SAS and
on-premise applications here
James creates a new integration from
scratch he chooses the map my data style
of integration to simplify data mapping
and to send the request data from
salesforce.com to e-business suite there
are other patterns available such as
pub/sub orchestration virtualization and
more on the right is the list of SAS and
on-premise connections he's created
previously
since the opportunity information is
sent from Salesforce to e-business suite
James drags and drops the Salesforce
connection to the source section he
names this endpoint and picks up the
outbound messaging interface and the
related business object in this case
opportunity next James configures the
target of the integration ebusiness
suite
James selects opportunity sync as the
operation the next step is to create the
data mappings between these two
endpoints typically this is the most
complex and time-consuming part of
delivering an integration however with
the simple data mapper in ICS James can
easily drag and drop to create the
mapping also ICS has a mapping
recommendation system that can create
the mapping automatically the time and
cost required to build and deliver
mappings is significantly reduced to
ensure and end visibility James
configures the key search identifier for
this integration flow why is he doing
this if an order creation failed or if
EBS was down for maintenance the
operation manager may want to search the
transactions based on the opportunity
name or organization ID and identify
which transactions are not
processed he can also use this
identifier and search for transactions
on the monitoring dashboard
James has completed the integration and
he hasn't written a line of code or
worked on an XML schema XSLT or other
artifact he activates the flow in one
click the messages could now seamlessly
flow between salesforce.com and
e-business suite for more information
