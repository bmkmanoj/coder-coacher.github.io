development for everyone my name is Josh
Mansell I'm director of product
management for the Oracle cloud
development tools in this session we're
going to discuss how can we increase the
productivity of JavaScript developers as
well as how can we actually make
JavaScript based development more
accessible to a wider range of
developers out there so first maybe we
should explain that JavaScript right now
is underutilized and on this slide you
actually see a result from the recent
developers survey that was done by Stack
Overflow a very popular website where
people ask technical questions and they
ask developer what are they doing and
here are some of the responses so on the
left side you actually see their ranking
of the most popular development
languages okay so those are the
development languages the developers use
the most and JavaScript today is the
most used development language out there
okay and one of the key reasons for this
is because if you look on the right side
at how developers define themselves in
terms of what will they do most of them
today are doing web developer and web
development involve JavaScript and -
given it's also interesting to note by
the way that JavaScript has gone a
beyond just the client in web
application and now in many cases it's
also functioning go on the backend so if
you actually look at the middle we have
how people define themselves and there
are what we call web developers that
work on the front end and web developers
that work on the back end of application
and many of them define themselves as
full stack web developers so those are
the people who would be taking care of
not just developing the user interface
and the user interactions that are
happening in the browser but also
developing the backend of the
application the logic for example get
access various data sources and expose
it usually as a services that are going
to be consumed by the web
is sober well this is where the industry
has moved okay most of us are doing web
development doing development of rich
web interfaces leveraging the JavaScript
and it's usually not just JavaScript
it's a combination of JavaScript html5
and list this is the most popular
technology spec for building modern web
application and if you ask yourself why
then there are various reasons for this
the first thing is that when you do this
type of combination you can actually
create a much better user interface
experience okay because JavaScript
executes from the client and has direct
access to the HTML code to manipulate
the Dom for example you can create a
much more responsive user interface you
can react faster to actions that the
user is doing in addition the fact that
you are using these technologies enable
you to more easily adapt yo UI to mobile
devices and more and more of the users
are accessing applications through
mobile devices and when I'm talking
about easier adoption a to mobile
devices the two key benefits here is
that this technology stack of html5
JavaScript on the UI is able to run on
the browser's of big devices basically
your PC or laptop okay as well as on
mobile devices and in the browser and
the browser's on mobile devices today
have full functionality and support for
anything you want to do with javascript
okay and with html5 it even becomes a
better UI experience in the browsers and
all the mobile devices today support
html5 on their browsers ok so you can
create mu eyes that are either adaptive
or responsive and basically adjust the
size and the display of your application
to mobile devices ok and in addition
one more way that you can do mobile
development with html5 a javascript is
by packaging your application to be
installed as an own device application
and using something like Cordova for
example which is a very popular open
source solution for packaging html5
JavaScript based application to become
own device application so this gave IT
department a single technology stack
that allowed them to develop web
interfaces that are accessible on
multiple sizes of devices and basically
develop ones run everywhere as well as
use the same technology stack to build
both web and to mobile applications also
the architecture behind this combination
of JavaScript html5 and rest is a
stateless architecture which creates a
very scalable application and it also
creates a decoupled application there is
a built-in separation between the
provider of the service that exposes the
data to waste and the consumer of the
service which can be a UI or can be some
other application so this decoupling out
of the box is actually implementing one
of the best practices of good software
design and let's not forget the last
reason that javascript and html5 and
rest also popular it's a cool technology
ok it's what the cool kids are doing and
a lot of people want to go into this
area and develop with this new
technology ok the problem then becomes
that once you decide you want to go and
develop your JavaScript html5 based
application you'll faced with too many
choices there are a lot of frameworks
out there and it's kind of how to decide
which one you want to go with ok and
those are frameworks to deal with user
interfaces with how you connect the user
interfaces to the back and rest services
with how you do things like building and
creating the application and packaging
them
a lot of choices and things change very
rapidly in the world of JavaScript a
library that might be very popular today
might not be that popular in a month
from now okay which makes it hard for a
developer who wants to move into this
area to decide which technology stack
exactly should I go with but let's say
that you chose your technology stack the
next thing that you're going to find out
is that you have to do a lot of coding
if you look at a normal regular
JavaScript based development team you
would see that they are doing a lot of
coding a lot of them are using basically
enhanced code editors things like
sublime okay to code and make coding
easier but they do end up working at the
code level now there's nothing wrong
with this this is how software is being
developed but that might not be the most
productive way to actually create
applications let's think back to the
days of client-server if you've been
around for a while and transfer was very
popular in the 90s okay and
client-server was much more productive
in terms of the spirit I could create an
application okay and what made
client-server Development productive it
was a bunch of tools that will build to
simplify the development okay so those
are tools like a visual basic and power
builder and even Oracle forms all of
them focused on the concept of creating
applications by picking UI components
arranging them visually on a page and
then defining the business logic that
will function behind it okay so the
development experience that they
provided was completely different from
low-level coding in most of them you
were able to go in and add code but the
mundane task of organizing items on the
page rather than writing low-level code
I mean maybe Co C++ was done visually in
a UI builder and a lot of the
functionality such as accessing a
database was abducted from you so you
wouldn't need to write low-level access
to ODBC for example okay to access your
database by the way and this is not just
for C it's also in the world of Java one
of the things that gave rise to Java was
the ease of developing applets a by
using visual tools that allowed you to
visually develop swing applications okay
and again abstracting the JDBC concepts
behind it so if those types of tools
help all the technologies become more
popular and more productive I believe
it's time that we have visual
development tools for the JavaScript
HTML and the rest generation now again
I'm not just talking about a tool that
allows you to design just your HTML page
I'm talking it well to tool that covers
both the UI design the access to data
sources the exposure of things with rest
and sink refined creation of business
logic in your application now in the
industry today there is a new
terminology for such tools and this is a
low code platforms okay and now code
platforms is basically deferring to what
I would call that development tool rapid
application development tools for the
new generation it's just that as I said
before coolness is an important factor
in deciding which technology you're
going to go with and if we would call
these tools edge tools some developers
might not like it
so doesn't unite no code and the goal of
those tools is to bring the development
which new technologies okay to a broader
audience so there are different types of
developers out there there are the
developers who like to code everything
okay and but there's a separate type of
developer which is a developer that
actually likes to do things in a visual
way
okay it likes to focus more on solving
specific challenges okay functional
challenges rather than writing code if
they can eliminate writing code from
there and flow or minimize the amount of
code that they need to do in order to
get the regular functionality of the
application they would go with this and
more and more we're also seeing another
type of person or persona coming into
this area of development and that's the
business analyst those are people who
are not professional developers but do
have some background in software
development okay they might have taken
some courses in college they might have
dabbled in a development as a side
project for them and given the right
tools those guys can actually create
applications now to be realistic those
slow code development tools are mostly
focused on creating business
applications okay so we are not going to
use those tools to create advanced
websites such as Amazon or Facebook or
things like that but for a lot of the
interoffice applications kind of the
applications that work in the back
office or simple applications that work
with a customer facing a scenarios those
tools can serve a very good purpose okay
they can actually increase our
productivity and reduce our backlog in
creating such business applications so
some of you on this webinar might
actually want the Iying actually one of
those developers who like to code so is
this still relevant to me should I
actually be killing about these tools
and the answer is yes okay even if
you're not going to use these tools to
build your actual application even if
you're going to pick up your beloved
JavaScript framework and write
everything with a code editor okay you
can use these tools to serve you for
doing things like quick mock-ups of the
application
so we all know that when we're starting
to develop an application it's good to
have a design in front of the user to
get his feedback on the application see
how they like it get any specific
changes that they would like to do and
basically create prototypes and these
tools for professional developers can
serve as a first way to create those
mock-ups and prototypes of application
before we go over and start coding
everything okay so that's one approach
another thing that you can do if you can
use these tools as the base for an
application that you're creating okay
and whether you're just leveraging those
tools to create the business services
layer and then you go and you manually
write UI layers on top of them using the
rest services that those in Business
Service expose or whether you're
actually using those tools to also
create the base users interface and then
you go over and enhance this user
interface and extend it with code okay
if you're choosing the right local
development platform you're going to
have access to the code and to api's
that will allow you to extend the
functionality of the application using
the standard technologies that you like
and one more use case is even in
scenarios where you're creating all the
applications from scratch using your
favorite architecture you're going to
run into the typical business users who
is going to want to extend your
application and add functionality modify
things okay and you can actually provide
them with these type of tools on top of
your application by exposing your
application through standard API so
taking your business services for
example exposing them as standard REST
API and then giving the tool like a
local platform to the business user so
they can handle those minor changes or
minor additions on their own without
bothering you the professional developer
okay
so at the end of the day these tools are
elevant both for the type of developers
that are interested in rapid application
development as well as to the how to
code coders so I'm going to show you one
of those tools that are available in the
market today I'm going to show you a
tool called the Oracle application
builder cloud service which is a
cloud-based development environment that
allows you to build applications and
much faster ok both web and mobile
application but it's not just a
development platform it's also the
hosting platform and you'll see that one
of the nice aspects here is that as you
build the application you're able to run
it all the time because you're already
developing it on the hosting platform
and you'll also see that we're focusing
on a visual development approach let's
talk a little bit about the technology
stack that is behind this - ok and this
tool is able to create both web and
mobile applications so both
browser-based application as well as on
device application it's able to access
third-party rest services but it also
includes a local database and the TA you
can use to store custom business object
and expose them with less services and
in fact for those business objects you
can define specific business logic and
specific behaviors validators etc all of
them are exposed as reusable rest
services then on top of those web
services and business components you're
going to use UI components to create the
various web application in mobile
applications and you're going to do all
of this by using a visual builder so for
the UI component we're going to use a
overkill jet and I'm going to explain
what Oracle jet is in a minute the
backend is again a bunch of rest
services and for example just so you
know when you're creating a custom
business object ok putting it in the
database exposing guest services
we're actually implementing this with
Java but one of the nice thing about
this is that you don't actually kill how
it the business logic was implement
that you just cared about how can I
access it how can I add business logic
to it and then for the database this is
no local to also the database of course
is an Oracle database so as I mentioned
in terms of the user interface we are
using a technology called Oracle jet
soical jet is a toolkit for building
enterprise applications using the
JavaScript html5 respec one thing that
is interesting for you to know is that
hotel jet is completely open source so
you can pick it up and use it for free
you can get access to all the code on
github and the focus of Oracle jet is on
providing a modular approach to the
architecture of a JavaScript application
ok rather than being an end-to-end
framework where you have to choose the
whole framework and work exactly the
framework dictates our conject focuses
on modularity so here's the basic
architecture of overkill jet application
will following the model view viewmodel
architecture ok I will view model model
architecture the view layer we basically
have a bunch of jQuery component
components ok edit we provide and we
provide a lot of UI components that
range from their base M radio buttons
and date pickers and things like that to
much more complex tables and trees and
expendable trees a to a lot of data
visualization components so one of the
design patterns and the best practices
that we are turkey believe in is
visualizing data for the user of an
application is a way to drive the
elections and inside a local jet you
will see a lot of data visualization
components so those would be charts and
gauges and indicators of various types
and diagrams and more and more so all of
those are provided as UI components ok
based on the jQuery specification along
with support for Hamel as a framework or
the library that gives us touch gesture
support along with support for sass for
changing the look and feel of the
components for the view model ale we use
knockout that gives us the two-way
binding to our back-end and we have a
modeler a jet common model that allows
us to connect to both west and WebSocket
sources of data we use a routing system
that we built that gives you a very
advanced single page application
functionality with support for various
aspects of history when you're
navigating through your pages and to
manage the resource loading and minimize
the load time we use require.js to
optimize that aspect of the application
so as you can see our content is based
on some of the most popular JavaScript
frameworks how-to or JavaScript
libraries Alden along with additional
functionality that will build and again
we're using overkill jet inside Oracle
to build a most of our cloud products
and you can use it as well because it's
opened so I would thought it would make
sense right now is to go over and show
you a demo of how you would go about
building an application using low code
development approach or a visual
development approach for building
JavaScript applications so I'm going to
work here in my browser accessing author
application builder cloud service to the
web and we're going to see how to create
a new application now as I mentioned
before we can create a web application
or a mobile application with the
differences that a mobile application is
actually packaged and downloaded to your
device for running over the but we're
going to start with a web application
and we're going to do a project planning
application so we're going to call it
project planning and we have different
looks and feels that we support out of
the box and you can extend and add more
look and feel mode templates this is one
place where a professional html5
developer can help you because they can
design the template that style sheets
behind
to create your own looking sphere and
we'll see a little bit about this later
on okay so I'm going to create an
application where we're going to have a
list of projects and maybe we also have
a list of employees that we might want
to assign to those projects so the key
area in all application builder cloud
service is this area that you're seeing
right now it is a visual editor for your
application and from here you can
actually create various artifacts that
are involved in your application as a
visual editor we are working again
inside the browser we can click on an
area and we can modify it so we can for
example upload a logo of our company to
our application and modify the logo up
here we can change the title in that we
can go over and click components and
just drop them on the page thank you
better if we don't need a button we can
remove it so I'm on this page for
example we want to see a list of all the
projects that we need to complete so to
do that we are going to pick up the
table and drop the table on the page and
now we actually need to bring in data
now we don't have a place for the data
so we're going to create a business
object and you want that would store
information about the project okay and
then we can add new fields so for
example we can have the name of the
project and maybe there's a budget for
the project this can be a currency field
and maybe there is a due date which
would be a date now you can see that as
I'm adding the fields visually they are
represented on the left side so I can
already see how my user interface is
going to look like and I can even change
the location of fields and it will be
reflected in the UI so by the way this
responsive behavior ok easier in
interaction with the user is something
that is implemented with JavaScript in H
sighs okay we can indicate that when we
click on the name of project we're going
to edit the project and we can add the
filter for example the advanced queries
or sorting if we need to I'll just click
finish now because this is html5
JavaScript application it's very easy at
this point of time to just click run and
get your application to one there's no
complex deploy step okay you just hit
run and here you go your application is
here so you can say maybe the project
and for a company party with a budget of
$300 and it's deal by the end of the
month okay and maybe there's another
project that we want to do okay
and so maybe a company picnic okay so I
might have 200 bucks and this is in a
couple of months from now so they can
see we now have a full card application
we can actually edit the details of the
little code and we can also of course a
search and over here so we'll type of
party we're going to give a filter
applied and we can look at the company
party to get more information
all right so nice we designed an
application and you can see how easy it
was now the reality of what we did here
is we created a database okay we then
expose the database to a rest service
and then built a full html5 JavaScript
grace interface on top of it with
multiple pages okay so right now for
example we have here five pages that we
created now it's not enough to just
easily create something you should also
be easy to modify things
okay so let's suppose that you are
looking at this edit page for company
for project and you want to modify it so
one of the things that you would like to
do is change the layout so you can pick
up a load component and divide your page
into two areas
and shatter some of the fields to the
left and some of the fields to the right
maybe another type of change you want to
do is add another field over here maybe
to have a description of the project
like this now again you can run the
application right now and see the
application working with a new field
where you can say that this is a man and
royalty now it's interesting to note
here that what I did by adding this
expert field into the page if you think
about it from the perspective of a
professional developers I went to the
database and I issued an alter table to
edit column ok then I expose this new
column in my disturbs then I built this
new UI on top of it but with the right
tool with a visual development approach
I can do this just by dragging over
another column into my UI and automate
everything behind the scene ok let's see
some additional things that we can do
for example we can maybe define the
relationship between objects so maybe
each project has a bunch of tasks
associated with it so let's add a task
object and we can have the task name we
can have the cost of the task and maybe
there's a type so this can be a list of
value and type of task so this might be
a buy something now this might be a
bring something oh this might be a
bubble something right so now let's
click finish and run the application now
and now we can look at our party and
start defining tasks so and we need
balloons ok and about 30 bucks dedicated
to this and this is something that we
need to buy
and maybe we need some food okay and
again we have another 20 bucks dedicated
for this it is something that someone
needs to blink so they can see now we
have a full master detail relationship a
long way to lookup table implemented
again few clicks and we got all of this
working in our user interface as I
mentioned one of the things that we like
about jet is the ability to visualize
data so one of the things I can do here
for example is again modify the layout
of the page maybe adding it tab here and
click on the first tab this is going to
be our tasks and then on the second tab
we're going to have a breakdown of the
costs okay and by the way third tab we
don't need it so we can just remove it
take that tasks bring it into the first
tab click on the second tab again visual
editor allows us to access every aspect
of the page directly they go to one of
our data visualization component connect
it to tasks and show us the cost for
each one of our tasks ok like that
so now we have an application working
and in addition we can see responsive
behavior of the application so this is
how the application is going to look on
a relatively big screen and if I switch
to a smaller device you can see that
with rearranging the application okay I
am using the responsive behaviors that
are built into our HTML template however
we might want to optimize our UI okay
for example maybe on a small device
because we don't want to do a lot of
scrolling we would want to hide this
complete area okay so we can go over and
say that on the phone in portrait we
don't want to show it maybe on a mobile
device we know that the table is not the
best UI components and we want to switch
it to a list and maybe hide one of the
columns okay again to save some space
so now we have a user interface that
looks like this on a small phone okay
but the same UI can be used on a large
screen and will show you all the extra
data that you need so again using a
visual development tool we can leverage
the responsive adaptive capabilities of
html5 JavaScript based device and create
a UI that is optimized for both mobile
and web in a single application this is
nice but maybe we want to do one more
thing okay and maybe what we want to do
next is create a mobile version of this
application so not just an application
that I can access for my mobile device
from the browser but actual application
that will be running on the mobile
device so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to indicate to this application to
shell its resources and then I'm going
to stage the application copying the
data from the development environment
okay so sharing the resources means that
I the business objects that I just
created in these applications are going
to be exposed as rest services for
applications to access and then staging
is basically taking the application I
created and was in development mode and
putting it into kind of a QA environment
okay so I'm actually creating the new
instance of the database an instance of
the application and now people can go
over and run the stage duplication and
kind of perform a keyway on the
application accessing looking at the
data playing with the application seeing
how it responds a response to various
interaction things like that okay let's
go back over here and now let's actually
publish the application publishing the
application takes the applications from
the QA stage into production and provide
the different level where people can now
run the fully functional application so
now we have our first application the
project planning application created and
published it's a live application now
let's create a mobile application for an
on device experience so I am from the
same tool I'm going to create a mobile
forge application we know that mobile
user interfaces in order to be highly
usable need to follow some guidelines
okay yet responsive UI is nice but if
you are actually targeting a mobile
device there are different types of user
interactions that people do for example
this type of menu M is something that is
more popular on mobile devices than on
big screens oh those type of tabs for
example let's get a page that will show
us our project okay we list and also
details about the costs in a second tab
now again you can see that as I'm typing
and walking through my environment
everything is represented in a visual
waveform for example now I said I want
the first page to have a list of all my
projects okay Oh
currently I just said it's a list I
didn't say what I'm going to put in the
list and this is what I'm going to next
I'm going to edit data to my application
I'm going to show you a simple title
subtitle
type of list and I'm going to get the
data from one of the applications I
already created so this would be from
the project planning application okay so
this is the application we just created
I'm going over to the application
looking up the rest services it exposed
picking up one of those business
objected towards exposes with a service
the project 1 and then I can pick up the
name and the budget and show you a live
preview of this data over here so again
using the same concept of a usual
development screen I can create
additional create screen for example I
can add a detail screen and maybe we'll
just use a simple screen layout like
that this form and we can then navigate
to that page to define which fields
we're going to shoulder show again
information about the project and this
time we're going to show the name and
the budget as well as the due date and
the description
and now we can actually run our little
application or maybe before we learn
this application one more thing we
wanted to do in this page is in the COS
tabs we wanted to pick up again one of
our jet components and such as this
child component drop it on the page and
then connect it to the data coming from
the rest service showing us the budget
so each one of our project all right so
now we created an own device application
we can run it in the emulator over here
and see the data coming from the rest
service into our html5 base UI on the
device I can click on a specific project
and basically recognize touch gestures
of clicking and navigating okay using
some of the best practices of how you
build an on device mobile application
there we go not only can I run it in the
emulator I can even test it on my phone
okay before I test it on my phone let me
just show you that there is a difference
here between looking at the application
on an android look at the tabs for
example and in iOS we're using native
look and feel for each one of those
devices adapting our UI to replicate a
native look and feel on the platform
that we Lanigan clicking test on phone
would actually take my application
package it and and provide to me a
downloadable version of the application
that I can download to my phone simply
by scanning this QR code okay so there
you go we used visual tools to build a
web application and the mobile
application all visually right now
without writing any code however I did
want to show you that you could write
code okay so let's get a new version of
the project planning application and
work on some changes to this application
for example when we are looking into
this project okay we might want to know
if this is a good project or a bad
project or a big project or a small
project and use a button to do that okay
so we can have a button that says check
project now I'm not going to do a lot of
complex logic but we can actually define
an action on this button and we have a
bunch of built-in methods that you can
invoke for example navigate to another
page but what I wanted to show you is
that you can actually use scripting in
JavaScript scripting for example over
here so we're going to use from my
script here okay and if you are a
developer who is familiar with a little
bit of JavaScript you can go over and
start coding so we can ask for example
if the budget okay is bigger than 200
okay then you want to do something for
example alert
and then we might want to use the name
of the project and say is a is an
expensive project make that and else
we're going to alert and just say this
is a small project so as you can see if
you know a little bit of JavaScript
development you can go ahead use
valuables from the business objective
created and write some logic in your
application like we're doing here let's
save this okay and click done let's test
our project right now so this is now
more than 200 so if you click the check
project we get company LT is an
expensive project so maybe we need to
adjust this to be maybe 100 to 90 and
then click the button and then we know
that this is a small project so you now
see that previously I developed
everything without writing a single line
of code but if you do know how to code
and you do need to introduce some
specific business logic you can do it
writing JavaScript so this is just the
tip of the iceberg in terms of what a
JavaScript developer can do with this
tool so let me talk to you now about the
importance of standard base
extensibility okay and one of the
problems that was there with the old
generation of client sell well visual
tools is that most of them used
proprietary technology and proprietary
languages which caused kind of a locking
and you couldn't be a developer that
worked across multiple of those tools
you will usually either the power
builder developer or when Oracle forms
developer but you weren't both of them
however the modern tools tend to use
standard based languages
which means that as a developer of the
tool you're actually more portable among
multiple tools but it also means that
you can pick any JavaScript or html5
developer from the split okay and use
their current skills to extend your
application to add functionality and
because we're using those candles more
developers alder okay and even if you're
just getting started one ice thing about
using standard based technology in
languages is that it's very easy to find
how to's an explanation and demos and
simple code for whatever tasks you need
to do yeah one of the things we did in
our tool is allowed professional
developers to extend the functionality
of the tool and basically add to our
platform by creating reusable components
those can be seems looking fields those
can be specific UI components those can
be JavaScript libraries with some
business logic like complex logic and it
can also be business object providers
who basically a packaging of a business
service that someone can reuse in their
application I wanted to show you how you
can add those type of things into the
project we just created okay so we're
still in the project over here and we're
going to go over to application settings
and look at extensions okay and one of
the new extensions that I can create
okay is a UI component except extension
and I can create a new one directly here
or I can actually import one from a zip
file so one of my fellow professional
developers created a demo map component
that I can use in my application so I'm
just going to open it and load it into
my environment and again all this
developer needed to know is just a bit
of HTML just a bit of JavaScript I can
actually show you the code here
so here's a little bit of the HTML we're
using here one of the jet component
called schematic map here is a bit of
the code behind the scene that goes over
to objects on the page okay for example
I can modify it and say you need to go
to the project object takes up data from
them and uses it in the application so
once you create those type of components
you can enable them and add them to the
product itself to the application
builder cloud service this is the UI
component another type of UI related
thing is a scene okay so I theme is the
look and feel and again I'm going to
import a look and feel that one of our
UI designer created and add it to the
look and feel that are available for our
users who are building applications so
this is what we call the ml l you can
see and the third thing I'm going to add
I'm going to show you here I do have
some well here a rest service okay so
this is actually the response from the
rest service it's a lot of details about
employees and this is service for
example was created from Oracle apex
okay and if I want to use it in my
application I can use a business object
provider again a developer can create
such a business object provider that
maps to such an external rest service
okay and allows me to read the data or
update the data from the service into my
application so here I'm basically adding
this business object provider now let's
go back to the page designer and see
what we can do now okay
so one of the things we can do for
example is we can now add a map
component to our page and maybe show
some information in a geographical
option so this is the new UI component
another thing we can do is go to the
scene okay and choose the NLL theme and
completely change the look and feel of
our application okay let's show you how
it's going to look like and we also have
a side navigation night
over here with some additional
information so one of the nice things is
that I can actually switch between those
look and feels and based on the one that
I prefer so this was another type of
extension that someone created and the
third thing I'm going to do is actually
when I'm looking and and when I'm on
this application for sale when I'm
actually editing a task okay I can
assign who is actually going to do the
task and to do that I'm going to add a
new source of that going to go to my
data designer and click to add service
form in another place and here I can see
the business object provider the source
of data coming from an external rest
service that one of my developers
created allowing me to access that about
employees that I was told in a separate
system pick up their name and email for
example and specify any authentication
if I have any and then add those as a
new source of data for my current
application okay so now that I have this
source of data of employees if I go back
to my page designer when I edit a task I
can have another drop-down filled in
here and this dot down field would be
the owner of the task and the owner is a
new field that references the employee
object and we're going to pick the name
of the employee here so now when I know
that I need to bring balloons to the
party I can say that Mila is responsible
for doing this so as you can see with
the talents of professional developers
we can extend the functionality that
slow code tools give us we can add
capabilities and create even more
complex applications
so to summarize visual development tools
visual local development tools the
modern generation of those tools make
the development of JavaScript html5 rest
application development much simpler if
you look we basically spent about 15
minutes during this hour building an
application that gets data from multiple
sources of places we created the
application from scratch we created a
mobile version and web version this is
what we call productivity by using these
type of tool we are going to increase
the adoption of those technologies
JavaScript html5 list among the
community of developers it's already
very popular but we can actually get
more developers to use it get developers
that previously thought about this
technology stack as being too complex
using these tools can also reduce the
backlog of a lot of our development
organizations that are right now
spending too much time building those
type of application by coding everything
rather than by using visual tools to
simplify the development and it's going
to make it easier for a lot of
developers to get started with this
technology stick yeah as you can see and
when I edit the button and I wanted to
write logic I needed to write a little
bit of JavaScript and that's the right
way to start your route into the life of
a JavaScript developer don't start by
trying to build a full application from
scratch
use a visual tool to allow you to start
your way and then slowly slowly add
business logic
edie capabilities well things matter
allowing you to slowly slowly learn the
technology and get expertise in it by
the way if you want to try this
development tool I just showed you
it's called application builder you can
go to our website get a tile and try it
out and see how it can improve you on
development experience and now it's time
for you to ask any questions you might
have the remaining time in this session
is set aside for your questions please
use these final few minutes to submit
your questions via the Q&amp;amp;A widget
you
this session ends
five minutes so now is the time to use
the Q&amp;amp;A widget to submit your final
questions
you
you have only about two minutes to
submit your final questions using the
Q&amp;amp;A widget
you
that concludes this session and the full
stack web development track in this
Oracle code online event thank you for
your participation
