to thank everyone for joining us this
afternoon or this morning whatever time
it is for you so as mentioned our web
conference today is focused on Oracle
database life cycle and stig management
with Oracle Enterprise Manager focusing
on the capabilities presented within the
database lifecycle management pack my
name is Martin Pena and I am a director
in the product management team for
Oracle Enterprise Manager based here in
California
we also have some other experts on the
phone today joining me as well as Pete
Sharman who is one of our product
managers focusing on this area as well
as Angie mentioned at the end of the
call we'll have an opportunity for
questions and answers answer sessions
provided we have enough time
I would also invite those of you who are
on the WebEx conference to utilize a
chat feature during the conference you
have any questions just submit the chat
and make sure you post them to all
panelists and we'll have the opportunity
for one of the panelists to perhaps
answer the question in the context of
the presentation or at the end we'll
review them and see if we can answer
them at that point I also realize some
of you may not be following the WebEx
some of you may have a copy of the
presentation that you're viewing in
advance so I'll try to keep track of
which slide I'm going through as we go
through the presentation itself so let's
go ahead and get started I want to start
out with first our standard Oracle safe
harbor statement this is just our
general statement if you could take a
moment to review it and it just states
it any of the information we're
presenting here is for informational
purposes and shouldn't be used to create
purchasing decisions
so in terms of our agenda for the next
45 minutes or so I'd like to cover a
overview of our database lifecycle
management solution and this is a really
broad area of Oracle Enterprise Manager
and has become one of the top three
management packed areas of Enterprise
Manager so we're going to do our best to
try to cover a lot of the key areas
realizing that if you have interest in
some of these you may need to do some
additional exploration and deep dive
we're going to talk about that database
lifecycle management in general what the
business drivers are for that and why
it's important why Oracle is investing
in this area and why many of our
customers see this as a valuable
solution then we'll focus on a couple of
the key solution areas we'll talk about
our automated database provisioning our
patch automation solution and we'll
probably spend majority of the time
talking about configuration
standardization with a particular slant
around stick compliance as I know many
of the customers on the call are
interested in that particular area so
let's go ahead and start talking about
why this is important for Oracle
customers and what we see is that
traditionally with system management
solutions oftentimes people initially
focus on the monitoring aspects of
system management understanding when
problems occur and trying to get alerts
and notifications on those so they can
react to those I like to think of
database lifecycle management has more
of a proactive solution for this and
what we're trying to do is address some
of the key challenges here one of the
main ones we see is what we call asset
sprawl so we see many of our customers
have a growth of databases many
databases are being spun up for
different projects and oftentimes these
databases are spun up with very unique
configurations so what we see is
customers have many different versions
oftentimes due to maintenance
difficulties there many different patch
level
and different sizes so oftentimes
customers have many many different
variances of databases across their
estate so we turn this configuration
pollution and while this can be annoying
at the basic level it can also be very
costly and time-consuming time-consuming
in terms of how you actually manage this
another challenge
customers have is really how to deliver
databases to respond to business
requirements so what we see is that
customers suffer from slow time to
delivery so oftentimes the time it takes
to provision databases can take anywhere
from many days to even a matter of weeks
and oftentimes this is just much too
long to address the business
requirements so this is really at a high
level what database lifecycle management
is all about and so with this we're
trying to address the issues of
consolidation to help manage sprawl
we're trying to address standardization
to control configuration pollution and
we're trying to promote additional
automation opportunities to make sure
that new databases are provisioned as
quickly as possible so as I mentioned
earlier our solution from Oracle and
Enterprise Manager is what we call
database lifecycle management and we
have a particular management pack that
focuses on this and this is really a
very broad solution that includes many
different components so here you
actually see although it looks very
detailed this is actually just a
high-level overview of the capabilities
within this pack and as the name implies
lifecycle management it really deals
with the complete lifecycle of the
Oracle database itself so we deal with
everything from planning to provisioning
to patching to maintenance and to doing
compliance to make sure that the
databases are deployed in a proper
manner
so within the tool itself we have a
variety of different tools first at a
very high level we perform discovery and
collection so one of the most
interesting aspects of database
lifecycle management is it actually
gives you a complete and real-time
inventory of what you have deployed in
terms of databases so you can get a
real-time view of what databases are
deployed what version what patch level
and even look at the configuration
aspects of those different databases so
with that basic discovery and collection
we start to add additional components so
we have different advisory tools so for
instance we have patch advisories so one
of the interesting features of
Enterprise Manager is we're able to
connect the Enterprise Manager
repository directly to the my Oracle
support repository and what that does is
it gives customers real-time access to
patch advisories not just generally but
specific to the specific database
version deployment and even platform
that they're deploying those databases
on with those patch advisories we
provide additional intelligence we
provide upgrade advisories and we can
actually alert you with configuration
policy violations as well with this
basic metadata we're able to do a
variety of different types of analysis
so we have some interesting tools that
can actually look at the topology of
your database environments for more
complicated environments like rack real
application clusters we can look at the
topology the hierarchy of the components
how they relate to the host etc so it
actually gives you a graphical view of
these different components we can also
do some basic tasks such as change
management understanding what changes
have occurred within the schema itself
do comparisons between different
databases and do daven data governance
and again with this analysis we're able
to do some more
high-level strategic tasks such as patch
plans so Enterprise Manager can actually
look at your estate figure out logical
patch plans it should be deployed on
your targets which order they should be
deployed in and actually understand the
dependency of the various patches that
will be deployed with this analysis the
next step is to actually take action and
this is probably one of the areas where
the database lifecycle management really
excels in terms of providing built-in
automation so we can provide hatch
upgrades we can do mass deployment of
either deployments of new databases or
of the patches themselves we can do
cloning synchronization of schemas and
we can do a variety of configuration
management to address configuration
drift and configuration changes and then
finally we can do a variety of reports
on this environment so we can do
real-time monitoring to understand when
configuration changes take place we can
provide a variety of high-level useful
reports such as compliance scores which
will let you know what the compliance
level is of various groups of targets or
even of your entire estate we can
provide a variety of reports and we can
also do change reconciliation as well so
again this is a high-level view of what
the database lifecycle management pack
can do
so let's go ahead and drill down into a
couple of these key areas the first one
that I want to talk about is really at
the beginning of the database life cycle
which is database provisioning
so one thing I mentioned too is that
Enterprise Manager currently is that the
Enterprise Manager 13c release this was
just recently released back in December
and we have a lot of great new features
that have been introduced in that so
I'll be trying to highlight some of
those features as we go through this but
many of these features are relevant to
the previous versions as well which you
may currently be running so in terms of
database provisioning we provide a
variety of tools that help database
administrators automate the process of
provisioning new databases and the idea
is to really help you scale the
provisioning process so rather than
having each provisioning exercise be
unique basically it's a process that
enables you to standardize the process
be able to automate it save time in that
process but also the end result is you
have a consistent set of databases that
are deployed and that's going to really
help the automation process in terms of
managing those databases once they're
deployed so we can address automated
provisioning of Oracle databases at many
different levels we can do single
instance databases cluster databases
many different database configurations
we can support automated provisioning up
through all the different levels
including database 12.1 and including
the multi tenant pluggable database
options as well and the process that we
do with this is really based around gold
image cloning and creating database
profiles so the idea here is that either
procedurally or actually by building a a
gold image you can create a database
that conforms to your standards
so the idea here isn't that you have
just one type of database that you
provision you can actually have a whole
catalogue of these databases or what we
sometimes refer to as a service catalog
and basically what you can do is you can
deploy these databases customize them
set the initialization
others to conform to your standards and
even pre deploy the necessary patches
basically that that gold image can then
be used as the standard to provision new
databases and we do this using a an
artifact called the profile and so when
you're doing the provisioning we
actually have many different roles in
this process you have a designer who can
actually determine what type of
databases should be deployed what their
settings should be that designer had the
capability to lock certain parameters so
if you don't want the actual operator
who's going to be deploying these
databases to change certain settings
such as the storage locations or
initialization parameters you can lock
down as many of these as you'd like so
you have a lot of control on this so
really the process here is you save
these gold images you create the
profiles and then you utilize the
Enterprise Manager software library and
then deploy these images as you need
them so this really automates the
process and creates a high level of
standardization for the deployed
databases
as I mentioned Enterprise Manager does
provide capabilities to support database
12c and multi-tenant databases so we
realize that many customers are just
starting to explore database 12c and the
multi tenant options and the database
lifecycle management hack is a great way
to help you automate those processes so
it can help you create the container
databases and also the underlying
pluggable databases it can also help you
migrate from pre 12c databases to the
12c multi-tenant database configuration
it enables you to automate the plugging
and unplugging of the databases so this
can be very useful for upgrade testing
functional testing and development
purposes so for instance here in this
demonstration we're showing you can see
a production content container database
that has multiple pluggable databases
within it basically if the development
team needed to do work on a new version
or perhaps do functional testing on it
you could basically clone and copy that
database to the new development kit
container database which may have a new
patch level new configuration parameters
etc and basically it's a very easy way
to clone and copy pluggable databases so
this is all provided and automated
through Enterprise Manager through the
console with the database lifecycle
management pack so moving on once you've
deployed your databases you haven't in
production probably the next major
challenge for many database
administrators is patch automation and
we often see that many customers do not
patch as frequently as they would like
to just because the process can be
tedious time-consuming and expensive so
we see patch automation
being one of the key areas where many
customers take advantage of the database
lifecycle management pack and see a very
good return on investment almost
immediately with these solutions so the
patch automation solution covers many
different scenarios so we have customers
who have deployed databases in a
traditional manner and for that
traditional database of state we provide
a full range of tools for those so as I
mentioned earlier we have the capability
to do automated patching via patch plans
so Enterprise Manager can actually
evaluate the database targets and put
together patch plans that are relevant
for the specific versions and patch
versions that you already have it can
provide advice on the recommended
patches based on the specific
configuration of your targets and we
have a variety of different patching
options to help minimize downtime one of
the very interesting parts of this is a
feature called the prerequisite check or
pre-flight check and what this does is
it makes sure that the patch is actually
compatible with the target before you
actually go through the patching process
so it can be very frustrating to
actually try to deploy a patch and
determine that you don't have all the
prerequisites in place then you have to
back up the patch and restart the
process and that can contribute to
additional downtime basically using
Enterprise Manager you can do the
pre-flight flight check and determine if
you have the prerequisites in place
before you actually start the process so
this is going to make the whole patching
process much more efficient we also have
patch templates that are going to make
patching similar and like targets much
more simple and automated and we can
also enforce compliance standards as
part of the patching process as well
which is going to make sure that the
compliance across your environment is
consistent many of these features are
supported not only through the console
itself but also through our command-line
interface the
CLI so if you choose to implement these
procedurally through any sort of
scripting environment you can do that as
well so in addition to patching
traditional databases we also have
additional features for patching multi
tenant databases with database 12c so we
offer the ability to plug in a plug
databases and it can be as simple as
basically unplugging a database from a
container database and plugging it into
a pre patched container database that
has the required patch level that you
need Enterprise Manager will take care
of the prerequisites required to conform
those two container databases to
facilitate the patching so that's a
great advantage with database 12c
multi-tenant we can also do patching of
the container itself and again just to
make sure that everything's conforming
and compliant we can do continuous drift
and auditing across all the different
pluggable databases
for those of you who may be looking at
deploying pools of on-premise private
cloud databases we also provide some
high-level maintenance capabilities
called fleet maintenance which is
actually part of the cloud management
pack which is a different pack but that
actually provides a way to patch large
sets of pools in a scaleable automated
way as well
so it's a great addition to this
solution as well and then finally I just
want to mention for any customers who
are using engineered systems Enterprise
Manager particularly in the Enterprise
Manager 13c version have provided some
great new features to extend patching
beyond just simply the database itself
but to include the other layers of the
engineered system such as the network
and storage as well so we can actually
patch the database grid the storage the
network and we provide specific patches
for these different environments
especially for exadata environment and
we've introduced a new dashboard that
focuses on these specific patching
requirements for engineered systems
so I wanted to mention just a little bit
about the process of patching and again
this is very similar to what we saw
earlier with lifecycle management in
general so basically again with
everything we do in the enterprise
manager it's all about managing it scale
so rather than helping you perform the
task on simply a single target it's
really built on helping you manage at
scale so if you have tens or hundreds or
even thousands of targets this is a way
to perform these tasks in a scalable way
so we have these patch advisories again
linking back to my Oracle support and
since I think we have perhaps an
audience based on many government
agencies here oftentimes sometimes the
connectivity to my Oracle support is
prohibitive for security reasons in
different environments and we definitely
have a solution around that with
Enterprise Manager we have the ability
to allow the administrator to do a
direct connect to my Oracle support and
manually download the metadata and
insert that into the enterprise manager
repository manually so that it can be
done in a secure manner so you don't
need to have that continuous persistent
connection to my Oracle support you can
actually periodically go up to my Oracle
support download the necessary
information whether it's the metadata or
the patches themselves and basically
insert those into Enterprise Manager and
then continue on with the same benefits
of that functionality with that metadata
around recommended patch advisers we
have the ability to provide patch
planning so we can create patch plans
and templates enabling you to apply
patches to multiple targets and again
the whole idea around this is not only
to hatch multiple targets but also to
minimize the downtime associated with
that patching process as I mentioned
before one of the key features of this
is the pre-flight dependency and
impact analysis which is going to make
sure that you actually have all the
prerequisites in place before you deploy
the patch when you roll out the patches
we have predefined templates for many
different configurations not only single
instance databases but for RAC databases
rolling patching support for RAC
out-of-place patching in-place patching
et cetera as well as for engineered
systems so many different configurations
that suit many of the requirements from
our customers and then once the patches
are applied we can help verify the
patching process and also make sure that
the configuration and compliance still
conforms with your internal
specifications at that point
so I mentioned earlier about our support
for engineered systems I'll go through
this just very quickly so basically we
provide support for all the three
different layers for instance in the
Exadata environment for the database
grid the storage grid and the network
itself and basically this provides a
very automated solution and
comprehensive solution for doing the
patching all at once
here I'm just showing you a screenshot
of a dashboard for this patching
solution this is particular for Exadata
but you'll see the same sort of
interface for other patching type
exercises within Enterprise Manager 13c
so here you can see the system state
information telling you that there's a
recommended patch it'll tell you the
number of targets that it's viewing in
this dashboard the number of targets
that need updating and those that are in
progress we can actually show you which
patches have been applied to which
components we can start the patching
process and then we can track in real
time what's been patched to actually
look at the log files associated with
the patching process so it's a great
tool to manage and deploy patches across
environments like this
you
so for patch automation as I mentioned
before many of our customers see very
immediate ROI benefits from doing this
it's going to help reduce the labor
associated with patching process it's
going to enhance productivity decrease
downtime associated with patching allow
for validation and make sure that
configuration changes make are
maintained and compliance is maintained
through the patching process itself
so moving forward like to cover a
configuration standardization and this
is a really very valuable and
interesting area within the database
lifecycle management pack and Enterprise
Manager I like to consider it sort of
the hidden gem with an Enterprise
Manager it's not always the first place
that people look for in terms of
functionality but it does provide some
very powerful features that can provide
some great benefits as I mentioned
before oftentimes people look at system
management tools as providing a reactive
tool to react to problems and incidents
after they occur with configuration
standardization this can actually be a
more proactive tool to help prevent
problems before they occur maintain
consistency and compliance with your
internal standards so from that
perspective this can be very powerful
so one thing that we focused on with
Enterprise Manager 13 are a couple major
areas configuration drift and
configuration auditing so basically
we're trying to validate conformance to
standards or benchmarks so basically
just like traditional monitoring we'll
look at performance issues or
availability issues we're basically
validating configuration standards that
have either been set through industry
standards or through your own best
practices themselves and so based on
that you can proactively look and
maintain compliance of your various
targets another issue that we've tried
to address is the issue of configuration
drift so the idea here is that
oftentimes when databases are deployed
they're configured properly but through
the course of maintenance that those
configuration settings may drift and
change so basically we have capabilities
to continually monitor and validate
conformance to standards using a
reference configuration so that
reference configuration can be a gold
standard or different policies best
practices or industry standards that you
want to apply to as well
enterprise manager has a complete
compliance framework and basically with
this we can take advantages advantage of
a variety of different standards so that
these can be Oracle's best practices
they can be security recommendations or
for government agencies they can be
stake benchmarks we also have various
tools that have been delivered from
Oracle like or a check or exit check
they again provide best practices for
specific types of targets so within the
enterprise manager compliance library
added block box we provide literally
thousands of different checks that are
available these checks can be activated
employed based on your own requirements
and we also provide the capability to
provide remediation or corrective action
for these so the administrator can
choose to review them and manually
correct the configuration settings based
on the alert or in the case of the most
severe ones if the administrator prefers
they can actually implement automated
remediation but that's strictly up to
the preference of the administrator
great thing about the compliance
framework is it's completely
customizable to meet your internal best
practices so you can take advantage of
any of the oracle best practices
industry standards and basically tailor
these to your own internal requirements
and you can build the rules to exactly
match your own specific requirements
you
you
you
so in terms of configuration and
compliance management there's a couple
key features I want to talk about one is
the setup and maintenance of this and so
we basically have a comparison template
so the idea here is that we can
basically call attention to those
configuration settings that are most
important to you for specific types of
targets so rather than giving you a
comprehensive list of all the
configuration settings showing you
what's the same what's different you can
choose just to focus on those that you
think are important to you we can also
do group Association so as I mentioned
before one of the key features of
Enterprise Manager is the ability to
manage at scale so most of the most
valuable management operations allow you
to manage at the level of a group or a
system so this means that rather than
applying the configuration templates to
a specific target you can actually apply
it to a specific group and manage from
that perspective so that could be a
group of specific to us a discrete
application it can be things like
production databases development
databases and you can have different
settings for different types of targets
so that enables you to really manage its
scale but also to customize based on the
specific groups and then we also enable
you to do a test mode so before you
actually implement these standards you
can actually test them before you mass
deploy them so again the idea here is
you're going to get better feedback on
on what's actually going to occur
through this test operation
once you have this configuration
framework in operation there's very
interesting features again designed to
help you manage at scale so we have some
rate dashboards that are going to enable
you to look at everything from the
enterprise perspective a group
perspective and application perspective
and basically summarize the compliance
at that level looking at compliance and
drift we can also very easily do side by
side results so you don't need to drill
into one specific target remember the
settings and then go to the next one
basically we can view multiple targets
together we can also do incident
management integration so basically any
violations of these configuration
settings compliance settings can
contribute sworn alerts critical alerts
whatever you choose and then if you
choose to you can use Enterprise Manager
to take correction act corrective
actions on these violations either
manually or automatically
you
here I'm providing a screenshot of the
comparison and drift management
dashboard and you can see here that
there's multiple ways that we can do
comparisons between many targets we can
do a one-time comparison basically
on-the-fly and this is a very useful
tool if you're trying to do any sort of
troubleshooting investigating the
problem oftentimes if there's a
performance issue or even availability
issue you might want to look first at
the configuration setting of the target
and see how it compares oftentimes it's
associated with the configuration change
at any of the tiers a database tier
operating system our hosts here an
Enterprise Manager can immediately give
you a complete inventory of all those
configuration settings compared to the
baseline or to another target that's
actually operating properly we also
provide the capability to do drift
management to understand how targets
have configurations have drifted over
time and we can also do consistency
management within a group of similar
targets as well so here we're showing
you just the workflow associated with
these as well as a highlight of the
dashboard associated with that and I'll
be going into a quick overview of the
workflow and this in just a minute just
to expand on a couple of these targets
types drift management is really
intercog at management so basically it's
about large-scale drift management
around similar targets so for instance
databases so you can have a a saved
baseline configuration that you want to
compare your databases to or even look
at a live target that serves as the gold
image baseline for that and compare your
database targets to that so that's enter
target management another interesting
thing we've added in a m13 is intricate
management so this is for systems of
targets
for instance real application clusters
or Exadata targets as well so basically
looking within a group or system of
targets and looking at compliance within
that membership so for for dripped
basically we can look at things like
initialization parameters so we can
compare different initialization
parameters across all the targets or
again through our templates we can focus
on specific parameters that are useful
to you we can also look at things like
application patches which patches have
been applied to the targets and we can
even look at the underlying host
configuration associated with those
targets for consistency we can focus on
consistency within groups like rack
database instances data guard standbys
or EXA data storage cells
and then as I mentioned before one of
the great features as well is once these
violations are identified it gives the
administrator of the option to harden
these based on the violations and the
administrator has a choice to initiate
these either manually or automatically
so completely up to the choice of the
administrator how to implement these you
can associate corrective actions to
these compliance rules and the violation
context is actually passed on to repair
specific issues themselves
so with that I'm going to switch over to
just a quick click through to show you
some of these features within Enterprise
Manager 13 itself so many of you may not
have seen Enterprise Manager 13 yet this
is the overview enterprise summary of
the environment so like previous
versions it gives you an overview of
alerts and notifications how many
targets are up down etc so you can see
that key information here but of course
configuration and compliance information
is highlighted here as well so here you
can see some useful information in terms
of inventory again part of the lifecycle
management pack what different versions
of the database are being managed by
Enterprise Manager so you can get that
real-time information very easily noting
the different versions database types
with a single instance pluggable
database rack environment etc and then
we can give you a compliance summary to
show you how compliance is being scored
across your environment so based on what
specific compliance rules you've
implemented you can see a summary and
the compliance score across those
targets in an enterprise level
so as we go through this we can actually
drill down and look at the comparison
and drift management and this is similar
to the screen shot I showed you earlier
basically the dashboard that shows you
the different types of comparisons we
can do a one-time comparison we can do
drift management and consistency
management and basically we can use this
information to go through and identify
how many targets in this environment
have drifted so here you can see 67% of
the targets in this environment have
drifted 1% are inconsistent so we can
drill down further and actually
understand how that is viewed so here we
can see in terms of drift based on the
drift definitions we have you can see we
have definitions based on a specific
application we have it based on hosts
and also database drift and you can see
based in the chart as well as the table
here the number of targets that are
drifted as well as those that are
similar so you can really understand
where your issues are and from here you
can simply click on database drill down
further and understand where the
specific issues are so here we can
single out databases identify the target
comparison results here and drill down
even further and look at the specific
database instances from here we can see
all the different database targets we've
selected we can actually highlight the
ones that we want to focus on and that
will enable us to see what the issue is
is here so here you can see the specific
configuration parameter that's causing
the difference and here you can see that
the property is the archive log and
basically our reference environment says
the archive log should be active and we
have
these three target violations where it
is not active you can also view this up
here as well we can also rotate the view
to see it this way as well so again many
different ways to manage this at scale
and then we also have the ability to
export this information to variety of
different types of reports so for
instance to a zip file or even email or
PDF reports as well so that's just a
quick view of this environment so let me
return back to the presentation
so let's drill down a little bit deeper
into some of the capabilities of the
compliance framework and specifically
some of the the stig capabilities so I
wanted to talk a little bit about how
the compliance framework is implemented
and really the framework is a hierarchal
hierarchical set of components it's
basically how you want to manage your
various targets and within that we have
compliance standards which are basically
groups of compliance rules we have
compliance rules which are discrete
checks or tests specific to a particular
target type and then we also have what
we call facets which are used to specify
the specific type of entities that you
want to monitor so those could be things
such as log files binary files library
files etc so this is a very
comprehensive and deep framework built
around these different components
you
I also wanted to mention that as part of
this compliance methodology you can
certainly take advantage of the
thousands of out of box compliance rules
and standards that are built into the
product so as you can see here in the
chart you know if the rule exists
basically you can add this to your
standard but Enterprise Manager also
provides the ability for you to create
your own rules or actually create your
own configuration extension as we call
it to gather the type of information
that's specific to you so if we don't
provide the rule or the configuration
metric out of box you can certainly add
those very easily to enterprise manager
to complete your come your compliance
hierarchy
so let's drill down a bit into Stig
compliance so for those of you familiar
with this this is the security technical
implementation implementation guide
published by Adso and basically you know
it's a set of technical guidance to help
secure and harden systems from malicious
computer attacks and so it's available
at various levels operating systems
applications such as databases
middleware etc and used by a variety of
different government agencies and even
non-government agencies that are
concerned about security so the
challenge here is that in the past this
has been a manual effort to check and
validate conformance of this also once
these are implemented there's the
possibility of drift over time which can
result in undetected violations until
the checks are repeated and so this can
be very costly and time intensive to
validate so basically what we're trying
to do is addresses by automating the
solution to continuously validate
against the state standards we want to
provide proactive alerting of the
changes resulting in non conformance and
also give the compliance and violation
scores to monitor those in the report
like format
so basically we have the stick
compliance for 11g databases will be
coming out soon with the version for 12c
databases as well and what this is is
really a turnkey solution to
automatically audit and report
conformance of the databases against the
Stig benchmark this is based on the
district security implementation guide
and basically this is built around
Enterprise Manager the agent and
database lifecycle management and this
is compatible with version 12 104 and
higher of Enterprise Manager this is
licensed as part of the database
lifecycle management which has been the
topic that we've been covering today
so basically the compliant standard
consists of several different components
are actually implemented in several
different ways so as we go through the
complete stig standard basically nearly
100% of the of the parameters are it if
they're scripted if they have scripts
associated with them to check them we
have completely automated those within
an apprise manager itself for others
that will require manual intervention
we've provided interview checks and have
tried to automate that process itself
and then for the remaining those might
require manual attestation to confirm
those and in terms of the categories
that this covers this covers both the
Oracle database instances as well as the
Oracle home installation itself so
there's checklist associated with each
of these different categories
here's just a couple screenshots showing
the list of these standards so on the
left-hand side here you can see the
Oracle home procedures and basically the
different rules associated with those
provided out of the box and on the right
hand side you can see the database
instance procedures at a high level so
you can see it's very comprehensive
robust and as the standards are changing
we're continually updating those
standards to comply with the stig
standards as well
when you drop down into the specific
compliance rules I just wanted to show
you that the type of information we
provide for those so basically there's a
name for the rule at a high level so the
number and some brief information about
what it does we also set up the severity
so this can be a warning alert or a
critical or of course you can modify
this as you'd like there's a description
of what this compliance rule is and then
the rationale around why that is
implemented this way and then in more
detail we provide here if it's a
scriptable rule we can actually provide
the query associated that Enterprise
Manager is using to check on this
particular rule
so whenever a violation occurs we
provide very detailed and actionable
findings associated with that violation
so we identified the offending database
we provide the specific check findings
the date discovered and we provide a
guided resolution recommended resolution
associated with that and that's that
recommendation has offered a per the
stig documentation itself so here you
can see again screenshot just showing
the event detail associated with it
showing the specifical the specific rule
the target database instance when it
occurred the message that the
administrator would have seen the event
type etc and then here you can see the
guided resolution that's recommended
with that particular violation
and then well of course managing all
this true the console can be very useful
for administrators who are using the
console for other purposes we've also
integrated this in with our other
reporting capabilities so we built in
flexible and integrated reporting so we
can view result again not just across
single databases but across groups of
databases we can do historical trends
and scores so look at how compliance is
scored over time see if you can see if
there's any trends that need to be
monitored and all these reports and
information can be scheduled and emailed
automatically they can be downloaded in
two different formats such as PDF HTML
reports or Excel type reports as well
in terms of the stig implementation
that's very simple to implement
basically select the standard that you
want to enforce select the targets that
you want to apply them to and then the
results can be run immediately in real
time or you can schedule them to run at
specific times run Daly's is the default
but you can certainly modify that as
you'd like and then as the violations
occur you can determine how to receive
those notifications what alert level and
which administrators would receive those
as well
you
so basically this compliance solution
provides them some great features it
provides high automation for ensuring
compliance and avoiding drift across
your various targets it provides
continuous auditing of these compliance
settings you can proactively alert on
the findings across all your different
targets and it can provide recommended
remediation or actually do manual or
automated remediation on these targets
and the reporting capabilities are very
flexible and robust as well
so with that we've gotten to very close
to the top of the hour
I want to perhaps have the operator to
see if we have any questions at this
time and while we're doing this I'm
going to scan and see if we have any
chat questions or Pete if there's any
questions that came up on chat that you
want to answer verbally that would be
great too
so I'll turn it over to the operator to
see if we have any questions if you
would like to ask an audio question
please press star 1 on your telephone
keypad again that's star one to ask an
audio question
you
if you would like to ask a question
please press star-1 your question come
from a line of david shocky if you
listed the minimum version of the client
that was needed is there is a maximum
version can we usual latest absolutely
so many of the features in terms of
compliance and consistency management's
are actually included in the 13.1
version which is the latest version of
Enterprise Manager but the state
compliance requires at least 12 104 or
or higher okay and can you use the 13
client with 11 databases yeah that's
that's a very good question so the
version of Enterprise Manager does not
have any relationship to the version
supported the database version target
supported so Enterprise Manager can
basically manage back to I think
officially we're certified back to 11 to
databases but technically you can go
back to 10g databases if you need to
thank you thank you if you would like to
ask an audio question please press star
1 your next question comes from the line
of Terri Coker
hi Terry go ahead
carry your line is open
it it shows 12 you need a 12-1 agent is
that mean you need to 13 see Enterprise
Manager and then along with a 12-1 agent
or can this be done from the 12c
Enterprise Manager yep so this can
basically be done completely within
Enterprise Manager 12c so starting at 12
104 that's the version of the Enterprise
Manager infrastructure including the
agent that you want to deploy on any
targets that you want to manage
thank you okay
there are no further questions at this
time
okay
well great I'd like to thank everyone
for your time and attention today so I
believe those who have registered will
be able to send you a link to the
presentation if you'd like also on the
Oracle technical network we do have a
specific page on these solutions where
you can drill down in more detail to
explore this as well as look at some
pre-recorded demos and other information
so I'd like to thank everyone for
joining us today appreciate your time
and wishing you a great day thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
