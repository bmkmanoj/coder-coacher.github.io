few seconds the installation finishes
and we click close to exit the setup
wizard now there will be a shortcut
created on your desktop and we can go to
this application by double-clicking it
once the application is launched for the
first time there will be a new directory
named IMS home created on your desktop
this directories includes all DB files
and all loft bells now let us find out
what this vacation can do for us there
are three main tabs English a vacation
tap inventory tab seals log and tap
pattern Discoverer the image rate have
provides all the functions we need to
deal with the inventory items the field
lock tab allows us to look up and handle
sales log and get summary of daily sales
and the pattern Discoverer will find
sales patterns based on items all time
I'd like to introduce the tab inventory
at first they are four sub tabs you look
up an item add a new Adam at a new
vendor and add a new category now let me
demonstrate how they walk I'll add some
new categories first I take clothes and
food and example here note that as
different categories you only have
different extra attributes that's a
textbook is designed for the extra
attribute names for example will fill
color size for clothes well with your
date for food then I'll add some new
vengeance inga tab at a new vendome that
may create two windows here please make
sure the vendor name here is different
with that of any other vendor which
already exists
now we can add some new item in the tap
add a new item at first I need to select
the category for this new item place
note that when i select a different
category the extra or triggers out here
will change accordingly I'd like to the
left lobe here then I feel ask you I to
name price quantity vendor name and
extra attribute we have to make sure
that though asking you here is unique
besides the vendor name here should
match one of the vendors which already
exist otherwise you should add this
better first
finally we can look up update or delete
items and vendors in a tab look up and
item items can be searched by item name
or sku here says average item has a
different ascii you looking up by ask
you you may be better if we leave this
textbook blank and click search we'll
get all the items here with a total
number of records at at the same time we
can update or delete items directly from
here please note that the update of
asking you or vendor is not allowed now
I'll update the price the quantity and
the extra of tribal site of the first
item
click the button update item okay it's
done then I'll delete the second item
here click the button delete item and
then the record is deleted permanently
the research update and deletion of
vendors work the same way except that
the update of vendor name is not allowed
then let's move on to the second meant
ad sales log they are three sub tabs
under this meant have look up sales log
add a new sales record and a daily sales
summary I will add some sales records
here please make sure the sku here
already exists otherwise you will be
asked to I to the item for the asking
you first and it is permitted that the
price here is different from the price
in item record if we leave the textbook
of sales time blank the system used
current time at the sales time for this
yields record if we fill the textbook
with a run time for mate the system will
give us a warning the string is not a
valid time
now we can look up seals log in the tab
look up seals log once we select start
date and end date phil and SGU and click
go will find all the seals log from the
specified item from the start date to
the end date leaving the textbook of sku
blank means searching for all the seals
log of all the items during the period
meanwhile there is the total number for
the fund reports and there is a gross
profit calculated from all these records
the update for the sales log is not
permitted but we can delete any fungus
eels log directly by clicking the button
delete let's note that when we add a new
seals log for some item the quantity of
the item will be reduced according to
the sword quantity in a sealed wall but
deletion of seals log will never bring
the reduced among back we can also
delete all the seals log during some
period here and this will be
demonstrated later now let's go to the
tab delay seals summary after specifying
the field state and clinking go we can
get all the gross sales data for all the
categories and there is a total gracias
calculated for all the seals on that day
