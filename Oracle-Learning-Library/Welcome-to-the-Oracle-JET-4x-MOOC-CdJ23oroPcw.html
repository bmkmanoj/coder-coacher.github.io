the oracle javascript extension toolkit
massive open online course yes
that's a really long name we'll just
call it Oracle jet MOOC going forward
and will often be using the term jet
instead of Oracle jet during the next
three weeks you'll be taken through a
wide range of technologies concepts and
best practices that make up jet before
you get started though we want to
provide some helpful tips and insights
and look into the resources that will be
available during the course as well as
sets and expectations about how the
course is laid out and delivered let's
start off by saying what this course is
not this course is about Oracle jet the
javascript extension toolkit not about
JavaScript itself not about the
JavaScript language and not about the
JavaScript ecosystem you are encouraged
to explore the JavaScript language and
ecosystem and related tools and
technologies to get familiar with them
before getting started with the course
basic JavaScript knowledge should be all
that is required though you may find
yourself needing to do some research now
and then to understand some of the
syntax used depending on your level of
JavaScript knowledge we have found that
quite a few developers have been able to
learn JavaScript at the same time as
learning Oracle jet next let's look at
how the course is delivered and how you
can get the most out of it
there will be ten parts to each of the
three weekly lessons these parts will
include a short video of no more than
about 10 minutes in length these videos
provide you with an overview of the
topic for that part and lead you in a
proper direction for performing the
homework that will be assigned at the
end of most parts as well to get the
most out of each topic you will need to
spend as much time as you need to work
on that homework task at the end of each
week there's a quiz with 10 questions
the answers to all of the questions are
covered in the videos and her work that
you have watched and worked on during
the week
each of the three weeks will provide a
different look at
how jet is put together each part of the
three weekly lessons will be delivered
in a similar way what you'll need to do
to get the most out of each week will
vary from week to week in the first week
you're going to look at some of the
underlying technologies that jet uses
and a lot of the homework tasks will be
reviewing websites as well as writing
some basic code that uses those
technologies in the context of a simple
jet application in the second week the
focus is on jet features themselves UI
components theming layout routing
validators etc pretty much all of the
things that you will use to actually
build the user interface of your
application homework for this week may
seem light at first but you should
explore and try different aspects of the
topic on your own
be creative try new things it's this
time of exploration that will help you
get the most out of the different topics
the third week will review more of the
framework type topics these include
things like security testing packaging
connecting your application to Oracle
cloud services integrating third-party
UI components and the very important
topic of the composite component
architecture known as CCA or the web
component approach that jet takes
homework for this week can be quite
involved it may take more time to set up
and configure external services and
features to get the Oracle jet app that
you've written connected to that service
feature or technology so be prepared to
spend a little more time on the homework
in the final week obviously you're not
going to get in-depth step-by-step
instructions from a short ten-minute
video look at those videos as starting
points and the homework as the area
where you want to explore and learn the
most from to help with your exploration
of Oracle jet during the coming three
weeks we have a discussion forum for all
students to join and interact with each
other
think of this as the virtual classroom
for this MOOC when using the discussion
group
please add the tag MOOC to all your
questions this will make it very easy
for fellow students to see related
questions as well as possible answers to
similar questions that they may have
please can involve with a discussion
group answer questions as well as ask
them if you know the answers it's not
only a great chance to learn about jets
but also a chance to meet others that
are sharing the same journey so get
involved in a similar way please use
Twitter to share your new learnings and
insights when you add the Oracle jet
Twitter handle to your tweets you'll
find that you'll get retweeted very
quickly so that knowledge about jet can
be shared and so that others and the
community can find out about the
activity that is taking place around the
jet MOOC please don't be shy send out a
tweet with the Oracle jet Twitter handle
and let the world know about the
interesting new things you're learning
about also please note that whenever you
need to find the links to the developers
guide the cookbook the discussion forums
the blogs
just remember Oracle jet or Agha
that one URL provides you with all the
links to everything you need
Oracle jet org is where it all begins
some of you may have completed the
previous version of the jet MOOC is
there a reason to take the MOOC again
and what are the key differences we have
tried to keep the MOOC as similar to the
previous version as possible we have not
redesigned it instead we have updated it
with new content in particular the new
custom element syntax has had an impact
on the demos while also the increased
relevance of web components via the
composite component architecture is
addressed to in the third week if it
were to redesign the MOOC as a whole we
would place a far stronger focus on the
composite component architecture and we
may do that in future another new
feature is the Oracle jet command-line
interface which we will be using
throughout the MOOC in short the
differences compared to the previous
MOOC are not on the conceptual level
well the syntax is different the CCA
components have a greater prominence and
the command-line interface has
and the first week is also structured
differently in that you start off with
an Oracle jet application and learn
about technologies like require and
knock out in the context of that jet
application to conclude this point you
are more than welcome to take the make a
second time to update yourself on these
points and to refresh your knowledge
what do you need to install and setup in
order to do the Oracle jet MOOC you're
assumed to have installed the Oracle jet
command-line interface and to have
created your first Oracle jet
application before the MOOC begins in
part one of the first week therefore
before starting the milk go to the
Oracle jet get started page to set up
your environment use any editor that
supports JavaScript HTML and CSS and
note that we recommend NetBeans IDE
because it has great support for Java
Script it lets you open jet applications
based on the fact that they contain a
package.json file and also because
NetBeans has terminal integration
meaning that you can run the command
line directly from inside NetBeans also
make sure to use the facilities provided
by your browser such as the chrome
developer tools in Chrome for debugging
purposes ok let's get started
going to the browser put in there Oracle
Jetta
org press enter you will be redirected
to this location you will find yourself
on the home page of Oracle jet click the
get started button and here are all the
instructions you need for setting up
your first jet application begin by if
you have not set up node setting up node
following this link here once you've
done that you will have NPM and so then
on the command line you will type NPM -
gyah for global and you'll install the
Oracle jet command-line interface once
this instruction is completed you will
have the ode jet utility available and
in the same way as you typed in TN
before on the command prompt you will
now type a jet followed by the word
correct and then the name of a project
whatever name you like my
my demo my amazing application as one
word without spaces followed by - -
template equals and then one of the
templates so these pipe symbols mean
these are different templates one of
which you must choose so you would type
- - template equals and we will start
with nav drawer in the course during the
first week there will be one part
dedicated specifically to the Oracle
Jett command-line interface but for the
moment all you need to know is this a
jet create in the name of our project
and then - that template equals nav
drawer press ENTER and your application
will be created you will then CD into
that folder that's been created and you
will run a jet serve and you will see an
application opening in your browser once
you have set everything up within two
minutes you should have your application
corrected for you without any problems
alright we can see that we have the
oracle jet command line interface
installed because when we type a jet -
help a range of commands are shown and
these commands we're going to look at
throughout the course for the moment in
order to prepare for the first part of
the course we need to set up an
application so we type a jet and then
create which is one of the commands on
the oracle jet command-line interface
and then the name of our project and we
will call it my app in this case you can
name it whatever you like and we add in
here template is and then the name of a
template nav drawer and we press enter
and now the oracle jet command-line
interface is going to use npm under the
hood your node package manager to pull
down all the JavaScript libraries that
we need to construct an oracle jet
application and at the end of this
process we are going to have our first
oracle jet application generated for us
and we can see at the end of this
process all the different libraries that
are part of this project and then we see
the internet we get into CD my app and
then we can explore that
structure as we will do throughout the
course and just to check that everything
is okay we type Oh Jett serve and the
application will be served up into the
browser and here we have within two
minutes the starting point of our first
Oracle Jett application finally please
take your time it's not a competition
don't go too fast go slowly and
carefully and thoroughly through each
part of each lesson to your homework
tasks work through the Oracle Jett
cookbook and the developer guide using
the references that you'll be provided
throughout the MOOC and try and apply
the concepts to the business
requirements that you can expect to have
in the context in which you're working
thanks again for enrolling in the Oracle
Jett milk we hope you enjoy your time
exploring and learning about Oracle Jett
