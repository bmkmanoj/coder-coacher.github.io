i'm going to give you an overview of
some of the important standards for java
embedded some of the standards that are
already around others that probably
should be around in the new future or
that have been evolving around java
defined by other standard bodies and
platforms so I'm going to briefly group
it into those building blocks one is
about sensor support then somewhat
related to it m2m the NFC standard and
then some of the standards and
technologies that allow devices of all
kinds to communicate more securely with
each other so that's primarily the TPM
or some of the mobile variations and how
Java card can also be used in that
context so for those of you who may not
have met me has seen me in the JCB or
elsewhere I'm involved in many
open-source projects and one of the two
individual JCP ec members at the moment
and i also lead an eclipse project
called warmer which is somewhat related
to sensors as you will see so the java
code for the thing basically i was in
inspired by this picture is any of you
from New York no so basically this is a
pizza place that's exactly opposite
ground zero so I'm not sure if it was
there before nine eleven but I was at a
JCP meeting last year in New Jersey and
had a pizza they're actually quite good
and it's literally facing the new tower
that is built there so in a sense so not
only
am i involved in many java projects but
not always respected often supporting
them in various ways so that that's why
the Godfather rather than the the father
is kind of an appealing soon tournament
since this place and this picture is
facing ground zero when i was elected
into the executive committee first in
2008 following the disputes especially
around harmony and raise other issues
starting in 2007 the java community
process at java as a whole almost seemed
a bit like a ground zero for some time
so fortunately things have improved
especially this year there's a lot of
spirit in ways as java ones used to be
some years ago so i think it's getting
better so that was also one of the
inspirations why I i use this guy here
on my timeline and other places so first
i'm going to talk about sensors and type
safety those of you who hurt the
keynotes or other presentations may know
java is also heading towards a unified
pipe system but at the moment
unfortunately it's not there yet so for
performance reasons most developers use
primitive types and thanks to auto
boxing that often can result in
ambiguities or method name clashes with
the same signature like if you use a
primitive type and a complex type and
these are some of the most commonly
known IT disasters in recent history
like the Patriot missile mishap the
destruction of the ariane 5 due to a
floating point problem or the so-called
Gimli glider anybody from Canada
but I guess you may may nevertheless
have have heard about it at some point
that an air canada chat was fueled and
that was just the time when canada moved
over from the imperial system to the
metric system and in that fuel chain
some devices or people measuring the
fuel we're still using the old system
and other parts were using the new
system so in the enter the plane almost
ran out of fuel and just before it would
have crashed it made an emergency
landing on a small military airstrip
called Gimli then this is another one
the the famous mass orbiter so the one
of the precursors to curiosity and at
the recent Eclipse meeting somebody
who's involved with NASA and ISA
actually literally said there was some
person who was supposed to to convert
all the data from one system to the
other so this was not done automatically
or in the cloud or something it was done
pretty many manually at some point they
were forced to reduce costs and figured
Oh what is this person doing why are we
actually paying him and they didn't know
in the first place because obviously he
was supporting some embedded system that
was hidden somewhere in the guts of this
whole mission so they fired him and the
data was sent unconverted and that
actually caused the whole mass orbiter
and with it the 125 million dollars to
crash or to get lost in space forever
and this was another famous example of a
near disaster it is the very curious
happening in outer space some of the STI
experiments in the 80s we're also trying
to do measurements with laser beams on
how to best position some of those
military satellites or weapons in space
so laser beam fired from the one of the
mountains in Hawaii was supposed to be
reflected from the Space Shuttle at a
time actually 11 of the space shuttles
that you have just ended up in a museum
in the last couple of months what
actually happened what's this
and why did it was later on disclosed I
hope you can read that so basically
instead of 10,000 23 feet above the sea
level which is the height of the Mauna
Kea Mountain accidentially it was
processed as 10,000 23 nautical miles
which is of course quite quite
significantly larger in that that's why
the Space Shuttle turned upside down and
was aiming for some point 10,000 23
miles or some 10,000 miles above it oops
yeah so unit has student find this these
problems and you often have ambiguities
when you have when you process sensor
radials what else do they have in common
well as you as you clearly saw most of
these devices or software programs we're
running inside an embedded environment
it on the plane on the spacecraft
missile or something similar so all of
these issues happened either in a mobile
real time or embedded environment so
there are a couple of approaches to to
measurement one was osgi and it actually
still exists it has a SI metric only
system with no conversions other than
that at least it has a very limited
ability to notice quantities I will I
will show that in a small example then
chase are 2565 who is sort of java
mobile sensor api does any of you have a
mobile that's actually still running
java m.e or chi 2 m.e okay is it running
sensor API is it running sent mobile
sensor API chase are 256 okay i've also
i will show you a few small code
snippets on up since the room is not so
huge i can actually then show you to
life runtime of that i made it work
although as you as you can probably see
that's not the latest nokia lumia so
this has also been around for a while
and it's unfortunately not under active
development and when when it came out
even nokia itself who
who's suspected of this basically didn't
provide it in most of the handset so I
had to to upgrade this in the Nokia
developer forum and when I installed the
runtime it actually gave me a warning
saying like oh this is still pre alpha
experimental code be aware so it's it's
even though the spec itself is final and
was accepted by the java community
process nokia itself hasn't really
rolled it out and in those phones where
it does it's still considered
experimental so it's definitely not
something that seems and last but not
least of course nokia is now heading for
microsoft so they're reasonably unlikely
to to ever also continue this so the
same as with the OSGi measurement mobile
sensor api although it it was included
with at least the most recent java
mobile embedded api that orgo just
launched but unfortunately the standard
itself is unlikely to be maintained or
improved in any way beyond a recent
maintenance release plus of course it's
from a time when there was no generics
and I will also show it at a lot of
those so essentially it's using
primitives and just add something like a
unit that's the only thing that it knows
but it has no clue of a quantity or
whatever so you can basically do
whatever you want and as long as the
unit is of class type unit it will
accept it this was an approach where I
was speculated a couple of years ago
actually we place the expected who was
no longer able to contribute enough time
for various reasons first and foremost
it seemed that since Java was too
monolithic and the whole internet of
things and m2m is just starting to
really gain traction in recent years and
we propose this
about seven years ago so at the time it
wasn't first of all nobody in the emmy
at the time even took notice that the
sensor api already had some of that so
there was no communication between the
two sides now this year we are finally
merging the two executive committees and
you may also have seen in the keynote
that the whole separation between server
AE SE desktop and mobile was pretty much
blood because some of the presentations
seamlessly moved from embedded tiny
devices or kiosks to large servers so at
the time when we actually proposed that
unfortunately the whole Java ecosystem
wasn't ready for it yet and even though
the final specs that are out there
including 256 have never really been
adopted and are practically dead even
though they are final this was used for
example by another standard called QAPI
by the open geospatial consortium you
will hear more from them in a minute
when I'm coming to the whole sensor web
aspect so even though 275 was stopped
and turned down by the executive
committee this non final spec currently
has more use cases out there especially
by a queue API than the actual final
speck of sensor api that nokia sent out
so what we actually did after that is we
removed it into a independent open
source project called unit units of
measurement api we also refactor it
slightly so it is somewhat closer to
most of the specs because most of the
public API is only exposed via
interfaces and it's up to the
implementations to define even some of
the standard libraries like metric or
non-metric
and there are at least four or five
independent implementations as of now
one of them being it keeps wobble so
warm or is it eclipsed incubator project
which builds on top of ICU for che which
is first and foremost a unicode
localization standard with a lot of
contributors Google for example IBM
there they're currently most actively
involved or they also see
implementations we're even companies
like Apple use it and on top of ICU 4G
which also defines a unit and a measure
value as the two core components I have
put the implementation of unit API which
makes it more type safe and unit context
safe then I see you forge a would be as
such and one other thing that we did was
that another Eclipse project called OHF
had an implementation of the unified
codes for unit of measurement or you
cuum standard which is used rather
heavily in the embedded space especially
when it comes to healthcare and
hospitals because everywhere where hl7
messages are sent between different
healthcare providers all the units
whether it's how many milliliters of
blood a patient has been taken from or
how many milligrams of a certain
substance they're supposed to take to
get better in any case all the units are
defined by the unified code for units of
measurement or the you come standard so
you come is kind of a meat of format
that can be used anywhere from XML to
chasten or
plain text so these are some of the
previous standards that the the you cuum
standard has built on top or extended it
and especially with those of you who
heard the keynote by Robert pallet
yesterday at the whole marine and
exploring organizations and institutions
that are in the US and around the world
they're also using the you come standard
for many of the data exchange and so are
most of the health care providers
especially through hl7 so the next
aspect for sensors is actually
distributed sensors or sensors in the
the cloud and the internet of thing
that's where a set of standards called
sensor web comes into place
now that's the definition of signs with
a coordinated observation infrastructure
composed of a distributed collection of
resources that collect if you behave as
a single autonomous so it's effectively
like a cloud but a cloud of sensor
enabled devices and also servers so
there are a couple of approaches out
there have any of you heard of Kozma or
as it was previously known as pshew be
some a British initiative where you can
put your again at you new board or your
Raspberry Pi or whatever embedded device
and expose it through an open API and
access the values of these sensors from
anywhere in the world
so sensor web is one of the standards
defined by the open geospatial
consortium mainly focusing on sensor web
and the sensor modeling language here
but there are several others including
for example the KML standard that Google
uses for Google Maps and some of the
other products around it like Google
Earth so that that is also another ogc
standard and unfortunately as as we we
saw in recent weeks some of the vendors
like Apple that are sometimes accepting
standards when it's inevitable but in
most cases not very open at least to
communication with others if they had
used some of those open standards
especially around KML or so even by
defining their own product but by being
a little more open to communication and
to data exchange and to widely accepted
standards they probably would have
avoided this fiasco with the Apple maps
because essentially it's just a mismatch
of mapping data you have a nice fancy
with 3d picture that worked perfectly
fine in the keynote but then the
underlying data is just crap or
mismatched
so the OPC is also a nope open standards
a body that was founded just a few years
before job I've even existed so one of
the Duke Awards as you may have heard or
may not have heard was given to the
UNHCR humanitarian organization under
the United Nations that helps people
deal with floods or disasters of all
kinds around the world so this will this
is from a similar case where research
institution in the Ukraine participates
in help too for example the flood
victims in Mozambique or other similar
global emergency cases and they use the
sensor web to monitor for example where
the floods take place and where there
are safe places to build refugee camps
and anything else that's related to
either measuring like for example the
water level or Q spatial which is also
governed by the open cheese geospatial
consortium and although I'm not sure if
that project was exactly explain but
chances are way high that whatever the
United Nations Organization got its Duke
award yesterday they're also going to
use some of that at least some of the
OGC standards will definitely be part of
that if it's nonsense a web so that's
another example for weather prediction
can be quite handy for example in areas
where you give regular hurricanes or
similar storms
sensor ml is the markup language which
allows you to exchange data between
different parts so basically sensor web
is more or less like the cloud
infrastructure and sensor ml is one of
the standards or data formats that are
used to exchange information in a
consistent way here's an example and
although this one is using I so as you
can hopefully see even though it's a
little bit small font the uom here is
basically stands for units of
measurement and the the definition
actually says that the standards body
that governs this unit is for example I
so in other cases this could be you cuum
or any other system of units that you're
using to exchange but that makes sure
that if you exchange data with the
sensor ml if you send it as you cuum
nobody can misinterpret the data when
they receive it they will know which
unit standardization table is used or
which unit code format is used and so
they cannot misinterpret Celsius for
Fahrenheit or yeah actually here here
for example you can also see that the
temperature and it's clearly defined
that it's Celsius so
I'm going to show
so that's just a very small example of
the OSGi measurement it's it's only the
console so one example where
multiplication works through the osgi
measurement is for example here but you
can do things like kilograms per meter
and for certain use cases with so did
you see that nike wristband thing
yesterday in the keynote so maybe for
those who are using such we spend two to
lose a little bit of the weight kilogram
per meter may actually make sense like
how many meters or how many kilometers
or miles you have to run to lose two
hundred kilogram or maybe less the
exception above actually shows that
there is a limited safety harness in
osgi measurements that it understands
meter and kilogram do not have the same
dimension and they are not the same
quantity so it doesn't allow you to add
media to kilogram now the second example
is using normal so not only is it
translated because i have a german Wes
here so some of the values like this you
will see in in the german translation
but for any other local that's supported
you will you have full translation into
your individual language than here for
example square meters and here are some
examples like 2.5 meters per second for
velocity just briefly so although some
of that may become possible in java 8 in
the future with type annotations there
have been a couple of concepts although
they are not
they're not really supported by the
expert group they just define the
compile and then they expect some other
project or person to actually implement
it on top of that what you can do with
unit API already is you have compile
time safety so if I uncomment that you
can see immediately there's a there's a
compiler error you don't even have to
run it so I ohci measurement gives you
this error message only at runtime chase
are 256 gives you nothing at all there's
no error message whatsoever and this is
another case where as you can see some
other operation that is also sensitive
it actually tells you you have something
of type length and you cannot put the
mouse in there yes
and tip depending on what was the
original value you may then get it
formatted in either of the two so if you
have for example meters and you add fee
to it you would still unless you convert
it again you can convert it it can
format it into almost everything else
you can you can use meters you can add
feet to it and then you can even edit
that example for for Poland for example
in a historic unit of measurement
obsolete polish that was l and in
germany you also had something somewhat
similar in the in the past which was
called la so you can basically use
meters add feet to it and then either
format or convert this into Ellen or any
other location specific so as long as
it's its length you can combine all of
these with multiplication and division
it's a little bit different of course
there there is a certain flexibility
where you may not always know what the
resulting quantity is but especially
with addition and subtraction it's
always type safe
okay so I small example as promised is
this sense of sample and here basically
i define a unit and i can define any
unit the spec basically says here you
can define how units so basically i
created a unit called move
and so once just
don't cop don't call any pay lines but
just pass it through so basically the
the unit move is it's running on this
mobile of course after it has been
patched and enabled with chairs are 256
so the code that I'm just showing you
here is actually running on the device
okay that brings us to machine to
machine and that is although there were
even some expectations i believe by the
former CTO SEO of Erickson who predicted
that the Internet of Things and the
whole m2m market will even be somewhat
ten times that in 2050 so by 2 by 2022
predict around 20 half billion devices
30 years later that is likely to be 10
times as much and of course you can also
hear see that from 100 so into a million
to two and a half billion it's it's
almost 20 times what it used to be in
2010 so the internet of thing and
machine-to-machine communication deals
with all kinds of vertical domains here
are some examples
here's one example that also again
brings us to the value of hl7 and the
standards like you cuum because it deals
with scales or heartbeat sensors even
pacemakers or external measuring devices
like your blood pressure monitor or a
sugar monitor or a pill box that
actually tells with an RFID chip what
the quantity of pills and any
concentration of substances in milligram
is in there of course since the Internet
of Things is globally it definitely
makes sense to know what this is in a
different country so if you get like a
product from Asia or a product from
Europe and you you're looking at it here
in America and you're still used to the
US customers standard then having
something like romo in the middle allows
you to show you that in your unit system
that you're comfortable with that's
another example we we saw yesterday the
Container Terminal vendor who's also
using javafx and they were actually
featuring customer wear and currently
most actively involved the worst line so
I cannot disclose where some of these
things may already be used but these are
potential use cases where the container
is tagged with an RFID chip and that
allows the whole supply chain to
basically find out where it was sent and
where it went through and what what
states for example if it's a cooling
container then you may even be able to
to monitor whether the temperature has
always been at the right level another
example although what I think they used
RFID chips actually in some cases for
house or other livestock animals I I
helped design a system in Austria to
prevent BSE and similar diseases and in
that case we also had to basically
monitor and store every single livestock
and even its pedigree and in some of the
cases nowadays if you for example you
you have a cow out on the field or in
your barn then a lot of them are also
carrying RFID chips already where the
the vet basically just scans the RFID
chip which is NFC reader and then those
ok this is the cow racy and then in the
system he he exactly can track the
pedigree of that animal so here's the
stack of the m2m tools this is actually
an an m2m industry working group at
Eclipse Foundation which builds around
as you can see the languages are not
only chava here they include C and C++
and newer is anybody here from the from
the Brazilian chinga TV
but we match them in in Sao Paulo during
the last JCP meeting and just Java
conference that was organized by zoo
Java and the company totals has a
variety of TV middleware we're also one
of the two main languages for that
chinga standard is Java and the other
one is Luis Luis a dynamic scripting
language that is roughly comparable to
the likes of why it's not as simple as
JavaScript but it's probably more along
the lines of Titan so it's it's typed
but more dynamically typed and yeah if
when I looked at some of the dual code
and I've been working a lot with patent
recently in our DevOps project so even
though we the containers that we were
truly deliver mostly contained large
java ee applications but the means to
move those containers mostly using
patent and newer is a scripting language
so if you're if you know some languages
like Python or google dart then Louis
it's relatively similar but it's it's
mostly for embedded devices so the next
main area is NFC it was actually a
little more his historic survey that
Nokia did about registered mobile
devices so
enhanced and if see or NFC as such is
based on a whole variety of ISO
standards and enhanced NFC is basically
the umbrella or the the comedy
combination of the most relevance of
these so these are some of the possible
use cases the wireless paid terminals
exchanging photos between different
mobile devices or the NYE skills that we
saw yesterday can also use NFC if you
have an NFC chip on your embedded
raspberry Arduino or whatever board or
tall gates or access gates at
conferences other venues or for public
transportation and of course you can
also have things that in some cases they
are using these freedom n or
two-dimensional barcodes now on on a
poster and as you probably hurt for the
time being at least Apple is not using
NFC so they mainly focus on the on the
camera to properly scan that barcode it
works in some cases but I've also seen
during concerts where basically the
barcode wasn't even readable or
something was misinterpreted so i don'ti
also some of you probably even had a
mobile phone that was still using an es
de infrared communication have any of
you ever used that or did you own the
phone in your history that had this
infrared chip yeah so in some cases I
even use that for tattooing between an
old phone and I can't
was nokia motorola but it was off of the
generation around 2000 and I is that to
use the phone as a modem and then we've
infrared it enabled itself what you can
do with the tech common tethering now
through blue tool for other channels but
back then it was using the infrared
sensor and the palm that I used to surf
the internet was on the other side so
basically they had to be perfectly
aligned and if you're sitting in a plane
or in a wet not then it wouldn't work
but in a bus or in a trained and of
course as soon as it boot wiggle the
Internet's gone and although for
scanning barcodes it may not be exactly
as sensitive but the whole idea of Apple
using this for their payments kind of
reminded me of well some people would
even use studios geared up for some of
that and essentially since it's a it's
an optical exchange of information it is
also somewhat similar so NFC's are
already used quite frequently as you can
see even in San Francisco for example so
some of the bart public transport well
people who live here and use the season
ticket on a cart will be using NFC the
same for the oyster in London or in
Paris many other places of the world in
dubai although they they haven't they
usually quite secretive over there they
haven't exposed the exact iso standard
that they're using but I was actually
actively involved in building some of
the infrastructure for the RTA in Dubai
in early 2009 and now they even got a
metal there although i think i think it
doesn't have much more stations than for
example when you go in san francisco
from one terminal of the airport to the
other but yeah
Dubai has an airport and Dubai also has
a metal so I think it goes from the
airport there to that big building
bullsh Khalifa I think is the new name
for it so RFC is used quite a lot
although it NFC is use quite a lot
although it's not used as much from one
device to the other at the moment so for
peer-to-peer you won't see it as much
but it is used very heavily in access
control public transportation and other
so mostly for b2b or b2c not so not so
much for customers to customer or end
user to end user so open NFC is one of
the main open source projects to allow
your applications to use NFC
but similar to its next neighbor cheese
are 256 that we just heard before which
is the mobile sensor API the NFC cheese
are 257 is no longer supported by open
SE so basically the most recent versions
of open NFC did support android 4 or
whichever version first provides an NFC
chip as long as your device is also
equipped with it there are native linux
editions there was a windows CD edition
which has also be discontinued so at the
moment there is no no official edition
of open NFC for Windows Mobile which
could be either due to lack of resources
or to some kind of legal restriction
that Microsoft doesn't allow certain
things to be done with an open source
API but they prefer to do this in their
own stack microsoft also has a sensor
API very well and most of the nokia
devices that you can buy now are most
likely going to use that but they will
no longer support chase are 256 for the
time being so this is kind of similar so
even though oracle may not really
appreciate you hear that but android for
open NFC and for NFC is currently the de
facto reference platform if you want to
use java bindings and then make use of
NFC from your within your java
application hopefully that's going to
change but of course that would also
require something like the cheese are
257 to be massively rear amped at least
as much as we heard yesterday JMS has
recently been upgraded because most of
these also including the java mobile
sensor api they are from the same time
when GMS one was started most of them
are hopelessly outdated and no longer
up to date for modern Java platforms so
much time if you left okay probably
about 15 minutes yeah that will allow a
little more Q&amp;amp;A so now the last area I'm
going to cover is the aspect of security
these are some of the actual use cases
for example a pizza chain here in
America is already using trusted Java
and the TPM on some of the devices to
ensure that the supply chain is not
compromised and that the pit is also
correctly delivered or to protect IP in
the cloud for example Netflix also uses
some aspects of trusted environment even
a mobile devices from what I heard at
the NFC world forum that took place in
Nice a little over a week ago where I
was presenting trust each other there so
of course a way important motivation
would be to catch a thief I took that
especially because the conference was
taking place in this and this old movie
with Gary grant and Grace Kelly was
located in these just around the corner
from where she became princess later on
so the trusted platform on anything from
large service to the recently released
java embedded se7 where this is also
compatible assuming that your embedded
device running this
embedded version of Java actually has a
TPM so I'm not going to go too much into
detail about the trusted computing there
was a presentation going to again I did
here last year at h-hour one and if
you're interested in in any of the
technologies in particular especially
trust each other then please check it
out at kcpt.org or at java.net it's all
offered way transparently and for
anything that's based on java embedded
se7 of course you can use trust each
other to to ensure that your
transactions have not been compromised
and the integrity of your code now on
mobile devices there have been at least
two other main developments or standards
and technologies that are primarily
defined by a group called the global
platform one is the trusted execution
environment and there are systems like
arms trustzone that also make use of
this today they sit on top of the te te
is a more software side even though it
makes use of the of the hardware and the
security system it does not necessarily
rely on on an actual chip so that he is
out of the freezer only variation of
security mechanisms that do not require
a specific chip either on your smart
card or via a java card or something or
being an actual TPM
present for real trusted computing the
alternative and that's currently
preferred by most online banks and
similar vendors is the so-called secure
element
so they're currently free approaches one
is based on the SIM card that the secure
element is is granted through your
actual chip in the sim card the other
one is an embedded security element with
a that is more or less like a like a TPM
but on a chip so it's kind of the mobile
version of the TPM and although the
current version of trusted Java is
targeted primarily for the actual TPM
standard we are as soon as java mobile
and ser growing together for upcoming
versions of the java platform we are
actually considering to allow traffic
chopper to not only work with a physical
TPM chip but also with a secure element
and where this is possible also on top
of a te and then of course the external
secure element would be smart cards or
any kind of fungal or similar external
devices that you plug into your main
device or board
a Java card it was just mentioned also
during the keynote what may only have
briefly mentions that Java card actually
just had its 15th birthday anniversary
so it's it's been around for a very long
time but that means it was also the most
frequently used version of Java anywhere
in the world with billions of devices
and as you can see the the sim can also
be used as a secure element so if you
have a card reader then you can also
have the Java card act as a secure
element in the in a trusted or secure
environment there was a presentation I
think two years ago where maybe not this
drone but a gentleman from the South of
France at the university had a research
project where Java card was used to
secure the communication between aerial
drones or also unmanned land-based
robotic devices that are somewhat like
drones but let's say the autonomous
devices like you're there are certain
vacuum cleaners already on the market or
long oils that you can remote control
from your mobile phone or from some
remote control and it will just go
around your house or the garden and due
to the work for you and of course the
autonomous self driving cars that Google
is currently working on are probably
something a little less hostile but
closer to home and actually closer to
people who are not
working for the military or at war with
some countries to also use it so he
presented various use case scenarios and
in fact he even showed some of the
drones being controlled or operated by
an embedded version of Android but the
external security and the secure element
was then provided via chava card okay so
time for questions I think we have yeah
but maybe at least five minutes for
questions we have any questions
well the TPM can definitely be used for
that and I'm I'm not sure whether it's
trusted I'd secure element or te but one
of the two is used for example by
Netflix there are they already shipping
that so you have certain devices and
Netflix basically then needs to register
you device so that your device is a
trusted device for netflix and only then
you will be allowed to download movies
and watch your money device so that is
kind of one of the means to protect
intellectual property via any of these
three or a combination of these free
trusted technologies well there there's
certain things like sealing that you can
also make use of with chase are two
three two one so you can use trusted
chava for sealing of con basically of
content the since the spec lid is a
research institution most of those are
actually field research but if you are
interested in your modern welcome to get
in touch with ie ik de to speculate
organization they can certainly provide
you use cases in the direction of
intellectual property when when you are
interested to to use the TPM for that
and they were also involved for example
in the Trust's own initiative by arm so
even though some of it is not at the
moment compatible with chase are three
two one there are other areas of digital
security and trusted platforms like the
te or others that you can use if you are
especially interested to do this on a
mobile device so it depends on whether
if you want to you mostly aim on the
desktop then you may have to rely that a
desktop or a laptop is already provided
with the TPM
and compared to the te e or Java cart
there of course still relatively low
volume in the market because until java
8 it was mostly way expensive high-end
business computers so if you have like a
two-hundred-dollar laptop you're most
likely not going to find a TPM in that
on that okay I think
yeah I I met at sea at the smart forums
in Nice they had like a poof over there
and at least they have a couple of
initiatives one is automotive and
although I I cannot disclose too much
but one of the implementations of the
unit API that I mentioned is also by
some automotive providers so they have
they're working on another
implementation for the automotive
business to make use of of unit API and
Etsy also has some of the standards one
of them is related to autonomous cars
similar to what Google is doing they
presented several of those and at least
the m2m industry working group member at
eclipse sierra wireless they are also
involved they have some laps in Toulouse
and they're actually collaborating with
etsy so even though I think Ed's is
currently not as involved in those
eclipse in rhetoric and group groups
some of the members are and I spoke to
to the representatives of Etsy where
they basically said they are not they
don't really see the Eclipse Foundation
for example as a whole to work with them
but the members that are involved in the
m2m industry working group like
companies like IBM or Sierra most of
them are working with them so that
they're there's some relevance and the
ace on going on I I also got the open to
your spatial consortium and some of its
leading projects to be involved in
another Eclipse industry working group
about location and chill
yes
the corporation
community process
sort of sort of it I don't know to what
extent you heard about the java
community process or the ec but Google
is and always was an EC member josh
block I think he recently left Google he
was of course one of the main committers
while he was still at son to the Java
platform so he's been contributing to
Java for a very long time he also wrote
some of the books that you probably may
have heard at other Java ones or similar
conferences so he's no longer
representing Google because as it looks
he left Google I don't know maybe he's
maybe we will soon her here that he also
moved to type safe and doing Scullin or
something like rot Johnson but he was
replaced by a Java user group activist
from the Silicon Valley a guy named van
Ripper or raipur not sure how you
pronounce it but he he was also at the
Prague meeting and he's representing
Google now and it seems at least there's
a little bit of communication going on
at the moment it doesn't look like the
time is right to say Android could
become a part of a future java embedded
or mobile platform I wouldn't out rule
it but at least there's currently no
official sources saying that this is
going on that doesn't mean they may not
communicate behind closed doors so after
the change of the EC representative and
also after some of the lawsuits have
been ruled to a certain extent that
Google has violated intellectual
property of Oracle to a much lower
extent than the lawsuit originally
claimed I guess at least there's some
some slow and careful communication
going on and for example one interesting
thing is also that the ICU forge a
project that i mentioned that is the
foundation for warm or van Ripper and
his colleagues we're working on some of
them are still working on that at Google
soul they are contributing in certain
areas but at least at the moment there's
no evidence that Android will become the
next Java and II but I would not I would
not bet against that at least parts of
it may so for example what you are
seeing in the area that open NFC is
probably a good example so some of these
areas especially google is also using
java code by the way so they are also
using it for their wallet so there are
standards especially in the area of
things like java card or ICU for che and
inside eclipse where google google and
Oracle are contributing side by side
much more actively than it may happen in
it in a TCP at the moment so did they
are working on some of these standards
and I guess when it comes to
localization geospatial and all the
stuff that I covered over this talk then
in some of these of course you see the
apple maps case was probably the best
example where Apple has cut all the ties
with Google over lots of lawsuits and
quarrels and disputes and that basically
ended up with their product being at a
much lower quality and for example if
you look at when Microsoft introduced
their mapping system with being they had
waked for some countries you have even
better mapping quality by being then you
may have with Google unfortunately at
least for the time being Apple hasn't
been so active there
and some of the status you you will
definitely see that Oracle's also using
google maybe not android but at least
maps or GWT and other other projects are
quite openly used
okay yeah unfortunately I couldn't cover
all of the slides so all of the links so
those are the most important links to
the Eclipse m2m industry working group
that you'll find on the on the slides it
keeps you all more units of measurement
API and the UQ most of the others it's
it's usually best to refer to for
example either the open geospatial
consortium or other relevant projects
open NFC for example so since I covered
so many different standards and projects
I haven't listed every single one of
them in the links but when you when you
look at them up for a particular keyword
that's of interest for you either NFC
sense or ml or others then you should be
able to find them and if you have any
questions or troubles finding the
information you need them please just
drop me an email or send me a tweet
depending on what you prefer to use for
communication</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
