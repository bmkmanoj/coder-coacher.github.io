sequel developer day tomorrow three
dream in this demo I will be showing you
how to use the search feature that was
in half in data modeler 33 so I
currently have the OE relational diagram
open if I want to do a search in this
bottle I click on this icon here the
search tab will open up and notice that
in the tab name will display the model
where the search will be done in in the
pattern field this is where I type in my
search I'll type in products and notice
that as I type the results will be
displayed below I can select whether or
not I want it to be case sensitive and
if I go down to my results I can double
click on it and it will take me to where
the object properties are where they
found the pattern of my search so in
here it found it in the comments and
this is where it found product I could
do a filter on the search results column
table or table view I'll select table
and I can save this search by just
typing in the name of the search click
on more and this is where i can select
the save it if i go back to the drop
down list notice that i have previous
searches are listed as well as the new
search that i just saved I can also
generate a report for my search results
click on the report button and the
reports dialog will open up here I can
select the various formats that I want
the report to be in you can select HTML
RTF PDF or into XL let's select Excel
type in the report title
I can select replace any boolean values
and also to show the filter in the
report when I select generate report
will show me where the report is saved
when I click OK it will automatically
open up the report and here is the
report in Excel format that shows my
search results will display the pattern
and all their information for my search
I can also select to view the common
properties in my search with the common
properties I can view the property name
the existing values and whether or not I
want to change it to a new value so for
example in the allow column the order
it's currently false I can go in and
type in true and apply this to all the
common properties so what I just showed
you is a simple search we also have a
advanced search mode that you can use
and right here this is where its you can
select to stop on first it's the default
so when it finds the first search
pattern then it automatically stop
rather than continue on so this was a
demonstration of how to use the search
feature in data modeler 33
