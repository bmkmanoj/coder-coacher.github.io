the previous video in this series
demonstrates what business insight you
can gain from pre-configured dashboards
now let's move on to creating custom
dashboards John the business owner wants
to track metrics ratios and trends that
are important to his business but the
pre-configured dashboards don't provide
the specific details he's looking for
inside allows John create custom
dashboards that can be used to visualize
indicators defined in the model and
extract it as his business process runs
to create a custom dashboard John needs
to enter the title choose a dashboard
icon and select the chart type in site
provides four types of charts pie chart
bar chart bubble chart and area chart
the parameters that need to be specified
vary based on the chart type John is
ready to create custom dashboards first
he wants to understand how many issues
are associated with each different
customer status the pie chart is the
best option to answer this question for
each slice of the pie count the number
of problems that have been received and
group the indicator by customer status
John will see the metrics right away
about forty-eight percent of the issues
come from standard customers 22% are
from gold customers and twenty-eight
percent are from silver customers John
also wants to see the distribution of
issues across regions per day a bar
chart can meet John's need for each bar
count the number of problems that have
been received and group them by region
set the x axis to instance start time
John immediately finds out that on March
22nd the total number of tickets reached
its peak the next day issues in the apac
area were significantly reduced however
tickets in the America region still
increased he makes a note of this so he
can dig deeper to find the reason John
can also create a bubble chart to track
the relationship between the retail
value of the products the total
resolution cost of the problem and how
many times the same problem has been
reported or he can configure an area
chart to show the number of escalations
over time and so much more from the
bottom of the console John can easily
find all the dashboards he's created and
switch among them
he can also edit the dashboards to make
changes as the business evolves the
cross drilling feature of insight is
also available to custom dashboards for
information on how to integrate external
dashboards created using the Oracle
business activity monitoring or BAM
composer check out the integrating your
external dashboards video in this series
