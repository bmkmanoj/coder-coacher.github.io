center operations like configuration
management compliance management and
automation Enterprise Manager 12c
leverages the capabilities of these
features and introduces change activity
planner change activity planner allows
you to plan track and monitor change
activities across a data center in real
time you could now use this to plan and
execute processes that run over a period
of time and involve multiple people or
teams change activity planner supports
people in an organization like
compliance officers and operators to
enable them to accomplish projects like
your cyclical patch rollout process
rolling out compliance changes
commissioning of new servers based on
business demands or consolidation of
databases into an Exadata for example
change activity planner provides the
whiteboard required for the manager to
define the change plan associate targets
where the change is being made set the
schedules and the priorities Enterprise
Manager based on ownership creates tasks
and automatically assigns them to the
administrators as an operator you can
review your tasks to understand the
context and schedules you can use
enterprise managers automation features
like jobs patch plans and deployment
procedures to accomplish the tasks upon
completion compliance kicks in for
validations and updates the status of
the tasks and the plans as a manager you
could monitor and track the status in
real time you can also generate reports
for further management reporting let's
take a closer look at the feature with
an example of the database patch rollout
process Oracle releases patch bundles
quarterly either a compliance officer or
a database manager reacts twitten
triggers the rollout
ideally organizations roll out the
changes over a few months across their
data center involving quite a few
administrators patch rollouts have quite
a few steps in the process they are
traditionally planned and tracked
through Excel spreadsheets wiki pages
and via weekly meetings for status
updates change activity planner provides
the whiteboard required for the manager
to define the complete change process
as a manager while creating a plan in
addition to specifying the basic
information like name and description
you can specify the target type affected
priority of the plan like low medium and
high and also associate documents to the
plan which need to be shared across all
people involved with it typically these
are the documents you would host in your
intranet file sharing site as a next
step you can define task groups and task
definitions to create a workflow like
you see here in the screen task
definitions can be created within or
outside the aggregation tasks groups
let's create run performance tests as a
task post the apply patch task note task
definition has three main parts one
basic information like name target types
from the list defined at the plan level
2 action that is needed for the task it
could be based on the type like
artifacts within enterprise manager jobs
patch plans or a custom one where an
administrator could execute any method
inside or outside of Enterprise Manager
and three verification the task based on
its type could be verified as done by
the task owner or could be evaluated by
running enterprise managers compliance
standards you could pick the appropriate
one from the library and associated with
the task
additionally you could add documents
specific to the tasks so the owners of
these tasks get access to the relevant
documents let's pick the core task in
the plan apply PSU patch Enterprise
Manager supports automation of applying
patches using patch plans the
information of list of patches to apply
can be stored in patched templates when
you define a task to apply patches
choose the out-of-the-box patch task
type and associate with the template you
want the administrators to roll out you
can also define the execution flow
needed by setting dependency amongst the
tasks for example you could define
execution as run first on stage go for
approvals and then move to production as
a next step you could associate targets
to the individual tasks or across the
entire plan you can choose targets
either using groups or by query over any
configuration search criteria upon
adding the targets they are distributed
across the tasks based on the target
types specified previously the last step
in the process is to define the schedule
for activation of the plan
you can specify the duration and the
start date for example you can specify
that the plan needs to be completed in
12 weeks starting next month you can
also specify assignment criteria upon
activation Enterprise Manager creates
tasks based on target ownership
as a manager you can review the newly
created plan you can see the complete
change activity plan and its individual
tasks you can change ownership of the
tasks based on availability canceled
tasks and define alternate schedules
additionally you can generate and print
reports when logged in as an
administrator say Joe Joe can see his
tasks under the my tasks page there he
can view the status across all the tasks
identify the ones that need attention
and acknowledged them in case of an
issue he can request for ownership
change Joe can perform a lot of actions
on his tasks for tasks like apply PSU
Joe can complete it by executing the
patch plans additionally he can add
comments and review the audit trail as
Joe completes the actions compliance
standards run to evaluate and update the
tasks and plans status as a manager you
can see the updates to the dashboard and
the plans in real-time take any action
needed you can generate reports for
meetings compliance officers or for the
management for more information visit
