provide a way to integrate your Oracle
Identity cloud service instance with any
application or client you can manage
identities and configuration and perform
single sign-on and authorization by
using REST API in your application
Oracle Identity cloud service REST API
SAR compliant with skim Open ID Connect
and OAuth 2.0 in this video we'll learn
how to make REST API calls to Oracle
Identity cloud service using the kernel
client in Linux to perform basic
operations such as requesting access
tokens and managing users and groups you
can use the same principles described in
this video to make calls from other
clients or programming languages as well
let's get started first let's add an
application in Oracle Identity cloud
service while adding an application to
find what it can do in Oracle Identity
cloud service we'll add our application
as a trusted application
it'll be configured so that the identity
domain administrator has client access
to the identity cloud service
administration api's
we save the client ID and client secret
that are generated and then activate the
application the client ID and secret are
the client credentials required for
performing REST API calls
now let's authenticate against Oracle
Identity cloud service by making a REST
API call using the client credentials to
make REST API calls we need to generate
the access token the access token
establishes a session so that we can
make rest requests without providing the
client ID and secret again after
activating an application you can
generate the access token the access
token is downloaded as a token file that
can be opened in any text editor we can
now use this token in a REST API call we
can also generate the access token by
using the client ID and client secret do
this by concatenating the client ID and
client secret and then encoding the
concatenated value in base64 then we
make a REST API call to the URL slash
token using this value to obtain the
access token now let's manage users
using REST API s start by creating a
user REST API SAR compliant with skim a
standard that defines how identity
management systems exchange information
using rest and JSON first we'll create a
JSON file where the user information is
defined according to the skin schemas
and attribute standards then we'll make
a call to the slash users URL using the
post method passing the access token in
the JSON file as input the results show
that the user is successfully created
the output file provides details of the
user that was created the users also
listed in the oracle identity cloud
service console this confirms that the
new user was created you can also use
REST API s to search for users by making
a call to the same slash users URL this
time we use the get method the output
display several users including the one
we just created will perform operations
for the user by specifying this ID now
let's modify the user by making a new
call to slash users user ID URL using
the patch method for this call the
information we're updating as
if I'd in the input file and the user ID
is specified in the curl command the
command returns a successful response
message confirm that the changes are
effective by looking at the user profile
in the console now let's manage groups
using REST API x' to work with groups
first obtain the user ids so they can be
assigned to the groups we create obtain
the user ids from the URL and the user's
profile in oracle identity cloud service
or obtain it by performing a search on
the slash users URL let's create a group
create a JSON file in which the group
information is defined / the skin
schemas and attribute standards the ID
of the user that needs to be added to
the group is also specified we'll make a
REST API call to the slash groups URL
using the post method passing the access
token and the JSON file is input results
show that the group is successfully
created the output file as well as the
console displays the details of the
group that was created to search for
groups use a similar REST API call using
the get method all the available groups
are listed now add a new user to the
group we created the idea of the user
that needs to be added to this group is
specified me input file we'll use the
patch method along with the group ID in
the command the console displays the new
user in the group's member list to
delete a user from a group use a similar
command but specify the patch method
along with the group ID and the JSON
file in which the user ID to be deleted
is specified using the oracle identity
cloud service REST API you can make your
custom applications interact with the
Oracle Identity cloud service and
perform various tasks such as requesting
access tokens and managing users and
groups to learn more about what you've
