Are you looking for a way to quickly
setup and teardown your development and
test environments? Or thinking about
moving your enterprise apps to the
public cloud? Subscribe to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic and easily launch and
manage virtual machines to handle all
your business-critical workloads. Here's how it works...
You can choose a 
multi-tenant subscription model and
share the environment with other tenants
or subscribe for dedicated capacity and
get an environment that's physically
isolated. Both options provide the same
enterprise-grade features on virtual
machines. You can play with various
resource combinations. Start small and
scale up when needed.
Create virtual machines with as little
as 7.5 gigabytes of memory and just one
processor core. Or,  ramp up to 16 Intel
Xeon processor cores and up to 240
gigabytes of memory per VM. Choose from several robust virtual machine images
all backed by Oracle's world-class
support and maintained, patched,  and upgraded for
you. Or, run your own operating system on
the Oracle Cloud infrastructure. You
control your networking at a granular
level down to each VM and external
host. With just a few clicks in a web
console, you can set up a firewall around
one set of VMs, but allow another
group to communicate freely with the
Internet. With each VM, you can attach
up to 20 terabytes of efficient block
storage capacity spread over up to 10
discs. You can attach and detach discs to VMs
on demand. The storage discs are
independent of the VMs, so your data
remains intact regardless of the state
of the VMs. You define and manage all VM
resources in orchestrations. When you
don't need a set of VMs,  simply stop the
relevant orchestration and restart it
when you want the VMs running again.
