with a desktop integration suite video
this video covers what is desktop
integration suite or D is for short what
applications can be used with desktop
integration suite how to contribute and
edit content using desktop integration
suite and finally how to connect to web
Center content server desktop
integration suite is an application that
integrates your desktop experience with
Oracle's website or content server
giving convenient access from Microsoft
Windows Explorer desktop applications
like Microsoft Word and Excel and email
clients like Microsoft Outlook and Lotus
Notes you can easily manage files
directly from your desktop using
applications you know best integrating
Windows Explorer with content server
provides a mean through which you can
connect to and manage content servers
when you right-click a content item a
pop-up menu appears with content server
options such as check-in checkout and
content information you can check
content into a Content server by using
drag-and-drop or copy and paste and
depending on how your content server is
configured you have profiles available
that contain default metadata values you
can change the profile or edit the
metadata values upon check-in once
checked in the new content item has the
metadata values assigned during the
check-in process your content server may
be configured to automatically initiate
a review process based on the metadata
field values if that is the case the
content information view will display
workflow information content can be
opened directly from any of the native
applications using the open option in
the web center content ribbon where you
can browse to or search for the desired
file if the edit option does not display
the content item is currently checked
out by another user you can select view
to
open a read-only or a new copy when you
open a file using any one of the
integration methods the content item is
also checked out of the content server
this prevents anyone else from editing
it when you save a file that is open in
your desktop application the file is
only safe to cache the changes are not
actually saved in the server until you
close a file and check it into the
content server if you prefer to change
any metadata values simply select the
Edit metadata check box and click OK
then make any desired changes and click
OK to complete the check-in process
email client integration allows you to
check email messages and their
attachments into the content server
directly from your email client
depending on your client settings you
can check in messages and their
attachments as one content item or
separate content items if you opt to
check them in a separate content items
you'll be prompted for metadata values
for each item
depending on how your content server is
configured you may have access to
digital access manager features which
allow you to define and provide images
and videos and specified formats and
sizes when checking in attachments
separate from email messages you have
the option of which items to check in in
this example the attachments are checked
in but the email message itself is not
to download the desktop integration
suite client login to content server
from a web browser expand the my content
server tray and click my downloads then
download the appropriate version for
your machine and follow the installation
screens once the client is downloaded
and installed you are ready to connect
to the content server there are two URLs
you will need the server WebDAV URL and
the cgi URL as you type in the server
name the URL is automatically inserted
into both the WebDAV URL and cgi URL
edit those fields if necessary and click
OK</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
