session is Eduardo Milan chelle Eduardo
is it a curriculum developer in the
server technologies curriculum
development group here at Oracle at this
time I'd like to turn it over to you
Eduardo okay thank you Peter if you know
everyone and welcome to this online
course about java ee 7 consuming restful
gauge from services using get a risk
point oh my name is a little moines
shell an idea macaroon developer at
oracle i'll be guiding you through this
webcast which consistent for grading a
web-based application that already uses
html5 and let sockets to use a sim 2
point 0 for the Earth's peruse the
x-rays 2 point 0 for a remote is remote
calls to our rest service the goal of
this is to demonstrate the new features
that are available on Jack's arrest open
oh and this is like we have our standard
Oracle seek are born artists basically
it is states that these web test does
not require a contrast between us and
what I am demonstrating today should not
be used to make any purchasing decisions
I'm a second to look at it okay to take
full advantage of this wave done you
should have the following prerequisites
a Paul will be posted on your screens a
asking you for or your experience with
some of these technologies you need to
have some experience with the other
Enterprise Edition development
specifically HTML Javascript and other
phases in note that in order to follow
this tutorial you also need the
following Oracle products to need
netbeans seven point three point one a
day for java ee is seven and the
GlassFish server open source solution
person for which is a java ee 7
compliant server if are available or
download at knitting stuff or and glass
crystal or respectively
java ee 7 is built drinking in three
main themes one developer productivity
to enable developers to write
applications faster with easier
configuration using animated objects it
reduces the boilerplate code required
for common task and having a cohesive
integrated platform to develop
applications meeting to the private
banks with a ps4 batch jobs concurrency
and as well as if the pain is 1580 ice
like JMS and finally html5 support with
inclusion of web sockets Jason and
improvements with the servlet API more
rest webservice sport and finally many
prominent CSS the action eres tu point
all includes free new features a
synchronous support it to handle
requests in the server or clients this
will optimize resources in your
applications in the third in the server
as you can write the responsive separate
threads and in declines you can use call
back or blocking a future objects
filters and interceptors for rest goals
integrated in the server and client
calls this allows a notified way to
create filters and interceptors and a
client api to call restful web services
in your applications this api allows you
to communicate your application to
services using a simple yet extensible
APA organized for rascals note that Jeff
surrett Oracle is reusable in clients
and servers so most of these a sinker
support and filters and interceptors you
may find that is really horrible when
you use it on the server and on the
client I will give an overview of home
to you create a gesture reticles a
synchronous a servers
i synchro servers already gets arrested
following manner you have to add an
acting response parameter to you to your
jacks every service methods then using
this method in a separate rate you can
write the response using the result
method and the gold is nibud are
examples here of how to use this a piece
of synchronicity in if you're Jack's air
estupido servers so start the Rupert
method you had the a/c response
independent method and in a separate
afraid to write a response video happy
buddha snippets for both a vigorous
various works with call dr. blocking
future objects you have to add piercing
response parameter to do your debt
service service methods sorry not you
get to make the client a request a
synchro you have to call the asking
method on the request and then calling
the service medal and a call back you
have to pray the request as view is
normally in your clients you have to
make it a synchronous and then call the
method a with a call back the request
method with a call back or if you desire
you can use our future object then let's
move to the nephron and find out the
other feature that has yet service to
point o is interceptor for filters
interceptors and filters are created
using a deck service providers that
implements the Pacific interfaces
filters are applied to the request and
response while interceptors applied to
the actual content of their request or
the response
this is like you can see how executional
what is the execution order of
interceptors and filters so these are
the four interfaces that you use for
filters these are the two interfaces
that you use for interceptors so first
happens they declined requests a client
makes a request enters our request
filter for every client and then
Thursday interceptor for writing the
request then the server received a
request there's our best fielder for day
for the container or the server and then
take the set to read that from day from
the request you can see here there's a
bright intelligent scepter there's a
waste on tinder simple finally there's a
response from the server after the metal
impatient there's a person responds
Fielder after day the response is going
to be sent and then there's a neater
separate writing by the content then
finally the client receives their
response Thursday response fielder and
then the Interceptor in the final a
future and in depth arrest with all his
client API the decks earth Arastoo
client API provides a simple alternative
for invoking restful services on a
remote server the API was created
thinking of rest so you have
unprecedented ability creating rest
calls you can add very parameters bonk
on in another useful rest Peter for your
client calls by training methods as
shown in the second example here and
optionally you can enable features in
the invitation chain like a synchronous
processing using this API you can create
simple one-line Driscoll's by using
method chaining or great templates by
saving an object in that chain for
reusable calls so as you can see you
have to create clients where targets
request and then you can actually extend
or save they exceed the middle a baby
obviously the chain as you see fit and
also you can add features optionally
like in me craving them a synchronous
and then calling your pure HTTP
you call so in the demo I will show you
how to create jax-rs clients using the
new features a the application we are
going to be looking at ucsf servlets web
sockets and we will add gate sir jack's
errors clients a in each of these
technologies let me show you my desktop
so interesting more I begin with two
applications rest server and I went up
and a web application that will actually
consume is the rest services provided by
these other application the rest server
application uses Jack's arrest and I
will updated to use the Jason processing
API or another that will be sent to the
to the first application to the web
application and the web application
itself uses jsf service and web sockets
from e7 i will update it to use Jack's
arrest upon all clients and get some
processing the application that will be
showcasing is the same that i've been
using another a in the other webcasts so
make sure you a if the speaker book
application you subscribed a set of
speakers in the left side of the screen
and they can run it into the canvas in
the right side it interaction is done
with WebSockets and the page itself is a
it's a JSF page so here is the
application here you have a list of a
the speakers to come right in today to
the right side and right now you don't
not seen anything because we have an
implemented this part because the data
well today lined the original occasion
was saved in memory in in this webcast
the data itself is on our server they
have the web application will connect to
the server to get the list of speakers
and center speakers that have been
dragged to the campus as well so all the
data management will happen on day on
there
server the rest server itself is also
has been implemented already so we have
some basic stuff hey I will demonstrate
that as well and as you can see we don't
have any stickers on the lip pain of the
page so the steps I will follow I will
implement a required code to show their
stickers here from the rest server I
will get also the sticker sticker images
from the rest server and display them
over here and finally I will retrieve
the all the stickers that have been
tracked here and I will a save every
speaker that that leaves being dragged
from from the left side of the right
side so first if the list of stickers is
generated in the web server a by a class
is over Q which is the sticker resource
class the figure resource class is a
classic jax-rs a object so we have the
usual stuff we have the path for this
resource and we have some methods you
can see I have a business already
existing and up a tomato that will
return me the list of images and a
method that given a name of self or
sticker of oral or an image will get me
the actual image itself so what I want
to implement versus this method here
getting the list of images it is only
imagine is already over here in a list
so I want to return a rest json
representation using rest a for this
list over here so let me show you go to
you photo with other in jet injector
rest point all and in java ee 7 you have
the case on processing a ati already so
you can actually return JSON objects in
your tab in your Jack's arrest methods
and they will be sterilized as based on
the swings automatically you just need
to add the produces application JSON a
it may add annotation and then returned
it is an array object so what do I
create I get an array well a I just have
to do get an array a array bill
generation together right fielder you
soon right away ill their equals case on
what made array builder I fix my imports
by going to source a fix imports in
works and then I have to use this
builder to construct a array they get on
a rate that i will be using so what I
will be sending is just the strings
themselves you know in a JSON oh right
so i don't have to write in a really
complicated code so i will just go
string image name inside english names
so i will iterate my list off of images
and i will add them to my regular
rebuilder thought add and i will just
get any mistake there we go well you
have to return the actual JSON array so
I have a here builder that that I can
use to create the actual return JSON
array so I will just do an array builder
thought build which actually will return
me a JSON array object which is the one
that I need so if I my formatting and
save the file I can actually access
these these stickers a resource with
resource from my from my browser let's
go to the browser and have the server so
i can access the rest / stickers and
there does i get the list of speakers
that that I have available right now on
application so the piece actually will
terrorize a be images that I have into a
JSON array and will return it in a
nine-year zone in my rest
in my red service here these are URL so
let's try a to see they the actual
images a when a speaker so i can see
that that I have another resource down
here which has they depart a stay of the
name of the image which will actually
give me a so passive speaker / the name
of the image and we will actually use
some kind of a actually raise
conventions will give me the actually
Michelle so I know that there's and a
star but PNG so let's try to see that
one dot PNG and there we go there we
have it that we have a star so right now
we know that we have the a service that
will give me a list of of images that i
have and i have my service that will
give me a particular image so i can
actually move forward and add those to
my web application so I cherry in the in
do in the server side i I'm just finish
I have everything that I need I have a
service that will give me the list of
images and the service that will give me
a particular image it's already therapy
also i just want to demonstrate the
Geisha mission ality so let's move to
the to the web part and a to the web
application so till the list of images
is actually I guess as a managed bean
the game sub- pin is a mr. speaker sheet
a object is some manners pinned from a
from jsm which actually will return me
it will return it a list of the other
speakers available only if I wanted to
show you the PDF page that actually
shows this part so against a page a
contains only you are repeat a element
that will iterate over all the stickers
all the stickers inside the sticker
sheet object here is managing
and we'll use a html5 features from jsf
to show me the stickers so here i have
the speaker a testicles shown each one
so let's i will go into this a further
because it diffuser blitz to
experiential image so first we need to
actually get that live for speakers
because right now I don't have anything
I don't even have broken links or
anything so nothing is being shown here
but to show at this broken link so let's
go to the sticker ship a class and here
a I can take it all stickers method
which is called by jsf I want to return
here the list of all female years that I
actually cut which I will get from the
from this rest in service for here so
the first thing I need to do is a I need
to to create a pig a call that i will
use for making a RS our vessel code so i
will create a list of the images that i
want to put it on speaker right now and
returning a no so you know ray list get
it really really really simple and i
will return to thanks then the next
thing I need is to create the actual
risk also to create goals as I shown you
in this light I have to create a client
in a target dinner request and then
finally a calling the method that I need
so first I need a client and create a
client we pulse client yielder builder
um not your client so I fix my imports
and you stay jax-rs a client class and
then I'll just a note that i have
declined i have to tell the client that
I want to keep
and a specific service oh say client got
target and here i can give the URL that
I want to do actually query so I already
have that it's here this recipe so I
actually copy Niska is URL i will paste
it over here and it will give me a
thorough sort of web target so there we
have it I fix my import again and then I
get the jacks arrays purse target object
here in a with this web target i can
actually make a request so i can
actually do target dot and in the in the
record i can say what media type i am
expecting so a dexterous contains this
media type a this media type a interface
with a lot of a of constants that are
actually wrote the most used a media
types over there so i can look here for
the application Jason a media type and
then it just make the get request so I
know if I get request so i will do get
and i actually know that they the object
that i want as a as part of this ok i
know that i come together JSON array
from here so i do this JSON array
response equals this so Joseph I deal
with the sticker resource transforming
is a arraylist into JSON object I will
do the opposite here application obvious
and I will convert them to a total is
that i have here so really simple i will
copy this code from here so i will
iterate over each of the elements inside
their JSON array I know already that
they are all the strings well a and they
are just a separated by comma
and everything so instead of actually a
I cannot get the string directly here I
got to get the Jason value which is a
kind of rapper a super interface that
will and that each value will extend
this interface then i will get the
different string and get the actual
string from here it's actually the think
that's you using in Jason processing to
get the the actual value of of each
element view array if you say that up an
array of objects you will have to use a
JSON object stead of JSON string if you
send a numbers you will have to use case
on number instead of JSON string as well
so let's go back to / application if a
this word then we should actually see
some broken links on the left should let
me open explorer because that wednesday
so one that actually displays those root
links there you go you can see that I
have now broken links here because I i
am requesting the list of office
speakers but i am not a I'm not
requesting the the actual a picture for
each a sticker so that's my next step is
to actually display those those images
let's go back to the today ASAP page so
I am doing this I am getting all the
images and I are repeating are iterating
them so inside of each image a user
servlet with the actual sticker image
and the actual sticker image is inside
my red server here so what can I do to
actually display is image from my wrist
server using a servlet on my on my web
application well let's open that servlet
I see that is completely empty so that
that explains a the broken links well
I can do a restful inside my my sublet
that we are actually gave me the image
from from their West resource that I
have there so I can actually get the
images from another server inside my
favorite so I can actually a disguise
the fact that I don't have those images
and actually get those resources from
Wales work so let's go to that class in
order to do so a here's a note if you
are going to make a lot of requests here
for your application you will make one
request or eight a bridge a speaker that
you have here for a remote server these
will require piece servlet we called a
lot of times and that will mean poor
performance for your side it's actually
kind of a performance issue you will
have a visitor would be available in the
Oracle lending library site and if you
want to try it a try removing their
synchro inspired in this in this servlet
OG called toe pain packing your
performances so the first thing that I
know that can help me with the
performance issues that I have is a
choosing a synchronous support or jacks
arrays and for servlets so i will add
the synchro support for service now I do
that by modifying the Webster blade
annotation and adding a passing
supported through a parameter here he
doesn't make everything I think rules I
have to actually do it that's all so
let's actually look at the code required
to make an ass across goal make a secure
Rose servlet I have to start on a
synchronous a processing here right
Colleen request dot start a sink this
will return me and I think a context
sync context object
with this I actually say okay my request
will be handled as elsewhere not not
here someone else will handle it okay so
right now what I can do is start
creating the rest the debt service call
that I had written it I know that I need
to connect for a client as usual mind
builder not inclined so I create my
client I fix my imports I know the URL i
want to hit a pieces I get this room is
a URL here and all that it has to be
local or something and then they not the
name of the athl a image that I want I
know that image i receive it as
parameter the parameter name here for my
servlet so i can actually use this kind
of you so let's copy this so i know that
either send string URL i have to hit
something like this so oops and I know
that you failed star India have to
request thought get parameter and get
the from turning removal then now that I
know the URL that I want to hit and then
I have to create a target line dot
target and justice target I will
actually say okay a the URL that you are
going to finish the URL that I've
learned up there so well target target
equals this and now i start my request
right so target not request 16 fruits
it's on request i know that i will be
receiving an image / PNG a file from the
poor my rest server and here is where
where the fun begins i know that i have
to handle this I synchronously so I have
to do this request a synchronous I do
that by adding the i think a testing a
method call they might change in my
chain and then i know that i will be
calling i get a witch one of this will I
i will use a i will actually use this
day over here to get with an invocation
call back so get and i will create a new
sticker holdback class then i will send
it be passing context so what happens
over here i will create this class right
now this glad will be called we will
actually limit a callback interface that
i need and i will send a geosynchronous
context from day from there a tablet so
whenever is a is restful called a
answers and returns the data i will
actually call the methods inside is a
sticker go back okay so let's do that it
will click over here and i will create a
class a sticker callback week instructor
there will have it and here we just have
to implement a correct interface the
correct interface is called invocation
call back bo you want to remove this
location call back see we have a
response and i have I i know i will
receive an input stream because it's
it's an alyssa animals what I get as a
response so i have that now it will make
this one public and i will actually
implement your submit
there we go then I will assign this a
synchronous context to field so I have
the filled with action groans context
and these Tomatoes over here they
completed and failed whenever they get
to raise a cool complete successfully I
will be called with this angle captive
method called and if it fails I will
have this other metals gold we're here
so first a their simplest one is when it
fails when it fails I don't want to show
any where it's tough i will just do
nothing context dot complete i would say
okay they therapist has been completed
and you don't have to do anything ok now
when it completes when I have the actual
input stream I want to write a ripple
stream today for the syncros context the
response so but i do but i will use if
you stay is a debe 7 syntax so our to
get the the output stream and copy of
the closeable so i will do justice
careful in case of an exception I won't
do anything section me for now and I am
not willing to do anything so let's put
that third fix my inputs and there we go
so I know that with this I will have to
be able to close of all support and we
have an opal string which I will use
their synchronous context get response
get up the string which will be closed
and the input stream i will just assign
it directly so it will be closed as well
this try catch block so what's rest is
to copy those two strings it is code
actually chose that it's just a simple
eries from the input stream and write it
to the output stream and this will
actually make a bit will actually show
the stickers on the left this time
around ok now it's been shown now I have
the stickers here and they generate a
lot of Driscoll's the first one is a
fitting all the stickers from the server
which are these nine stickers and then
we have an independent a restful a that
actually gets media stickers in
imposition I think you and I can
actually look at them if you want to
play with the code a program movie the
synchronous support a from here and you
will see how is no your server becomes
because you will actually create a very
request and you won't be bringing any
resources well the requests are
happening so this is a very a easy way
to actually optimize your resources
since you are free the threads are
hunting the request and you are using
call back so you're actually just
sending day the streams not a pho threat
and this will actually improve
performance unloading your applications
if you happen to find this scenario
where a where your servlets become
unresponsive because they are waiting
for some answer from a from the rest
server this can be used as well jsf and
and we know their places
so let's see hope the application works
right now so I got this here so let me
open a new tab put it up here it's
access the same URL so i say that if a
collaborative a sticker book so if i
drag a Dasani number here i will have it
here perfect attractive moon over here I
will have it here as you can see that it
is replicated but there is an issue
right now there's no persistence and
there's no estate sale so if i refresh
the pages i start a fresh again so if i
refresh this guy i don't can be
astronaut there if i put this feel good
day here I sit alone in here well we had
some friends over here why is this
because we want to save the state on the
rest server as well and we're not doing
that right now but where does this
happen if this happens a when you drag
and drop the stuff if happens on a web
socket so you can also add Rascals to
web socket so let's do that now let's
open the web socket Class A which is
actually on the sticker story a
brilliant we have the story WebSocket
class thank you we have a common web
socket we have seen so far I guess have
managed bean servlet and now we have a
web socket so whenever they when user
drags and drops the speaker this method
is called so a sticker is sent to
everyone else that's cool and whenever
someone open position you just arrived
today to the least obsession that has to
be notified that you tried a sticker so
we went right now to actually add a some
kind of persistence or some kind of
notification to the server that a
sticker was right so you get this method
called every time I sticker is destroyed
to the screen so we want to actually
cola arrest a service for that
the URL that I am thinking of is this
guy works here so it's a string URL it
was this so i will call the story
resource in this server here and i
actually will go up off I post a HTTP
call here so I know that that I could
put por todo this kind of course I have
to create a client with the others
create declined I pics main ports and
then i create the target so climb both
target and i will say the URL my target
and then I know that I need a request
and I am expecting to to receive nothing
from this because he's a boss I'm not
just posting stuff so i would put
anything inside a request and i will
send a post a method CO and as you can
see it receives parameters receives an
entity the entity is the actual content
so so i need to send content as as the
post body so i will say entity entity
and I will send a a digital
representation of this speaker and I
know that the media type that I am
sending is an application yes so so far
I have this and I just have to create
the gates on a sticker or presentation
of pieces thicker object which is the
one that i received a whenever they're
from the social and will actually create
that using json object based on a
sticker equals case on dot great of your
builder so I great the the object
builder and then I will just add the
parameters as with any case on
processing API and finally and we'll
just build build it's my important there
so what if I create a JSON object
representation of my on my sticker on it
by setting a thr parameter for the phd
actual attributes of my JSON object from
my dears honesty from my stick and i
will send that using a post request and
if actually does the trick of actually
sending you stuff to the server so now
supposedly we we save a we send every
time we put our speakers here within
something today to the rest server
now how can we verify that we have to
verify that by getting those stickers
from the server so the best place to do
that is whenever we open a connection
when we open a connection which is when
we refresh the page I have to get all
the stickers that I had on the server so
and although I actually do that well we
can answer to a simple a-arrest a Jack's
arrest bundle client imitation so I will
make this as a one-liner so this Oh
Jason array which is what I you speak to
get expect to get deviation stickers on
the server equals crime bill they're not
new client not target and I a URL that I
want to use is the same that i have here
but instead of doing a post I will do a
get request so far let me add this as
another line and then dot request dot
get and I know that I need to get our
JSON array dot class also my request has
to be media type and then the
application this so look at this
it's a 19 well one long line implication
you can create a bit decline in the
target the request and do the gate
chaining the teammate met of goals so
you can have one after another and you
don't have to break your pure coding
from multiple objects like here you have
declined that the integrated pilot you
can actually do everything just in one
single site and then i will just convert
a JSON array that i got from the server
into actual a into actual objects that I
can handle I just compute this method
from something that I have prepared for
you sure what it does it's easy to raise
over the speakers and then a from them
we get a JSON object and then we
populate that neo sticker objects with
whatever we get from here the chicken
series this kind of the same as what we
sent here it is the opposite this
converts a sticker in two ideas on the
sticker and this converts are given
sticker into a sticker object then we
just a send your bit usual using the
session so we get all the all the
stickers and we send it today to the
connected session using this line on few
lines over here which is this is
standard a web socket API and this is
case on API and this is the G jax-rs API
so right now we should see these things
refresh right every time we send a
sticker we should refresh and see them
or we don't see that because we have an
implemented the server yet so let's take
a quick look at the changes that we need
to do on the server side so let's go to
the story resource class here and you
see that the key i had the list of
stickers that i actually hunting so the
first thing is whenever i send a sticker
receive a sticker object Jason sticker I
have to convert that to a speaker object
so it's really similar to what IV donde
on the web socket I create my sticker
object I said to parity the value stood
and then I will just add it to my
speakers a list so I autistic and then I
will need to convert these little these
professed occurs into a sticker objects
and put them inside a Huson array so if
you remember who we did it with the with
a list of images I go almost the same
stuff i just created his own builder the
JSON array builder it will reveal their
to build here and then i will just
iterate over my stickers here then
convert them accordingly using the
objective builder so these will create a
diff kickers a basic array in a in
association let's look at the
application how it works now fresh and
this rather moon over here and then
astronaut on each side and now let's
refresh and I captain a persisted why
because it's being persisted on the
wrists server using this a simple lines
of code and the actual web socket
doesn't really know about that it just
makes them Rascals I can open it in a
second tab or a window and I can
actually see that they are there and if
I am late to the party and I should
refresh the page a PS builder
so let's do a quick recap of what i did
in i implemented this on a server Jack's
arrest clients the most aggregation in
the web application inside RJ's have a
minus bean as usual inside a servlet
optimizing resources using the
synchronous a blitz and a synchronous a
rascal and finally inside a WebSocket
here using simple calls over here and
here then I also added to the server for
the sticker resource and the story
resource class i added a necessary
conversions from objects to jason using
this code over here for their stickers
that are persisted and this code over
here for the images and the sticker
lists that are shown on the the Russian
well the left side of the page so you
can see how ot factory works well a
fiscal
tutorial itself as you can see Jack's
arrest Bruno Klein support provides a
simple and flexible implementation for
importing a restful services and we go
back to the slides and well Java is
saving actually is more than Jack's
arrest point oh and Jason processing is
so download the java sdk and begin
developing applications with devaki
seven today you can find a SDK as well
as comprehensive documentation at oracle
com / java ee here a glasses were point
0 is an open source server that runs
java ee 7 applications it contains the
full or web profile specification
implementation download it enters your
applications you can get it from www not
classf is our cue the IE 7 contains a
lot of new engagements given give the
platform a test today and talking about
the technology in Java is I mean did you
notice something that could be improved
or perhaps you have a very dear for an
API that could be incorporating future
versions it make the future Java join
the java community process and be part
of the joint effort of grade a better
and more complete platform remember java
specifications are open for people like
you get involved and join the community
join your local general user group and
be part of the vibrant java community
learn more exchange ideas practice a
practice techniques and a top the java
specification requests for the next
generation aps and now did you know that
Oracle provides free demonstrations and
tutorials about Java EE and other
technologies up all will be posted on
your field to get feedback from you
Europeans from the Oracle Learning
Library
go to the Oracle Learning Library to
find out about all the free material
available you can find tutorials like
this one as well as online courses
examples articles and much more you can
find in recording as well as the
previous one CD series in the Oracle
Learning Library site listen for also
the poll a posted on your machines about
how did you find about this event this
will help us find better ways to reach
developers and provide better material a
final note if you want to learn more
about Java demodex errors clients used
in javafx system applications go to the
Oracle Learning Library and look for the
Oracle by example tutorial titled
developing enterprise applications with
jela FX in java ee 7 just go to the site
and search for it it contains a cool
example of how to connect an interface
application with the idea effects
application using Jack's arrest 2 point
0 and well thats it for today thanks for
your assistance my name is Aurora Marron
