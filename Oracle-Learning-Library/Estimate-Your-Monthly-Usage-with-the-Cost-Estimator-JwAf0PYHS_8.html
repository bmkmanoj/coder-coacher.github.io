cloud the first thing you want to do is
estimate your monthly cloud usage the
Cost Estimator provides an easy way to
do this for example suppose you're
looking for information about the Oracle
database cloud service start from
cloud.oracle.com
select platform-as-a-service database
and then click buy now to get started
with the Cost Estimator
select a category of cloud services that
best summarizes how you want to use
Oracle cloud for example select data
management select one of the default
configurations to serve as a starting
point for your monthly cost estimate for
database there are nine starting point
configurations for our first example
let's select an instance of database
cloud service as well as the storage and
backup services required to setup a
secure and efficient database
environment for development test and
production scroll down the page and have
a look at the database cloud service
default configuration expand each item
and note the number of database
instances and the average days of usage
each month and each day try increasing
the number of database instances to two
so you have one instance for development
and one instance for testing note how
the estimated monthly cost changes as
you make your changes note that there
are two pricing options pay-as-you-go
and monthly flex pay as you go
reflects your estimated monthly cost if
you want to avoid any kind of upfront
costs all of your costs will be based on
what Oracle services you use and the
resources you consume to save money you
can purchase a set amount of monthly
credits these credits can be applied
towards any IAS or past service if you
go above the estimated amount you will
be charged an overage fee however you
can adjust your monthly credits as you
get more experience using Oracle cloud
in addition to the savings you give by
selecting the monthly flex payment
option you can save additional money
based on the number of credits you
purchase and the duration of your
subscription for example let's start
over and select database cloud service
this time with real application clusters
for high availability
now we'll add another instance of the
database so we can have one for our
development team and one for production
note how for this configuration there
are additional discounts shown in the
monthly flex discount bar for even more
discounts consider signing up for a
longer term
with these features of the Cost
Estimator you can try different
configurations and sets of services to
identify the best value for your
organization when you're ready to
purchase simply click the appropriate
Buy button and you're on your way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
