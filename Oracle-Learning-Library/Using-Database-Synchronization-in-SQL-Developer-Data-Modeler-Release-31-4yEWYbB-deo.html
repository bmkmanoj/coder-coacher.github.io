use the database synchronization
functionality making changes to existing
database objects is not always easy
because you may want to ensure that your
existing data is maintained database
synchronization involves importing the
objects you want to change from the data
dictionary if you do not have a model
already then you change the objects
depending on your needs from there you
want to compare the changes you made
with the data dictionary and specify the
appropriate options and how you would
like the DDL generated the first thing
we're going to do is import some tables
from our data dictionary so we're going
to select the file import data
dictionary option select the connection
that we previously created and click
Next
we're then going to select the schema
that we want in this case the HR schema
and click Next and then we can select
the tables that we want to include so
we're going to select the department's
table and the employees table and click
Next and click finish to generate the
relational design and we'll notice that
we have the two tables once we click
close and we can double-click on
employees to change one of the columns
in the employees table so we'll go ahead
and select the salary column and change
it to a bar car bar char and then set
the size to 20 and click OK at this
point we want to synchronize the
database with our relational design so
we're going to go ahead and select that
option in the tool bar and it will come
up with a compare models dialog window
the icon that shows a warning symbol are
detecting the changes that we've made so
we're going to go ahead and navigate
down to the salary column and you'll see
that the changes are displayed this
point we can select the DDL preview to
see the DDL that would automatically
created if we had just went with the
defaults we want to go ahead and
recreate the table because there's
currently data in that table so in this
case we're going to select the recreate
table option and if we scroll down the
DDL you'll notice that we have a alter
table renamed to another table and then
if we scroll down to the bottom it's
going to insert the data back into the
new table that we created we can also
change the backup strategy so that we
don't generate that temporary table with
the data and in that case when we
generate the DDL now it's just going to
automatically drop the table you have
just seen a demonstration of using the
database synchronization feature</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
