coming to this session about JavaFX
present javafx presenting data
capabilities my name is Rodney man i'm
working as a software engineer at oracle
and currently i'm working on single part
of javafx today i will talk about javafx
features which can help you to visualize
data and present data I will start with
a brief overview of javafx charts and
will continue with showing you how to
implement your own custom chart advanced
charter and will finish showing you some
other ways how to use Java FX features
to visualize data by other ways than
charts so let's start with the charts
part in addition to typical UI elements
javafx brings a few types of charts and
currently supported our scatter chart
line chart bar chart ar ar bubble and
pie chart and besides these six charts
you can implement as I already mentioned
your custom advanced chart to create a
chart it is really simple process and
you have to do only three simple steps
to
sorry aha ok I'll try ok I'll try thank
you so to create a chart there are only
three simple steps you have to do the
first step is define chat axis then you
have to specify series of data and
finally you have to instantiate the
chart so looking at the gold this is
what this is everything what you have to
do to create the charter displayed on
the right side first two lines shows
exist the Phoenician then our define two
series of data each series with three
data items and on the last line is the
chart instantiated so it is really
simple and you can do it very fast let's
look now a bit closely at this code
exists currently in Java effects are
implemented two types of axis it is
category axis and the number axis
category axis works on a string
categories where each value represents a
unique category and number exists plots
range of numbers and these numbers can
be can be any type supported by Java you
can create auto ranged axis by using a
default constructor or you can specify a
range axis range
by the axis parameters you may object
when looking at this slide that there is
missing something like time or data axis
which is often used when creating charts
and I have to agree you are right and
when I was writing the application which
I will show later I found also this
issue and was thinking how to do it
because I really missed it and
fortunately there is a very simple
solution to it you have to represent for
example date value as a number and then
you can write for matter which will form
at this value this number value to do
format which you want to display so this
sample code shows how I represent date
values for date value I using
milliseconds and then from these
milliseconds I create a Java date object
and format this object to the string
which is written in the center of the
screen so it is here / month / date and
this is everything you have to do to
create data axis so also specific data
axis is missing in javafx
very simple to do it when axes are
defined you have to specify data for pie
chart there is pie chart data class to
specify it and for to exist charts there
is except salon chart data class which
is used to specify data and what is
interesting here is the extra value in
the last exception chart data
constructor through this extra value you
can pass another specific value to the
chart to process it for example in
bubble chart this value is used to to
set the bubble radius but more typically
this value is very useful in custom
charts where you can use it to draw your
own specific charts and displaying
specific data which would be difficult
to display by standard charts and I will
show this later in this presentation I
will show you how to write your custom
chart from scratch and when you define
data you can also create a few series of
data and and that's all on the data site
you may also want to somehow process
events on on data on particular data
elements in the chart and to do it you
have to you can use this code pattern
because all chart implementations are I
extends javafx node and so they inherit
the their methods and properties so you
can handle mouse or key events and to do
it you you only asked the data item for
the note which represents it and at even
handler do it and last last thing which
you can do with charge is to style them
so if you want to change visual
appearance of the chart you can do it by
CSS styles javafx api's offers only
limited set of methods and properties to
outer chart elements directly from Java
code and the recommended way is used a
CSS styles this slide shows three
examples how what you can do so the
first
example shows how you can change a color
of line chart and the other two examples
shows how we can change chart symbol in
this in the first case it is using image
and in the second case you can use SVG
path to define a symbol and for a
complete list of CSS properties I would
recommend you to check javafx CSS
reference guide which you can find the
JavaFX web page so this was a short
overview of standard javafx charts and
now i will show you a few of the things
about which i was talking in the real
application when i was thinking how to
present javafx charts so I decided to
write sport trac ER application because
I'm a runner so I using this application
to drag my trainings and it was it was a
good chance for me to try what we can do
with javafx in in this data processing
so this application is is a reading data
from the database and visualize them by
charts or by other base but I will show
later so first I will start by showing a
few aha we have a small screen
ok
well okay so the resolution is slower
than should be but this chart is
displaying style scatter chart and and
what I changed out of what I styled hair
by ciara CSS other chart symbols and I
use images for them and unfortunately
what isn't visited what you can't see in
this resolution is the date exists which
demonstrates what I showed a few slides
before the data format the second
example shows demonstrates events
processing and this pie chart shows how
much time was spent each year by all
sport activities together and when I
move the mouse pointer over each slice
so another pie chart appears and shows
details how this time is split between a
different sports so everything what I
show here is done using standard javafx
charts I
I had not to implement anything special
i had not to extend any kind of chart
it's just using the possibilities which
are javafx gives me and so in this chart
are I'm handling moving mouse over
slices of the part site and also mouse
click so if I click on the chart I can
see details for all years and the last
example of the standard standard JavaFX
chart shows bubble chart and in this
case it is animated bubble chart which
is also standard feature of JavaFX
charts and you can animate data changes
between between chart data series so you
can visual in nicely see how how data
are changing and now I will move to
custom charts so what I am going to show
you is how to implement this specific
chart before I i show you how how to do
it how you can build your own advance
the chart so i will
say a few words about theory behind this
chart this chart shows how much time was
spent in in training zones and when you
train so your heart rate is split into
five zones and these slides simply
describes for what is H zones good and
the chart what I implemented displays
the time spent in each zones by
different colors and so Barbie's bar
created from 5pcs other piece of another
color and that's how how each exercise
is visualized here so I will open my
NetBeans IDE or it's too soon for it
right first I will show you another
slide and this slide shows what you have
to do to create your custom chart so in
case of to exist chart you have to
extend X epsilon JavaFX except salon
chart and override these methods as you
can see from their names
they are methods which manipulate with
data items so methods which put them to
do to the list of items which is then
processed and from which are the data
items drawn to the chart so now i will
switch to to the editor and and try to
go a slowly through the code so in the
beginning there is just constructor and
the important part is this layout plot
children method which is responsible to
plot the chart so the data which i sent
to the chart I are processed here and
and for each data is created zone bar
object and this object is the visual
representation of of the values which I
sent to the chart so
it is here so I create five rectangles
and here in the method which I called
update I I pass there by parameters time
how much time was spent in each zone and
this from these values i compute the
size of the of the rectangles which
represents each zones and then then this
these rectangles together make the bar
with which is shown on the chart so back
to the top so here is from the layout
what your children method is called the
method with which creates me the bar and
and then that's almost everything than
in the rest of the method I only add or
remove this this zone bar element from
the list of data I items which is drawn
and in addition to this to this
implementation I also add
tooltip to to to the to the bars so if I
move the mouse pointer over each bar
symbol on the chart so i can see detail
so for that item so when i move back to
the application so you can see that in a
case of this training how much time was
spent in each heart rate zone and and
you can see two by by visually by the
height of each color rectangle and also
you can see the details by pointing
pointing my pointer over the bar so this
is how to implement non-trivial charts
and now I i will show how to process and
visualize data by other base than chance
so
what I will show is this processing and
analyzing data from GPS device on on
this screen you can see map and and on
this map is drawn a track right by
bicycle and data from from this track
where we're locked by GPS device and
then then put to this application so GPS
lock was passed and from the data
provided by this look was created the
JavaFX a path object which is very nice
and simple way how to how to create any
kind of bath in javafx so
I i created this pop-up checked from the
elements from the latitude and longitude
values which i caught from the GPS log
file and what you can do is with this
path or another features which you can
do getting what you can do with the path
object is the you use it in animation
because as you probably know each other
effects offers you a few ways how to
animate object so in this case I used
this path object to animate the right so
you can see that red silk circle and it
simulates the right but I can i can draw
the track also by an other ways and for
example I can visualize the attitude of
the tag and in this case are I i read
the altitude from the GPS log and for
each and each outta to do i display by
different color so again I I can create
a
apart from from this altitude elements
and and again I i still can animate the
drag and and erase and similarly I can
do it with anything but what I want to
do display so by similar way i can
analyze the speed and different colors
shows me different speed so i can come
from this view I can see when when I've
also going up to the hill or down and
similarly I I did it for her heart rate
so besides besides charts you can use
lots of other official javafx features
to to visualize your data use the use
effects which are in company
incorporated in javafx animations and
you can present your data by by a
nice-looking way and this is the end of
my presentation so this is what I wanted
to show and if you have any questions
you may ask yes
in this case it's also obviously you
know I in this case i can compute it
because I know the latitude and
longitude bounds of this map so so I can
simply compute the right positions so
then if I would like to scale this map
and and end the path here so it would be
very easy to to scaling it yes yes
yes yes yes no I don't know because well
I I'm working or I don't work in the
team which implemented the chart stuff
so I don't know what's their plans but
if if you if you give me your contact I
may ask and to let you know aha
oh yes but okay it is i would like to
publish this source code as a part of
javafx samples but it wasn't done yet so
hopefully sometimes in the future it
will be available somewhere I'm sorry
I was
so this past pass object is the path
which I'm animating and to to make the
animation
yes in this case I I have two pie charts
ivana
so here I have two pie charts about
bunnies this dark pie chart and under is
under it is lying second pie pie pie
chart which which is by default non
invisible and when I move the mouse over
each slice so I make visible to
corresponding part of the of the
underlying pie chart any other question
if not so thank you for your attention
for coming and hopefully it was somehow
useful for you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
