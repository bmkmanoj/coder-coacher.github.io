a single transaction now you can with
sequences and Oracle data visualization
let's look at the data flows we want to
sequence launch navigator and click data
to open the page double-click the merged
customer social media data flow to open
it click join to see how this data flow
merges datasets for customers and their
social media feeds click aggregate to
look at how the data will be aggregated
click Save data to verify that the data
flow saves the result as a new data set
called merged customer social media
click the back button on the data flow
page to navigate back to the data page
to open the next data flow you'll add to
the sequence double-click the merged
customer point-of-sale data flow to open
it this data flow uses the first data
flow merged customer social media as an
input and joins it to the point-of-sale
data set it also aggregates the data and
saves the results as a new dataset
called all data sets merged click the
back button to navigate back to the data
page to begin creating the sequence on
the data page click create and then
sequence drag and drop merged customer
social media to the sequence this is the
first data flow that executes in the
sequence
drag and drop the second data flow below
the first one to specify the order in
which the data flows will run in the
sequence you can also reorder the data
flows if you need to save the sequence
by entering all merged data sets and
click OK then click execute sequence to
execute it when you execute the sequence
the data flows within it are executed in
the order you specified and if any flow
within a sequence fails then all the
changes made within the sequence or
rolled back click the back button to
navigate back to the data page and then
click data sets to verify the results
the two data sets are refreshed as a
result of the sequence execution now you
know how to run multiple data flows as a
single transaction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
