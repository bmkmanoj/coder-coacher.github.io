sales consultant in the UK HCM team the
purpose of this recording is to show you
how to use some new talent review
reports that we've created for you
unfortunately these reports aren't that
straightforward in terms of just cutting
and pasting the code and their work
straight away so that's the reason for
this recording to show you how to bring
the reports into your own environment
and also to do the small amount of
configuration that's required to allow
it to report against your own talent
review and the setup that you've created
so the first thing you'll need to do is
to be logged in to the answers interface
- Oracle bi within your fusion
environment just to mention that these
reports won't working composer so you'd
need to be working within this answers
interface you need to highlight the
custom folder under shared and then you
need to archive the file that's
associated with this post on customer
connect so there's my talent review
catalog I'm simply going to open that up
and then bring that in and when you've
successfully done that what you'll find
is you have a new talent review folder
which sits under shared custom if we
expand that folder included within that
or two separate sub folders and there's
one report that we've created here which
will work straightaway but the layout
might not be exactly what you're wanting
and there's a second lot of reports
which may be a layout that you would
prefer but require the additional setup
steps so firstly let's have a look at
the simple display and see how that
works so if I expand out the folder
called simple display performance vs.
potential you'll see here that we've got
a graph and then an associated drill
report so if I first of all open up the
retirement review graph report you'll
see that the first thing the report asks
you to do is to select the talent review
meeting that you want to report on so in
my case I'm going to select it in the
nine box current review that I've
interested in which is the 2014 talent
review meeting for Meg Fitzsimmons
having selected that the ok button then
becomes enabled just to mention that you
can select multiple meetings at this
point however they do all need to have
been based on the same template for the
results to make any sense
if I click on okay and the report runs
for that particular talent review
meeting and the information that's
returned in this graphical bar chart is
the number of review e's by each of the
difference performance and potential
boxes anyone who's ended up in the
holding area at the end of the talent
review meeting is displayed at the
bottom here as well as showing that
information graphically you can also
have a look at it in a tabular view by
using the view as option at the top here
we can see more details behind what
happened when talent review meeting was
finished if we go back to the graph the
other thing that's enabled on this
report is the ability to pick any of
these bars and drill to the underlying
employees so say for example I'm
interested in the six employees who
ended up in court talent I can click on
that bar and then choose the drill
option to say see the employees that
were in that box so here we can see that
the drill is passed through the name of
the talent review meeting which box it
was and also an underlying sequence
number for that and as a result it's
been able to identify those six
employees now if for any reason the
drill report doesn't work when you bring
this in into your own environment it's
probably because in the catalog you've
unarchive the folder into a different
place because the way that drill report
works is it needs to know where the
report is and obviously if you put this
talent review folder somewhere different
then the link to that report will not
work anymore if that's the case in your
environment all you need to do is go and
edit this main report and repoint it to
wherever you've put your drill report so
that's all you have to do to take
advantage of the simple display
performance versus potential report if
you want to take advantage of the end
box display reports which will actually
show a kind of three by three grid or a
2x2 grid depending on what kind of
talent reviews you have then you need to
come into the n box display folder
instead and these are the reports that
require a little bit more setup so in
order to set up a nine box report what
we're going to do is we're going to use
this talent review nine box example as
the starting point the first thing I
need to do is go in
edit this report now as you can see by
default this report doesn't return
anything and the instructions below it
say to save this template report is a
new name and update the filter on the
criteria tab to point to your talent
review however the talent review must
use performance and potential as its
axes and in this case it needs to be a
nine box so a three by three box once
you've done that it says to run the
report and follow the rest of the
instructions that are on the compound
layout so let's go through that if I now
save this report as a new name I'll just
put my initials on the front of it and
save that away it then says to update
the filter on the criteria tab so if I
move to the criteria tab at the moment
the filter isn't set to anything in
particular you need to choose your
meeting so I'm going to click on the
edit option and I'm going to go through
and find the talent review meeting I'm
interested in which is the 2014 example
once I've updated that filter if I now
come to the results tab then I'll see
the data for my particular talent review
meeting now we can see here the basic
structure of the report that we're going
to create and we just have to update
some of the labels in order for it to
show the exact setup that you've created
for your own talent review meetings but
before I go through the rest of the
instructions to tailor this report I'm
just going to briefly switch to the
talent review itself within Fusion so we
can see where this data is coming from
you'll notice the numbers I've got on
the performance tiles here showing ones
along the bottom then 163 and then 131
as the results of this talent review
meeting if I switch to that same review
meeting and have a look at it
you can see here that same information
displayed in the stalactite the standard
of talent review screen so ones across
the bottom 163 and then 131 you can also
see within the talent review how it
picks up the box labels that you specify
in the template and that's the thing
that we need to next in the report is to
get the performance tiles to be called
the same as these labels now in order to
do that what we need to do is to update
the name and description of each of the
performance tiles and to make this more
straightforward on the right-hand side
here is a bar chart which shows you for
the particular box sequence number what
the label is for this particular talent
review temper so number one needs to be
misaligned talent so to update that all
I have to do is go to the pencil icon
and here we can see the performance tile
and then I simply uncheck the measure
name and put in misaligned Talent if I
want to I can put a description in here
or I can just remove the whole
description altogether so in my case I'm
just going to repeat the name just to
show you the idea of how we could do
this when I finish that particular tile
I can click on done and need to repeat
that for each of the boxes
okay so I've almost completed updating
the boxes now I've just got the last one
box secret nine which is top talent
I change this one in exactly the same
way so my top talent and again for
examples sake I'm just going to put the
same name into the description just to
mention that if you don't like the
colors that the boxes are it's very
straightforward to change those within
each of the performance tiles you can
just come up to the performance tiles
properties box and here on the
background you can specify your own
colors
you can actually do conditional
formatting as well based on specific
values if you want to so I've now
completed updating the names and
descriptions for each of my performance
tiles and we can see here the display
starting to look complete the next step
actually requires me to delete the graph
view from the layout because I no longer
need that because I've now used the
information that it was providing me
with about the labels so to delete that
I can simply click on the cross it then
says delete this narrative from the view
so again I can come up here and click on
the cross and my report is now complete
if I now choose to save the report I can
have a look at one of the other features
that's available with this report so if
I go back to my catalog we can see here
is my new report if I now choose to open
the report then again the first thing it
asks me to do is to pick the talent
review meeting I'm interested in just to
remind you it must use performance and
potential as the axes and you can select
more than one provided they use in the
same template if I pick my 2014 talent
review meeting and click on OK then the
report runs I now have a 9 box layout of
the output of that talent review meeting
and a box at the bottom showing me how
many employees were held in the holding
area now for each of these boxes again
what we can do is we can click on the
number and then we can drill to see the
employees that ended up in this
particular box for this particular
talent review meeting so here we can see
it's passed across the fact that it was
the 2014 talent review meeting and the
fact that it was in that particular box
and here are my six employees
so hopefully this report and the
technique for creating it
we'll be useful in terms of helping you
create and produce your own reports on
talent review meetings
