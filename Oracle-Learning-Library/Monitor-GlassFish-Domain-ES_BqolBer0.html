Cloud Control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I will show you how to use
Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud control
12c for monitoring a glassfish domain
we'll begin the demonstration from the
home page of a glassfish domain to
access the home page will navigate to
the targets menu and then click on
middleware from the middleware summary
page we can see all the GlassFish
domains to which we've been granted
privileges to monitor to access the
domain home page will select a specific
glassfish domain the GlassFish domain
home page provides a summary of the
overall health of the domain and its
members whether the domain is open
source or otherwise does not matter
oracle enterprise manager provides the
same level of monitoring to both the
open source version as well as the
commercial version of glassfish from the
domain home page we can quickly
understand configuration details for the
administration server we can drill down
into the administration console for
configuring the domain we can determine
if any incidents or potential problems
could be impacting the domain or whether
any recent configuration changes have
occurred to the domain we can understand
the status and other statistics of the
domains clusters and servers if this
default domain home page view didn't
meet our needs we could easily customize
the home page through personalization
just as any target home page can be
personalized with in the console with
personalization you can add data remove
data and rearrange data displayed on the
page for the purposes of this
demonstration we will not personalize
this home page but rather drill down
into another home page the home page for
one of the domain servers from the
server homepage you gain an overview of
the servers health key performance
metrics spanning the jvm servlets
connection pools and JTA usage as well
as ejbs and JMS are displayed in
addition you can see the most requested
servlets in the past 24 hours
in order to analyze performance data
more closely we can navigate to the
performance summary page for this server
here we see a series of stacked
performance metric charts the default
performance metrics span availability
general statistics such as CPU usage and
request processing time as well as
memory this performance summary page is
helpful when we need to investigate a
performance problem as the page is fully
customizable we can go to the metric
palette to add or remove performance
metric charts this makes it easy for us
to correlate performance data across
different metrics as well as across
different target types such as the
underlying host target that this
glassfish server is running on we can
adjust the timeframe for which
performance data is displayed last 24
hours last two hours or a specific date
and time range this allows us to analyze
past performance data during the exact
timeframe in which a performance problem
began we can also overlay data we can
overlay performance data from another
glassfish server onto the same charts as
this server enabling us to for example
compare performance across servers
hosting the same application we can also
overlay past performance data with
current data to compare the two sets of
data monitoring data for the GlassFish
server is automatically collected after
discovery of the domain and is collected
on a regular basis to modify the default
collection frequency or to specify
warning and critical thresholds for
performance metrics we can modify the
metric and collection settings for the
server we can make such changes by
navigating to the target menu selecting
the monitoring sub menu and clicking on
metric and collection settings however
for better efficiency Oracle recommends
specifying these metrics and collection
settings in a monitoring temp
it and then applying the template across
several glassfish servers in one
operation this ensures that all
glassfish servers are being monitored in
a consistent fashion we could for
example have a template specific to our
production glassfish servers and another
template specific to the GlassFish
servers in our staging environment to
view the out-of-the-box monitoring
template for the GlassFish server we can
navigate to the enterprise menu click
the monitoring sub menu and then click
monitoring templates we can narrow our
search to just the GlassFish server
target type and choose to display the
oracle certified templates now we can
access the oracle provided template for
glassfish we can choose to create a new
template like this one add a remove
metrics modify the various threshold and
collection settings and then apply the
template to our targets if the warning
and critical thresholds are ever crossed
then we would receive alert
notifications of the potential problems
such notifications could just be in the
form of alerts in the console or we
could receive email or page alerts as
well we can even configure the
monitoring templates such that when
events occur corrective actions would
automatically be executed in response to
the problem thereby eliminating manual
involvement
