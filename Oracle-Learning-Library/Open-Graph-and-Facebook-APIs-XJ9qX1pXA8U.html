me thanks to Ellen thanks to Oracle and
thank you for the opportunity to talk to
you that this morning so I'm going to be
talking a little bit about developing
against facebook as it what does it mean
as a developer to create social
applications and a little bit about our
API is and specifically I'm going to be
talking about one of our API is one of
our sets of api's called open graph it
goes without saying that Facebook is not
an enterprise company per se but
hopefully a lot of the philosophies that
I talked about and lots of the
principles of social design our
applicable regardless of whether you're
developing for internal enterprise
customers or consumers and obviously
enterprises are made up of real human
beings who have a life outside of work
as well as inside work so a lot of what
has worked at Facebook and a lot of what
we've done hopefully will be applicable
to those users inside as much as outside
so this is me I like to get to the
monospaced font as early as possible and
I'm responsible for developer advocacy
which means essentially going on the
road and talking two coders talking to
people about developing against facebook
by the nature of the job easy to get in
touch with and you're very welcome to
contact me on Facebook Twitter whatever
and really I think my role is about
trying to establish Facebook's
reputation with developers and making
sure you understand what we can do for
you and providing an environment where
we prove that we can roll up our sleeves
and hack with you and create code and
give you whatever you need to be
successful and also hear about what
works and what does not work when you're
developing with Facebook so really we
think there are three things there are
three parts to being a Facebook
Developer we think there are three
things that we can do for you
one is obviously the you're building
applications and we provide the api's
and the toolkit and the SDKs and the
design principles to better do that but
secondly facebook offers the opportunity
field applications and pure efforts to
be distributed now we talk we normally
talk about that as being distribution
out to almost a billion people but even
within an enterprise environment
distribution is key how are you going to
make sure that your users whether they
are employees or partners or clients or
whatever are being made available or
being made aware of what your
application to do and it turns out that
the social concept is not just about
providing a personalized experience for
users but it's also about allowing them
to distribute their experiences or share
their experiences such that their
friends and their friends or friends of
their employees or their employees of
employees begin to learn what your
application is doing pollen and in turn
install it and so forth and finally
facebook also offers ads and promotion
and various marketing based channels for
distributing and making people available
aware of the apps that you have
available not going to talk too much
about that third section so really when
we talk about social it's worth going
back you know 200,000 years and think
about what humans have always done and
when there was a campfire out in the
Serengeti somewhere and there were two
human beings on either side of this
campfire you know that in a sense was
the first social network to people not a
very exciting social graph I made it two
nodes with an edge between them but
those were the first humans and what
they were doing immediately was
communicating and they were telling
stories to each other and that in a
sense defines who we are as a human
species we have this urge this
compulsion to tell stories why I mean it
helps us to survive an out in that kind
of environment the ability to tell
stories and communicate with each other
was how we knew where the
hunting was and where the water was and
which berries not to eat and so forth so
humans are programmed to tell stories
it's part of our identity it's part of
who we are and so regardless of the
technology that's available whether it's
a campfire or whether it's the printed
word or whether it's TV or radio or the
internet with program to tell these
stories to define who we are the strange
thing is actually if you look at the web
10 15 years ago the early days of the
web it was not actually a particularly
strong medium / telling stories and you
know for expressing your social identity
the web was a very static and anonymous
place it was made up of millions at the
time and billions now of web pages with
links between them it wasn't so much
about humans telling stories to humans
it was about pages that were linked
together and that you explored through
the use of keyword search I it wasn't
you know a medium that had that was
pushing stuff to you as a human it was a
medium where you had to go and pull
content you had to go and look for
things you had to go and browse it was
about seeking but of course the web has
evolved and over the last five years at
least it's become very clear that the
web and in fact technology in general is
orienting back around people which is
natural that's what we've always wanted
to do we've always wanted to tell
stories we've always wanted our
technology to work for us as a medium
for telling stories and so now the web
is not a web where you necessarily open
up a search engine and go looking for
things that you think might be out there
it's a medium where you go to Twitter or
Facebook or to your RSS feeds or
wherever and you have content instance
pushed to you by your friends by your
colleagues by your family etc etc and
every single one of those experiences
can in theory be personalized you're not
looking at the same webpage as everybody
else anymore you're looking at a web
page that's potentially customized
published for you gives you what you're
interested in and contains the stories
that you see your friends telling so
anyway that's a little bit high level
but ultimately what it boils down to as
a developer is the Indian thing about
how you can offer that sort of
experience to your users and users have
come to expect it employees of
enterprises have come to expect that
because of their outside lives they are
looking for every application to deliver
to them an experience that's social that
is personalized to them and if you can
develop an app that has that social
experience if you can deliver to them an
app that's going to allow them to tell a
story the great thing is that they're
going to distribute those stories to
their friends who are in turn going to
discover your service or discover your
application so it is literally a
virtuous circle you personalize the
application and in return developers
will help you to distribute it and get
it discovered amongst their friend now
there's no coincidence but behind this
picture I've placed a picture of you
know a metaphorical social graph because
really to be able to do this
personalized I think have your app
discovered you've got to both read and
write to that graph so by pulling data
out of a social graph your application
can be personalized HTTP GET and by
posting data back into the social graph
that is letting people share things and
tell stories HTTP POST they can then
tell that story they can then help you
you're apt to become successful and of
course that's why at Facebook we created
a platform most people in the world
think Facebook is a website but we think
it's a platform and hopefully so do you
it is an opportunity for you to build
these types of applications and when we
first launched the facebook platform
well before my time back in 2007 you
know initially it was just about little
apps running in an iframe on the
facebook com website and clearly the
proliferation of early apps there was
skewing towards games
games of course are the ultimate social
applications that makes a lot of sense a
lot of the innovation around social
applications came from that gaming
community but clearly these things can't
just live inside a sandbox can't just
live inside the facebook iframe and so
we worked hard to bring those same kind
of capabilities to web apps wherever
they were so on your own domain you can
now obviously access the same Facebook
API is the same facebook platform but
look you know the world is not about the
web so much anymore or exclusively
anymore and we clearly are seeing a huge
huge growth in mobile I don't know
whether it's occurred to any of you but
we are already living in the mobile age
the desktop age well you know it's kind
of happened and I think regardless of
the type of developer that you are and
regardless of the stack that you're
thinking about or the environmental the
tubs users you're developing for you
need to have mobile first and foremost
in your mind either you're developing
for mobile right now or I can guarantee
you need to be thinking about it very
very soon and so we as Facebook have
realized that you know mobile of the
mobile devices the ultimate social
device and we have a huge percentage of
our user base that are using mobile
devices to connect to their friends and
their social experiment of course that's
why you bought the phone right it's for
connecting to your friend and so for
developers we're also making sure that
we have this same platform available to
them regardless of whether they're
building iOS applications android
applications mobile web applications or
whatever other native stack they choose
these folks also deserve these users
also deserve to be able to have this
rich social experiences and I just
wanted to run through a quick example
this is not an enterprise example it's a
consumer example but as an example of
how some of these concepts can be pulled
together this is endomondo so endomondo
is a fitness out and of course there are
many fitness apps in the world but this
is what i use and the reason that i use
endomondo is is not just because it's
green and because it shows me you know
how far everyone of course
fitness app to do that it's not because
it shows me a pretty map or fitness out
to do that the reason I use endomondo is
that that's where my friends are it is a
fitness app that was built from the
ground up as a social application wasn't
just something they bolted on at the end
it's the second tab on the app here it's
a core part of the end Amendola
experience for me to be able to see what
my friends who also use endomondo are
doing so i can obviously compete with
them and I can do fitness challenges in
its center etc and it makes it more fun
so all other things being equal I will
choose the version of the app that is
social it's just what I've come to
expect from the modern world what's
really cool as the endomondo has added
this setting to so not only can I share
my stories about what fitness activity
I'm doing to the other users of the end
of mantua I can actually also share it
to all of my friends anywhere on
facebook now obviously the number of
friends I have on Facebook is a superset
of those that had to use endomondo but
of course is in n de Manos interests for
as many people to use the app as
possible so by doing this I can share
that story more broadly and help in turn
to promote the end amando app and in
fact my fitness the stories that I tell
about my fitness there's such a kind of
cool part of my identity that I even put
them on my facebook timeline so you know
facebook timeline if you like is the
ultimate expression of me which is
curated by me and so you can see the
music I listen to and you can see the
friends I have and the photos that I
take and the places I go to and the
pages i like and the fact that i like
celine dion I keep meaning to photoshop
that out but the endomondo app is front
of foremost on this time right it is Who
I am it identifies me I like people to
know that I run and that I cycle but
that's awesome for endomondo right
because their name is front and foremost
on my page and of course if any of my
friends click through they're going to
get taken through to the end of mondo
app and lower down my timeline the
endomondo app is configured to actually
tell these rich stories and we actually
call them stories I mean
these rich panels about the activity
that I'm doing here's that map on my
facebook timeline here's the aggregation
of all the running I've done on my
facebook timeline here's my the
aggregation of all the cycling I've done
on my facebook timeline and there's the
end amando brand front and foremost so
to summarize I'm telling a story and
endomondo is getting the distribution
out of it and that's the same on mobile
as well as it is on desktop and even if
my friends haven't gotten the facebook
app sorry the end amano app installed if
they click on that story to go through
two more detail we're going to drive
them to the App Store so you can see how
we started to drive distribution of this
app on behalf of the developer simply
because that developers made it easier
to tell rich stories that developers
want to that users want to self identify
with we also have an app center which we
use to provide a curated list of apps
I'm sure many of you have seen that this
itself is a social experience we show
which friends have used an app and we we
rank apps based on which of your friends
have used it I know there are you know
many opportunities for enterprise app
stores these days and we hope that the
same kind of concept come to the
enterprise too if you're a very very
large organization and there are
hundreds of apps available for employees
to use you know the ones that your
colleagues and that your colleagues of
colleagues are using are likely to
you know to be the ones that you should
also be exploring and so enterprise app
stores that put the employee at the
heart of that social experience are
likely to be very successful of course
there's also the opportunity to send
mobile and I just wanted to give you a
scale of how this works for it for
facebook and for the developers that
develop against facebook so using the
technique just like I showed their
whereby a story drives someone through
to the native app store to install an
app they don't already have in you know
per month we are driving at least 150
million users to both the Apple App
Store or Google Play so for a developer
you know this is kind of a magical way
to get your app distributed if you have
created a rich social experience
now 150 million seems like a big number
to me but I have to say in the grand
scheme of things at facebook it is
actually well one of many big numbers so
the facebook platform as it currently
stands we have nine hundred and fifty
five million active users that's on
facebook as a whole but i did want to
call out this particular stack which is
that of those users well over half now
our mobile monthly active users so if
any of you are in any doubt that we're
moving into a mobile world I guess
facebook traffic is a statistically
valid sample we have you know a huge
huge uptake users expect to be able to
do everything on mobile and that's not
just going to be the case outside the
enterprise okay so let's actually drew
into how some of this can actually be
built so you're all developers or your
coders and your think it is a wonderful
but how do I actually build this stuff
so and I must have stood on something
what do i do to get that to come back
take it out and plug it by again didn't
nearly worked do you guys mind slightly
gray interlaced slides might improve
them actually a little bit disconcerting
have nobody's epileptic so we have you
know obviously to be able to support
this ecosystem of people building rich
apps we have a huge number of developer
resources and before we go any further
anyone that's interested in getting into
this world you should definitely live on
developers facebook com that is our
entry point for everything that we
provide to developers documentation
resources download samples etc etc
behind that oh it works it was a search
slide behind that our platform itself is
obviously a very very deep and rich and
wide stack and you know it's almost at
this point two large fair to describe in
a single set of slides
but our platform is easy is a number of
different things when we talk about
developing up against facebook we're
obviously talking about SDKs that we
provide and we provide SDKs for a number
of languages I'll talk about that in a
moment we provide a restful graph API to
allow you to read and write data out of
that social graph it's HTTP POST the SDK
is ultimately are just a wrapper around
that we provide a query language called
fql which looks a little bit like sequel
and it basically allows you to do more
expressive queries on to the social
graph authentication and extremely
important part of any social obligation
is to get the user to identify who they
are and then give you the permissions to
do the things you want to do we use
OAuth 2 again that can be kind of tricky
my brain doesn't wrap itself around two
or three well but the SDKs take care of
all of that we provide dialogues and
plugins like the like button I'm sure
you've all seen as well as a rich kind
of object data layer underneath and I'm
going to talk about open graph in more
detail later and we have places and some
other things that for some reason have
been badly current but events what
movies people like you know their
friends obviously their subscriptions
and so forth this is a bunch of data
objects underneath all of which are
available through the Open Graph API s
I'll start off by running through a
couple of the important parts of that
platform plugins are obviously the
easiest one and they are prevalent
across the web in many many ways of
course to the like button the comment
button the send button has subscribed
but I am sure you have seen lots of
these this is a poor man's way to create
a social app track a like button on but
nevertheless it's a good way to get
introduced to seeing what the benefits
of creating a social experience can be
for users and some like the comments
plug-in you know allow you to add you
know rich interactive functionality to a
static web page simply by embedding a
little bit of JavaScript or a little bit
of html5 it's a good way to start
tasting what it means to create a social
application
but really ultimately when it comes down
to it the exciting part of the facebook
platform is the graph API which is the
restful interface to pretty much
everything that we offer everything
lives on graft on facebook com that is
our main endpoint HTTPS and pretty much
everything that ever comes back is Jason
and obviously in a sort of a restful
style gets get stuff out posts put stuff
in and the Franco the the path of the
URL indicates what it is that you're
trying to do so in this case I am
Facebook user 738 2298 37 and a get to
that URL will literally bring back my
basic information my name where I live
etc cetera the same sort of information
that you would see if you went to my
facebook page or the very simple part of
it anyway what's cool is it you can add
extra you know sections to that domain
after all on that part of the right-hand
side so for example such check-ins will
tell you it'll give you an array
adjacent based array of all the places
I've ever checked in / locations will
tell you all the places I've been / work
I think we'll give you all the companies
I've worked for and so forth and in fact
you can even alias the user ID for just
the word me now that of course
emphasizes the fact that to get this
stuff you have had to have gotten the
user to have logged in and to
authenticate it against your app and to
have given you permission to get access
to this information so actually what
happens is at the end of every single
call you make you have to append an
access token and the access token is the
thing that identifies the user and
identifies the permissions they have
granted you this is all just started or
stuff I'm sure you're all familiar with
OAuth we use OAuth 2 and we were kind of
part of the group that put together or
two in the early days it's still a
little bit baffling at least for novice
developers so we try to make it as
simple simple as possible ultimately
what the user sees
dialog box like this when you make a
request to the OAuth endpoint and the
list of permissions that you're asking
the user for appears on the right hand
side and if they accept it they simply
add to facebook and that is then logging
them in and it is authorizing or you
know letting them authorize what
permissions you've asked for and so if I
what ends up happening is you get an
access token which you can append to the
end of all the graph API calls in order
to prove who you are simpler than making
raw HTTP calls of course is to use an
SDK we have four supported SDKs
android/ios PHP and JavaScript I am
sorry to say we do not have a fully
supported java sdk and nord by the way
do we have an asp.net sdk nor in fact do
we have a ruby sdk but we work very
closely with communities to create open
source versions of these and to make
sure that they're compliant with our AP
is at the end of the day these are
nothing more than glorified HTTP
wrappers so you can make calls to that
API and they just convert it into
whatever behind the scenes and they do
the little bit of the OAuth up the front
so there's nothing magical about these
particularly but for developer
convenience they're obviously very
important the best that i know of anyway
the best java sdk for facebook is spring
social and in fact i think it supports
twitter or so but it'll take care of the
OAuth as well as the simple API calls
so just going to look on the front end
first one of the easiest ways to
implement Facebook it actually not on
the server side at all but on the client
side and so for anyone building web apps
anyone building html5 apps we've got a
rich JavaScript environment this is
pretty scary but actually is extremely
simple this is the small amount of dom
and the reasonable amount of javascript
boilerplate required to pull in a
JavaScript SDK now a great thing about
doing a JavaScript SDK approach is that
the OAuth can work without having to do
a sort of a second redirect it all kind
of taken care of for you you don't have
to provide an appt secret this is
literally boiler but you just got be a
basis of our website but by inserting
your facebook app ID in the top and
right hand corner you've essentially
provided all of the infrastructure on
your web page in order to get users to
login and to go on permissions and then
subsequently make calls I realize I'm
bringing JavaScript to a Java conference
but anyway trust me it's pretty easy and
once you've done that you're in a great
position to do things like this FBI
login that will log the user in there's
a callback comes back as an object
response if they're authorized you can
then do for example FB API / me if you
remember that was the alias meaning my
user ID and now we'll bring back some
basic data including the name which is
going to be easy enough for you to
insert into some welcome message so it's
nothing clever but this is incensed the
Minimum Viable social app that exists in
the world get the user to login get
permission to get their basic data and
customized experience personalize that
experience it's kind of what they expect
I even worse than bringing JavaScript to
Java conferences bringing PHP to a Java
conference but anyway sorry apart from
the dollar signs it's sort of no it's
not at all similar anyway
and those heresy rather but for those of
you that can tolerate it if you can
stomach it for a few moments this this
this is the kind of concept on the
server side so there is obviously a
two-stage process you have a front yeah
the first page that has a login URL
which will take the user to Facebook to
do the authentication and then there'll
be a callback which would mean they get
redirected back to your site and the
second page is the point at which you
can then start calling against the the
API we have a very very simple way of
invoking or including the PHP SDK into
into those pages but yet again there's a
simple API method that just allows you
to make all of these HTTP calls and just
for completeness writing back to the
graph it's just as important as reading
from it isn't actually going to be post
based and here we are paste posting in
this case a check-in this is me checking
in at work passing some coordinates and
a place ID which happens to be our
office and that is writing back to the
graph and of course in assuming are
given the permissions for this my users
will be able to do this and my friends
will all be able to see the activity
that they're doing now the rest of it is
up to you so to speak the rest of it is
up to you it's as a creativity around
well how can I create a social
experience that is a compelling and
exciting for users to get them sucked in
the mechanics are extremely extremely
easy couple of important tools we have
on our dev site a range of tools the one
that you absolutely must use if you're
doing anything with Facebook is the one
at the top graph API Explorer and this
is a sort of interactive console where
you can actually explore that API and
see what's available and see the pretty
printed Jason and be able to actually
click on some of those links and kind of
almost browse through the API switch
pretty cool so any of you exploring that
stuff will find that in valuable and
lots of sample apps as well
maybe you guys are okay but many of the
developers we make get freaked out by
blank text editors at the beginning of
the day is like okay well we can start
with something that already exists and
work from that how we doing for time
before I go any further okay so this is
kind of the overview of the introduction
to social apps and also very very basic
introduction to what building against
the Facebook api's look like but I
wanted to talk in more a little more
depth about something called the Open
Graph and the open graph is well it's
relatively new it's built on top of
everything you've seen but it's a new
way in which we believe you can create
strongly structured social experiences
and hopefully they'll make sense as I go
through so this is the social network
this is me the middle of it and clearly
you know Facebook and other social
networks are all about stitching people
together with their friends no big deal
when we launched the like button we were
providing in a sense this graph to
connect up to web pages so I can now say
I like the coca-cola web page or I like
the starbucks web page pretty soon we
realize that there needs to be a more
expressive way of expressing opinions
and actions against other objects in the
world you know what would I do if I
wanted to say I ate a meal or ran a root
or read a newspaper or listen to music
so Open Graph ultimately is about
providing these extra verbs that i can
say i'm using to act on an object and in
fact the verbs that the graph can now
describe are actually customizable by
you the developer you can create we call
them action types and if you think about
what your application does and the
things that people do in it you can
actually start to model in a very very
semantic way the actions that people are
performing against objects in that
social graph there is more to life than
like
and we launched this in october or
September later timber last year and it
was no coincidence that we launched it
at the same time that we launched
timeline I'm sure all of you they use
Facebook of now seen timeline and
timeline is an interface that you know
allows me to list out what I do in my
life and it's no coincidence that panels
like this that show the music that I've
been listening to are tied into this
open graph concept because listening is
a is a verb you know I didn't just like
this music I actually listened to it at
a given time you know here's one on the
left I'm going on a trip you know and
the tripit app is logging the fact that
I I'm about to leave well that's a verb
in a center and I'm about to leave on a
trip so these strongly structured
stories around strongly structured verbs
and strongly structured nouns are now
appearing in people's time land and
again it's a cross-platform story as
long as you have an app is capable of
posting HTTP and an app that's both
capable of reading it back out again you
have the opportunity to read and write
these structured stories regardless of
the medium and I'll just give you an
example it is obviously a consumer app
but this is soundcloud it's a website
that allows you to upload and listen to
wav files and if you spend any time on
soundcloud you quickly realize there are
four or five things you do all the time
you play sounds you like them you post
them you follow other users and you join
groups and so the soundcloud development
team has modeled these activities using
open graph and they've created the five
those five verbs and a couple of nouns
that correspond to them and they can now
post stories to post facebook about
users doing each of these different
actions clearly you need to go through a
permissions dialogue as before but
you'll see on the right here the
permissions dialogue now explicitly asks
the user for permission to post the
sounds you posted the sets you posted
and more
so users are fairly familiar now I think
with the concept that they can they can
be posting these richer stories and then
within the soundcloud app itself oh by
the way this is a general philosophy no
don't post things that users aren't
expecting to have posted it's very
important that you know the user feels
they have control over what stories or
what activity they're sharing soundcloud
is extremely good about this so every
one of the Open Graph verbs and objects
that can be shared are configurable on
or off in fact as an even more kind of
general principle when you're asking for
permissions on this sort of dialogue
never overdo it you know even in a
corporate environment even an enterprise
environment don't ask people for more
permissions than you need because users
will generally get freaked out why did
you need to know my religious
affiliations it will increase the
drop-off for known noticeable reason and
in fact the best practice is possibly to
ask for at any given time that
permissions you need just to do whatever
the next thing is in that so when they
first come to the app just ask them for
read permission so you can get their
basic data when they come to publish a
story that's the time you ask them for
published permissions on any of you that
have got an iphone with iOS 6 on it will
have already seen perhaps that the
Facebook integration in iOS 6 will
always ask incrementally as the app
wants to do more and more it asks for
more and more permissions and it's
really just about giving the user
comfort that this app isn't going to do
anything that they're not expecting it's
just a general principle fourth in
general never ask for too much too early
so in sound clouds case there you have a
desktop app which posts Open Graph they
have a mobile web app the post open
graph and iOS app and an Android app and
in fact even as always eggs app
basically this just proves that all of
those environments have HTTP client no
news to anyone but then those stories
naturally going to turn up in Facebook's
case on the facebook timeline newsfeed
ticker and so forth and what's cool
actually is that the Open Graph protocol
that underpins this is also now son to
be used by other social networks so this
is not by the way of Facebook silo this
is the same protocol that's being used
in twin
for their hover cards it's being used by
google plus it's being used by linkedin
and in fact I believe it's even being
used in Windows 8 so this stuff is is
now becoming fairly well adopted yeah
it's oh GP me it's a based on RDF a
that's an open web protocol doc
obviously works on iOS and again you
know if the user does not have iOS but
they're being driven through to an Open
Graph story it will encourage them to
install that application I'm just going
to quickly run through the steps and for
some reason we got the fuzz again but
let me just little talk a little bit
about how Open Graph actually works
first thing to do is obviously model the
activity that your users do in their
applications what are the actions what
are the objects what are the verbs and
what are the nouns if it's a HR
application know if the action is
reviewed and the object is person
perhaps a little bit of a contrived
example yeah exactly and in the Facebook
world the way that you can figure this
is literally in our app dashboard where
you come in as a developer to configure
the app you're literally just press you
know create new action type create new
object type and start to build up these
semantic classes now so what are the
types of thing that you create and what
are the types of things that users do on
them so the font is extremely small here
but this example here has an action type
of cook this is an app for cooking food
cook and then the object types are
dishes and dishes in turn and made up of
ingredients you can actually model
object relationships so the senior is
made of beef and cheese and so forth and
you can have an open graph object for
each of those the second thing is you
have to create the objects themselves
and these are actually exposed using the
ogp protocol so the mark-up that you
would see there
on a web page somewhere living on a URI
describes these objects so there would
be a chocolate cookie object which would
have title of chocolate cookie the image
some descriptions any relationships to
other objects the lasagna dish would
have its own web page with its own mark
up at the moment anyway this is the way
that you you create these objects they
have to exist as you are I content just
like the Semantic Web and the RDF
concept that underpins all of this so
this is a slightly clearer to read
example this would be my dish that I
created and I would be able to provide
at the bottom references to the two
ingredients that go into lasagna as well
as an image that I want to have
representing my lasagna object to
actually get the user to express the
fact that they did something to this
object it's an HTTP POST naturally so
posting to the social graph on facebook
in this case / my name space cook with
the recipe object that I just created
this HTTP post is enough for that user
to be able to say they cooked lasagna
again contrived example but as I
stressed it's extremely easy to make
these strong structured statements using
HTTP only now there is a challenge here
i guess if any of you using this kind of
thing for an enterprise environment
where the content is not public as I
caveated right at the beginning you know
we are not an enterprise company but the
way that this works is that when a user
says they have acted on an object and
you've posted that action to facebook
facebook naturally needs to come back
and scrape that metadata so the URL of
this object needs to be publicly visible
now that's okay when you're talking
about lasagna and cookies and other
stuff I guess if you were trying to use
Open Graph in a more sensitive
environment you would need to think
carefully about what elements of an
object of any you would want to expose
externally but for the applications your
enterprises customers are using this
should be no issue at all just need to
be a public site so Facebook will come
back it'll scrape the image the title
any of those rare
princes because of course that is the
data that's going to appear in the
stories that appear on their friends
timelines and finally the cool thing
about open graph is that it's not just
the right medium it's also read medium
and in a sense we're creating a
queryable semantic structure here so you
can get that graph and you can get back
out again all the things that the user
has done so you can find out all the
dishes they've cooked all the movies
they've watched all the music they
listen to etc etc and this is obviously
key to personalizing the experience
again an example might be let's say
you've spent a year using one music app
for example and you've already listened
to lots of music on that app so that
service has begun to build up an idea of
what your tastes are and can you know
customize playlists for you what if you
switch to another playlist to another
music app in a sense the music you've
listened to that's that's your data that
is a user that's your that's your
identity so how can the other music app
begin to tap into it well now they can
if you give them permission they can
actually read out the list of music that
you played in the past despite the value
was on a different app and they in turn
could provide you and immediately
personalized experience we do obviously
a policy for the platform in general in
this case we know we do not I mean we
have certain expectations of
responsibility on the part of the
developer one thing for example might be
if the user d authorizes an apple
together then that app has an obligation
to remove the data that they've
previously captured about the user I'm
not going to run through our entire
policies here but in terms of this open
graph reading data that's why it's
called open graph we do encourage impact
apps to read this out as much as they
can in order to offer that personalized
experience
so that's pretty much it the summary for
open graph it was a little bit of a
whistle-stop tour but hopefully given
you hopefully it's given you a sense of
of how we think that you know apps can
read and write this structured data in
and out of an open graph environment I
just want to conclude by I guess
wrapping back to you know my first
philosophical point which is ultimately
this is the way that users want to
behave and as developers we have an
obligation to provide apps to provide
this social substrate that provides this
medium for them to better interact with
their friends their employees they
colleagues etc it's kind of what they
expect and you can make your appt much
more successful if you do provide a
social experience for them they in turn
will tell stories and help you get your
apps successful and that I think is my
time thank you very much thanks we do
have a couple minutes if if you have a
few minutes to may not answer some
questions if there are any questions if
we can take some of those great thanks
good i'm unfamiliar actually we're
social OpenSocial is right now I mean
yeah I mean it was one of those kind of
cross-industry attempts to standardize
around open around open standards for
graph reading and writing right okay go
ahead there's another question right bad
you yep yep
so we have a couple of Global's
ourselves that we've just seen lots of
people using so we've modeled them in a
nice you know kind of global way so
listening to music so listen is a global
action and music is a global object
reading news watching movies we actually
have a global object for global action
so for like and for following other
people and I aming i'm going to imagine
that over time as we start to see common
additional actions and objects that we
would look at wrapping those up into
nice standard ways which is a
particularly important when you're
reading back out of the graph because
you want to you don't have to try and
guess what the actions were that we used
in other places but you know if you go
to our dev site and you'll look at the
list of Global's you'll see you see
whatever great morning master skreen
social as a way to buy gamma have you
heard about the only other alternative
API that is some of closer to the Java
standards that orders also proposing or
promoting like Calvin Sevenfold raha I
have not but I will go and check it out
all right fantastic great anybody else
ok James thanks very much thanks very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
