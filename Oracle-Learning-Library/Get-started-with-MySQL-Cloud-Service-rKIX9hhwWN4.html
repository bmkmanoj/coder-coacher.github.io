MySQL cloud service instance before we
start there are some prerequisites first
you'll need an account on Oracle public
cloud this can be a trial account or an
account that you or your company has
purchased and you must know the name of
an identity domain associated with that
account and the data center associated
with the identity domain the identity
domain must have the MySQL cloud service
activated you will need the service
administrator role so that you can
create and administer instances this is
associated with your Oracle single
sign-on login tied to your email address
it's also helpful if you've already got
an SSH key pair so that you can upload
your public key to the service instance
if you don't already have such a key
pair you can create and download when
during the service creation wizard with
the prerequisites met you can now sign
in at cloud.oracle.com select your data
center and enter your identity domain
then you can log in using your single
sign-on credentials to get access to the
Oracle public cloud dashboard
you
from here I can see what services are
activated for this identity domain I'm
going to create a MySQL cloud service
instance so I'll select MySQL from the
cloud services menu
I haven't yet created any instances so
I'm prompted to create one by clicking
the create service button and launching
the wizard the wizard is quite simple
there are three pages the service page
for the high-level information the
details page for configuration specifics
and options and a confirm page that
shows a summary of my choices the
service name is a short name of up to 50
characters that appears in dashboards
and on other lists and screens to
identify this service the service
description is more flexible and gives
you a place to describe the purpose
lifecycle or other information for this
service this text appears when you drill
into the service you'll need an SSH key
pair to log onto the instance host
machine as usual you keep the private
key on your local machine and place the
public key on the remote host in this
case the virtual machine that hosts
MySQL cloud service instances if you've
already got a key pair you can browse to
the file that contains your public key
on your local machine and upload it to
the wizard you could also copy the
public key text to your clipboard and
paste it into the key value box for the
purpose of this tutorial I'll create a
new key in the wizard and download the
key pair to my local machine the new
public key is automatically associated
with this virtual machine
the downloaded key pair consists of a
public key and a private key in a zip
file there are a few ways to make these
keys available to the ssh client on my
local machine but for now i'll just copy
them to my ssh directory so that i can
use them to connect in a later tutorial
the compute shape specifies the resource
profile for this instance each shape
specifies the number of OCP use and the
amount of RAM dedicated to the instance
and O CPU is an Oracle computer unit
equivalent to one physical core with
hyper-threading corresponding to two
hardware execution threads for this
tutorial I'll use the default compute
shape that uses the least resources but
as my application demand grows I can
change the compute by scaling of the
instance the second page of the wizard
is where I choose specific configuration
details these include the usable
database storage in gigabytes the root
user credentials
MySQL Enterprise monitor configuration
and automated backup configuration I'll
go at the default 25 gigabytes and
MySQL's root user is the default
administration user I enter and confirm
the administration password I'll change
the default database schema name to one
of my choosing and within the wizard I
can choose to configure MySQL Enterprise
Monitor on this instance for simplicity
in this tutorial and as best practice I
won't install MySQL Enterprise Monitor
on the same machine as the instance that
it monitors because this is an instance
of MySQL Enterprise Edition it also
includes MySQL Enterprise backup which I
can use to perform automated and
on-demand backups to the hosts disk and
also to cloud storage containers to
enable this you can provide the name of
the cloud storage container and its
credentials but for simplicity I'll
disable that in this wizard the confirm
screen provides a summary of my choices
from the previous screens in the wizard
and when I verified the settings I click
the Create button to complete the wizard
and create the instance back at the
services overview I can see that the
instance creation request was accepted
and the status of my first service is
creating service
when the service has been created I can
click the refresh button to see that the
service has been created and I can click
on the service name to view it's details
these details include the public IP of
the virtual machine on which the service
is hosted and it is from this screen
that you can perform much of the
administration patching and scaling of
the instance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
