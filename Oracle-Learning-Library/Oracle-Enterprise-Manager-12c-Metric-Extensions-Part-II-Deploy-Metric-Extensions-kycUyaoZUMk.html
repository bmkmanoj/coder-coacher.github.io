Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series this demonstration is the
second part of a series of two this part
shows you how to deploy into Blish
metrics extensions to targets we assume
there is currently metric extension that
has just been created to compute the age
and CPU utilization on your hosts refer
to the first part of this demonstration
to see how to do that
how our metric extension is still in
deployable draft let's deploy it to a
particular target click on actions then
select deploy to target on that page
click on add
let's filter to only see host targets
then select your target then click
Submit
you can now see the job is scheduled you
can click on refresh to see its
evolution okay so our metric extension
is now deployed let's verify this go
back to metric extensions
okay now you can see that under deployed
targets for our metric there is a number
one click that number
it shows you on which target it is
currently deployed now that the metric
extension is deployed to that target you
can go to and look at the target home
page from the home page select the host
menu
then monitoring and all metrics on the
left you can see at the bottom your new
metric extension expand it and click on
the top one to look at the latest
collection results click your data value
and to get more details for this metric
these gets you to the eastery details
obviously there is only one data point
on the graphic after a number of
collections a complete graphic will show
now that we are satisfied with the draft
metric extension behavior let's publish
it for others to use using the
Enterprise menu at the top let's go back
to monitoring then metric extensions now
from there select your metric and click
actions then select publish metric
extension notice the status has now
changed to publish so we are done at
this point your metric extension is
available for anyone to use this is the
end of the demonstration thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
