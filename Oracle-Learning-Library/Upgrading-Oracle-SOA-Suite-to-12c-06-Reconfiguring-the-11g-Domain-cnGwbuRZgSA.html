reconfiguring the 11g domain this is the
sixth in a series of eight videos about
upgrading Oracle's so a suite to version
12c at this point we're well into the
upgrade process we've created new
database schemas and upgraded our
existing database schemas and active
instance data in this video we'll run
the reconfiguration wizard to
reconfigure our 11g domain the wizard
will apply reconfiguration templates to
the domain it'll also update schemas
scripts and other files that support
Fusion Middleware products we've said
this before but it's a good time to
remind you that if you're using Oracle
business activity monitoring or BAM you
can't upgrade BAM 11g to BAM 12c using
the standard upgrade procedures refer
instead to upgrading sowa
with Oracle business activity monitoring
section of the upgrading so a suite and
Business Process Management guide for
more details the topology we're using
for our walkthrough doesn't include
Oracle BAM
so we'll proceed as planned recall that
for our demonstration we have two hosts
and both hosts have domain files we're
going to run the complete configuration
wizard on the host with the admin server
reconfiguring the domain on that host
then after one more domain update will
copy the upgraded domain to the other
host we'll see that in the next video in
this series remember that the steps
we're about to follow reflect the needs
of our particular topology so they show
one path through the reconfiguration
wizard your environment may be different
so be sure to consult the documentation
before performing these tasks in your
environment the reconfiguration wizard
is found in the oracle common common bin
folder under the new Fusion Middleware
12c Oracle home we've added two
parameters to specify a log file and the
maximum logging priority to capture the
highest level of detail in the log let's
start the reconfiguration process
the select domain window prompts us to
provide the location of the existing 11g
domain the domain will be reconfigured
in place which means the 11g domain will
be modified and no 12c domain
directories will be created double check
our entry and click Next the
reconfiguration setup progress window
displays the progress as reconfiguration
templates are applied this prepares the
domain for reconfiguration when the
process completes we'll click Next the
domain mode and JDK window displays the
domain mode set for the current domain
this is set in the Fusion Middleware
control and can't be changed here the
JDK displayed is the one that was used
to start the wizard you could browse and
select a new one you might choose to do
that if the one displayed isn't
supported in 12c in our case the JDK is
supported so we'll click Next
if you have any data sources that were
created using the WebLogic server
console rather than the configuration
wizard when 11g was installed this
window appears we could use this window
to supply connection details for these
data sources but we're going to have a
better opportunity to do so later on so
we're going to ignore this for now
and click Next here - we can advance to
the next window recall that one of the
12c schemas we created in the video
titled creating database schemas for 12c
was the service table or STV schema on
this window we specify connection
details for that schema the
reconfiguration wizard will use the
service table to load other 12c schema
credentials automatically credentials
for our existing 11g data sources will
be preserved
double-check our surface game host name
and password and we click get our Cu
configuration the connections successful
so we can advance to the next window the
JDBC component schema window lists all
of the JDBC data sources and their
connection details we can modify the
connection information for any data
source here here we can test all of the
data source connections at once by
selecting the check box at the top left
click test selected connections
check all the way to the bottom of the
list we have all green checkmarks that's
good news so we'll advance to the next
window if the domain you're configuring
is using a per host node manager the
node manager window appears it allows
you to select the node manager
configuration to use for the
reconfigured domain we're going to
accept the default domain location which
is displayed here note that it's under
the original 11g domain structure in the
node manager configuration section we're
going to migrate the existing per host
node manager configuration to a per
domain configuration we'll need to
specify where the node manager is
currently located which in our case is
under the 11g WebLogic server directory
finally we need to specify the new node
manager credentials the ones we'll use
to start the node manager in the
reconfigured domain supply username and
password and click Next if you want to
modify any advanced configuration
settings you can select them here you'll
see additional windows according to
which ones you select for example you
can select the manage servers clusters
and coherence option to add modify or
delete manage servers clusters or
machines from the domain select
deployments and services to customize
how application deployments and services
are targeted to servers and clusters our
topology doesn't require any advanced
configuration so we'll move on the
configuration summary window displays
our planned reconfiguration we check
everything one more time and then click
reconfig the reconfiguration is underway
and we're apprised of the progress here
when the reconfiguration is complete we
proceed the reconfiguration success
screen reports that we were well
successful in the reconfiguration of a
domain on the first of our two hosts and
so we finish remember that the choices
we made in this demo were appropriate
for our environment to determine the
correct path through the reconfiguration
wizard for your environment consult the
documents you see listed on screen in
this video we reconfigured the 11g
domain next we'll upgrade additional
domain configurations then we'll copy
the upgraded domain to the other host
both of these tasks are covered in the
next video upgrading domain
configurations
until then I'm Ron Pinkerton thank you
for your time and attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
