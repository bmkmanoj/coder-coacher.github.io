at kimya logic with me is raj
ramchandani he's our founder our vp of
product we're going to talk about today
is this this journey to IT as a service
and if you're if you're tired of this
notion of cloud and you're sort of
overwhelmed by this this you know
repetitive you know beating over the
head of this notion of cloud this may be
a good topic for you because what we're
looking at is we're really trying to
understand try to take a slightly
different angle on it which is what does
cloud really mean in terms of the end
state right and for us really what it
means is delivering services so if you
think about cloud you can think about it
in a variety different ways I guarantee
if I ask each one of you to give me a
definition of cloud it would be slightly
different than anybody else in this room
right everybody's going to give you a
slight different different definition so
for the purposes of this discussion we
would like you to think about cloud as
delivering services right at the end of
the day what does it mean it just means
you're getting services that you need as
an end user or an end customer and
that's really what it should mean so so
that's really what we're going to talk
about today we're going to talk about
paving the way to getting to that will
call it you know end state or sort of
shangri-la if you will it's it's not
easy it's got a lot of bumps in the road
so we're talking about paving that road
paving that path and that would be the
thought of topic we talked about today
so let me start off with a question how
many in the room have actually
implemented cloud right so I see one two
three okay and again it could be a wide
definition to when I say implement a
cloud you know could be bringing in some
sass services it could be building a
private cloud it could be supporting a
hybrid cloud so you know they're a
variety of different different nuances
there but but again at the end of the
day at least some people are moving in
that in that journey towards private
cloud and towards sort of providing
those I like to refer to them as sort of
morpheus services that are abstracted
and automated so that kind of that next
level above virtualization which will
also talk about so okay good I just want
to get a feel for that so again in terms
of thinking about cloud and again if you
equate that to delivering services
we're really talking about here is
trying to combine business agility with
IT agility to increase time to market so
I've gone around I've talked to CIOs all
over the country in a variety of
different vertical markets in a variety
of different sized organizations and
almost to a person those CIOs at the end
of the discussion when I asked what are
you really truly what do you care about
and what keeps you up at night it's time
to market it's delivering applications
to their constituency faster than their
competitor right so if they can get
their applications out if they get their
product that is supported by those
applications out faster they're going to
be more successful but especially if
you're talking about public companies
you're talking about tangible results
and having to deliver Wall Street
results it's all about time to market
whether it's product whether it's
application whatever it is so this is
this is really where the rubber hits the
road is time to market so you can think
about all of the IT infrastructure you
can think about all the applications you
can think about all of that in support
of the business but the business cares
about time to market so really what
you're thinking about here when you're
thinking about cloud computing and
enterprise IT is time to market and
that's this whole agility story so we're
gonna we're going to touch on this but
as a thematic kind of overview I wanted
to just set the stage for you here just
so you can kind of get an idea about how
we're thinking about it how we're
delivering to you know if you're
delivering services in a you know in a
more streamlined more efficient way
what's the net result of that and
somewhere down the line the net result
is going to be time to market right
because that's where that's where that's
where things actually matter so layers
so think about layers of cloud adoption
we started out with virtualization that
could have been anywhere between 1999
and you know maybe 2007-2008 it could be
we're still you know could be some
organizations are still right in the
middle of virtualization adoption today
but that's sort of a starting point so
if you think about virtualization you
think about storage you think about
servers you think about applications
that's kind of a building block and from
there you need to build and you ads you
know you can add SAS applications and
for this particular context we're
thinking about IT supportive SAS right
so you could think about you know help
desk as a service or you can think about
capacity
as a service capacity management as a
service kind of core IT functionality
that's going to be in support of IT then
you think about infrastructure as a
service and what does
infrastructure-as-a-service mean so get
back to that previous slide we talked
about private clouds for me and the way
we're thinking about private cloud is
the next iteration infrastructure of the
service is the next iteration above
virtualization right so you've got you
first you take your bare metal and you
convert it over into VMs then you have
to take those VMs and make them more
useful and make them more automated
right so there's an automation layer
above that and that's where a lot of
these private clouds that we're talking
about today really really are in terms
of their life cycle then you think about
taking to that next level you start
thing about platform you start thinking
about platform as a service so then
you've got this automated plat you've
got this automated infrastructure now
how do you orchestrate that how do you
abstract that from even farther from
that core infrastructure how do you
create another layer of abstraction so
that users can get what they need and
when I say users in the context to pass
i'm thinking about developers developers
can get what they need with two clicks
instead of spending half of their life
building out web servers app servers
database service right how do you
abstract that how do you how do you make
that how do you orchestrate that and
that's really what you're thinking about
when you're thinking about pass this
will be the focus of the discussion
today right so again we're not going to
boil the ocean we're not going to talk
about all of these but we're going to
focus on is pads we're going to talk
about the evolution from
infrastructure-as-a-service into into
platform as a service then you can think
down the line so you know we all like to
be forward thinking I think everyone's
probably gotten some great ideas from
from the show this week probably some
ideas that maybe you didn't have coming
in and things you weren't necessarily
thinking about coming into this week
that maybe you are now how about big
data big data is a huge topic how about
big data as a service right so think
about in that in that context where you
could have you know two clicks to a
fully provisioned Hadoop cluster right
that's kind of an interesting idea right
moving forward so this is almost like a
dot dot dot and that's the truly
exciting thing about with with the cloud
delivering services that's really truly
exciting part about with his offers from
our perspective
is you can continue to add those
services as you go and as your business
requires it so if you can find the right
partners you know like an Oracle and and
others that are you know kind of
thinking about this a few steps ahead
it's a pretty it's a pretty exciting
time to start thinking about this so
anyway from what from sort of the layers
of adoption perspective what we're going
to focus on today is is that past layer
what that means what what sort of what
options are there today and you know how
you might you might want to start
considering it yourselves so with that
I'm going to turn it over to Roz I'm
gonna let him talk about the platform as
a service layer and some more details
that you can kind of get a better
understanding about what what that
encompasses thanks like so so we why
focus on platform as a service because
what we believe is we have spent
enormous amount of time over the last
decade doing virtualization and
converting virtualized environments to
deliver that as a service to
infrastructure as a service is an
incremental value that you get out of
infrastructure as a service and there
are plenty of ways you can do that there
are plenty of solutions out out there
available if you want to build
infrastructure as a service in your in
your data centers what is biggest
challenge in the IT environment is
actually the sleuth of application
infrastructure services that you have to
put together to deliver that as a
service so that's why we believe
platform as a service is the most
critical component when it comes to on
your journey when you want to deliver
everything as a service your
infrastructure has to be ready to be
delivered as a service so here what you
see is basically application
infrastructure is pretty complex and
just to you know not to trivialize in
this slide but the major components of
your of your application infrastructure
or the frameworks we develop language V
develop applications using variety of
different languages scripting Java Ruby
Python there are different frameworks
that we have to work with for each of
those different languages
p card to manage databases you know
mysql or no sequel databases MongoDB s
etc there is caching components involved
for some you know critical applications
that we want to want to manage with
database caching there is messaging
components there is web tier components
the web servers the load balancers proxy
servers etc so these are some of the
major components of managing if you want
to deliver platform in general as a
service so this is basically we look at
this as a 50,000 overview of all the
things that you have to worry about to
actually deliver this as a service now
once you have put together all of these
components there is enormous challenge
about optimizing configurations sizing
and dependencies of of all the
frameworks that you end up using or
supporting in the in your environment
similarly with databases you have
optimization issues schema optimizations
you have to worry about the backups
restore our data applications and
storage management and all kinds of
other other problems that we are
familiar with with at least with sequel
databases same problem set of problems
that occur with say no sequel databases
caching of course you know caching is
one of the biggest components that we we
have to deal with and it why do we care
about caching so much is all about the
performance and scalability of our
applications messaging is another
biggest component the problems with
messaging is how reliable our messaging
systems are can it scale to the scale
that we are supporting the kinds of
applications that we are developing in
these days to support an enormous number
of users failover capabilities
eliminating the single point of failures
for our messaging system wept here is
another biggest component right it's not
only about you know securing the web
servers but
the firewalls and proxies but we have to
worry about the failure management of
the web tier itself so these are
challenges that we have been dealing
with over or you know for a very long
time but these challenges still occur in
our infrastructure as a service layers
or call it as a private cloud that we
that we are starting to build now so
again to just to summarize and put all
the things together what this looks like
is this complexity the whole problem is
putting together all the application
infrastructure services together
configuring them optimizing every single
tier virtualizing making sure we are put
in redundant architecture reliable
architectures we worry about
availability of time of our applications
latency issues backups restoring
upgrades and patching all our entire
application infrastructure so the this
whole thing is pretty complex I mean
given we want to say that we want to
deliver a platform as a service but the
complexity is involved and the
complexity is much bigger than we have
seen in the past now how do we manage
this complexity right we have been
managing this infrastructure today
without clouds as well so there are
various ways we do this and we picked
the three ways that we think are most
generally common or some places that we
are going and in terms of the technology
that we can adopt to manage these
application infrastructure services so
chef and puppet you know pretty obvious
a lot of you must have used system
integration frameworks like chef for
puppet or equivalent solutions platform
as a service is something it is still
evolving and be at kemah logic I've been
working on it for purpose a couple of
years as well we have developed
solutions we have our own thoughts about
the platforms as a service how they
should work in an IT environment
and then what we have looked at is the
cloud services basically and I'm going
to talk more about these modular
building blocks of of the services that
can actually help you build and manage
this entire application infrastructure
or a pass instead to just to serve
everyone understand so we were thinking
about this and the way we're you want to
present this here is these are three of
the most common solutions that we
believe are there to try to solve this
problem right again thinking about
delivering services in a more efficient
broader way and we're thinking to
specifically hear about application
services so just so everybody
understands what we're really trying to
solve for is this right in this
discussion we want to just kind of get
you thinking about this and start
thinking about ways to kind of solve
this and deliver part of that notion of
the as a service future right so
everything as a service well this is a
critical path to getting everything as a
service and and just so everybody
understand these are kind of the three
areas that we're going to talk about as
options that are going to help in that
critical path to get to the point where
again shangri-la everything is as a
service so
so just curious how many of you use chef
or puppet or both in your ikea
environments i am assuming most of you
guys to IT stuff there's one okay pretty
interesting actually we thought there
will be a lot more actually people who
use or at least familiar with chef and
operator exactly so chef and puppet are
basically open source integration
configuration management solutions so if
you want to automate say provisioning of
an a database or you want to provision
an entire application stack on to either
either a bare metal box or on a
virtualized environment so chef and
puppet basically left lets you write
these descriptive language it's it's
basically a ruby language so you write
your what they refer to as recipes or
cookbooks so you write your recipes and
execute it through the server so what
server would do is take your descriptive
language and provision the entire stack
that you have that you have requested to
so basically in that stack you would
define what elements of infrastructure
you are provisioning what configuration
settings you want your usernames
passwords for databases and other app
servers or anything that you're
provisioning all the elements it allows
you to define in a descriptive language
and then you run it by the by the
puppets or a chef server and then it
will provision the entire stack for you
so that's very high level overview about
you know chef and puppet and it's pretty
common it's actually open source
solution so there is a broad community
out there which where you can find
pretty much all the entire large set of
recipes and cookbooks if you want to
provision you know any kind of stack
whether it's Java Ruby databases and it
allows you to actually pick the recipes
that you want to provision on a bare
metal VMware non VMware environments and
even provisioning on the external clouds
amazon club so it's pretty comprehensive
solution but think about this is more
like you know configuration management
and provisioning system you know you
write your language descriptive language
and then send it over to the server to
do the job so you know it's it's a great
solution you know chef and puppet a lot
of people use it actually we see you
know obviously every every solution
always will have pros and cons so we
believe you know because of the open
source community is pretty widely
available so you can pretty much go
download any kinds of recipes you would
like you will find recipes for
everything today if not then community
can write help write it for you but the
cons what we what we see the limitations
actually for systems something like chef
our puppet is you have to write those
recipes or you have to find them and
then anytime you do a configuration
change a slight modification either you
change a password or username or a
different version number software that
you are provisioning you end up
rewriting the recipes so basically you
have to do a version control you have to
manage your recipes so that you end up
with large number of recipes we refer
that as a recipe sprawl there are so all
the things like components like
monitoring you know if you if you
worried about auto scaling on the on the
clouds and high availability and
failover so basically what happens is
none of these is built into the solution
as such you as a user are building that
solution you're creating an architecture
and telling shuffle chef or a puppet to
actually provision that for you that's
as far as puppet and chef would go for
you and a lot of you know coding is
involved you really write a lot of Ruby
code in this so we believe you know
although we have been using chefs and
puppets in the in the data centers for a
while these are challenges you know you
need this way it's very hard for us to
deliver platform which works as a
service lot of complexity involved
coding involved lot of version control
lot of recipes prom so who the next
solution is batch basically going one
level up right one it's not one level
actually it's quite a bit high level
when you come to a platform as a service
any of you familiar with platform as a
service today any of you using
platform-as-a-service know so so we
believe platform is as a service is like
I said you know it's evolving it's very
nascent market today for platform as a
service actually there are solutions out
there like you know we sell software
that you can buy and then deploy it on
your data center and then everything the
entire stack you is delivered as a
service so if your developers want you
know access to deploying a java
application then you know they just
basically push a java file into the
cloud and everything else is done by by
the system the platform itself so
provisioning the stack you know
configuring them monitoring them and
tired architecture is built by the
platform itself for you so the entire
stack is delivered as a service you want
to know I was going to have seen it if
you're not familiar with platform as a
service you're just just it just to
familiarize to kind of tie it back if
you're familiar with engine yard they
have a platform as a service or date
which they've offered for a number of
years for the Ruby community or Google
App Engine or force com those types of
custom of touch companies have met were
early providers in the public space in
terms of being able providing public
facing platform as a service that their
challenges with those specifically they
get very very locked in because they're
not open platforms over it
very close but those if you've heard
those names that's what would generally
that's what we're talking about here in
this platform as a service space what
Rogers was was moving towards is the
concept is fantastic right in terms of
delivering those services and delivering
those platform services to the
developers but how do you do that inside
of an enterprise right or inside of a
private cloud as opposed to a public
look facing situation where you have you
know firewall issues you have code
outside the firewall you have infosec
guys that are knocking on the IT guys
door trying to figure out how this is
how this is going to happen so that's
where Raj is going with this as a
service model in terms of delivering to
enterprise customers within a firewall
so just I just want to set a context in
case you if you've heard any of those
names that's all in this in this similar
platform delivery platform services
space Thanks pay
so you know platform-as-a-service so we
built you know platform-as-a-service in
last about two years and then we have
been you have been working with a lot of
enterprises who have actually done proof
of concepts and you know actually
deploying in in their data centers right
so what happens is because of the
complexity involved because of the
breadth of application infrastructure
that is involved in in the enterprise's
the platforms which are delivered as a
service tend to be very tied into a
particular language so so you will find
which is Java pass you will find Ruby
pass you will find you know PHP pass it
is very hard to build a platform which
can support entire you know set of
languages and frameworks so there are
challenges so what you will find is
although the platforms are completely
integrated solutions very easy for you
to deploy applications all you need to
do is basically push an app into the
cloud
yeah so her question was is this
platform running on our servers ya know
so there's two there's two schools of
thought right so there's there's there's
the opportunity to use a public-facing
like i mentioned like a like a like a
google app engine or like a engine yard
in that case yes it's typically and
completely as a service the challenge is
taking that and turning it around and
saying how do i put that platform in my
environment inside my firewall so that i
have the platform but it's accessing my
own servers right it's accessing my own
private cloud and that's that's kind of
part of the challenge that we're
thinking about here
who pays the licensing fees is the
question so yeah so for the for the
platform itself typically the platform
itself the enterprise is the company
that's buying and bringing it inside the
firewall with hay for the software
yeah so if I nursing the questions
you're asked you're asking about the
subscription kind of so that's a lot oh
yeah so typically with the subscription
model is you get a so you'd pay for a
scripted subscription for the platform's
software itself and that platform would
afford access to all of the underlying
infrastructure that that that enterprise
and again we was the enterprise is just
sort of generic right but you know
anything that's accessing that private
cloud or that hybrid cloud so the
solution here in terms of delivering
more services to the enterprise customer
to the end-user customer is really
thinking about the platform on top of
the existing infrastructure as a service
or the existing virtualized environment
so you pay the subscription fee for the
platform and then all the developers
access the platform they have three you
know they click three times and they get
their entire staff deployed for the a
production is dead that's it we're
actually going to talk about that as a
great question so asking about runtime
and production is a great question this
is the only way to address that by the
way is with this solution inside the
firewall right as opposed to the outside
the firewall so now your start talking
about this interest really interesting
space where you start talking about that
the conversion from you know depth to
ops right in that conversion from
development into production and what we
can we'll touch on that as well as that
you hit the nail on the head that's a
really great question because no company
that I know of that would know infosec
group that I know of will ever let
somebody allow you allow you to run a
production app in somebody else's public
cloud and that just that just doesn't
happen if you have any sarbanes-oxley or
other requirements are being put upon
you so we'll certainly talk about that
that's a great question and if we don't
answer in the next couple slides will
definitely come back to it
so going going back to you know let's
look at all the advantages right we did
is just touched upon all of this so it's
a completely integrated application
stack that that your end developers or
you know whoever is your user for the
platform will get an entire stack all
they need to do is bring their
application files and then push it into
this into the platform extremely easy to
deploy completely integrated with your
development tools like eclipse if you
are developing in Eclipse its can
integrate it most of the platforms are
integrated with Eclipse environment and
then some will be integrated with your
continuous build environments if you are
using bamboo atlassian or some other
jenkins kinds of services it definitely
great for developers you know we've
heard like you know thirty percent of
developers developers time is actually
gone in setting up the infrastructure to
basically to do the development and
testing of their code that they are
developing time-to-market obviously you
can accelerate time-to-market in a very
big way because you're not you
eliminated the time that is involved to
set up the old infrastructure and manage
it and test it and all that so great
great solution for we believe it's it's
an ideal solution but there are
limitations like I said you know it's
very hard to build a platform which
which has this broad range of frameworks
and services that we use across the
different enterprise base so these are
limited usually in what you can do with
the platforms if those services are not
bundled not provided by the past
provider natively then there are usually
ways that you can plug in third-party
services say messaging service and
Mayman may not be available natively in
the platform but somebody else is
actually selling a messaging as a
service but typically there are plugins
there are ways that you can integrate
them but there are limitations and how
many services you can integrate how you
can integrate what s la's you get
from the third parties so those are some
of the challenges with the third party
mess integrations and what are the
biggest challenge is when when you have
this the downtime is basically decided
by the IT right or if the past provider
happens to be providing you as a service
then the downtime for that platform
basically brings down the entire set of
applications for you and the user
typically doesn't have control over when
that maintenance window for updates or
patching should be right so the past
provider typically decides when that
maintenance will happen based on their
convenience and it is getting back to
your question about production
environments you can see that's a that's
a non-starter right there right so then
not only if you're doing this if you're
using an external service again as
opposed to bringing this inside your own
firewall it's a complete non-starter so
not only do you potentially lose down
time of the productivity of your
developers if it's even if it's just
development but how in the world could
you put a you know a runtime production
app on somebody else's service when then
you're subject to their to their to know
they're down there but even the best you
know like the Salesforce regice as an
example right even they have to stay
scheduled downtime right and they you
know they do a good job of doing that
but you know so again you look at the
gold standard and you think about
somewhere you know lower on that totem
pole it would become really challenging
to put your actual application
infrastructure outside of your firewall
on some other pro you know some other
providers solution
and finally we believe like the biggest
limitation is actually what you can run
on that platform say you know platforms
are typically delivered as a service so
that means it's multi-tenant platform a
lot of users use it a lot of
applications are actually sharing the
entire application infrastructure
sharing the underlying hardware the
virtualized environment so typically
there would be limitations and what you
can do in your code in the applications
and what you cannot so this is this is
sort of a protection so that a rogue
application would not cause any harm to
rest of the applications which are
running on the same platform so for
example if you if you look at Google App
Engine a few if you write a google app
engine application you will realize that
there are lot of interfaces that you
typically use freely in Java but those
interfaces are blocked in Google App
Engine you cannot use some of those
interfaces just because they can be sort
of abused to you know to hog the
resources in a given platform so there
is always if you go to a public platform
you will always run into limitations
what you can and cannot do in your
application codes so those are referred
as blacklisted and whitelisted AP and
interfaces that you can use now to
overcome all of these challenges
especially the flexibility part what I
can write in my application code what
interfaces do I use what frameworks or
what language I want to develop my
applications in we believe there is
another better way to do this a better
way to bring or create a platform which
is very very unique very suitable for a
given workload type so this what what
this means is think about you take
entire application platform which is
take your frameworks take your databases
take caching messaging web gear anything
that you want typically use each of
those services is now modular and they
are delivered as a service by themselves
so one way to do platform is you know
entire integrated platform delivered as
a service multi-tenant platform but then
take out those and pair and make them as
individual services all by themselves
they can be independently managed they
can be independently controlled they can
independently be patched and updated and
upgraded so each of them services are on
their own now what you could do is
actually now orchestrate those services
in such a way that your application will
consume those services as and when they
need it right so that's a pretty
powerful concept like you take database
as a service you take caching as a
service you take load balancer as a
service now you can put together
everything that you want in your
application and now that's your platform
now that gave you an entire flexibility
to pick and choose the components that
are right for you and it doesn't cause
any downtime to your application unless
all of the services go down that you are
using then it's a different story but
that's concept is called as the modular
cloud services concept right so so there
will be you know easy orchestration of
services so there there could be an
orchestration dsl just like I was
mentioning about chef and puppet you
could write a DSL language to assemble
the components now you could actually
extend this and create a DSL language to
orchestrate your services and pull the
services together into a redundant
architecture that you want for your
particular application so you can build
an app build a stack for an application
which uses MongoDB and you can build a
separate stack for MySQL application or
something like that
right all these services typically we
believe are you know all individual
pieces individual services can be built
as a redundant solutions by themselves
they will have failover capabilities
they have self healing capabilities at
individual levels so if you're familiar
with Amazon anybody using any amazon
services any any of you guys so anybody
database as a service caching elastic
ash load balancer so amazon has these
you know concept of different services
that you can actually launch
independently and sort of put things
together although it requires a little
bit manual work but that's the concept
right they allow you to do that now we
are actually building those services
ourselves now what the concept is each
of those services will be self managed
by just like platform-as-a-service is
totally entirely managed for you each of
those services will be managed
seventy-five percent to eighty-five
percent of the tasks that are typically
required to manage a particular service
are automated so you don't have to worry
about in case of databases the backups
are automated you can easily restore
your database from point in time
recovery if it if you have to recover
caching is automated so every every of
those services will be automated and you
have knows no or very little maintenance
required for those and the good thing is
when you are using these services these
services are actually provisioned for
your appt only they are not shared with
different applications so when you are
using these services you can define what
is your maintenance window you can
define tell the service when you launch
a service you can actually tell the
service this is the time frame that I
prefer my maintenance should happen or
this is the time frame when my backups
should happen and if you want to the
system to upgrade your say MySQL or any
other app servers or anything to a new
version you can define whether you want
the system to actually upgrade those
versions for you or not
and if yes you can actually go down to
the level and say yes upgrade this to a
next version only at midnight my time
you know so it's pretty powerful concept
when you think of individual services
that can be controlled and managed
totally entirely by the by the end user
who knows what what the requirements are
and all these services will be exposed
as api's so if you want to integrate in
your scripts in your end scripts the
provisioning and deployment of
applications you could actually use the
API or command line tools to control the
lifecycle of those services when they
get started when they get stopped how
they are monitored etc and and good and
another thing that we really really care
about is optimization of individual
infrastructure services for performance
tuning every layer can be every layer of
the infrastructure can be optimized for
individual workloads you know for
read-only optimization or if your
workload is read heavy rights you can
optimize different parameters on
databases on app servers or caching or
anything that you are using basically
individually you have the capability in
these services to be able to optimize
your parameters and not only that you
can optimize them in real time without
shutting down the services so if you
suddenly realize that you're you know I
ops is not performing on the database
your read rights are not performing to
the to the level that you want and you
want to tweak a single parameter you
could actually go and tweak that
particular parameter in real time
without bringing the service down or
without bringing the database like MySQL
de so these are beautiful advantages we
believe this is this is the next
generation where it brings basically to
a level you know it allows you to build
a platform deliver the entire platform
to the customer to the end user and use
it yourself if your developers without
having the limitation
that typical platform-as-a-service would
have right it's it's you have the
flexibility you have the control you
define your maintenance windows you
manage them the way you want to manage
them so it gives you all the flexibility
all the power to do your manager entire
infrastructure minus all the
disadvantages that we just saw in
platform-as-a-service so we believe this
is the next generation of how we will
actually orchestrate our services in
real time and have a deploy our
workloads on different different kinds
of environments so cons obviously you
know one of the cons bc is just what we
saw in chef our puppet that you end up
writing a dsl code basically which
defines your services so that's that's a
very you know minor issue we believe but
then you can build very high you know
you are in charge of defining your
architectures in your applications yeah
i was gonna ask to your talking about
development and we're talking about i.t
right we're so we're talking about that
marriage show of hands how many people
are on tour on the developer side of the
business okay an IT side okay so we're
down okay we got both over there okay
good no just one I we didn't want to I
don't want to get the whole kind of
conversation lost too much on either
side of that but really what we're
talking about when you start talking
about this as a service is really that
crossroads it's really that that that
crossroads between where I tea and
development coming together and that's
you know we're right there today so this
is hopefully very germane to that
discussion if everybody cares about
thinking about delivering ID as a
service to do that development community
and where I tea and developers come
together so so let me just give you a
quick quick update on what we're working
on and how it kind of fits in and I
promise this is not a commercial at all
I just want to give you an idea about
what we're working on and kind of how
out we've we've thought about things so
for the last two years cumulus been
working on solving for this middle area
right so if you look at that yellow box
that's what we're solving for so we're
solving for this Kaz
between applications and infrastructure
so if you think about infrastructure you
know we talked about earlier we
mentioned private cloud but you could
you know a private cloud could be a
VMware vSphere environment it could be
an automated environment that includes
Citrix cloudstack or OpenStack or
eucalyptus it could be a hybrid maybe
you've got amazon i know i saw one
amazon hand over here maybe it you know
it could be Rackspace involved etc etc
so that's what the world is going I
don't think anyone's going to debate
that right the world is going to a
multi-vendor environment but how do you
connect those applications to that and
that's really what what what we've been
working on for the last two years so
thinking again about services I think
about Raj is in a discussion earlier
you've got platform as a service and
we've got that right we've got that
multi-language completely orchestrated
the entire stack but now think about
taking that modular approach so not now
you could receive if you're a developer
you could grab you could grab database
as a service in you know three clicks
right you log into the console and say I
need a fully managed Mongo database and
I needed to look like this click click
click done it's delivered for you
basically it's fully managed it's fully
backed up it's it's completely
orchestrated same thing for caching
right if you say hey I need you know
memcache and I need it now and I need
you know this I need to look like this I
need to assign it to here click click
click done right i mean it's really that
easy yeah question
ah yeah yeah really what we're seeing
I'm pretty bad really want to thank
today you have this infrastructure
that's providing that infrastructure
level that you need right servers
storage networking and you have these
applications need to tap in it right so
how you have you automate that entire
process how do you orchestrate that
entire process I determine this whole
thing right into three clicks of what a
developer named rights you need these
types of services to facilitate those
applications by this infrastructure how
do you do that the most efficient
orchestrated way possible and how do you
do that
a you don't have to take on sort of the
conglomerate if you will if you don't
have to take on the entire staff if you
don't once you can pick and choose what
pieces you need as a service to be
delivered to you and by the way to the
question earlier this all happens inside
the firewall right so this is all
designed to this platform that we've
been working on designed to sit on top
of this infrastructure that sits inside
your fire
yes yes yeah so the assumption is at a
minimum you at least have vmware in your
requirement or or xenserver
yes so the question is yes the question
is how do you how do you get it on your
on your virtual machine and I mean it's
really yeah we do we do it in that way
as well we recreate all all the
templates vm templates that's one way to
do it the other way to do it is we
maintain our software repositories so at
the time of provisioning we will
basically take our software and
provision it and not depend on the vm
templates
yes company so it's inside the firewall
whatever company has either it's a
VMware or any other environments that
they virtualized environment basically
no no because we give you the server
that you can that you can deploy in yo
ya know there's no holes in the firewall
so the whole idea is we're going to give
you the software the software runs on a
vm inside your firewall and it's access
by your developers inside the firewall
so developers access all of these
services right they come in and say i
want cash click click click done it's
all it's all completely provision and
provided for them that's all
orchestrated so did that answer ok yeah
yeah yeah I know so it's it's the
software running on a vm inside your
firewall and then they're accessing the
console that that that software provides
and the console is you know basically
literally think about it as you know
here's a console i login and i've got a
button for a full pass i've got a button
for database as a service i've got a
button for caching as a service i've got
a button for whatever it gets back to
the original which is sort of dot right
think about a d you can add additional
services to that console as time goes by
as your developers needed or as you know
the IT infrastructure matures it was a
question over here
yeah yeah great question great question
so the question was how do you know so
some of these services are going to
require more infrastructure and some are
going to require less right so that's a
great grass a great question so I'm just
going to walk over here again just shout
but what your wig I think auto scaling
right auto scaling being one of those
key features so thanks so the key
feature that you were discussing in
terms of the elasticity is the auto
scaling and that's going to be resident
as part of the core platform against any
of the individual services so all of
those individual services are any you
can tell by the diagram are stacked on
top of the core platform features so
think about you know auto scaling
self-healing of the application high
availability failover right the heart
you know sort of a heartbeat failover
monitoring securitymetrics usage metrics
all of those elements in that platform
features box our resident in each of the
services so there's an auto scaling
engine that is built into this entire
solution where you can set the
parameters to auto scale up or down
based on whatever whatever thresholds
you like to put in place and you can set
those against any of those individual
services did that answer the question
ya know the question was is if it is a
global or the propagating the answer is
it's prob location so you set that per
application because each application is
obviously going to have different
different kind of scaling requirements
and you can you can probably even said
it more more granularly than that right
yeah no absolutely you can do this
architecture is built for basically
doing individual dedicated load
balancers or dedicated services for each
application right yes it's very it's
very application-specific right and in
fact you know like if you see in
database as a service all right we have
multiple engines that we support we
support mysql and mongodb and then we be
adding support for couchbase actually so
one of your application could be using
mysql second application could be using
couchbase or third application might be
using monko so you have that flexibility
when you when you launch our provision
those services you have the capability
to define what what service you want or
what engine you want same thing in in
the load balancer right if you have a
production application that you want to
use this load balancer for you could use
netscaler right or if you want to just
test it open a core open source engine
x2 a load balancer is available so you
have a lot of choice and flexibility or
application and again the entire theme
here and everything we everything that
we've been working on for the last two
years is all about as is all about
empowering as a service it's all about
delivering more about more IT as a
service and this is just our particular
focal area we talked about all the
various kind of components that make up
you know the overall IT but this is our
focal area in terms of trying to help
help move down that road to everything
as a service so any other questions yeah
maybe I know far away yeah please no
we've got we got we got time
yep entirely pluggable so not only it's
it's all open API it's entirely
pluggable so you know again so thinking
about it this was designed from the
ground up to be inside the firewall so
it's completely open so if you have a
special messaging package or you have a
special identity management package or
you have something special that needs to
be that needs to be plugged in it's it's
it's completely pluggable yeah so it's
designed to be an entirely flexible if
you want to add different frameworks if
you need to add different elements it's
it's designed to be entirely flexible
and pluggable
yeah so it's every yeah its mid-to
multi-tenant right so it's it's you know
obviously multi-user so I think the
question was if somebody's if you have
an offshore team and an onshore team how
does that work the assumptions the
offshore team would have either somehow
access into the firewall so if once the
offshore team can get inside the network
then the out the offshore team is going
to have the same login capabilities as
the onshore team but it's a browser no
it's a browser-based so all they need to
just go to this server and then login
just like you login into any
multi-tenant app right you just log in
they get their individual console the
individual services they can provision
services on the what we refer to as the
target environment which is your VMware
or any other in virtualized environment
yeah so if you had miffed if you had
multiple clouds for instance or if the
you know if there was a team in india
and they had a specific target the Oh
VMware environment that they would use
they would just have credentials for
that so it's literally when they go in
you it's a drop-down menu that says okay
I want to deploy against this cloud
right whether it's a VMware vSphere
environment or whether it's some other
you can you can pick right pick and
choose we've we've done all the
integrations for all of these so it's
completely transparent so they is
whatever that particular user is
credentialed for is just a drop down
menu so if they're you know if in the
set up there were local environments
that needed to be addressed like local
visa environments for localized
development teams that's that's very
easy to facilitate yeah and it could be
there could be 10 of them listed for the
corporation but nine of them may be
greyed out for one particular group and
one group may have eight of them greyed
out so it's just a question of where you
know where those where the organization
would like to direct those developers to
go you know what cloud they want to
direct them to but is the same console
so theoretically it's the same look and
feel whether you have a developer in the
Philippines or in India or in San
Francisco or in Chicago it's the same
kind of look and feel and they would all
have the same experience through the
browser
any other questions alright so the road
ahead we know Roger you can kind of you
know figure it out right you kind of
figure out where we think this is going
you know we think that the modular
approach is the best approach to
empowering everything as a service we
think that's the right approach because
it's max maximizes flexibility it
minimizes risk and it you know allows
for lowest maintenance and the highest
productivity so we really believe in
this modular approach we believe that
the pass pass in and of itself is is
incredibly valuable and it's it's going
to be something that's going to be a big
part of what's the future is in general
in terms of adding services but that
modular approach is going to be critical
as opposed to having this sort of black
box approach we really believe in this
open pluggable modular approach in terms
of you know adding more IT services and
again getting back to the theme paving
that road so continue the conversation
so if you're know java you know james
james gosling if he looks familiar he's
sort of the father of java james is our
lead technical advisor on our advisory
board so James has been very very
involved in our evolution of our product
and in helping us with what we've done
over the last two years in building what
we showed you we are doing to be doing a
special event with James coming up soon
so if you'd like participate in that
it's going to be a live event it's
likely going to be a webcast event
because most people aren't local and
James is so if you feel free to come up
drop off your business card and we'll
include you on that on that event with
James and we've also have a LinkedIn
group that we've set up which is a
modular cloud so if you'd like to we'd
love to have you join the LinkedIn group
for for modular cloud as well so that's
all we have and if there any other
questions yeah yeah
now the ops team is still doing all the
ops yeah yes I Ops teams ops is highly
reduced in this automated environment so
that they're eliminating about 75% of
their tasks that they typically do first
but they still have two men maintain the
up right it basically creates much more
efficiency at the ops team so it gives
the ops team a whole bunch more time to
go off and take care of other pressing
needs that you know typically get
ignored right so there's never enough
right there's never enough ops resources
and you have questions thank you and
appreciate your time all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
