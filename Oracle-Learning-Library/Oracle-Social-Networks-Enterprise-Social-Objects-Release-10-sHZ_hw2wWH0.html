business application such as Oracle
sales cloud can be mapped to Oracle
social network with enterprise social
objects for example opportunities and
sales accounts with my CRM system are
mapped to Oracle social network as
opportunities and accounts I can open a
detailed view of an opportunity to view
record data any changes made will be
posted to the wall
in addition I can hold as well as
preserve a conversation about it adding
messages documents and references to
other Oracle social network objects
directly to the objects wall in addition
to accessing record data social objects
provide the ability to share the
opportunity in Oracle social network
when I click the social icon I will see
one of three things if the opportunity
has already been shared in Oracle social
network I will see the conversations
wall if the opportunity has not yet been
shared I will see a share button which
creates a corresponding wall in Oracle
social network I can add a set of
members that defines access to the
collaboration around the record as well
as create new related conversations
if the opportunity has been shared and I
have not been added as a member i will
see a joint button i can then opt in to
become a member of the opportunity wall
