Angelica Sarah and imma imma Java
evangelist at Oracle what we want to do
is this is going to be part 3 of
building your first javafx application
using NetBeans 7.1 so let's get it
started so far you've been able to have
been able to add components to your own
application we actually into this event
mouse event we use some binding we
associate the x-coordinate of the image
with the mouse movement so let's now in
this part we're going to focus on
animation and effects very simple but it
still give you an overview of the great
power of javafx so let's get it started
first of all what I want to do is I want
to bring into our our application a
second image so far we've been working
with this one with the blue sea now what
I want to introduce is a yellow sea okay
so we're going to be playing with these
two ones so pretty much to start with I
wanna just copy what we have 40 so we're
going to create a second image that is
going to hold the new see they are antsy
and it is going to be z1 we also have
the same clipping area for c1 because we
just is exactly the same situation long
image we don't want to see all of that
so we just copying and pasting this
information see one of course the image
that we want to display is c1 and then
we create a clipping area pretty much
the same size rounded corners we
associated we set that clipping area to
the new image that we created okay and
we added into your scene graph okay now
we know the down here we have some
events when the mouse get drugs so let's
copy and paste these also for see
one so the c1 also will move along with
the mouse movement okay with the mouse
tracking so c1 when mouse is press C 1
with this move and we do have defined in
functionality also for c1 so let's run
this and pretty much we have the same
thing we're going to see the image but
by default because we added the yellow
one the new image last in my secret is
going to be on top so what's happening
is the blue sea still there is just
underneath we won't be able to see so
what I want to do is I want to play with
the opacity I want to show and hide that
way we can see both images so when we
run the application what I want to do is
I want to hide this yellow image that is
on top we want to hide it so we're only
going to see the blue sea when we
started as the mouse move over the
application I want to show the yellow
sea when we get out when the mouse get
out of the application we're going to go
back to the blue one so we're going to
show your unhi see one let me close the
application let me go all the way to the
top where we create see one so we would
what we want to do is we want to set the
opacity of c1 to be 0 at the beginning
so we are not showing it we are adding
it to the scene graph but we're not
showing it now what we wanted to hear is
we're going to add some even hundreds so
when the mouse we're going to actually
define mouse enter and mouse exit when
the mouse entered we're going to show
the yellow image when the mouse exit
we're going to hide it okay so this also
see one we're gonna set on Mouse enter a
case when we mount when mouse enter
wanna have a new eventhandler okay that
is going to be a mouse event and for the
handle method what we want to do so I
want to take c1 and I actually want to
set the opacity to one so we want to
show it so when we enter we want to show
now when we exit or Mouse exit we have a
new eventhandler okay we want to hide it
again so when we exit we're gonna hi si1
ok so now let's see that what is going
to happen so we're going to see both
images as we define but it's not the
desired behavior because they are just
gonna either show it or hide it so
application is started fine we're
looking at the blue image that's fine
and when we enter we switch back to the
yellow one where we exit we actually see
again the blue one so yes it is working
but it's just changing rapidly from 0 to
1 the opacity is changing from 0 to 1
and 1 20 so what I want to do instead of
just changing it right now is I want to
take and what I want to change it but I
want to take a second to do so so we're
going to show a nice transition between
images so what we're going to do is
we're going to introduce animations in
javafx we have a fade anime a fade
transition a fade transition back object
will allow you to create a fade
animation that will last for the period
of time that you specify so let's create
animation using first is fade transition
so i'm going to create a new pay
transition
okay and it's called a phase transition
okay and down here after we create the
images we are going to instantiate it a
transition is going to be a new phase
transition and this is that definition
so we're going to specify the duration
how long we want this animation to last
and what which node is it going to be
affected by this very transaction so the
duration we want the duration to be in
seconds and we want to be one second so
it's going to take one second to do the
animation and it's going to affect see
one okay now for the fade transition we
need to specify where is the original
value the from value and we want to
specify the two value so the Fae will
work with those two values the fade
animation so they transition set firm
value so it's going to change from 0 to
serve a transition set to volume 2 12 is
going to change from 0 to 1 okay so
remember is an animation so we need to
be able to play with animation you can
either play forward or you can also play
pop or so we're going to use the same
transition first forward to show and
then backward to hide so with the mouse
enter case I'm going modify mouse enter
and mouse exit so now it's not going to
happen abruptly which is going to use
the animation so we gonna play the
animation okay how is it going to play
so the first time we want to play it um
so we want to play it forward so we
wanna
we want to set the weight to be one okay
and now when we hide it we copy things
we're gonna do is the rate is going to
be minus 1 okay so let's see now how
your animation work so we see the blue
one and as we enter we have a nice
animation for showing and we exit we
have a nice animation to hide it okay so
fade transition to create fade
animations very easy we're using the
rate and to play forward and to play it
back okay now what we want to do we want
to bring a shark into this application
so it's going to be a shark image and
let me just show it it's a PNG image and
this is the shark so we want to do again
we're going to create a new image feel
for it so we're going to have a private
English view and it's going to be short
okay down here when we create create a
new shark no image view is going to be
no image and it's going to be an input
stream is going to be more see
application we're gonna take the clothes
when I get string I resources stream
I'm just going to be anxious to actually
and is called shark the PNG file okay
now we want for the shark eyes a little
bit we want to make it a little a
smaller so we're going to use this scale
our property for it so we're gonna take
shark we're gonna set scale to be 0.8 so
it's just a tiny a little time smaller
than they predefined size they said scan
one also point eight now we want this
shark shark at is yellow so we wanna
also um behave as the yellow sea so what
I wanna do is I wanna set the properties
bind the opacity property of the shark
to the opacity property of c0z one so we
have the opacity property be bind to see
one also the opacity property okay
because we're going to be playing with
shark a little bit I'm gonna take this
chart and I'm going to refactor it and
I'm go and create a new method for it so
we five to a new method put this new
method I'm gonna call it set shark ok
just to organize a little bit decode
okay we have the shark here so we
created we scale it a smaller a little
bit and we bind the opacity to be the
same as they see one finally we need to
add it to my scene graph okay now if we
run it you should be able to see a shark
okay so nothing we show it so now we
have two new shark
that is actually behave us to see one
okay let's actually apply some effects
to the Sharks a list for example apply
some shadow to it so for that we're
going to use the effect drop shadow okay
so let me create dad driver drop shadow
and let's call a sharp shadow now if we
go down to the shark we're gonna take
sharp shadow we're going to create a new
drop shadow okay and we're going to use
this second constructor where we're
going to tell the x and y coordinate the
displays the offset of the shadow
related to the x and y coordinate of the
object and then the color for that
particular shadow so what I want to be
is I want to put it M 5.5 for the x 5.5
for the y coordinate anything for the
other one and the color is going to be
black okay then we want to actually
apply that effect to the shark so I want
to take the shark and I want to set the
effect to be the sharp shadow ok so we
associate that shadow to the shark that
we just created so let me play one more
time to see if the shadow is there um
there's a small part that I already
filled in and i'm going to show you
exactly what it is so as we get in we
have the shark and we have the shadow i
will get out the shadow also disappear
the effect that is this shadow is
associated with the shark
and you should be fading in and fading
out exactly as the shark and you can see
that it doesn't really do it properly as
I say it's a little bug that already
fill it with it with the team with the
FX team but you can say that it's
actually pretty nice how then the Sharks
are also associated with the last place
of the exercise is we want to and do
some effect when you click the shark you
want the shark to swim away so what
we're going to do is we're going to do
some translation in the x and y
coordinate and we of the sharks and we
also going to be scaling the sharks so
they look bigger it looks like they are
swimming towards you so let's do that so
let's create some properties that we
gonna use so we're going to move the
sharks in the x and y coordinate so we
need those two variables we need to
scale the sharks or need a third
variable and we need also em at the same
time that we move the shark we move we
need to move the shadow of the shark so
we need a fourth a property for that
because we're going to be doing binding
so as I move this property we're going
to update the X&amp;amp;Y property the scale
property and the shadow position we are
going to create some double properties
okay so in this case is going to be a
simple double property simple double
property the first one is going to be
the eggs offset is going to be simple
double property the value is going to be
zero so originally there is not offset
same second one is going to be the y
offset
simple double property again is going to
be zero simple double property this is
going to be the offset of the shadow and
in this case the shadow is 5.5 away from
the image and finally the scale value
and the scale originally this point
eight okay so we created the variables
that we needed let's go down to where we
create a shark okay so we're going to
bind some information so first we're
going to take the scale property of the
shark scale X property to be buying to
shark find the observable object is
going to be that scale okay then we do
the same thing for the Y property scale
why property is going to be fine to
scale then we take the X proper team
coordinate X property and lick on
appointed with them eggs offset that
we're going to be moving along and then
the right proper team also don't be
bonding in this case to the y offset
okay last we're going to be playing with
shadow ok so the shark shadow is
actually gonna be also
we're going to change the offset X
property to be bound to add offset okay
on the same thing for the white one said
why property is going to be going to ass
off okay now what we want to do now is
we want to change the value of the scale
X of Y of and s of those are the four
five values that we want to be changing
and the way we're going to doing it is
through animation so animations are
going to be created using a timeline the
timeline will provide the capability of
updating our property values over the
time so we're going to specify how these
values are going to change over time and
the way we specify that is using
keyframes ok so let's first create a
timeline ok
timeline is going to be short swing away
okay
and in the sharp would we create a shark
where you're actually going to have way
okay and then let me show you exactly
what I'm going to do and just copy and
paste some code that I have so there is
a bunch of error let me fix that will
fix input yes I'm going to take their
animations from FX so what we're doing
is again you do animation through a
timeline and you're going to say how the
values are going to change over time and
the way to do so is through the key
frame so we have two keyframes the first
keyframe is going to happen in time zero
where we set up the values of the S of
scale X of and why off so this will be
the original values and the second key
frame is going to happen five seconds
later and we'll tell where they offset
the scale and eggs on y coordinate and
of this chart is going to be okay now
you do have the animation you do have to
play the animation when is the animation
going to happen well the animation is
going to happen with you click the
sharks so we're going back to the shark
and we're going to set on mouse click OK
we create a new event handler for this
and in the method what we want to do is
um we're gonna take on the shark swim
away animation and we want to play it
okay so once you click it this this fish
art will swing away one last trick is
the size of the screen so i want to make
the scene way bigger so the shark can
actually swim along the holes
green so I'm going to put it 1300 by
let's say a thousand wasn't really mad I
just want to make it bigger so it
actually swim away there's one little
thing um that we're still missing what
happened please if you pay attention the
shark was placed on top of c1 let's go
down to see one of the events associated
with c1 c1 we have mouths press and drag
the doesn't really affect we have a
mouse enter on your mouse exit what
happen is the sharks are on top of c1 so
whenever you try to put the mouse over
the shark to click on it we're gonna
trigger this to affect when we enter to
chart the own Mouse exit is going to be
treated because you're actually leaving
this step to see one image you're
entering into the shark that is on top
so he will receive the event this is
totally normal but this is not the
behavior that we want we do not want us
fired mouse enter and mouse exit unless
I really quit that area meaning i do not
want to fire these two events enter and
exit if what i did was when that i went
over the shark that is actually still
part of the c1 so i'm going to put a
small if condition2 at this um app to
these events here so i need to check if
I really leave if the mouse really left
the application area no just mouse over
the shark so let me create a vulin at
the top okay that is actually going to
hold if we really exit or not
by default it is true when the
application started we are outside that
area we're outside it on the screen okay
now we only wanna play let me go back to
see one mouse enter so I only going to
trigger it up oh I only gonna do the
transition if I really exit so if I'm
really out and i'm entering i do wanna
play this animation so if exit I really
exit then play this okay so i was really
outside the application then you do a
little bit of formatting here okay and
then of course if I really enter I'm not
outside anymore panting okay just make
sure when we said that and now if I exit
what I want to check if I really if I'm
really outside the coordinates the area
the whole area of c1 some and we want to
do if another if condition in this case
we're going to try we want to check for
c1 the clipping area okay and we want to
know if this area contains the values
associated with the mouse okay so we're
going to create a point to D that
actually have the mouse information
mouse x coordinates so we're going to
get the same x and gets in fight so what
it says is if the area for c1
doesn't contain this if it does contain
it means that you are on the shark you
haven't left the window if it doesn't
contain that you're outside the window
we do want to perform this okay so if I
really quit the application twister this
let me just format a little bit the if
condition and again you want to make
sure that yes you left so this is true
okay so let's try to run then the
application one more time and hopefully
everything is working okay we do have
Danny made the application when I enter
with to see the shark with I exit the
shark is there when I enter on a step
over the shock I do not see the mouse
enter and mouse exit for c1 and if I
click the sharks will swing away okay so
with that I conclude your first
application of how to your first session
your first collection of videos of how
to create your first javafx application
again a little bit of everything a
little bit of animation effects binding
functionality components again this is
Angela etc and I hope you enjoy this set
of tutorial thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
