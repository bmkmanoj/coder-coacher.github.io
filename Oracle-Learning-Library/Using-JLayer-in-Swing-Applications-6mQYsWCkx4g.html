decorator for Swing components content
is based on the J layer page in the Java
tutorial you'll get the most out of this
video if you already know how to create
a user interface using swing J layer is
new in Java SE 7 you can use J layer to
change how components are drawn and how
they respond to events I'll show you
some examples this one draws a
transparent gradient on top of a panel
component notice that J layer can draw
in its children which is not normally
the case where a swing component here is
something more practical an animated
weight indicator this next one shows how
you can respond to events it draws a
spotlight at the current mouse location
finally here's an example with J layers
that decorate individual text fields
they show a red X if the field cannot be
validated J layer is only half of the
story the other half is layer UI layer
UI
does most of the work of drawing and
responding to events while J layer just
serves to bind together the layer UI in
the component to understand how to use J
layer let's start by looking at how you
would add a panel to a frame first
create the jframe
next create a panel with some components
finally add the panel to the frame piece
of cake now how is the code different if
we're going to use a J layer to decorate
the panel first create a layer UI that's
going to control how the J layer is
drawn and how it responds to events now
create a J layer with both the panel
component and layer UI subclass notice
how we use generics to make sure the
types match the last thing is adding the
J layer to the frame instead of adding
the panel to make this work of course
you have to define a layer UI subclass
and make it do something interesting
let's look at how that works next layer
UI draws the J layer and response to
events you can customize behavior by
overriding methods the simplest thing
you can do is override the paint method
this is wallpaper layer UI a simple
layer UI subclass which paints a
gradient on top of a component the first
thing it does is paint the component as
it would normally appear by invoking the
superclass that's here after that
wallpaper layer UI does some custom
painting it's set to partially
transparent composite which you can see
here then fills the entire area of
component
with a color gradient notice how we
first make a copy of the graphics
context then get rid of it when we're
done this is to make sure we don't mess
up anyone elses painting by changing the
graphics context we were given this is
how it looks when it's running
everything works as usual it just looks
a little funky I hope you enjoyed this
introduction to J layer for more
information take a look at the java
tutorial where you can get the source
code for the wall paper example as well
as other examples that you saw at the
beginning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
