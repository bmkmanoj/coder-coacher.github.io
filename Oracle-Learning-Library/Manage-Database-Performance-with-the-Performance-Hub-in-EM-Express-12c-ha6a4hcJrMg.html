is Maria Billings I work for Oracle
server technologies curriculum this
video provides a high-level overview
over performance hub M Express includes
the performance AB which is a new
unified interface for all your
performance monitoring tasks so you have
a single view of your database
performance but access to the automated
database diagnostic monitor or EDDM to
secure tuning information to real-time
sequel monitoring and the active session
history or e is each analytics in other
environments DVDs have to navigate
through multiple pages to see the same
information to navigate to the
performance app from the database
homepage click performance and
performance hub on top of this page you
see a flexible time picker that allows
you to seamlessly switch between
real-time and historical view of the
database performance you can change the
characteristics of the slide the
real-time view by default shows you the
last hour and for this last hour on the
summary page you see the host runnable
processes you can move the cursor over
the legend to see the details for
example how much background CPU was used
how much the fog around you process is
used to CPU here you see the memory host
total if you click on show host memory
you see some of the details here like
the shared pool large pool etc below
there are active session information and
i/o information you can click on each of
these tapped pages to view more detailed
information next let's look at the rack
page here you see first the global cache
information global cache blocks received
and then the blocks get time and below
it you see instance details we have two
instances if you click on a link you
will see the performance
instance for only that particular
instance with a broader back button I
returned to this page and now look at
the activity this page allows you to
drill down to the active session history
by using multiple dimension if you want
to know which modules are using the most
resources you can go top dimensions
modules and here you see the modules by
moving the cursor again over the legend
I see the highlighted areas if I click
on one of them it acts as a filter and
you see on this detailed page only
information pertaining to that
particular module so I see the module
activity and then the sequel within that
module so here you see the sequel
details I will go back by the way on
this activity page you can also change
for example the graphs below here so if
I look at top dimensions wait wait
events you see how the graph changed
next let's look at the workload depth
paid selected by the time picker you can
look at the user calls past calls reduce
eyes and open cursors if you are already
in the detailed part of analysis and
know a sequel ID you could enter it over
here and then filter by it or you can
click directly on a sequel link again
this leads you to the sequence details
page next we look at the monitored
sequel page which shows you the
currently running in monitored SiC I'm
moving the slider back to look at some
more interesting statements and whenever
statement interests you you can click
the ID link and here you see an active
statement again with the general
overview time and weight statistics are
your statistics you see the planet
statistics the plan itself in a
graphical format you see the
parallelization the activity and the
metrics the addm or automatic database
diagnostic monitor findings of this
database are based on the last EWR hours
so if there are any findings it shows
to you here the current findings shows
you what goes on in the present moment
at this point in time in your database
here you see there were no findings
there are other videos that go into
details so I will not go further into
EDDM here let's change the time period
for example to week the historical view
is very similar to the real time view
except that it is based on the EWR data
and it has three more tabbed pages here
you see the database time by weight
class weight events and time then you
can see the resources or system
statistics are your statistics again of
course you can move your cursor over the
legend and see the details highlighted
and there are also system statistics
database calls are displayed here but
you could change it to any of these
there is an almost endless amount of
possibilities of information but you can
see system statistics and more system
statistics physical writes reads that
said well so this was the high-level
overview of performance up in AM Express
12c thanks for watching this
