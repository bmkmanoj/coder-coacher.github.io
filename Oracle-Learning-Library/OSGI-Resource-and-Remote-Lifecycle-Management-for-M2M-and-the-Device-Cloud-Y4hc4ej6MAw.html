developer talk so maybe that's why I'll
make a few people show up though we talk
about a solution um and okay it's
animated I need it so we will talk about
how to manage OSGi solutions in the
field and how to create an a manageable
upgradeable device basically and
colleague partner a mr. hot from process
so he will do most of the talk but I
have so honored to do the introduction
so um I will set okay
safe harbor statement sorry I will set
the framing basically so why does it
come to play what is it I'm working on
and then mr. hot will talk about the
technology itself the features and then
we will have a demo if it works
hopefully short from demo about what it
does and we have a few conclusions so
then a lot of things I'm sure you have
seen a lot of tsukino than other slide
so there's a lot of framing so I will
give you a very concrete definition
where this fits in so the java
technology is very wide and and I will
more give you a framing where this
specific solution fits in so this you
have seen so we're talking about it's a
big um Internet of Things the cloud of
embedded devices whatever you call it
and the basic strategy is to push
intelligence downstream to the edge as
far as possible to migrate an easier
adoption of m2m in the market basically
that's the main goal and at the same
time and that has nothing to do what
already does this is just happening in
the market people understand that they
can't continue to use the classical
approach to m2m which has been highly
verticalized and it's usually like this
every company may
we took a so is one of your few partners
does everything himself and if you
really want to scale within the company
or with your solutions or outside of
classical m2m companies you have to come
up with a horizontal approach and you
have to kind of make more use of
reusable components to propagate this
out to the customers out to the field so
that as again if this has nothing to do
what we do but it's connected somehow so
we believe we have a strong play in
helping supply which anyhow is happening
so the biggest picture the highest
picture I think from the advantage a
Java based solution has four cc's that
in a real m2m you have many complex
points so it starts with a device that
can be dumb or a bit smart or very smart
then usually you have a gateway you have
a middleware that basically is the m2m
middleware so it's not the classic limit
the way it's the middleware it manage
them to em stuff and then of course you
have your back-end system where you
finally make your money from so and to
have a continuous platform that allows
you not only to push push data and
connectivity that can be done without
Java but with Java you have the chance
to push down logic down to certain edge
so you can decide whether you want to do
all your preparation and work here or
here or here or here and at the end you
might want to decide to put there and
there and there and there a bit if it's
Java you can reuse the code and you can
push it and later decide where you want
to deploy it and of course there might
be different devices so one of the
examples one of the caster's I work with
is large car manufacturer in Germany and
here is of course different classes of
cars yeah
cars which start with $30,000 up to
something like 340 thousand four hundred
thousand dollars so of course the IT in
his car is different the high-end cars
have much more performance and power so
he white wanna do much more logic in the
car itself to give more comfort to give
more functionality while on the cheap I
mean I know ladies thousands maybe not
cheap but on the relatively cheap he
might just want to collect and you know
gives to comfort back to the cloud and
and let make everything happens there
so with this model he can actually reuse
the coat because he can decide later
where to put the coat and where it runs
on if you use a horizontal platform like
Java that's a major idea behind it so
for this specific topic if you also want
to allow client application you can do
this um what we I call the game changer
was a face change so you go from a very
vertical eyes optimized solution you go
over to what is a service platform and
that's actually a shift which happened
in PCs around the 80s when dos came up
suddenly people wouldn't have CPM and
other stuffs they would have a standard
operating system and right against it
and then again it happened around the
90s when Java EE showed up so people
woman went from enterprise applications
which were usually written in their own
language or in C++ or whatever it was
targeted for their own stuff and then
Java EE showed up it wasn't the most
pretty solution of the most fastest but
it had the wonderful advantage that it
did run on many different devices it had
a few features that everybody needed and
it allowed developers to actually think
about developing business logic and not
application logic this is the same thing
which I strongly belief will happen in
the whole embedded market and especially
in m2m
and there are some areas like this
Javanese Chi I in this smart gateway
automation devices where this is already
happening so this is relative far in the
curve of adapter adoption so this is
then what a what a smart device a real
smart device would like not compared to
a smart meter which is really dump this
is a real smart device you put in a java
application layer and OSGi container
that basically allows you to deploy
applications remove some and management
and that will be the second talk part
and then you have the message queue our
web services also data's and that
actually is a connectivity layer so you
need as well a connectivity layer and
then the developer can actually totally
focus on this and he doesn't really need
to care about this anymore
and what I've seen from customer
projects is actually in this part 80% of
the work is done and only 20% here and
that is not really helpful if you want
to be fast to market and you want to
address a create many use cases so
okay thanks very much okay first of all
welcome to the show and I'm sorry
there's only so few participants but
because I think I got really something
exciting to tell and something yeah so a
lot of people will miss it anyway I hope
there they'll look it up later on I'd
like to introduce my company to you
first of all so that you know who we are
talking to we are a company German
company that has been around since 1997
and since 1999 we focus really sort of
on something like like the search of the
holy grail of it which would be
basically the reference standard based
open reference architecture for the
entire m2m space and when we started off
with this fairly ambitious goal people
were telling you a crazy today I think
we are nearer to this point and then
ever before and we are right now
my company's got 120 employees most of
them are technicians I am and two of my
colleagues are the only guys doing
marketing and sales because usually
people know us and they they have a
certain need for open neutral service
platforms and the other products which
are going to introduce to you and we
work very closely with Oracle code
that's obviously all our technology is
it's Java based and I
yeah that's busy also what I'm going to
talk about first of all I think an open
reference platform should always be as
brutally standardised or following
standards as possible my company has
been very active in the OSGi and we've
been the first I don't know who knows
the O's GIS
I think it's well known right who
doesn't know the OSGi
raise your hands know that sorry do you
know the who knows the OSGi okay so then
I will brief the Aussie is basically an
alliance of fabric companies I think we
are the only ones who are on board level
and have less than 30 or 40,000 employ
the goal is to really define a standard
service platform for originally for the
smart home that's why it's called OSGi
it was called open service gateway
initiative but right now this technology
is also used in a lot of different
vertical markets like you know to motive
and so on
another standardization body which is
very important for the smart home is the
HCI the telcos are really afraid that
similar thing happens to them and in the
home market that happened to him do them
in the smart phone market where they are
right now just a bit PI when other
people are doing the business and there
are many other standardization bodies
but I don't want to bore you it was too
much too many details here the overall
principle here and that's kind of what
not everybody has understood so far
instead and the entire m2m world it's
it's all about apps yeah all those use
cases in the end are apps and what we
what we have now realized and there has
been a steep learning curve from the
smart home market is that it really
works if you have an open platform you
give out SDKs and you tap the creativity
of hundreds hundred thousands of
developers because I mean in today's
world hardware is not so important
anymore it's just you know how to manage
the apps outside the smartphone world so
how do you manage them in cars in smart
homes in a health environments smart
grid and you name it and all they really
need is the right infrastructure so they
they need a certain platform where they
are hosted where they are find their
home yeah and obviously this has to be
found on the in the local area network
like a smart home or a car then it has
to have the right back-end
infrastructure and that's actually the
focus of my topic of my talk today and
that you have to have an SDK which you
give out developers so that they can
easily start developing applications
without worrying too much about generic
features like security or manageability
and so on
and that's actually what we do
and I just would like to really go talk
a little bit out about the project we
have a name and maybe that's not the
best name it's called NPRM and it's
called remote remote yeah
what is the actual remote that's called
NPRM have managed its first management
platform yes before I really go to this
piece which is on the right-hand side I
give you a picture more concrete picture
out of the the smart home world what we
typically have in a smart home is first
of all obviously a gateway if you see
this picture of the Gateway in the
middle this is a gateway that it comes
from to me two more and it has been used
by Deutsche Telekom for their project
which is going to be launched early next
year so this gateway on the graphic here
you see is a pop-up of the operating
system you you have a Java Virtual
Machine in this case it comes from
Oracle you have the so called OSGi
platform which comes from processed my
company and on top of it you've got all
these apps the connectivity is very
important in this case obviously to the
end users that they can you know what
see and manage their control the
applications from anything from their
mobile device from from their tablet
from the TV from the PC so there's a
connection there and that's part of the
infrastructure and on the left hand side
you could imagine a lot of devices
you've got in the home so you know the
washing will see in actors switches
thermostats whatever you you have
cameras the picture was too small to
show some of them but what's really
important is that all these different
devices in today's world are connected
by various wireless and viateur
standards and that's the first problem
and when you talk about connectivity in
about smart home I would say 80 to 90
percent of the people focus on this
issue and this issue has already been
solved we've together with
the companies have developed kind of an
abstraction layer which allows you to
add new protocols so it doesn't mean
whether you have wireless protocols like
is that that ZigBee or that wave or you
got you know why add protocols like KNX
that's a sort of a powerline standard
and more importantly this thing is
scalable so if you have a proprietary
protocol or if a new protocol is coming
up like right now we've got an ocean I
don't know whether you heard about it
another wireless tenet which I think
it's very good so that's the
connectivity on that side and basically
what you've got in your home and on the
on the right hand side it's basically
the entire back end management system
and now after having showed you this
concrete example and again this could
also be work for a car or for some other
environment I'd like to show a more
technical picture here which again shows
you what's on both sides I mean on the
service gateway you have what I was just
talking about I don't want to talk about
too much more about it it's basically
based on this Java Virtual Machine and
the OSGi framework the functionality I
just described and on the right hand
side we now have the backend system and
the backend system that's sort of the
first news is actually the first
enterprise system that has been really
based on OS GI itself because you know
SGI company formerly we had our own j2ee
application server which we have sold to
as AP back in 2002 fund what we've got
now you have you see what what's part of
that back-end and obviously CI gateway
management the software repository the
App Store and you see more below you see
the the end-user who's got access to the
app store via
again various devices typically a
smartphone or PC and on the right-hand
side you see the admin administrator who
can manage the functionality of the
backend now
the backend system system itself is very
modular consists mainly out of those
components so apart from these NPM users
have cut their the system and you've got
back-end service support system j2e
application server payment billing as
you can see that's all staff we
obviously don't do ourselves as would be
too much and that's where we are very
happy to have cut Oracle because they
allow us to really offer or we offer
this together real scalable and
efficient back-end infrastructure to our
customers the main sort of the main
slides are kind of an overview on what
this remote device management can really
do it can is really there as a
management monetary system supporting
remote device maintenance software
provisioning and service operation
support for all sorts of network
connected devices and also supporting a
lot of various standards also for the
connectivity what if in a nutshell can
really do is can use a centralized
device configuration management software
management and provisioning an automatic
software compatibility and dependency
resolving it can monitor their I know
all the status and performance of the
devices in the field you can remotely
diagnose problems you can troubleshoot
problems and yeah you can control
obviously the applications that are
installed on the Gateway again this is a
glimpse at the other packages the whole
system is build up and as you would
expect from an OS GI system in a very
modular way so not all companies need
all of the packages but this again in
over you viewer and
I will not just just just read this to
you as you know this presentation would
also be available to you on the website
but let me just look a little bit closer
to of the various features the
management operations is obviously yeah
the reason here is to to manage the
software deployment so you can really
group the devices in various groups and
you can filter them and you can really
manage the way you want to execute an
update for example and that's very
important because as long as you have a
few hundred devices in the field that's
fairly easy to manage this but if you
really got millions of devices in the
field you really want to be more precise
and more efficient in updating them and
you might you choose any criteria you
can say I now want to update any devices
that have the JVM version 2.0 and you
could say I just want to update
everybody who lives in Ohio
I don't you say I want to update anyway
you can if you can you can group them
and you can do this as you want what's
also very important in the real world is
that if you do the installation and you
can do the installation anytime not all
the devices might be online yeah so a
car might be in the tunnel or somebody's
switched off his device which is more
unlikely but you really can can follow
and track the progress and and the
outcome of the installation and you know
there's a persistent queuing so really
make sure that the installation works in
a secure way by the way I forgot to say
this we've got really many companies who
are really relying on that software so I
on this picture I showed earlier with
Deutsche Telekom they are working with
our remote management system and many
others as well the software repository
obviously also very important to day two
to managed centrally the the database
and to do everything that basically
keeps keeps us efficient so part of it
also to many
the dependencies - yeah I mean I can
read all the points to you but I think
you can imagine that this is a giant
task if you have millions of customers
and they are using using everybody's
using 20 different applications with a
lot of bundles but this is something
that we are able to manage also things
of - Oracle we just now - well kind of a
benchmarking in the Scottish laps of
Oracle and I don't know how many devices
because I kind of will be simulating
their twenty-fifths right and out so the
target is 20 gateways exactly so I I
think that's a lot of message because
this is not not the future this is
something that can be done and it can be
done in a very secure way the user
management obviously very important as
well you can obviously have to manage
the way the the companies log in to
either side end users log into the their
gateways and so and the whole user
management and group information and
basic profiles of the users are you know
and what kind of devices they've got and
so on easily controllable by by this
feature other features are things like
security which as we all know is very
important especially in the smart home
there's a lot of discussion about how
secure is this really and so there are
very generic very good features and and
they can obviously be always extended
right now with Deutsche Telekom we we
have a lot of work on us on the security
but there telecom is also happy that
they are able to use what we've already
got off the shelf yeah the other thing
which is I think a really big advantage
is that this remote management system is
very modular and can be itself very
easily be integrated in other back-end
systems that are already there
and so I think these are solar than the
main feature that I've it's obviously a
lot of my own time invite you to go on
our website and have a look there's a
very extensive documentation on what
this product is really able to do I
think at this point it really is kind of
an enterprise thing and I would very
much invite Reiner
to talk about the last couple of slides
while I try to prepare the demo thank
you yeah so um so from a technology
perspective um M PRM is basically a
java-based application that can run on a
standard java vm or can be run
concurrently with a Java EE application
if you want itself it's OSGi based so
it's extremely modular so you can
actually run it parts on different
machines and you can also extend it
easily so if you you see here I'm Troy
with the laser pointer okay so here you
see the different arm modules and all of
them can be run separately of course I
mean it needs to store content so it
needs a separate machine which runs the
database and then it has a Java a
connected architecture or Java ME ME s
based connectivity to the enterprise
world that's what you would expect so
it's a very typical Java back-end
application so in a small deployment on
a small deployment your laptop would
really suffice for this you need roughly
one gigabyte of RAM you would use maybe
MySQL database for a store and you just
deploy it and then you have everything
on one machine and you can just log in
and as an administrator on use
start to manage your you know maybe
hundred devices um and that's actually
what you see with small management and
as as mr. hot already told you we're at
the moment it's exa laps so you know
Java guys I think so you might not heard
about the X illogic that's a huge
machine Oracle sells it contains
Java EE application layer and also
database integrated and it's it comes in
small means um I don't know sixty CPUs
or some things that's a small package
and then it scales up to I don't know
254 or whatever and man you get this
kind of architecture so um you would
build a typical enterprise large scale
earth detector where you put different
components on different parts and of
course you would have your database
cluster basically usually separated and
then um also you would have service
gateways so you would you would separate
the communication to your client also
two separate things
so originally before I did you know the
client Java stuff I came from enterprise
sites as a Java EE side and that's a
typical web service architecture and it
scales identically how you would scale
it Java EE you put web services on the
client as a proxy or Gateway then you
have your Java EE visa enterprise
applications and then you have your
database world and it's really scalable
so what Oracle and processed you
together at the moment that the X
elapsed is really to prove to don't you
kill telecom as a customer that we can
really unbelieva manage twenty million
devices or gateways so each gateway in
itself in this test will have up to a
hundred Tama devices connected well
that's really a huge architecture you're
building up of course the devices like
to
I am elated are you at the moment you
don't find 20 million devices I would
say so you have another cluster which
temp emulates the client traffic and
what we do is basically we take that
those two I client virtualize it and
then let it run and reconnect create
many of times and then you try this to
deploy applications update them in a
field and so it's not only a normal
scale test it's really a user test
so now after C splint preliminaries
comes the real part that's the demo so
it's not are we yeah thanks very much
can everybody hear me yeah I mean the
demo is basically really the whole
scenario we were just demonstrator to
just show in the demonstration and let
me first of all show you what what kind
of devices we've got some service
provider and
and so if he if he gets in there he
basically gets cut this webpage here so
that means he's got first of all to lock
himself in that's something I've already
done then he has sort of various option
you can see sort of here you can go into
the app store and can see these are all
the applications laid in the market some
of them he has to pay money for for kind
of surveillance services alarm services
then you know the idea is here that the
service provider once he bought this he
subscribed to the service he got some
some services for free and then he's
full of kids gets a voucher code in here
then basically when he's choosing wallet
let's let me explain first of all what
kind of devices we've got here we've got
which you see this it's a gateway and
this has two USB sticks that's for
ZigBee and for that wave internet
connection virus connection then he has
here two switches Vicky if you can for
example attach - yeah - two lamps to it
and then this year is as thermostat
which is that way connected which you
can also buy anywhere anyway make sure
don't forget anything
I also have I have kind of a little
PowerPoint here so I can more systematic
submit systematically get you get your
tool - all the demos demo features I
think what I've already said is I get I
got all the hardware the service gateway
registration is something I've already
done as well this is being done in
registering with this is a certain code
so now we are locked in and we can start
using the functionality now
we would say we try to connect these
devices so let's let's say we've we've
got these devices from our service
provider and now it's okay the next step
is to to pair those devices to connect
these devices to the central gateway and
this is being done in taking this code
this is the voucher code and put it in
in here in the in the vault of outer
space and I'm trying to just copy this
it makes it easier
so here we are and we enter this the
coat the coat is accepted and now we can
start with the process of of pairing so
we go now to the home application portal
which is basically here the service
gateway and by the way the whole thing
is a little bit slow about the server
for this demo it's located in Germany so
all this goes off to Germany and then
and back now we have now the musical's
goes to the home application portal and
opens now the ZigBee settings make sure
it's already the first problem that
chickpeas that in the settings should
now be there if the whole thing has been
connected let me just check
oh sorry I just forgot now to go my to
my applications and I then have to
install the application of this
professor on the Gateway before that's
but difficult before I before I continue
so the application is now one of those -
one of those two free applications I was
showing before it's now the basic
Ziegfeld light control which is this one
here and I go now here on the install
button says I do every one install it I
say yes
now this nobody ZigBee is working and
the next thing is of history that I have
to pair the devices
okay how do I do this I go back to my
service gateway and now finally yeah
here are the ZigBee settings I just put
it and now I can start the pairing
process and let's go and actually for
the end user who knows the system even
less than I do and there's also a help
desk here and so he would say to your
customer
what so it tells me what I have to do
first please press the start pairing
button this will put your service gate
into pairing mode then go to your device
and press the corresponding button on it
the device would appear in your browser
repeat the last step should be stopped
pairing so we know what we've got to do
now we push the pairing button and we've
got to go to the devices
I was green you see this ends up already
okay well I I know everything is working
and I can see these names also here on
my whatever it is this time is my PC
could also be my mobile phone and I can
also then put them put so often on
uh-huh that is typical for a demo they
do it the other way
so we could do this again and if you
stop to carry for first and now let me
remove the devices
you know I think
I will do that I will do the following
to try to go back to the
what this work this time otherwise I
now it doesn't look so good
okay one more time never give up
doesn't want to do this
one more time
okay so keep your fingers crossed
otherwise I saw your thermostat so
so one is remotely get them aha
so you see it okay so you can switch
them on and off and now what we can do
the next step would be we've done all
this this picture is correct and I could
now also how much time do we have
it could also connect the server start
but maybe we just leave it because if we
skip the thermostat because that's the
principle is the same you go and you
have to do the z-wave site settings
because you know the lens are now
connected we are ZigBee the server that
would be that wave so you have to do the
settings you have to pair those devices
and then the service that will would
appear and this would look basically
like this one so you have the Sun start
which you to pair it and then you have
the thermostat which you can there you
can control the temperature and if you
obviously get the temperature up or down
here it's paired with CSM instead or if
you manipulated the temperature on the
other stuff it's obviously I'm showing
up here now the next thing we could do
is having a look at you know our
apartment so I have a little apartment
here which looks like this and you can
now set images for every room because
you can have also do insert pictures and
yeah and then place your device in the
room so that you exactly know where
those devices are
this is done I think
no that's what we've done
a little bit slower Wyatt because
because of this server normally you
should have you know here you should
should should have the you can again
here you can create certain rooms yeah
you couldn't say basically kitchen
create this room then you can have now
various pictures attached to to the room
let's say I accept here this this
picture for my kitchen and now what is
this would be again my my kid my kitchen
looks like this no got to be taken the
configurator
so here we are again now you got there's
a kitchen but I should have a different
picture now
so it should be the room configurator
okay what I what I could do let's
imagine I just feel a little bit puzzled
that this is not showing up now I go to
the
so now I can congrat this this room into
their into this time into it and the
corresponding room like like this one
and I can now extend it so that it that
it sits in here and once I've done this
I can go into the room
that's really the slow internet connect
now actually the picture of the room
should appear let's let's say I just add
the devices first of all to the room I
add the two switches we've got now let's
say you can also edit this because
otherwise gets confusing you can also
just call it switch 1 &amp;amp; 2 let's not just
edit so I have the first switch in the
kitchen I can let's say add the second
switch in the kitchen and now I'm sorry
that this is not working but you can
imagine that you now have a kitchen
picture in the background and you think
and then place those switches wherever
you want to place them let's say you
know you don't really track you drop it
here's the second one that's good so you
can maybe see I have one for the ceiling
light you know I have one just you know
when I when I get into the door
and you could put you also add you could
say this is a door you know and this is
switch switch ceiling and then you can
just place it and then you can you know
basically go in there and you can say I
want to switch it again on and off
slow but it can has to go to Europe and
back ok so this is we skip now the
thermostat demo but I think you would
you get the idea then there's also a
another app you can basically go to back
to the to the app store and you can say
now I just found a nice app and this app
is code it's called one up one more one
power off you just go there try to find
it where is it
we helps me yeah
so the anymore home alarm
do you see it China no today is not my
day we removed it
wait is it hey have you seen it
this one this one right okay yeah that's
the one
okay so I installed it okay so now I
it's it's obviously installed I go back
to my service gateway
so now I have my my applications here
and I basically go to this application
here
so I have to have to go to this tree hmm
takes a while
we got nine minutes left so now this is
basically the hole and actually we
should have more picture on the right
hand side we can put it off and on I bet
I think it's basically this right so I
go on this and if I push the button
obviously all the power is off okay you
can can imagine that basically we have a
similar application for the yeah for the
for the Sam start where basically can
control myself stat and you know control
the temperature from wherever I am so
this is actually what what what could be
shown as well and since the thermostat
is not on yet I just have to show you
this little picture once you have the
service turn on you can also download a
scheduler done force is the name of the
manufacturer of this thermostat that you
can very easily control to any heating
that you have new rooms so you here you
have four time zones and you can
basically just say you know what kind of
temperature you would like to have on
what what time of the day I think that's
a quite a useful tool and that's also
something you can do that so I mean this
just us a few applications but I think
it shows you the basic principle what's
what's really happening and it's very
similar you will agree to what we find
with Apple and Google we just go to an
app store you have a lot of applications
and this is really you can really tap
the creativity of a lot of people who
know those applications because but I
found that as many service providers
especially telcos they they don't really
know how to do applications they're not
in the market yeah so this this way
company specialized on a health or on
you know energy control or on security
can just have the best app offer it on
the on the app store and the people can
buy it from there
and we are finally out of this thing
where you need one box for every service
so this is a nutshell the the outcome
and I don't have any more slides yeah I
have I've just a summary flight so I
want to emphasize of course this is a
very simple demo but it gives you the
idea that you can transform a solution
or vertical problem oriented focus into
more a platform focus why you sango like
i mean i've great many customers
somebody to heating controls but i will
approach them with this solution and
basically tell them until now you're an
expert in heating control so this
thing's on the wall where you you know
make lights and thing with this approach
you can basically generate one platform
for all the problems or you go to
somebody who has you know I don't know
steam management I have a customer the
steam management for large factories so
every motor is tuned differently and we
see sip create a platform and then they
can deploy so this can be an open
platform like in home automation but it
can also be a semi closed platform like
an industry control and the difference
is that after you have set
infrastructure you don't approach it in
a wiser cess so that's my problem how do
I build it up how do I do this how do it
it's like okay this is my infrastructure
I already have and then how do I create
an application and of course the final
application will be much more complex
than what we shown but it gives you the
basic idea and actually if you have this
infrastructure in place your development
time for the projects they will shrink
dramatically now that's what I call the
8020 switch so UK from 80% setting up
your your your infrastructure and 20%
business logic you go to 20% setting up
your infrastructure to 80% business
logic that means you're faster to market
and actually your applications or your
infrastructure will have much higher
value so you're competing better because
either you're faster or if you guys fast
as the other guy your solution will be
just much more complex and the more
attractive to the customer so
that's about it I think we are in time
and I think we have if you want a few
questions yes
yes so this the biggest project we have
at the moment is torture Telecom and in
this case actually the first prototype
is based on an ARM processor however
they don't actually care about this
because the developer never sees it the
devil else is only Java so they will in
if they go in the next step of Sarah FQ
a typical thing you know tell code to do
the to a prototype I mean a prototype of
60,000 boxes and then they will K go in
the large-scale deployment and they will
you know basically do an ask you to
hardware vendors and then not I mean
I've had customers same thing with nip
space PowerPC x86 whatever you you you
want so it's not dependent on the
hardware really and it leverages this
and so the applications don't you
telecom has at the moment they are
around 400 so they have around 400
applications so process has like I think
10 for demo purpose but you know you can
download the GDK from process there's a
naval license and actually create your
own solution very fast it's very simple
so
now we are not a service provider
yes yes so there they are starting now
so they announced it maybe I can add to
that I mean they are just just two of
those projects on the market right now
that one is Deutsche Telekom the second
one is AT&amp;amp;T they they go together with
Cisco but again this technology is
pretty pretty new and I can only tell
you that that we are right now talking
to at least two thousands of other
people we're doing demos for them we
they are there they have Spanish
telefÃ³nica and a few others have
already issued our cues for for this
kind of infrastructure so this is really
making as I said before ch GI at the
home gateway initiative where all the
major telcos are organized and has
specified this as a new standard
reference architecture so we asked
process I would I would say in our work
with again maybe at least two thousand
more people interested a couple of RFI
on top of it but was also important this
is really in the whole ecosystem this is
not just a service provider if you go to
the deities ship and and the people who
do it sort of smart home or tel Ematic
hardware they have discovered that they
rather show their hardware was visits
kind of service platform on top of it
then just showing it without it because
this kind of service this kind of
hardware that just provides connectivity
so far becomes an intelligent service
service gateway so here we have a lot of
projects also in telematics space you
know there is the top-notch car from
Audi right now is using this platform
because that's an energy management
especially that's that's one of the
features because it's a it's a electric
car
but they are really I can you know write
me a mail and I'll give you all the
details but they also device
manufacturers and we got at least 30
device manufacturers that use our
software to connect the devices like for
example Miller German
yeah developer of white goods many
people who do home automation like ABB
you know they have a company in Germany
called Bush Hager and Eaton - name one
here and Claire :
Claire controls and a few others alert
me and you name it they obviously go
away from their proprietary hops in the
car in the home and work whispers noise
GIS because it's more scalable and that
I think it's also the main trick here
that it's scalable and remotely
manageable and that I think is is the
best this is the greatest benefit
because over telecourse also found out
that once they launch their product in
the market people ask for new
applications and and it's very very
difficult with some proprietary
architectures to provide that
scalability or very expensive
okay any more questions okay thank you
very much for sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
