demonstration my name is Maria Billings
I work for Oracle server technologies
curriculum in this demo I'll show you
how to create a password encrypted
arming backup the slide shows you my
setup but that doesn't mean that your
setup has to be the same it's just my
test environment so what's the use case
for Arman's password encryption you
could use it for example if you need to
securely transport a backup to a remote
location and then you call the DBA at
that location and provide them with a
password to enable this functionality
you need to use the command shown in the
slide set encryption your so you must
provide a password then you create the
backup and of course the same password
must be provided when you restore the
backup logged in to enterprise manager
cloud control 12c navigate to scheduled
backup if needed
select named credentials and log in on
the scheduled backup page click tables
pieces ensure that you have host
credentials and then click scheduled
customized backup select your test
tablespace this options page is
interesting it shows that I will take a
full backup with archive lock and now at
the bottom of the screen with the
encryption section expanded I selected
to use Recovery Manager encryption I
will not use a wallet but use the
password encryption so I selected this I
enter a password make sure that you
remember the password because without it
your backup will not be recoverable I
click Next since I wanted to have the
backup stored on disk I don't change
anything here I click Next in schedule
for immediately click next again and
here at the bottom you can see the
script that Armen generates as you see
it does not disclose your password that
is being hidden for security reasons
so now I submit the job once it's
submitted you can view the progress if
the auto refresh is of you can use this
icon to refresh the screen success so in
this demo we showed you one of the three
encryption modes that are main supports
and that is how to create a password
encrypted backup
there is another series of demos that
shows you transparent data encryption
thanks for watching this demonstration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
