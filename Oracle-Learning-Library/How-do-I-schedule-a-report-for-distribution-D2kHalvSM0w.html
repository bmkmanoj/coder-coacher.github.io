the priority for the agent for this demo
we will use normal which is the default
and is appropriate for most instances
next specify how the analysis is to be
generated the default is to generate the
analysis with data specific to the
current user but for this demo we will
select recipient which generates the
analysis with data specific to the
recipient next click the schedule tab in
the frequency box select how often the
analysis is to be generated for this
demo we will set it to weekly to run on
Monday and to start on July 29th at 7
a.m.
next click the condition tab specify
whether the agent always delivers the
analysis or conditionally delivers the
analysis for this demo we will use the
default condition next click the
delivery content tab enter a subject in

example when sending an email to a
recipient for this demo we will enter a
weekly opportunity sale stage detail
report next click the recipients tab
then specify who's to receive the
analysis click the add recipient button
the select user dialog is displayed for
this demo we want to add Lisa Jones who
is a sales representative first we will
search for her from the users list
then we select her name in the accounts
list click the move button to move it to
the selected members list then click OK
her name is added to the distribution
list next click the destinations tab
specify where the analysis is to be
delivered for this demo we will use the
defaults so that the analysis is
delivered to the recipients dashboard
and to the devices specified in the
recipients delivery profile finally
click the Save button to save the agent
by selecting the folder in which to save
it and specifying the agent name for
this demo we will save it in the my

the name click OK the agent will now run
at the next scheduled interval I'm Donna
