to trace parallel executions there are
different ways to get detailed
information about how sequel statement
executed and we are going to review some
of them the first of them is with sequel
plus and that's why we have a sequel
session opened here with the explained
plain line command that I could run
right now which will help you to have
the execution plan of this create table
as select followed by the select from
the display table which will display the
detail explained plan so of course it's
nice to have this kind of information
under this non graphical tool but it
will be easier if you can view it
through the graphical tool under
Enterprise Manager so let's go end
Enterprise Manager in the monitored
sequel executions in the sequel
monitoring and retrieve the detailed
plan from this create table that we just
run at the moment so let's expand this
execution so that we can get the same
kind of information of course but under
graphical aspect which is much easier to
detail afterwards let's go to the
parallel tab
and as we had a top of two we have two
Korean slaves performing the statement
another mean to trace if the last create
table as select was paralyzed is to view
through the viola PQ says start panel
query session statistics and through
this view you see if the GDL paralyzed
the last one was paralyzed or not and
how many of these DDL paralyzed happen
during your session here five and you
get of course the similar information
through again Enterprise Manager within
the sequel monitoring here you see that
the last GDL was executed with the top
of eight hour
create table and if I expand again this
execution I can see here that the
statement was paralyzed with one slave
set as we said and how many queries
servers in the single slave set we see
that they were eight query servers
allocated to do the work this other
example of video nappy consistent shows
you that as you can see the service
threat is set to 16 whereas the
allocation head is 8 so this means that
the table was eight but two slave sets
were necessary to complete the request
which was this request create table as
select with a group by which required
two slices to perform the
parallelization we can also use the
keyword based event px trace to get more
detailed information so let's set it in
our session and now launch our create
table as select with a table of
requested for and let's see where the
trace files are going to be generated
the traces are going to be generated in
the Jack mystic decks test directory so
let's get into this directory and let's
see which trace files have been
generated you see here that there is one
trace fight for the query coordinator
and as many traces as Chris service so
let's get into the twice part of the
query coordinator and see which kind of
information we get so it says that it
was getting one slave set of four
threads so as we required add up of four
it allocated us the four query servers
and the pre-record inator
was first trying to get the first query
slave on the first instance and he got
it and then he was trying to get the
second one and he got it and then he was
trying to get the third one he got it
and then he was trying to get the fourth
one and got it
if I now compare this type of
information that I see here where the
load as select is being executed by a
query server of the slave set with
another similar type create table a
silly
we will see the difference let's go to
another create table a select button on
this on a smaller table this one which
had a dot of four which was then
paralyzed and the create table was also
see TAS but let's see what's the detail
execution plan here you see here that
the load s select is performed by the
query coordinator not by one of the
query slaves the query slaves are only
here to retrieve the information from
the table the customers table so
depending on the volume that the create
table is as select has to perform either
both operations that select and the
creation while the load are being
paralyzed or only one of the operations
is paralyzed between these different
ways of tracing Enterprise Manager
sequel monitor is the easiest one to
quickly diagnose what happened but for
deeper diagnosing fix trace event is the
best one because each trace provides
detailed information of operations
performed by each query server
now last thing to see is that when you
have several paralyzed statements it
might be difficult to find the
appropriate trace files tension
generated for each of them
so for that purpose we are going to set
a trace file identifier different in
each of each session in the first one we
will set my sets one trace fight
identifier and in the second one my sis
to trace file identifier and let's
execute the queries
let's go to the diagnostic test
directory where the trace files are
located and we can see here the list of
my sets one trace file for the query
coordinator and my sis one trace files
for the parallel query servers and the
same for the session two this ends the
demonstration and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
