server pools and an overview of the
create server pools wizard and Oracle
Enterprise Manager off center
a server pool is a group of one or more
virtualization hosts of the same kind
one or more guests reside on each
virtualization host these virtualization
hosts shared the storage and network
resources allocated to the server pool
in a server pool you can move guests
among virtualization hosts you can use
this feature for load balancing and
server maintenance without disrupting
the service all server pools require a
network domain a storage library and at
least one virtualization host there are
extra prerequisites depending on the
virtualization technology let's quickly
review some information about the three
common requirements for server pools and
off-centre the virtualization hosts
officer people must use the same
virtualization technology in the same
architecture ops center supports Oracle
Solaris owns an Oracle VM server for
SPARC as a virtualization technology for
virtualization hosts
a net word domain can be defined as a
network container and it must have at
least one network a server pool is
associated with a network domain and a
virtualization hosts in the server pool
are associated with the same set of
networks Suresh libraries
store the metadata of the virtualization
hosts and guests and also provides
storage for virtual disks let's continue
with an overview of the create server
pools wizard and nops enter an OP Center
you can create and configure a new
server pool to manage your
virtualization hosts and guests we
review an example for creating a server
pool using Oracle Solaris zones the
steps in the wizard vary based on the
virtualization technology so let's get
started the first step of the wizard
requires us to provide a name and define
the virtualization technology for the
server pool we can select among Oracle
Solaris zones for SPARC in Oracle VM
server for SPARC for the virtualization
technology click Next to continue
now we need to select the virtualization
host members of the server pool which in
this example our global zones the wizard
lists the eligible members for the type
of server pool we are creating you must
select at least one virtualization host
but to take full advantage of load
balancing in high availability select at
least two virtualization hosts click
Next now we select the network domain to
associate with the server pool I'm
selecting the default network domain for
this example click next click the add
Network button above the associate
Networks table to attach a network to
all the global zones of the server pool
click Next if a selected network is not
already connected to a virtualization
host you need to configure the
connection by choosing the network
interface the IP address allocation
method and eventually the IP address
click Next now we select the storage
libraries that we want to associate with
a server pool the available storage
types differ according to the
virtualization technology App Center
provides two main types of storage file
system storage such as network attached
storage libraries an Oracle VM service
storage repository and block storage
that supports storage area network
protocols like fibre channel a nice cozy
click Next lastly the wizard request us
to specify policies for the server pool
each server pool has a placement in an
outer balancing policies the placement
policy determines which virtualization
hosts in the pool is the preferred
destination for new guests
the auto balancing policy determines how
often the load is balanced in the server
pool and the approval criteria you can
schedule when inhale often the load is
balanced additionally you can enable
automatic recovery of zones logical
domains and guests this feature provides
the option to recover the guests that
are attached to a failed server the
recover guests are restarted in other
servers in the server Hall
click Next we now review the information
and click finish to generate the job
that creates the server pool when the
jobs completed we see the new server
pool in its members in the server pools
list we can modify the server pool to
add or change network and storage
resources and members as needed
this concludes this overview for more
information consult the OP Center's
library go to Doc's oracle.com look for
enterprise management and select the
Enterprise Manager ops center version
