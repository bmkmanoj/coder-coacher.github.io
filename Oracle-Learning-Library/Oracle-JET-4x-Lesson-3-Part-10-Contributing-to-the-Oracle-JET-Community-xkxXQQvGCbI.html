the course on our project if you have
made it this far in the course
objet we want to congratulate you thank
you for participating in the course for
doing your homework exercises for
tweeting for helping others in the forum
thank you for participating and we hope
that you have learned and that you have
enjoyed learning about jet in the course
on jet we spent the first lesson
exploring the environment beneath jet
and the problems that jet tries to solve
we examined requirejs unlock our joyous
and by the end of the first week you
were creating your own jet applications
in the second week you started really
exploring the jet cookbook and using it
in your own application there are not
very many jet components that you
haven't touched and looked at or become
aware of during the second lesson in the
jet course in the final lesson which we
are now wrapping up you explored the
world outside jet in particular you were
introduced to the composite component
architecture and you also explored a
range of Oracle cloud services that
provide back-end data as well as
management and monitoring services for
jet applications to you in addition we
looked at internationalization
accessibility security and the other
typical enterprise concerns that you are
likely to face when you're creating
larger enterprise applications in
JavaScript we now like to spend a bit of
time talking about different ways in
which you can contribute to the jet
community firstly you have learned quite
a bit over the past weeks about jet
about the reasons for jet and about how
these applications are constructed about
jet components and about the solutions
around that it would be really nice if
you would help the jet community while
following the forum and jumping in and
giving advice and insights where you
know that you have answers secondly
please do blog and tweet about your
experiences with jet if you learn
something new if you publish an
application to one of the app stores
please let us know please tweet about it
please blow
please share knowledge that you have
gained about jet and ash on knowledge
grows please share that knowledge with
others to be aware that there is also
the success stories tab on the Oracle
jet home page where your organization
can promote the web and mobile
applications that have been created by
means of jet what you can also do is you
can provide your own teams as explained
in the theme in chapter of the jet
developer guide and your own composite
components finally congratulations again

on jet three weeks of 10 parts with 10
YouTube clips and a lot of homework
