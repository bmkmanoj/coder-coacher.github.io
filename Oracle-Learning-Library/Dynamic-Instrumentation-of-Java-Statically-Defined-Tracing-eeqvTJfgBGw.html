the group called ice v engineering it
oracle previously at Sun Microsystems
you might have heard of this company I'm
working with software makers to try make
their software run better on oracle
solaris based hardware platforms doing
this i'm in country in with my a
developer's i'm a jointly working from
time to time problems mainly performance
project i'm working mainly on
performance project with Isis and other
project problems that we need to
troubleshoot there are many good tools
around especially for java very good
profilers some of them come with the
built-in in the twister jdk very good
debuggers and very good other tools to
troubleshoot most of the types of the
problems still there are some transient
problems how to reproduce which usually
those kind of problem though there are
the minority stay with us for days weeks
and even more when we encounters this
such type of problems we usually wish we
had a capability to ask questions about
what's going on in our execution
environment questions that are not
necessarily derived from what the tools
the standard tools are offering us we
want to ask arbitrary questions and also
get answers so the session today will be
on such capabilities will try to use a
few technologies together in order to
try as much as we can to get the
ultimate a answer for this or the
ultimate capability for answering any
arbitrary question on what's going on
with our execution and
vironment so we'll talk about de tres de
tres is a technology which was born in
solaris solaris 10 and is making its way
into other operating systems we'll talk
about this a bit we'll talk about Java
statically defined probes which lets
DTrace a invade better into Java and let
us a fire event from whatever point we
want inside our Java code it will talk
about few awesome java technologies the
java instrumentation and java touch api
which enable us to turn anything into a
dynamic in our case inject code
monitoring code into our application
will talk about the ASM bytecode
manipulation package will need to deal a
little bit with byte code in order to
inject code with SM we can do this
bytecode manipulation byte code
injection even without noticing we are
really make our L hence dirty and with
in my opinion at least with some fun so
we'll achieve dynamic instrumentation of
Java statically defined probes with
these technologies we'll also talk about
mention at Oracle dtrace with touches
all the mentioned technologies so add we
have a lot to talk about today what's
the trace how many of you used it race
in the past good how many of you heard
about dtrace before coming to out that's
good that's good okay so these are the
only questions with dtrace cannot answer
that's why I'm asking you so de tres I
think it's probably the most
comprehensive monitoring to
I don't think there is another tool that
can do as much as dtrace can do it's a
dynamic instrumentation framework with
which can monitor both user application
and the operating system part of the
execution it's good for both testing and
production environment because it's safe
and has minimal impact on performance
again the power of D trace is the
capability to answer arbitrary question
a that we want to ask dtrace as i said
is a solaris tool it made its way into
make OS i have currently a problem in my
iphone it does not decide on my mode
does not work here dtrace will be on
iphone in the future it's on Mac OS not
currently on iOS unfortunately so what
else and what else I'll speak today
mainly on when I speak about
specifically on dtrace it will be
solaris jazzed it is currently solaris i
believe it will soon get to other a
operating system if not remember you
have the VirtualBox technology which
enable you to run everything installed
VirtualBox on Windows Linux or whatever
and run solaris inside dtrace has no way
over an impact not no performance impact
if you don't activate the probes if you
don't do actual monitoring it's
completely safe and it has powerful data
management which will take a glance in a
minute in dtrace we usually monitor
applications with a d'être script
although they might dtrace has an api
and we might use
consumers written by ourselves in C or
Java most of the time we use the deal
and which d'etre scripts d language is
actually list of events that app might
happen during execution of our
application or anything in our execution
environment list of events that we want
we are interested in in monitoring and
when a predicate that says where do we
want to monitor them and actions what to
do in when such event are fired the
command line the one-liner that can be
run from the command line is written
below if we are more complex d'etre
script we will write a script and we'll
write it with the same DTrace utility so
I've actually just for slides on de
três before will go on to maybe more
interesting stuff I personally think de
tres languages is very interesting and
very very powerful too so a probe is
they described with this fourth provider
model function and named provider is a
logical group of probes of points of
execution in our execution environment
models is a subcategory functions it's
not written here it's the place the
function in the code where the event is
fired a name is just the name of the
probes of the probe example for
providers i will give just to cisco
which contains all the system calls in
our operating system and hotspot
provider is from java 6 on solaris the
JVM is pre instrumented with many events
with many probes that we can use in a de
tree script
predicates and actions we use predicates
we don't have control statement in de
tres because of performance
consideration so predicates might
replace the functionality required so a
predicates are just conditions simple or
a complex conditions we have a lot of
predefined variables in de tres which we
can use in both in predicates and
inactions they're getting their values
dynamically according to the context of
the code send the event so it for
example we have an exact name process ID
the CPU number we're getting the event
from a timestamp you can take time
stamping point a and point B and they
will be correlated you can easily
calculate the time passed between the
two events with arguments for each
probes we can pass relevant data from
where the event is happening to the
script they are all for the pre they
prepare the predefined probes they are
all well documented will see afterwards
how can we add our own providers and our
own probes to our code and define our
own argument which data which
information we like to a pass to the
d'etre script to the monitoring utility
so the powerful data management of the
trace I talked about before is actually
a degra gatien's when we are monitoring
a
application or anything we usually want
to aggregate values to measure to count
how many times an event happens or to
calculate the time passed from point A
to point B and to summarize this indie
trace we have the probably the most
optimized way to achieve that and if you
use d'etre script with aggregation
you'll see that though you are
aggregating and calculated large amount
of data it is very very efficient and
you hardly see any in any performance
impact so aggregation take the syntax of
fish strudel aggregation name and key
it's actually for whom and who know that
term associative array it's an
associative array in Java 8 hashmap so
it's a name and keys one or more a
comma-separated keys and in aggregation
functions which is count counting there
how many times we visited this event
summary to summarize some something
average min max quantized and l1 times
are two functions that help us to
calculate distributions of a something
like a reed size or something like this
and a de tres will output a simple
asking graph that will make it easier
for us to look at a bit some kind of
ASCII visualization the top example
there just count every read in our
system every read system called actually
every read from a disk oriented device
or from the network and it counts it /
executable the second example counts the
same every read network or a disk but it
counts it by exact name and arg0 for
every siskel system call arg 0 is the
all the arguments are the system called
arguments so arg0 in all the read system
calls is the file descriptor so we are
currently we here just sorting it count
how many times a reed was a cold by
exact name and a file descriptor very a
powerful in analyzing read problems so
i'm going to give you with passed the
Dietrich's but where if you don't
understand it completely don't worry it
will be more clear later and if not
you're very welcome to a session
tomorrow morning from 10 to 12 angelo my
colleague will be running a d'etre
sandal engine lab tomorrow morning very
recommended him that's a use example i
worked with one of my eyes vs on a
performance tuning they had typical java
ee multi-tier application running
application server and database on other
machine I was concentrating on the
application server trying to get more
throughput and we got to a time when we
add load but we were not able to
increase the throughput we were not able
also to increase the cpu utilization in
modern computational environment modern
servers you might know that there are
multi cpus multicores multi threads on
each score here we ran on a computer on
a server with 502 n 12 hardware is CPUs
a hardware thread a and we didn't get
even to fifty percent utilization
profilers for example are very good in
troubleshooting troubleshooting or
monitoring what happens when the our
threads are on the cpu i call it on cpu
profilers there are less good in
profiler in profiling of cpu or why
aren't we succeeding in
utilizing more CPU we want to handle
more transaction per second but we want
we don't succeed to utilize more cpus so
here is an example of question that we
want to ask and the question will be any
idea sorry I didn't give you time for
the thing too much we are in a hurry so
the question is what are our threads
waiting to we were expecting our thread
to mark to work out well how do we have
pull of threads and they should be busy
all the time they have plenty of CPU the
disk there was not saturated the network
was not saturated the memory was not
saturated there was no reason
theoretically for them to wait so what
white do they are waiting so in order to
analyze that we have a sked provider
sked came from scheduler a the operating
system scheduler give us to a events two
probes of cpu and off see in on cpu
every time any thread leaves the cpu we
get an off cpu probe fired every time
any threads gets back or gets on a cpu
we get an unsecured event now if we our
thread leaves the cpu we can record the
time when it left the cpu when it comes
back and we use here to m1 variables is
the self arrow TS timestamp self and
arrow means shred local variable so for
each thread that left the cpu we we can
we keep the timestamp when it left the
cpu and when it comes back to the cpu
and we use here at predicate that
confirm that this thread we recorded its
time the time it left the cpu when it
comes back what we are trying to
calculate here
anyone has an idea excuse me yes we are
summing up the latency how much time it
enjoys of the CPU outside of the CPU but
we record here we we record this latency
/ execution stack so we are we have few
keys here the important are stuck and J
stuck stuck is the system execution
stack the operating system execution
stack and J stock is the user execution
stack theoretically including the Java
execution stack so per execution stack
will know what is the latency you know
when we come back to the CPU it's
usually we have the same execution stack
the same as on the time we left the CPU
so what we get from this a long list of
things like that at the top there is the
system stack and here it's the user
stack that's the native our code which
is invoked from our Java code the Java
stuck is not very readable unfortunately
that's because they're heavy in lining
the people are doing in optimizing
the Java code in just-in-time compiler
and it can be worked out and manipulated
by them but for us it means currently
nothing and there is no way for us to
retrieve the right stock will try to
compensate on it afterwards with the J
sdt but we can't long list of such a
user of such stacks with a the latency
here measured in nanoseconds fortunately
though we don't have a readable Java
stock we have here and in most of the
stocks the native stocks we give which
gives us good hint of what they actually
the code is currently
so after 10 or 15 minutes of post a
processing of the data I get to this
graph describing the day latency I
aggregated post aggregated in addition
to what DTrace does and i got to to this
graph telling us telling me that the
most of the time we are waiting on
socket read and one more sure d'etre
script with another question I told me
that we are waiting for a queries for
answer from the database machine so that
was easier script than the a latency one
so you see that for this we in very
short time get answers for something
that was otherwise a very hard to to
troubleshoot to analyze continue quickly
to M the hot spot a provider before we
start with Java statically defined
probes there is as I said before from
Java 6 and up there is an hotspot
provider the JVM on solaris Esprit is
instrumented with this events that you
may might use in in a dettori script
again you might use these events along
in conjunction with other a operating
system or other a probes like the
scheduler probes so where they are the
thread control the thread events the
class loading GC a method compilations
and they're more interested in
interesting a probes of application
tracing require a special flag to the
JVM extended dtrace probes that's
because they are still making a too much
of performance impact is something that
made them makes them unusable for
performance troubleshooting and for some
kinds of other troubleshooting they are
very very
helpful in trying to for example build a
call graph of the application to try
understand what our application is doing
in certain areas but they are not very
good it again performance that's why
they are sort of protected by this
special flag again we'll try to
compensate on this with the J sdt
technology so jess DT is available a on
solaris from Java 7 what's jazz DT age
esta t is a de tres technology it did
solaris technology solaris dtrace plus a
java on solaris technology which enable
us a fire probes fire DTrace event from
whenever we want in our java code is so
this is an example of a probe that is a
fire this is a d'être script that read
that is handling events that we are
firing from our java code let's look how
do we do this so we can define our own
provider or providers there is no
limitation on the number of providers we
define and for each provider we define
any number of methods or probe names
that we want so the interface name here
that extends com Sun tracing provider
will be the provider name and the method
inside will be the a provider's a method
a provider probes so I defined here for
this example 3 a probe start and end
some milestone we say which has two
arguments we can pass int or string a
parameters only at this time but I think
there are still very powerful and we can
actually a parson
now right our data i miss the world into
the string if we want to pass structures
data or whatever once we have this
interface defined we all we need to do
is just somewhere in our code before
we're starting to fire the probes
instantiate our provider with a provider
factory and there we are ready to start
using the probes as here in the method
and pass to it arguments that according
to what methods we defined and in order
to use the probes we as i showed before
we just use them this is the provider we
all meet here as many times the model
and the function we have just provider
and probe names and we are ready to use
it as any other dtrace probes that this
is very good but in order to do this
just one comment before i moving all the
probes that we are translating in our
code has zero impact as all de três a
probes when not activated so no you
should not be afraid to add a probes
permanently to your code but still this
is static and our wish is to do it
dynamically without static changes of
the code and sometimes a we don't know
what questions will want to X 22 to ask
on runtime and which kind of probes and
where to locate them so we we are
looking for a way to do it dynamically
this will be a bit harder than using a
you know a tool that you just use it out
of the books so we'll go over a the Java
API in Java instrumentation technologies
how many of you use Java instrumentation
before
good okay but I'll go I I'll go quickly
about how to do this eh i think it's say
something that worth knowing for every
java developer a very nice technology
technologies that differentiate a java
as a virtual machine language from
native languages so you can go back
afterwards after this session to your
C++ colleagues and yeah you're better
you have a better environment so we'll
talk a bit about Java a touch API which
is the technology that enables you to
connect to other JVM in order for us to
instrument to add the JS dt probes
definition a java instrumentation a
technology java technology which enable
us to inject the code to transform
actually classes and inject our J's DT a
code into the running program running
application we'll talk a bit about ASM
in technology sm package it's an
external package that a very is very
efficient and very friendly in doing
bytecode manipulation will use ASM in
order to transform our bytecodes very
very easily or we can use be trace which
actually is implemented in using all
this technology java instrumentation a
touch api and ASM and it's already
integrated with dtrace so--but race as
you can see is named after betrays its
trying to get everything dtrace brought
to solaris he tries to bring it to the a
Java environment a not only on solaris
also on every platform that a sun's jdk
is running on a it's very powerful in
byte code
M instrumentation and it's very powerful
it gives a lot of very useful utilities
for a inspect your code other than a
calling DTrace and an feira de tres
probes from your call so it worth anyway
visiting to know more about if you are
not familiar so in bit race we write our
code not in dis crypts or any a new
language we write it in on Java code
instead of a probe description a rewrite
here a annotation of when we want to
invoke to define a de probe the event
here for example it's an on method by
default its own method entry we can also
do it on return if we add an attribute
here or if we have line number
information inside our classes so we can
also make it in in line resolution so
here we decide to instrument a specific
class and to add disco that will be
called a in every entry of of this
method we can retrieve the arguments of
this method and pass to 22 de tres or
print them or whatever it has the D
trace probe utility within wit with
which you can a fire de tres event d
trace of a predefined atriz event which
which betrays a defined a predefined for
us so as I said it in betrays include
rich set hundreds of methods in its
betrays utils library worth looking at
it it's currently being rewritten it's
on Prairie list of betrays too so you
might wait for a day release or start
playing with the sort of beta of betrays
Tuesday
some changes their betrays utils are now
called their betrays extensions but you
can manage to cope with this I wrote an
article and publish it on how to use bit
race in order to in cooperation with Jay
sdt since deter a bit race was rewritten
since then I don't know how much is
useful if you are going to use and a new
bit race and I think you should still
you have in betrays to the capability to
to invoke betray scripts and if you want
to use a pre well-prepared tool and not
do the things by your own though you're
losing some capabilities you can still
use be trace and and take advantage of
dtrace too so the rest of the
presentation the session will be on how
to do the injection of the Jays dt
probes a two-hour java code without
using a d'etre so you earn also some a
knowledge of java api and java
instrumentation java touch api is very
easy very straightforward to use in
order to attach to a target JVM we just
need to know its process ID and use the
virtual machine class in order to attach
to this JVM we need to have the same
user in order to have permission the
permission to attach this a process on
runtime m we later on see how we prepare
again very easy to prepare an agent that
will be loaded on the target JVM with
this where we are going to call the load
agent and call the agent we provide the
path to hear so agent is packaged the
agent that will prepared is a will
package it in a jar file and it will
contain all the transformation that need
to be done in order
to inject our jsd t-code general
instrumentation after we know how to
attach to a target jvm now we need to
know how to write the agent that will be
loaded so agent is just a java class
that it doesn't need actually to
implement anything it just need to thank
two methods to to define the pre main
and the agent Maine pre main is usually
for a agents that are statically that
are loaded with the info with the
startup of the JVM our more important
function is is the agent Maine which is
called when we a load agent attached and
low a load the agent from another from
the client a process in our agent Maine
we need to do a two things to use the
instrumentation instance that we get a
reference to in our agent main method we
need to end a transformer a class
transformer to to this to call this
method our agent class will be used as a
transformer in this example because I
imply it implements the class file
transformer we can use a helper class
for this I chose here to just implement
it in in the agent class what does it
mean to implement a class file
transformer just add one method called
implement one method called transform
which gets for the classes that will
choose to a transform to inject code
into a will need to a will actually have
a call back after we will try to retrans
form them will have the transform
Colbeck a
and will be given as a parameter its
class bite and we'll need to return at
the end of the manipulation the new
class bites that will replace the
existing bites of of that class which
class will be replaced or retrans formed
the one that we call we transform
classes we provide here a rare class
array of classes of class a of the class
class week it's easy to retrieve all the
running classes if you want from the jvm
and not cover it currently because i
don't have a lot of time so all we're
left to do is go here from the existing
bytecode of the class change it and
inject our age sdt code where we want it
and that's all before we do this we need
to package as i said before the our
agent in a jar file we have a manifest
file that include one important
attribute which is the boot classpath we
can a adhere list of java files that
needed to be loaded they are loaded with
the boot class a class loader something
that enables them to a work from any
part of our code and this is a very a
required feature so here we will give it
a all the jars that are used by US 22 to
transform the classes we want to inject
code to so these are the ASM library in
one dtrace library that you should use
in order to use the chastity framework
in addition to this it has also the the
provider a interface that we defined it
should be included in the path to so we
are left as i said just with
transforming the class so that's say for
this we'll need to make our our hands a
little bit dirty but fortunately we have
the ASM package sm is used also by
beatrice and by other profilers it's
small fast and robust and it supports
already a Java 7 it's open source m sm
has reader and writer the reader can
read class bite the writer writes those
class bites it can the reader can read
it and generate events of everything it
meets in the class file just like xml
sax parser generates events when it
passes an xml file all we can work again
like xml dom parser and build tree of
all the class objects i use the event
base because it's much faster and
consumes less memory again it's just for
the instrumentation phase it's not a
when you're just after the
instrumentation when you just want to
fire events or or use your probes so the
ASM frame with the sm framework you can
use a class reader to read the input
bytecode generates events from for
anything it meets like field it meets a
field a method and everything it can
just pass a didn't mention this we we
usually pass all events to a class visit
or a which is our adapter our class
visit or can either change the
the event or define another event or
pass the event as is it can also don't
pass the events in it gets by default
the event is passes forward to the next
class visit or in line if you don't pass
the events that means that you remove
this item whether it's a feel the method
and instruction etc so that's the
mechanism we have afterwards it the next
class visit or is a writer which can
write for us the transform the change or
not change bytecode and from the writer
we can retrieve the byte codes that's
the high level a code for this we are
defining a class writer a we're defining
a class visit 0 which is our adapter is
going to make the changes and we define
a class reader the class visit or the
adapter will get in the in its
constructor the class writer so that
means that it's a transfer all its event
all the events it want to transfer to
the class writer the class reader is
just initialized with the input byte
code and after we call the reader except
it starts generate events to this
parameter to the class visitor it
generates events and the class visitor
our adapter is doing whatever it wants
with the class content it's a bit
abstract so we're not far from giving an
example of how it's a going have four
minutes for that so a in our agent that
is automatically loaded by a attach API
a we are instantiating class reader
visitor and writer we're starting to go
over the input bytes and move them to
our class v
it or our agent when our agent visit
method get to a method that we want to
instrument we are a generating this
method but a working with a special a
method visit or method visitor is the
same as class visit or but for methods
during the class visiting getting the
events for it class we are when we get a
class event we can retrieve a method
visit when we get a method visit event
we can retrieve a method visitor and
method visitor will help us to go over
all all the content all the instructions
of the methods and like the class is
going over all the content of the class
method visitors goes over all the
instructions and change them remove them
edge to them eh whatever we want to do
with them so here we are using as an
adapter something which is derived from
a method visitor it is the advice and
adapter which make it easy to add code
on method enter it's a predefined a
method of this ASM predefined class we
have on method ed enter and on method
return it's something that it's easy to
implement by our own with on extension
of a class visitor but it's easier to do
with this advice adapter so the code of
our class instrumental which is the
class adapter that we are instantiating
in our agent class is a easy it just
passes all the events all the class
content go straight to the a-class
writer afterwards so the only thing we
need to do is to add disk or back visit
method and every time a method is
started
the reader reports to us that it met a
method it called our visit it calls our
visit method in class and at the end of
this visit method we need to add to
return a method visit or we will create
our own visit method a method visitor it
will be a predefined it will be built on
a predefined a advice adapter ASM
predefined advice adapter and will
change only class the if here is
something it's a condition to filter
just for methods we are interested to
instrument and the instrumental here
instrument just in in the entry of this
method of course we can easily
instrument whenever we want in our code
so the method entry instrumental has
just one method for us on method enter
and we add justice byte codes which
calls our a jazz DT probes if you are
not familiar with a byte code you have
the option to use the asme fire tool
coming from ASM SME fire is it n in an
ASM tool which is invoked on every java
class file as when you invoke it on a
java class file it gives you the ASM
code which generates this class so if
you write this call this code you'll get
the original class so if you want to add
such bytecode such a code to our own
method event that's the only a messing
with with byte codes here and we don't
want to mess with byte codes we can use
the asme fire tool to take the pre
instrumented class compile it run a
fire on that class take the output keep
the output now add the code to the class
the code we need to edit just this jess
dt provider and whatever call we want to
do edit to our java code compile it run
asme fire again now we have to ASM code
codes before the instrumentation the
code edition and after so we can do diff
differentiate find the difference
between them and it will be exactly the
code that we need to add to that adapter
so we don't really need to mess with
byte codes if we don't want to it
doesn't doesn't do anything bad to have
some familiarity basic familiarity with
byte code and since we are late on time
I prefer to pass the static
initialization of the provider it's not
really a mass to do this I'm going to
publish a template that is doing all
this so you'll just I'll put it
somewhere on the web so whoever
interested I forgot to write my email
but I'll write it in a minute so can
email me a and I'll send him a pointer
to that a publication when he took ours
and what we did so far we am we
completed to dynamically attach the j
sdt code into our a java code i want you
to see this say for more information
because there are some important stuff
dtrace is a very convenient to reach
dtrace the commendation if you're
interested in in touch api the pointer
here core java technology
tips is very useful very straightforward
to start retrieving dot class files from
running up it's very useful if you want
an example to start with and this is on
instrumentation again very very a give
you a very good ramp up betray something
that will be easily found with a google
and ASM this is the home of this of the
project the ASM for guide I almost urge
you if you if you are not familiar with
a sm reedus guide even if you're not
going to use a same it's very educative
for what's going off on the Java
platform on the Java execution
environment if you are not using if you
are not familiar with the JVM execution
model with if you have no clue about
byte codes and how to run them very very
good well written document not very long
and give you a very good idea of the JVM
execution environment end of j of n of
ASM for we don't have time but if you
have any questions and they want let us
out questions or you can come to me i'm
still here for a few minutes
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
