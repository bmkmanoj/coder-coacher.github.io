to provision an Integration Cloud instance  automatically.
A stack template describes a set of services
that will be provisioned together.
In this case, that includes not just Integration
Cloud itself, but Oracle Database Cloud Service
and an Oracle Storage Cloud Service container,
both of which are used by the Integration
Cloud instance.
Using a stack template with Integration Cloud
offers a choice of three feature sets: Integration,
Integration and Process, or Integration, Process,
and Integration Analytics.
The Integration Analytics option will cause
two Integration Cloud instances to be installed,
with specific containers, sharing the database.
To use a template, you'll first need to
note a reference to your storage account.
To find that reference, click the menu icon on the Storage Classic tile of your My Services page.
Select the View Details option.
When the details are displayed, copy the value
of the account reference and save it for later.
Then, return to your dashboard.
On the Integration Cloud tile, open the menu,
and select Open Service Console.
From the menu in the upper left corner of
the screen,
Select Oracle Cloud Stack, 
and then navigate to the Templates tab.
Select the template by filtering on the name.
In this case, I type in the word integration,
and the Integration Cloud template is displayed.
To view a graphical representation of the
components in the template, click the template
icon or the template name.
The topology tab shows the graphical representation
of what will be created by the stack template.
The template tab shows the contents of the
template file in YAML format.
To create a stack, click the create icon at
the far right of the template you want to
use.
In this example, we'll use the Oracle-provided
template.
Enter a stack name.
Instance names will have this stack name pre-pended
to them, so it's best to keep it short.
You can optionally enter a description.
The template field displays the template
used to create the stack.
Enter an email address where you'd like
to receive notifications of instance provisioning
progress (for example, when provisioning completes).
Selecting the On Failure Retain Resources
option would preserve both successful and
failed services in case of a partial provisioning
failure.
You won't normally select this option, but
it may be of use if you're working with
Oracle support to debug a provisioning problem.
To automatically create a Storage Cloud Service
container instance for backup and recovery,
Enter the storage container reference you
saved earlier.
Provide your storage container user name and
password.
This is the user login you use when you log
into the MyServices Console.
In the service section, provide an SSH public
key.
You can either upload an existing key, supply
a key value, or create a new key pair.
To create a new pair, select Create a New
Key and click Enter.
After it's been created, download the key
pair to your local machine.
It will enable you to access your virtual
machines if you're doing any troubleshooting
with Oracle's guidance.
Next, select the feature set that you want
to provision.
You can select
Integration features.
Integration and Process features.
or Integration and Process + Integration
Analytics features.
Visual Builder is installed automatically
with each feature set.
Finally, enter the number of nodes you want
to start with.
You can scale in or scale out later in the
Integration Cloud My Services Console.
Next, review the values that you provided.
Confirm these values to trigger the provisioning
process.
Provisioning is underway.
From here, you can refresh the screen to view
the latest status, or select the Activity
tab to view log messages showing the provisioning
status.
When provisioning is done, your instance is
ready to use!
