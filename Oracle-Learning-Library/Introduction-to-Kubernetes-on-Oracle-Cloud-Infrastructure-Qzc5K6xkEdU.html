cloud infrastructure the cloud
application development and deployment
paradigm is changing and comes with its
own set of challenges
containers are a piece of software that
includes everything needed to run code
runtime system tools system libraries
and settings
thus containers package code and
dependencies together
hi can you tell me more about container
technology please
container technology has solved the
problem of getting software to run
reliably across various computing
environments a container consists of an
entire runtime environment it provides
programmers development teams and
operations engineers with the common
toolbox that they need to take advantage
of the distributed and networked nature
of modern applications such as libraries
and other dependencies and ship it all
out as one package
oh I see is the container limited to the
use of certain technologies
no there are no such limitations with
containers you can use almost any
technology for your applications
you can choose the right technology for
an applications functionality from a
wide variety of languages databases web
applications monitoring and logging
tools and much more
how do I deploy those containers to the
machines do I have to deploy them
individually
this is the point where containerization
becomes relevant containerization is an
OS level virtualization method for
deploying and running distributed
applications on multiple isolated
systems for a single control host and to
access a single kernel
when deploying containers on oracle
cloud infrastructure there are two main
container technologies to be kept in
mind docker kubernetes
docker is an open-source project which
is guided by the docker company Dockers
flavor of containers is the most popular
method for creating containers
kubernetes is an open source project
maintained by one of the top five
fastest growing open source communities
kubernetes provides tooling to manage
large numbers of containers
note docker containers are the most
popular type of containers used with
kubernetes
that's interesting can you tell me more
about kubernetes
kubernetes is an open-source platform
and is production-ready
a kubernetes cluster contains two types
of resources the master coordinates the
cluster nodes are the workers that run
applications
the master is responsible for all
activities in your cluster such as
scheduling applications maintaining
applications desired State
scaling applications rolling out new
updates
a node is a virtual machine or a
physical computer that serves as a
worker machine in a kubernetes cluster
any kubernetes cluster that handles
production traffic should have a minimum
of three nodes when you deploy
applications on kubernetes you tell the
master to start the application
containers
the master schedules the containers to
run on the clusters nodes the nodes
communicate with the master using the
kubernetes api which the master exposes
the kubernetes installer for oracle
cloud infrastructure provides a
terraform based kubernetes installation
how does terraform based kubernetes work
but before that could you tell me why
Oracle chose terraform
sure Oracle chose to go through the
terraform route for a few key reasons
terraform is becoming an extremely
common way to orchestrate cloud
infrastructure terraform manages state
for us for example it is helpful in
easily adding or removing nodes from
your kubernetes cluster the existing
terraform provider for Oracle cloud
infrastructure provides an existing
powerful abstraction for managing
infrastructure that we can leverage and
build upon
this terraform kubernetes installer
provides a set of terraform modules and
sample based configuration to provision
and configure a virtual cloud network
vcn and subnets instances for kubernetes
control plane to run on and load
balancers to front-end the Etsy D and
kubernetes master clusters in your
tenancy on Oracle cloud infrastructure
the example configuration supports a
number of input variables that allow you
to specify the kubernetes master and
node shapes sizes and how they are
placed across the availability domains
ATS this example kubernetes cluster
configuration includes three back-end at
CD instances one for each availability
domain three back-end k8s master
instances one for each availability
domain 9k eights worker instances three
for each availability domain
the configuration also includes
self-signed cluster certificates for
authenticating API requests kubernetes
RBAC role-based authorization control
for authorizing api requests flannel or
CNI for handling multi host container
networking
if your requirements extend beyond the
base configuration the modules can be
used to form your own customized
configuration
you can also add and remove notes from
your cluster using terraform
you can follow these steps for a quick
setup download and install terraform
download and install the Oracle cloud
infrastructure terraform provider
version 2.00
or later create a terraform
configuration file that specifies the
path to the oracle cloud infrastructure
provider create a terraform dot TFRs
file in the project route that specifies
your API signature or API signing
tenancy user and compartment with an
Oracle cloud infrastructure ensure you
have cubed CTL installed the quickest
way to get a kubernetes cluster up and
running on Oracle cloud infrastructure
is to simply use the base configuration
defined in the top-level file the
kubernetes cluster will be running after
the configuration is applied
successfully and the cluster
installation scripts have been given
time to finish asynchronously typically
this takes around five minutes after
terraform apply and will vary depending
on the instance counts and shapes
thanks for sharing all this information
within minutes terraform sets up the
kubernetes cluster and that's really
amazing
exactly
but before an organization can decide on
using kubernetes or not it must address
some vital questions
we'll the cluster be hosted on premises
in the cloud or in a hybrid system will
it rely on the providers monitoring and
maintenance tooling there is a lot more
to learn about the terraform kubernetes
installer for Oracle cloud
infrastructure for further information
you can refer to the github repository
what if we prefer to design the
automation for deploying kubernetes
clusters ourselves
you can create your own clusters from
scratch and can learn more by following
the kubernetes deployment guide

infrastructure portal to learn more be

get started right away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
