Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series this demo shows you how to
benefit from the out-of-the-box
compliance standards capabilities of
Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud control
enterprise manager Cloud Control
provides an automated compliance
framework that allows you to validate
the configuration of your existing
targets against Oracle recommendation
best practices that are provided
out-of-the-box crowd-control
also allows you to create your own
compliant standards for your system in
this demonstration we are looking at
applying the out-of-the-box compliance
down darts to some of the existing
targets to begin with let's go to
enterprise compliance and library this
takes us to the compliance library page
which contains the default rule
standards and frameworks as well as the
ones that you manually created the first
important thing to understand is that
there is a hierarchy between what we
call frameworks standards and rules
basically a framework can contain one or
more standards and a standard can
contain one of our rules let's go and
look at the compliance standard rules
there are three compliant standard rule
types there is a repository rule very
similar to the policy that was available
in Greek control 11g there is also
WebLogic server signature rule that is
essentially the integration of the DEA
guardian' capabilities for WebLogic
server and there is also a real time
monitoring rule which is the integration
of the configuration change consoles
real-time monitoring capability
let's look at a couple of out-of-the-box
rules here
first off you can see they are out of
the box because you have a padlock on
the left hand side and users are
actually enabled to add each system
define rules but they can do a create
like to make a copy of that rule and
then edit it if need be now we take a
look inside one of these out-of-the-box
repository rules just to see what's
inside and you can see important
information like the severity that is
used for compliance calculation the
state of the rule can be production or
development and only production rules
and standards are actually evaluated and
show up in the compliance results page
you can give it keywords and references
and then this is the sequel statement
that is used to query the Oracle
management repository to check the
compliance for the particular target
that is associated to that rule you can
also specify an extra condition for the
statement to check for any violation
which is very similar to the 11g
policies as you can see there are
hundreds of rules out of the box
covering different target types like
WebLogic server cluster database
database instance host etc and you
organized one or more compliance rules
into one compliant standard which is
applicable to a single target type like
database instance so let's take a look
at one compliant standard to see how
those are organized on the left-hand
side there is a navigator because one
compliant standard can contain other
compliant standards as long as they are
of the same target type they can contain
folders and of course rules the folders
give a way to organize rules into
logical groupings for organizational
sake but they do not affect the overall
compliance score
so you can see all the different rules
and I can click on a particular rule to
get some information about it as a user
you can associate and out-of-the-box
compliance standout to an existing
target by simply highlighting that
standard and clicking the associate
button here we select the storage best
practice for database or you can do a
create like to make a copy of the
standard which is probably recommended
because of self update mechanism that
could suddenly change and out of the box
standard but in this case we will use
the storage standard and associated to a
target here you can click on add which
gives you a list of applicable targets
of that particular type and let's pick a
couple here then click select and then
ok to confirm
so these pop-ups are warning that if
your standard contains real time
monitoring rules or WebLogic server
signature rules it may deploy certain
settings to the agent to enable those
functionalities so just to be aware of
that finally let's look at the
frameworks again Keppel sheep out of the
box and you can create your own the main
difference between a compliance
framework and a standard is that the
framework can spend multiple target
types which allows you to get true
compliant scores across the entire data
center let's take a look at one of these
again you have a navigator on the left
and one framework can contain one or
more standards we would be able to drill
down to rules from here as well these
cover is pretty much out to use
out-of-the-box content and now you can
apply it to your targets to immediately
take advantage of the oracle best
practices
now let's go to the results area to see
how the compliance results show up after
being evaluated on the compliance
results page you can view the results in
a number of different ways you can
review them by compliance framework you
can view them by compliance standard or
by target so let's focus first on
compliance standards you can see a list
of compliance standards that have been
applied to live targets and on the right
hand side is the average score for the
compliance standard and in the middle
here of what we have is target
evaluations and number of violations
they are represented in terms of
critical warning and compliant for
targets and critical warning and minor
warning for violations so let's drill
down into this one here and see how we
can look at it in further graphical
details let's go first with the summary
view here again you can look at the
compliance in different ways we can look
at the results by targets and this is a
list of all the targets with their
violation counts and levels as well as
their score and last evaluation date
that is important because evaluation
only takes place when there is a change
in the configuration in addition to look
at results by targets you can also look
at them by rule in this case there is
only one rule but we will see another
example that has more probably as
important as the current state is the
trennis tree so you can see how your
average compliance score is changing
over time
the number of targets that are evaluated
as well as the average number of target
by compliance score in the average
violation count per target
now let's go one more time to the
compliance results page to look at a
standard that has more than one rule
this one has many rules but just one
target associated with it so it's abused
to see in this case if the target
complies or not
finally let's go back to the compliance
results page and this time let's Ana
look at the results in terms of targets
here you can look at your results from a
target point of view rather than a
standard you can do searching here as
well if you are only interested in
particular type of targets for example
there is how you can leverage from the
out-of-the-box compliance content you
get in Oracle Enterprise Manager
thanks for watching
you
