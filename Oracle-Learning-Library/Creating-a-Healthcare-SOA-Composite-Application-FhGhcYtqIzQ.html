in this demonstration I'll show you how
to create a healthcare so a composite
application using Oracle so sweet for
healthcare integration here we'll create
a simple so accomplished application to
receive hl7 messages from an inbound
mllp endpoint and then send those
messages to an outbound mllp endpoint
here in JDeveloper we'll create a new
application and give it a name for the
application template we'll selects our
application click next we'll name the
project and we'll choose the empty
composite template and finish now the
applications composite XML file is
opened in the editor first let's create
the healthcare adapter for the inbound
or source endpoint which is an ml LP
server that receives generic ADT
messages in the component palette we'll
scroll down and select this healthcare
adapter and we'll drag it over to the
exposed services land in this healthcare
configuration wizard will configure the
adapter we'll enter a service name
indicating we're receiving an hl7
version 231 a DT message and click Next
we're not using JMS so we'll leave
healthcare integration type at default
and we'll use this application server
connection that we've already set up the
healthcare adapter is receiving inbound
messages so the operation is receive
and we'll leave the document definition
handling at basic and now we'll select
the document definition for the service
which is hl7 version 2 3 1
generic ADT and we'll select this
document definition ADT def and click
Next and we're done so we'll click on
finish and here you can see the wisdom
file has been created and the healthcare
adapter appears in the exposed services
lane now let's create the healthcare
adapter for the outbound or target
endpoint which is an ml LP client that
sends generic ADT messages
this time we'll drag the healthcare
adapter to the external references lien
and we'll configure the adapter we'll
give it a name indicating we're sending
an hl7 version 231 a DT message will
live integration type at default we'll
select our application server connection
and this time the operation is send
which is the default document definition
handling is basic and again we'll select
hl7 version 231 a DT and select this
document definition and we're done and
you can see the new wisdom file and the
healthcare adapter appears in the
external references Lane now we need to
create a mediator component that
receives generic ADT messages from the
inbound endpoint and routes them to the
outbound endpoint so we'll get a
mediator component and drag it into the
components Lane we'll leave the name as
is
and now we'll wire the components
together so from the exposed service to
the mediator and from the mediator to
the external reference this now shows
the path of the messages through the
solar application now let's edit the
mediator let's scroll down here and
we'll set the message sequence to fi fo
which stands for first-in first-out
and let's open the expression builder
and into this expression which ensures
that all messages pertaining to a
specific message ID are delivered
sequentially click OK let's scroll down
a bit and now we'll assign a value in
the static routing section to identify
the outbound endpoint we'll add a new
value assignment and select constant as
the type in the from section and enter
outpatient laboratory which is the name
of our outbound endpoint that we defined
in the healthcare console in the to
section we want to use the property type
and we'll enter
HC to end point and we'll click OK and
now you see the assignment so let's save
now let's deploy the application we're
deploying to an application server click
Next and finish let's open up this log
window and in the solar log we can see
the build was 16
for in the deployment section if we
scroll down we can see deployment is
finished so the application has been
successfully deployed there's one last
step before we can run the application
that is to associate the composite with
the inbound endpoint so here in the
healthcare console let's open the
inbound endpoint our patient admission
and in this document to receive section
let's scroll over and select the
composite from the composite list and
then click apply so that's it for
creating a healthcare so accomplished
