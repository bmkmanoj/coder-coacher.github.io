installment of our discussion of big
data and analytical techniques this
video is the second of two on market
basket analysis in this video we'll
focus on a pairwise expansion of
shopping baskets hi and a simple drag
and drop method for building association
with Oracle data since this is part two
of two will quickly review some of the
relevant information for part one
following our review we'll look at the
implementation of a simple hi you DTF or
user-defined table generating function
for extracting item combinations from a
shopping basket finally we'll look at
using a combination of hive Oracle
loader for Hadoop and oracle data mining
to produce a drag-and-drop workflow for
producing rules from our shopping
baskets in our previous session we
talked a little bit about the history of
market basket analysis and some of the
algorithms which are used to conduct it
of all the approaches the commonality is
that we always need to explode or expand
the shopping basket and look at the item
purchases as K wise combinations this
could be accomplished via UDT ups or
transaction tables among other methods
from that point many tools can be used
to construct association pools Data
Miner are the group or simply ready
custom code and all equally valid tools
for exploring shopping baskets I'd like
to return to the central point of a
comet oriole expansion for any given
shopping basket would like to create
rules for every possible grouping of
items for a basket of meat potatoes and
beer we want combinations of meat
implies potatoes meat implies beer
potatoes implies beer not to mention
meat and potatoes implies beer in this
sense a simple exploding of an array
does not yield what we want
let's consider the simple case of a
pairwise expansion just the pairs of
items in a shopping basket I've doesn't
provide a function which produces this
so we'll need to write one let's say
that this function takes in a comma
delimited strength it produces all the
pairs within that set of hype items I
provides three different types of
user-defined functions u DX which run on
the map site and only consider single
rose you das which accounted for reduce
that execution require logic around
partial abrogation and finally UDTs
which produce multiple rows of output
for a single row of input will need
already you DTF I viewed etfs extend
from the generic you DTF clots and need
to override certainly improve method the
initialized method must be overridden to
validate the input and output types of
the function I've does this be an object
of type object inspector the process
method must be overridden this is the
method which actually operates on a
given rough finally the close method
should be overridden to perform any
cleanup it's necessary here you see the
initialize method over root my pair wise
function takes you only one argument
delimited string so we check the length
of the args are it the string a lie
object is an object inspector on the
input validating that it is a strength
the remaining inspectors are for the
strings will make up the output
the process method is extremely simple
if the RO is non-null split the string
on comma and look through the items in
the resulting array for each pair of
items the forward method is called in
the pair the forward method is
effectively our return value as it
passes the tuple end of the table will
be returned for this row using a you DTF
is simpler than writing one all we need
to do is make hive aware of the function
by first adding the georgia class map
and then assign a temporary function to
are you DTF class once that is done we
can use the lateral view operator add
pairwise expansion to our queries note
that because you'd ETFs produce tables
they need to be lateral views before
they can be joined to other projections
on the same table
now that we have our pairwise function
we can begin to compute frequency on our
shopping baskets however the lateral
view forces us to write a more
complicated query than we might like a
sub-query we generate the pairs and
their counts while at a primary we
conduct the filtering that we like of
course we could do this the opposite way
in which we first filtered on the brand
name and then constructed our frequency
counts the previous query only gets as a
pair of Regency in order to implement
the operatory algorithm we do need to do
a number of full table scans keep track
of the total number of records and
compute support and confidence with each
record however you can quickly get our
association rules using hive Oracle
loader Purdue and Oracle data miner
we'll start by generating a transaction
table which we can load into Oracle each
entry in the table will be purchased I'm
customer item the explode function which
as you may have guessed is a you DTF
will give us each of the items in the
basket as a row in a lateral view
writing this into a directory in HDFS
gives us a transaction table with about
Oracle loader for Hadoop requires a bit
of configuration specifically a pair of
XML files but it will load our HDFS data
into the database a single MapReduce job
the two xml files which are necessary or
a loader map to match the columns in our
transaction table to Oracle table
columns on the job configuration file
which provides the necessary information
for MapReduce to connect to an Oracle
database as well as our input file at
that point we'd only run the or a loader
class and our data is loaded once the
data is loaded it shows up as a regular
partition table of the database oracle
data miner has a built-in market basket
analysis widget which we can use to
graphically define our workflow to do
this we make a new workflow in Oracle
data miner and connect our table to the
Association rules block it's the one
with the shopping cart it's about as
simple as market basket analysis can be
the parameters for association rules
need to be set be a drop-down man but
our schema makes this simple we use
transaction time as the transaction ID
that is all the things in a basket
happens at the same check out of time
the item ID is not coincident by the
item column in our table at this point
we can run the model and view the
results this list is lets us view the
results as a series of if then causes
ranked by lift confidence or support the
three metrics are defined just the same
here as they were in part 1 of this
discussion from this point the rules
generated are hopefully interesting
enough to drive value back to our
shoppers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
