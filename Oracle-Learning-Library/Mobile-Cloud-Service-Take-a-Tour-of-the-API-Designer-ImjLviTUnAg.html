know while using the API designer and
the best way to learn those things is
through a simple example so say we want
to create an API called fix it vast
incident report we add an API name which
becomes part of the URL for the API a
quick description click create done now
as a mobile app developer you're
creating the interface to the API or the
contract that describes the api's
correct behavior someone else is
probably writing the implementation that
actually goes after the data anyway if
you're just describing the data you need
for someone else to implement the only
thing you really need to pay attention
to here is the endpoints tab
an end point is just a noun called a
resource and a verb called a method a
single API usually has multiple
endpoints to describe the data you need
and what you want to do with it so let's
see how to add a resource we start with
a noun in this case incidence say this
API is for an app that lets homeowners
request service from a company called
fix it fast so that the homeowner can
get someone to come out and fix a leaky
water heater or some other appliance
problem each request is in the form of a
service incident we want the API to be
able to fetch all the service incidents
out of the backend system like say
Oracle Service Cloud now we need a verb
so we click methods we want the verb get
so we can get all the incident reports
currently in the system the endpoint get
incidents will do just that there's
nothing else we need to worry about on
this page right now so let's go back to
the endpoints page say we also want to
be able to retrieve a single incident
from the system based on the incidence
unique ID to do that will add a nested
resource a nested resource is useful for
when you want to zero in on a subset of
a larger resource the plus sign lets you
add nested resources will add a nested
resource called ID based on the parent
incidents you know that it's nested
because it's shown after the parent
resource which is highlighted in gray we
need a get method for this endpoint to
of course
in a few moments you'll want to test
this endpoint to make sure you're going
to get back the data you expect you
could click test now and take the steps
to get a simple 200 response back which
means the call is successful but let's
make things a bit more interesting by
supplying some walk data this will make
the endpoint behave more like it will
when it's actually implemented all you
have to do is cut and paste some JSON
into the API designer like this click
responses then add response
click add media type
click example
and paste the JSON snippet
that's it we have two end points now for
our API so let's not add any more you
can get the idea of how to do it now
let's test the endpoint that has the
mock data that is the get incident / ID
endpoint the first thing you need to do
is go to the Security tab and allow
anonymous user access you probably
wouldn't do this in real life you'd
probably enter a role that pertains to
your mobile users but for testing
purposes it's fine before you can test
an endpoint in mcs it has to be
associated with a mobile backend a
mobile backend allows you to develop and
deploy groupings of AP is that are
designed to support a specific set of
applications in this case we're
developing our API in a mobile backend
called fix it fast so we'll select that
voila check out the response now you've
got some well-formed JSON with proper
data mimicking what will eventually come
back from the implemented API by
defining many endpoints and supplying
mock data like this you can build up an
entire mock API to code against so you
can do some rapid prototyping without
having to wait for the API to actually
be implemented in JavaScript you now
should have enough information to go off
and write your own API in the API
