cloud control 12c demo series this
demonstration will show you how to
create a basic report in bi publisher
against cloud control 12 seed target
data and also that bi publisher honors
cloud control target privileges now that
we have assigned the bi publisher
privileges to our enterprise manager
cloud control users we can start
creating our own custom reports as part
of the integration between bi polisher
and Enterprise Manager cloud control a
shared folder called Enterprise Manager
cloud control is created within bi
publisher this is the folder hierarchy
that is displayed within Enterprise
Manager cloud control however we should
not extend the hierarchy or at our own
reports to this structure as future
patches and updates may overwrite our
editions site-specific reports should be
created in their own folder hierarchies
although on the surface this then
becomes them if we remember that the
report hierarchy displayed within cloud
control is merely a punch out to be a
publisher itself it is no more onerous
than running the out-of-the-box reports
let's login to bi publisher to create a
folder for our own reports to do so we
need to log in as a user with the MB IP
administrator role which in our case is
the am admin user we will create a
folder called custom reports under
shared folders
next we need to modify the permissions
on the folder to allow our fellow
Enterprise Manager cloud control users
to access the folder and its contents
will allow anyone with the EMB IP author
all to read write and delete items in
the folder anyone with a TM VIP
scheduler role to schedule reports in
the folder and anyone with the EMB IP
viewer role to read and run reports in
the folder will also elect to apply the
same privileges to all items that are
created in the folder below policy
reports are composed of two parts and
underlying data model and a layer for
displaying information retrieved through
the data model I'll create a data models
folder to keep the two separate
we're going to create a report that will
let you select a managed database and
display some tablespace information for
that database as both a graph and a
table of data bi publisher comes with
some sample templates in the shared
folders components folder but first we
need to grant privileges to a mbrp
authors so they can read the folder a
final report will look like this and we
will need three things in our data model
to realize it a parameter to display on
the report so the user can select a
database to report upon a list of values
to populate a selection parameter with
database names and a data set to extract
the tablespace data from the oracle
management repository filtered by the
parameter value in reports is the
Enterprise Manager cloud control user to
whom we granted the MBI pls a role so
let's login to bi publisher as that user
start the data model creation process by
clicking the create data model button we
will specify its location in the folder
hierarchy when we save it let's start
with the list of values we'd give it a
name and we'll create an SQL query
against the am repos data resource to
populate it the e/m repos data source
was created for us as part of the
integration process I'll use the query
builder to create the SQL query the
search field will dynamically filter the
list of available objects as we type
into it drag the objects you want to use
from the list and on to the Builder pane
I want to select instance name and
target GUI D tuplets to populate my list
of values
so that the instance name can be
displayed but the target GUI D will be
used as the key value in the background
clicking on results runs the query so we
can confirm that it works it's working
okay so we'll save it now that we have
our list of values we'll create a
parameter so it can be displayed we give
the parameter an internal name and a
display name that will be seen on the
report for this demonstration we will
restrict the selection to a single value
as the final piece of our data model we
create a data set for the tablespace
data this will be an SQL query using the
am reposed data source
we'll use the query builder and filter
the object list then drag the objects we
want to use on to the Builder pane the
query builder lets us join the two
objects by selecting a common the first
object then the second it displays the
join and if we hover over it we see the
definition of the mapping we just
created next we select the columns we
want to use in the data set
and add a condition on the target GUI D
column to whatever is selected in the
parameter as this column is only present
for the purpose of filtering the results
we will uncheck the show option save the
data set
now we can save the data model to the
custom reports custom data models folder
that we created earlier
bi publisher allows us to generate
sample data for the data set that can be
used later to visualize the report
layout as we build it
click the XML button to run the report
here we can see that something appears
to have gone wrong
instead of displaying the instance name
our parameter appears to be displaying
the target GUI D key value if we return
to the list of values definition we
notice that the target GUI D value is
the first column selected and the
instance name as a second in order to
use a display value and key value pair
for the parameter display value needs to
be the first selected column in the list
of values we can alter the column order
in the conditions tab
now when you run the report the
parameter behaves as expected let's save
this as sample data for use later on now
that we have our data model we need to
create a report layout to display the
data still logged in as the a.m. reports
user we navigate to the custom reports
folder and elect to create a new report
we need to choose the appropriate data
model and then the template that we want
to use
now in the report layer editor we can
take the basis provided by the template
and modify it to suit our report let's
start by specifying a report title I
want to display the instance name and
version of the selected database so
we'll add a grid under the title to hold
that data in the top left-hand cell I'll
add a field label and then I can drag
the field from my data model into the
cell underneath similarly with the
database version I had a field label
and then drag the DB version field from
the data model on to the report layout
next I'll modify the chart title to
something more meaningful for this
report and now I can populate the chart
by dragging fields from the data model
onto the chart area bi publisher
displays three hotspots where you can
drop films to be displayed as chart
values series or labels I'll stand with
the tables based size field as a chart
value notice that bi publishing uses the
sample data we saved earlier to give us
instant visual feedback on how the
finished report will look I also want to
display tables based used sides
on the chart and I'll use tablespace
name as the label I want this to be a
horizontal bar chart
and I'll apply the default style
moving on to the data table first I'll
modify the title
and then I'll drag data films on to the
table area again bi publisher uses the
saved sample data to show me how the
finished report will look I'm happy with
that layout so I'll save it
now I'll save the report itself into the
customer reports folder so all the
Enterprise Manager cloud control users
with bi publisher roles can access them
now we can actually run the report by
clicking the view report button then we
can switch between database instances to
be sure that it works
next we will make sure that bi publisher
honors each user's target privileges in
Enterprise Manager cloud control so
we'll log out as in reports who has
privileges across all targets and login
as a M user one who has privileges
against all database targets
we navigate to the custom report folder
and open the DB tablespace info report
as we expect we can choose between both
database targets now let's test the
report as AM user - who only has
privileges against the target DV
database instance when we run the report
as am user - there is only one database
instance listed in the parameter field
demonstrating that be a publisher honors
the users target privileges as defined
within Enterprise Manager Cloud Control
