Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud control
13 seed demo series Enterprise Manager
13c introduces flexible TB access
control for enterprise manager database
plugin thus providing a fine-grained
privileged control model for accessing
data base management functionalities in
this screen watch let's learn more about
it and know how to configure enterprises
have different data base person ask to
access database management functions
such as TPA application developer
application DPA and so forth before the
introduction of this feature and
Enterprise Manager user granted access
on the database had access to all of the
database management features
irrespective of his current business
person now thus gaining access to
performance management high availability
management storage management security
management and so forth
thus the user was granted more
privileges that did not necessarily map
to his business personal flexible DB
access controlled privileges in DM 13c
is modeled to align new out-of-box
privileges introduced with different
database personas' and hence provide
tighter access control unmanaged target
databases for example enterprises may
now configure their application
developers to have read-only access to
view the performance management report
for a production database target
flexible DB access control privileges
are very granular database
target privileges available for target
types database instance cluster database
and pluggable database close to 150 new
out of box privileges are introduced
which are categorized in these DB
management areas homepage and
performance privileges high availability
privileges security privileges storage
and
keema privileges there are separate view
and manage privileges for all areas in
database management out of box
aggregated privileges are also available
which makes the configuration easy to
use for instance there are privileges
like database application DB database
application developer and database
administrator now in the demo I'll show
you how we can use a flexible DB access
control privileges to differentiate
access between an application developer
and application DPL and the database
administrator or managing the same
target database by deferring in
functional axis this is the application
developer Enterprise Manager user
account who can view database
performance in Enterprise Manager but
cannot make any changes to a database
against the target privilege the
pluggable database gen1 is selected and
the aggregated flexible DB access
control privilege called database
application developer is assigned this
privilege encompasses the view
privileges in the categories performance
and schema so now with this assignment
the application developer Enterprise
Manager user account has database
application developer privileges on 10/1
pluggable target database this is the
application DBA Enterprise Manager user
account who can manage application
schema application objects and
application performance in the database
application DBA can view and update the
database to fix performance and other
issues they aggregated flexible DB
access control target privilege called
database application DBA is assigned and
this privilege encompasses the manage
privileges in categories performance and
schema this is the database
administrator Enterprise Manager user
account for ten-month pluggable database
who has the ability to perform full
database lifecycle management from
installation to configuration monitoring
backup recovery and performance during
the aggregated flexible DB access
control target privilege
called database administrator is
assigned and this privilege has full
access
now let's login to enterprise manager
console using each of these accounts and
see the difference when accessing ten
one pluggable database target
now let's login as AB developer
Enterprise Manager user account and
navigate to ten one pluggable database
homepage application developers main
focus is to monitor sequence for the
application by navigating to performance
menu and the selecting sequel monitoring
she logs in using database credentials
and gets to see the execution plan of
the application sequence that he's
interested in application developer only
has view access to performance and
schema functionalities so if you notice
many of the menu items under performance
are disabled like sequel tuning advisor
sequel performance analyzer setup run
sequel sequel worksheet for menus which
are enabled like optimizer statistics
equal tuning sets this user can view
details but not do any active management
like edits for instance when the
navigate to optimize the statistics any
active operations like gather database
statistics will show the error page
indicating insufficient privilege an
application developer does not have
access to a large set of menu options
under availability security and
administration he has view access to the
functionalities exposed under schema
menu he also does not have access to
start or shut down the database in short
the application developer Enterprise
Manager user account is granted only the
privileges that are mapped to his
specific business need now let's log in
as a DBA Enterprise Manager user account
application DBA is responsible for
managing the application actively
including any edits to fix performance
and schema issues so unlike an amp
developer account here
menu items enabled for performance
tuning likes equal tuning advisor sequel
performance analyzer and so forth he
could also actively tune the application
by configuring optimizer statistics he
also has edit access to functionalities
exposed under schema menu he can also
edit the initialization parameter of the
database under administration menu but
there are functionalities which are
disabled for his business personal like
he does not have access to the menu
items under availability or Security
menu also he cannot start or shut down a
database now we have seen that tighter
access control for AB DBA Enterprise
Manager user account owing to the fact
that we have granted database
application DBA privilege which is the
privilege offered as part of flexible DB
access control feature now let's log in
as 10:1 pluggable database administrator
since the database administrator is
granted full access he has the ability
to manage and configure high
availability so the menu items in
availability are enabled he also has
access to configure security and so is
provided access to menu items under
security the menu items in
administration are also enabled so in
this demo we have seen how flexible DB
access controlled privileges can be
leveraged for granting Enterprise
Manager users only the required set of
privileges to complete their more
specific responsibilities thank you for
