this is the fifth in a series of eight
videos about upgrading oracle Scylla
suite to version 12c in earlier videos
we've taken care to verify our pre
upgrade requirements have been met we've
installed the version 12c software in a
new Oracle home directory as you saw in
the installing 12c software video and as
you saw in the creating database schemas
for 12c video we've created the new
scheme as required for version 12 1-3
now let's talk about upgrading schemas
and instance data using the upgrade
assistant the Oracle Fusion Middleware
upgrade assistant or UA is one of
several Fusion Middleware tools and
processes that are used to complete an
upgrade during this task the upgrade
assistant will upgrade the database
schemas that support our component
configurations UA will identify the list
of possible component schemas to be
upgraded it'll determine the order of
schema upgrade based on certain
dependency information that's present
then we'll upgrade eligible schemas
adding tables indices and constraints as
required finally it'll move all the
active 11g Sowa instances into the newly
created 12c tables as you saw in the
previous video we've stopped our 11g
servers and other processes and verified
no components are accessing the database
that's still important as the upgrade
assistant updates the existing schemas
and active instances in the database in
the previous video we described how you
can use the sequel query on the screen
to display the names versions and
upgrade status of each schema record in
the schema version registry table of
your database the upgrade assistant is
going to offer a list of components to
upgrade and a list a schemas that will
be impacted these sequel results will be
useful when selecting from among those
the upgrade assistant displays in our
example each of our 11g schemas is
eligible for upgrade except IAU
to understand more about exceptions like
this refer to the documentation
upgrading with the upgrade assistant
your results will vary but in our
example we'll use UA to upgrade each of
our eligible 11g
schemas with a multiple host topology
like ours it's important to run the
upgrade assistant on the host where the
admin server is located the upgraded
system is expecting to find and
reference files that won't be found on a
host running only a managed server if
you have a similar topology run the
upgrade assistant on the host where the
admin server is located the upgraded
system is installed under the new Oracle
home directory that was created when we
installed Fusion Middleware
infrastructure 12c will navigate to
Oracle home Oracle common upgrade bin
and there will find the upgrade
assistant with the command line in place
we press ENTER to invoke the upgrade
assistant the welcome screen appears
first it reminds us that before we begin
we should backup all software that will
be affected by the upgrade and verify
that our databases operating system and
hardware are certified for use with
version twelve one three we've done each
of those important tasks so we'll
continue on the next screen we can
choose to upgrade either our schemas or
our WebLogic component configurations we
need upgrade our schemas first so we'll
leave schemas the default option
selected because we chose schemas in the
previous screen a list of installed
Oracle Fusion Middleware components that
have schemas that can be upgraded is
displayed from here we choose which
components on this list to upgrade based
on our topology we select Oracle
platform security services and Oracle
soá--
we click Next to proceed
and we brought to the domain directory
screen here we provide the path to the
11g domain to be upgraded we'll browse
to that location select use 0 1 app fmw
that's the 11g domain user projects
domains so a domain double check we've
made the right selection and click Next
to proceed
the prerequisite screen requires us to
manually acknowledge that all
prerequisites have been met before we
continue with the upgrade we backed up
our 11g installation and instance data
we've checked the interoperability and
compatibility guide and verified our
database version is certified for 12c we
verified our system meets all
requirements for this upgrade to 12c and
we've converted our file based opss
to a database based policy store all
these items check we proceed at this
point a sequence of schema information
screens is displayed one screen will be
displayed for each schema to be updated
based on the components we selected to
upgrade earlier in the wizard for each
schema we need to enter information
required to connect to the database that
hosts that schema the information
includes the database connect string and
the DB a username and password verify
our typing and we click connect the
schema username is displayed we supply
the schema password the information we
provided on the previous screen has been
picked up here so we don't need to
re-enter it if we're satisfied and don't
need to make changes we can just click
Next and again now we're editing the UCS
ums screen and there's something
different here because the component ID
or schema name has changed for UCS um a
schema in version 12 one to the upgrade
assistant doesn't automatically
recognize the possible schemas and
display them in a drop-down list
we need to manually enter the name in a
text field if we were upgrading from
twelve one two the name would be prefix
underscore UMS but since we're upgrading
from 11g the name will be prefix
underscore ora s DPM
next to continue the Silla
infrastructure kinnda Cates the
examination of the schema was successful
the upgrade summary screen provides us a
chance to review the options we've
selected before we start the upgrade
process we're happy with those so we
click upgrade the upgrade progress
screen shows the status of the schema
upgrade process but there's one
important thing happening that's not
suggested by the checklist all active
instance data is being upgraded to 12c
the wizard isn't going to advance until
the task is complete depending how many
instances there are to be upgraded this
step could take some time now that it's
complete we'll click Next after a
successful upgrade of the schemas and
instance data this window displays the
list of successfully upgraded components
they're starting versions and their
current versions before we leave this
window let's take a closer look at item
2 in the next steps section
note that an automated upgrade of closed
instances has been started and will
continue until the upgrade is complete
or until the so a server is started if
yours is a typical implementation you'll
probably be motivated to restart the
service before this automated upgrade is
complete be sure to take the on screen
advice and refer to the section
administering and monitoring the upgrade
of Sowa instance data in the document
upgrading so a suite and business
process management to learn how to
schedule and otherwise manage the
upgrade of your closed instance data
we'll talk more about that topic in the
video on post upgrade tasks for now
let's click close and here we are back
at the command prompt
if the upgrade assistant exits with an
upgrade successful message you're done
with this segment of the upgrade if it
exits with an upgrade failure or if
you'd like additional confirmation of a
successful outcome
you can rerun the sequel script we saw
earlier to list the current schemas and
their versions the example on screen
lists each of the schemas in our demo
system each of our 11g schemas has been
upgraded except for the IAU schema which
was expected to remain at eleven one one
seven
Oh our results confirm the successful
completion of the UA and of this step in
the upgrade process we've created new
database schemas and upgraded our
existing schemas the next step in the
upgrade sequence is to update the
WebLogic domain in our next video
reconfiguring the 11g domain will run
the reconfiguration wizard and
demonstrate that tasks until then I'm
Ron Pinkerton thanks for your time and
attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
