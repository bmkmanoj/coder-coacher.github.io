source view with a filter that limits
data selection to a specific customer
segment add the view to your data model
as a dimension change user roles and
apply a filter to provide row-level
security for the model object I begin by
locking the data model there are two
ways to control what data is exposed
through the model the first way is that
I create a filtered view of a database
table the second way is that I can set
permissions and filters on dimensions to
control who can access the dimension as
well as restrict the rows of data they
can see next I create a source view that
only exposes data for the customers
senior segment I need to select at least
one table to define the view the source
view is created from a table that
contains both attribute and measure
columns I start building the table by
selecting all relevant columns for the
view and then adding them to the view
here's where I add a filter to limit the
content to just the senior segment I
have to enclose seniors in single
quotations it's important for me to
review the data records to verify that
my filter works correctly next I need to
add the view to the model as a dimension
table then I can continue by editing the
new dimension table making all the
columns available and then renaming the
columns to make them more user-friendly
I can change who has access to an object
such as a table by editing the
permissions for the object right now
everyone has access to this table
through the everyone role I need to
restrict access to the table so that
only users who have the bi advanced
content author and bi content author
roles can see the table I restrict
access further by creating a data filter
for the BI content author role
expression builder enables me to easily
create the new data filter I
double-click the dimension object I want
select an operator and enter a value I
validate the expression to make sure
it's properly formed now users who have
the BI content author role will only be
able to see revenue detail for the
Americas region to use this new
dimension table I need to create a join
to a fact table just as I would for any
other dimension I also need to validate
and publish the model this makes the new
senior segment dimension available for
use in analyses projects and dashboards
in this video I showed you how to limit
access to your data by filtering a view
controlling user access by role and
applying a row level security filter on
the model object to learn more visit us
