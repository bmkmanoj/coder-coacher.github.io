introduction to the Java Mission Control
a Java flight recorder series I will be
doing so Java Mission Control and Java
flight recorder their JVM monitoring and
analysis tools Mission Control is a
monitoring tool that's JMX compliant and
it basically allows you to monitor live
machines and it's also used with flight
recorder to analyze recordings and then
flight recorder allows you to record and
analyze JVMs of a running java
application both features are new to
Java 7 update 40 and the hotspot JVM
though they've been around a while with
the j-rok at JVM but it's all included
now in Java when you download the latest
Java 7 update you'll have the tools
included and they're free for
development use Mission Control once
again is the monitoring tool so let me
go through some of those acronyms and
you'll see them a little bit in the
demos JMX is stands for java management
extensions and it basically adds hooks
or libraries to dynamically monitor and
manage a VMs and it's built into the JVM
and that's accomplished through managed
beans or M beans and those basically are
objects that manage JVM resources
they're stored on a server and then we
have a jam X agent that manages the
beans and then you will have a JMX
connector which then connects to the
agent so that's basically how it works
and allows us to look at what's
happening on JVM and also manage with
happening on a JVM Java flight recorder
is a recording an analysis tool and
basically it records JVM events that
occur while the JVM is running and
creates a file that you can then load
later and analyze to see what happened
it has an untruth it has a very small
impact or small footprint it's very
unobtrusive and does not really impact
performance of a running application and
it creates very detailed recordings of
the events that occur while that
application is running and then once
you're you know done with making the
recording you load it up in Mission
Control console then you can analyze
what happened the flight recordings are
events of different kinds of things you
have duration events which have a start
and a stop time one time only events are
instant events polled events that occur
at a certain frequency or rate and then
timed events which are duration events
with some sort of threshold when you're
done with the recording it's stored in a
dot JFR file this is a binary file
itself contained in self-describing
and you can either do continuous
recordings which just means that you're
you know constantly writing all that
data to disk and then storing either
based on size or time a certain amount
of data and or you can do a timed
recording today I want to record this
application for 20 minutes to use Java
flight recorder with Java 7 you have to
have update 40 or later the examples I
use are using update 45 and then you
have to use a couple command line
options when you start the JVM you want
to monitor or record you need to add to
unlock commercial features and flight
recorder is shown here in the slide so
that you can enable those monitoring
features and the flight recordings may
be started for a Mission Control
Heol from the command line or using J
command which is also included with Java
7 and you can easily start and stop
recordings with that one last point you
can run multiple recording
simultaneously on the same JVM that's
this absolutely no problem at all
so that's it that's the introduction
that I have to the series I just want to
give a little background on those tools
and then what will follow will be a
series of demos demoing the actual
features and user interface etc for
Mission Control and flight recorder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
