and obviously it can be visualised I'll
show in a moment a different graph for
different customer which is taking into
account specifically what you what you
what you meant so basically wave and and
for example intensivity of particular
relationships so so I'll get back to
this so this is one of the views and on
the right hand side you do have top
entities this is just the demonstrator
but I wanted to be able to give you a
full walk through this so once for
example we see that John Smith it's it's
very active in this graph so let's take
a look his activity is also quite high
in the recent few days so let's take a
look at his add at his at his profile so
so his profile it's and here we are only
querying the data which is relevant to
John Smith so we are not wearing
anything more than that we are also
querying the events from the system so
we are trying to find out what's the
history so when this particular user was
registered what was the risk level when
he was registered how this risk level
has changed what was the history of his
connections with other people so all of
this can be useful for for the analyst
to take some decisions here we have very
simple graph of topics which are were
discussed by John Smith and we see that
Paul Miller for example was discussing
more or less the same and very dangerous
type of of activities like like our John
Smith obviously we can do the same with
with locations so to find out that again
Paul Miller it's the person who should
be who should be maybe monitored more
closely in the system so this is just to
show you how those graph is why
decisions are implemented at the moment
and here we do have several types of
research activities obviously this is a
view on HDFS so we do have an HDFS
cluster with the raw messages and the
text and reached messages in there this
is not extremely exciting to go through
those so to go through this data set but
is what is a little bit more
think I think ends the from the
projection we are doing so we are
putting all the data and all the results
of the analysis on the timeline so we
are trying to help the analyst so for
example say that specific time mentions
specific topics specific entities
specific locations where I mentioned on
the very particular day so it may be of
use for someone to take those decisions
a little bit more quickly so for example
around 13:00 around 2 o'clock let's say
some may be bombing Steve Johnson and
Paul Miller I hope none of you it's it's
it's Steve Jones or Paul Miller
especially Paul Miller because he is
here for the first time and particularly
high activity was what was discussed in
in the in social media was High Court of
Australia in Canberra again
this is here an oversimplification but
proving the point that when we get this
data in this in this kind of way they
are way more meaningful for us and
locations so something good what can be
interesting for you although this
implementation is very very simple we
are simply using our internal location
server and we are putting the in the
tweets and the messages as they arrive
to the system on top of the map so we
have we are able to for example tell
where the certain communication was was
ordinated
so I think that that can be also
expanded to other to other five minutes
okeydoke so two other stuff as well so
we do have others and old and so for
example if you are interested in in
raising the alert in the right in the
right moment for example because all of
this you see now it's something post
active so if you would like to be
notified before this would happen then
obviously you can subscribe to different
types of offer of for example events
like new connections risk level changes
new metadata communication rate changes
for example if John choir a John Smith
was again very quiet and now tweets like
crazy this is probably something which
would what should be fun
interesting for us
okey doke so that's that's that's that's
the social intelligence as it was
created I think six months from now and
but since then we were not really
sitting doing nothing we also tested few
other ways of how we can visualize the
for the graph data so here you have a
view on a big data discovery and I've
created a very simple project for you
which is based on the datasets that I've
created in the recent few days and I'm
not really sure if you're familiar with
with with data discovery but this is not
that much relevant now it's what is what
is important for you that's in this kind
of graphs so location and graph data can
be embedded in the discovery tools which
are used by the analysts and and
obviously here it's a network of
smugglers with their metadata like
phones like bank accounts and this sort
of stuff
for example same network after the CDR
process after billing processing stage
so we take the billing of the people
this is not something I to create that
I've used the datasets that we have we
received some time ago and based on the
data I was able to calculate the the
thickness of the of the of the lines of
the links expresses the intensity of
relationship for example so you have
potentially very different people
connected with each other so you can do
a number of different analytics and for
example this is something I have
implemented in the last two days this is
another data set and this is implemented
on top of cytoscape so for this is this
is this is based on cytoscape and here
you have a fully blown
set of algorithmic as bye-bye guys
yesterday so all the fur group algorithm
run on top of property graphs I don't
think all of them can be can be executed
on this data set but some of those
definitely can like between the
centrality for example here we calculate
the the
which of the notes it's between the
other notes so basically which one is
for example the most important for us to
connect different communities so if you
are targeting some marketing campaign
this could be the person you should
address to have maximum coverage of the
neighborhood of the rest of the network
you can for example the grid centrality
is obviously something we can do so then
it's trying to compress on the size on
the screen we have here but once it's it
stabilizes we can of course play with
this graph and so we can also add more
nodes add links and add other stuff and
here for example we do have this degree
centrality so based on number of
connections we are highlighting in a
sort of way
the the most central people in the graph
again might be of our interest depending
on the use case depending on the on the
customer the kind depending on
requirements this might be used in
different ways for for for dealing with
different use cases okay so that would
be it
I think so maybe you have some questions
okay
it was really crazy periods and very
intensive one when we implemented this
so I think it took us a few few weeks to
put this thing together and the problem
is that most of the stuff it's hidden
behind the scenes so basically all these
other people are assessing was really
complex stuff and this cause this was
this was investment to make and to embed
this into the solution but I think the
graph part was really easy I think it
took us I don't know week or two so
that's that's that's more or less the
complexity
again this is demonstrator but it's I
think app able to do different stuff as
well and and the full project it's at
the moment faced I think around three
stages and I think that's that's that's
the plan for now around 20 people but
not all of them were involved obviously
actually not many survived this this
this pace of work and now just joking
but I think it was a team of four to
three people who did this so
we well how does the language processing
happens and i've natural language
processing happens so that's very good
question i guess it's it's really
complex and here we we had to involve
partners and because this stuff is
really complex it's very much related to
the language to the linguistic to the if
all the syntax and all the if all the
complexities of of all the languages as
we have now and we have fusion languages
and non-fusion languages english is non
fusional languages which is a bit easier
but fusional languages like polish are
completely different based so this is
this is really hardcore stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
