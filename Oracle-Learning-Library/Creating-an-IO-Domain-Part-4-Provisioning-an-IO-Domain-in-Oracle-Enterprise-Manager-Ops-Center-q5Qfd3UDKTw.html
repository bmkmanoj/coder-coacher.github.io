developer with oracle and i'm going to
show you how to provision an io domain
in Oracle Enterprise Manager opscenter
ok let's get started before we do any
provisioning activities first let's
check the terminal window for the
virtualization server notice in this
example that the PCI 0 bus has IOV
virtualization enable and also notice
that we've got the PCIe endpoint device
pcie one already detached from the
primary domain you need these two things
in place before you start
okay looking at off center you can see
what we've got set up already there's an
IO domain io pcie one and it doesn't
have an operating system yet so that's
actually what we're going to do and also
on the network tab for this domain
notice that you've got a v-neck created
and the v-net has a mac address this is
important you need to write the mac
address down for provisioning later so
begin by selecting your IO domain and
then in the actions pane you're going to
click install server this will open up
the install server wizard and here you
can see we've already got a deployment
plan created which installs solaris 11
and then we'll click apply plan in the
introduction panel you can click Next
and also click Next in the provision of
West panel and now you're into the boot
interface resource assignments panel
select the checkbox identify network
interface by MAC address and check your
target and your network and then enter
in the mac address that you wrote down
earlier
enter an IP address and enter the name
of the IO domain and then click Next
review the provisioning summary and then
click Next
click next in the configure OS panel
in the network resource assignments
panel you don't need to do anything
notice so that the controller is set to
virtual okay click Next
in this example we won't assign the IO
domain to a server pool so click Next
review the configure OS summary and then
click Next
schedule the job now and click apply
okay the hard part is over take a look
at your IO domain notice that it has a
lock on it that is what you see while
it's installing an operating system
never wonder what's happening in the
background well you can find out by
looking in the terminal window enter the
ldm list command to list the logical
domains on the virtualization server now
what you want to do is use telnet
localhost and then enter in the console
number for your i/o domain which is 5000
and from here you wait and each line
will tell you exactly what's going on as
the install progresses when the
installation is finally finished you'll
see in op center that you have an
operating system listed under the IO
domain and then also if you look on the
network tab you've got a nick and an IP
address populated it's also useful to
take a look at the control domain and
it's i/o resources you can see that the
PCIe one endpoint device is assigned to
the i/o domain in this demo you learned
how to provision an operating system on
an io domain in Oracle Enterprise
Manager ops center this is Jody thanks
