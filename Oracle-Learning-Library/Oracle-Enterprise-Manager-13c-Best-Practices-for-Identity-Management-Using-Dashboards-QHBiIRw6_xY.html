cloud control 13c demo series this video
focuses on best practices for identity
management using dashboard there are a
number of key aspects to bear in mind
during this video first of all the
benefits of using dashboards number one
they greatly facilitate managing
numerous components up to dozens of
different targets that comprise an eidm
estate number two they enable at a
glance verification that IDM systems and
services are available in performing
thirdly they provide drill down
capabilities to determine root cause
errors and finally you're able to tailor
access the different functionality
according to unique organization roles
we'll be looking at two use cases for
this demonstration the first one is an
out-of-the-box dashboard called
Identity and Access dashboard and the
second dashboard that we'll be looking
at is utilizing the business
applications functionality the first use
case that we'll look at is the Identity
and Access dashboard this can be
accessed from the middleware home page
which can be accessed from target's
middleware and the dashboard itself can
be accessed from the middleware features
drop-down and clicking on Identity and
Access this is the summary page for the
Identity and Access dashboard there are
two additional tabs systems and services
and performance tabs which will examine
in turn the top region highlights an
overview status of all the different
targets that have been discovered by
Enterprise Manager and the next region
provides a summary status of those
individual targets as well as you can
see we've discovered and are monitoring
a number of different Identity
Management targets from adaptive access
manager to OID to Oracle access manager
to governance targets as well as oh you
D targets it's important to note as well
that we
click on any one of these targets and go
directly to the home page of that
individual target in addition there are
additional regions on this particular
page including an incidence region which
summarizes all the incidents for all the
targets on this particular page as well
as compliance summaries as well as patch
recommendation summaries lastly as with
almost all pages with an Enterprise
Manager this page can be personalized to
suit the unique individual needs of
different members of the staff the
second tab of the Identity and Access
dashboard is systems and services this
tab highlights all the different IDM
systems that have been discovered and
created for IDM targets and organized
into a logical format as well as the
different service tests and synthetic
tests that have been created and
deployed and are being monitored by
Enterprise Manager the final tab on the
dashboard is performance it contains
both performance and system status
charts for all of the targets that have
been discovered and are being monitored
by Enterprise Manager customers can
configure and format different charts
according to their own particular needs
the next use case that we'll examine in
this video is business applications
business applications can be accessed
from targets to business applications
and the idea behind business
applications is that it is much more
flexible and user-defined approach to
managing different and disparate target
types within a single UI within business
applications we can mix and match
different systems rouille information
service tests JB MD information and
configuration of compliance data in a
much more flexible fashion than we can
with out-of-the-box dashboards for the
purposes of this demo we'll be
concentrating on one of the business
apps that is our
been defined IDM biz ab3 this is the
homepage for the business application
IDM biz app 3 as you can see it contains
regions that have been selected and
arranged by the user to reflect their
own unique business needs and really
this is one of the key aspects and
benefits of business applications is the
ability to personalize these pages for
each particular user and we'll take a
look at that in just one second there
are a diverse number and kind of regions
that are available within business
applications on the screen are some of
the more common regions they include
general health calculations about all of
the targets that have been defined to be
included within this business
application component status for all the
components in a particular business
application an especially useful region
for monitoring the performance and
availability of JVMs for IDM targets
this is system availability and
performance information for different
components of different systems access
to web logic domains as well as charting
capabilities for key metrics it's also
worth noting that business application
is its own Enterprise Manager target
type and therefore has access to the
typical menu items that most targets
have including metrics status history
incident manager control capabilities
and configuration and compliance as
mentioned at the outset really one of
the key features of business
applications is the ability to mix and
match different regions depending on
each users unique job requirements and
we can perform that operation by
clicking on the personalized page option
within
business app the process of
personalizing a page is straightforward
with an enterprise manager customers can
both add content by clicking the add
content button which brings up a list of
all the regions that are available to be
imported and utilized within the
business application as you can see
there are numerous different regions
that can be leveraged including regions
from jvm Diagnostics metrics real user
experience insight service tests service
level agreement dashboards and summary
regions as well as system statuses
customers can simply add these regions
to their home page and then move around
their regions to suit their own unique
unique needs once the user is satisfied
with both the type of regions that
they've imported as well as their
location on the page they can save their
changes by clicking close and those
regions and their location will appear
whenever they access a business
application this concludes the screen
