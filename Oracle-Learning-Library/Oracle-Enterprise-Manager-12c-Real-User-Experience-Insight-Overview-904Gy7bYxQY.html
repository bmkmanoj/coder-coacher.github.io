Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo 6 in this unit we're going to talk
about really user experience inside the
product designs to monitor and measure
and user behavior and user experience as
people browse your applications
we'll start today's demo at the
dashboard a dashboard is location where
you can publish multiple reports as one
either inside of real user experience
inside or publish the dashboard
separately each and every report in the
dashboard is constructed out of the data
set you access the data sets by touching
the Browse button as shown right now as
you go into those data sets within a
browse data screen you are allowed to
slice and dice information any way you
like
you can change the time settings or the
period selections you could compare
reports from today against another
period in history for instance but there
is also a way to look at the information
that is given on a different angle now
we're looking at page user sessions we
could also be looking at information by
client OS or by client location we could
change our view from application
perspective to session perspective by
changing the data sets
once you have such a reporting your
certified what it is store it as a
report or export
let's get back to their dashboard we'll
use a predefined process like an order
process where you have to put something
into the shopping basket and then go to
an order process it's displayed on the
right hand side of the screen and we see
that the process not behaving correctly
we want to find out why so we click
browse again and it takes us into the
data data set on the second set it shows
a little red bar that indicates that
well that's that or on that particular
part of the process people experience
problems let's zoom into that and find
out which users were that the system now
selects all the users that were impacted
by that problem and we can just select
one of the sessions if session is
selected we get a report of each and
every step that was done within the
session by the user we have a complete
overview and we can see a screen my
screen we play by just clicking on that
little camera button it now opens up a
complete report which picture by picture
screen which shows us everything the
user did and everything that was put in
while they were browsing that particular
part of the application
another common use case is where the
helpdesk employees receive a call from a
user with little information like a
username or maybe an IP address they
have to find out what was going on with
the user while it was experiencing a
problem
so ruby allows you to do these kinds of
searches and use all attributes that
were just shown do a search and the
system comes back with a list of options
or a list of sessions that will comply
to that particular search in this case
only one was given so you can just
review that particular session we now
get back into session diagnostics and it
gives us a full report of everything
that the user did each and every screen
impression is listed in this view but
not only the screen impression is listed
also the additional information that
comes with it you can open up such a
page and it actually gives you
additional information about the URL use
your information about the server and
client but it also has a full copy of
everything that was presented to the
user as a request that responds all
information can be blinded of course if
either for security besides having the
screen impression each screen is made up
of multiple objects so we also lists all
the objects that we use to present the
screen the combination of objects
actually lead to a new screen impression
for each and every object we have
additional information about the role
arguments we also keep the ISA which is
a contextual ID we are used on oral all
Oracle applications that metalwork which
this is a link between what we were
seeing on the wire where a user was
getting a problem or senior problem
because one of the objects was actually
not behaving we can drill into the same
information using the ESET the
contextual ID and drill into the
Diagnostics page of Enterprise Manager
within that result we can see why the
JVM was not behaving at the time where
it was busy or what was going on at the
time this can
