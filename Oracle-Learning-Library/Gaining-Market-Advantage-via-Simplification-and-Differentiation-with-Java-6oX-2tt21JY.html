telling you a story I know it's pretty
late in the conference and what I'm
going to do is basically repeat and
somewhat reinforce the message of this
entire conference so if you're somewhat
tired in the day well when I was in
school in university to be exact I had a
really smart friend he had his first PhD
when he was 25 not kidding his first PhD
that ain't good bored of being a
mathematician and went on to be a doctor
but that's a separate story what as he
was working on his first PhD he took a
course which was really difficult one of
those where he had like 200 people
joining the course by the end of the
course there are 30 people there is the
Linnet and all those only maybe 10 will
graduate so they had an oral exam
because you have so few students it
doesn't make sense I've written exam
they had oral exam or Oracle and oral
exam that's a Freudian slip they had an
Oracle exam and he was last in row right
and of course his professor was kind of
completely frustrated with all these
stupid students that didn't manage to
pass it's perfectly nice and simple
course but he knew that my friend was
really really brilliant so by the time
he kind of walked into his office I
Peter you know what you know this stuff
right yeah I do he replied honestly he
didn't know the stuff let's just say a
and go have a cup of coffee right so if
you feel that you already know this
stuff maybe we should just go another
cup of coffee instead spares me from
talking in a spares you from listening
or maybe not so let's give it a shot if
you given our your attention I'll
hopefully be able to make it worth your
a little bit at least so my name is
hendricks tall as a matter of fact it's
still a line from sweden but i live here
in the US and I my head up strategy for
java Oracle Java ME and SC money and
have a seat don't feel that you break
the flow of my presentation they're my
colleagues so i can give them a hard
time
and about a year and a half back we are
two and a half years back we acquired
son and we went through all the IP that
we acquired miss on I try to figure out
what to do with it and about a year and
a half back I seriously started looking
into this general area of embed and
tried to figure out like what can we do
with Java ms field and what is the
overlap with with the Oracle Enterprise
Products and it was a lot of confusion
I've been programming embedded devices
myself I started out my career writing
small medical devices software for small
medical devices for medtronic long long
long time ago in some really crappy
assembler it was really painful and
since then I kind of moved to this
server side I've been doing a bunch of
enterprise stuff and then some JVM stuff
and I cannot come back to this and I
start seeing this these kind of
convergence and it like over this year
and a half it's made me really excited I
think we're on the brink of something
that can like change the way we live our
lives and that's what I want to talk to
you about hopefully I can share a little
bit on my enthusiast or you go away from
here and think I'm crazy either way at
least I entertain you for an hour
alright so if I can make this clicker
thingy work it's too difficult like it
needs Java to make it simpler to work
hello
come on wake up there we go I think I
managed to make something work at least
all right so what I what I'm trying to
convey here today and and what I think
the entire purpose of this or this
particular today mini conference is we
actually stand on the brink of the next
idea revolution and I believe firmly
that Java is the best technology for
overcoming the challenges as we enter
this revolution and the not only the
technology but also the Java ecosystem
is actually almost the only realistic
way we can address this fast enough as
fast as we would like because there is a
huge business opportunity here for all
of us if we can make this successful and
furthermore given that yahwah is in the
hands of oracle and oracle is strong
both on the back inside the traditional
enterprise side in terms of providing
infrastructure as well as now with all
the job IP parking but Oracle is
probably a very good way for you to kind
of quickly expand into this new market
now whether it's completely new to you
or whether you exist and just want to
grow your market and I'm going to try to
convince you that this is true all right
so let me start with something here
before before I kind of wrote radloff
this is my latest little toy a little
chip running java and and I have a great
make money fast scheme I think that any
one of you who is interested in doing a
start-up can make a million bucks clean
in a year and if you want to know more
about it come up and talk to me later
because that will not be covered in my
talk all right so it's very clear that
like internet is at its interaction i've
actually been part of this from the very
start I was very young fresh out of
school a few years before the internet
revolution really took shape and form so
I've been using it at my university like
many of you did but when it took off was
like when we got into the industry and
now this is a great thing to do for
relatively young student because you've
given it a lot of responsibility very
quickly and it enables you to work on
challenges by your own that you would
not otherwise have been able to work on
so clearly this has formed my generation
after internet came mobile which
probably has have even more profound
impact on our daily lives so I don't
know if you ride a subway to to work
which you may do if you live in San
Francisco maybe not so much if you're
another place in the US everyone's just
sitting and fiddling with our phones
okay it just it's so natural ye I gave
my my mother an ipod and just like what
the hell should I use this for well you
can talk to your kids when they're on
the other side of Atlantic do you think
it's the most brilliant thing under the
earth and of course she's willing to pay
apple four five six hundred bucks to
make it happen alright when these
revolutions in the industry happen it
shook the entire industry not only the
art in etosha as a matter of fact the
entire kind of business to its core
everyone hard to adapt and try to figure
out how to fit into this new business
now these are truest everyone know that
this is reality what I what I contend is
that the changes that we are now facing
will be faster than the two prior
revolutions and there will also be more
profound okay maybe more hidden maybe
not quite as visible but it will have a
very very real impact on our lives so
let's go to some what some of those kind
of high-level analyst thing is that they
throw around there will be 50 billion
devices by the end of 20 20 someone says
100 billion I don't remember it was 20
20 20 25 doesn't really matter the
reality is that would be huge number of
these devices we already have them
around us right but it will be huge
number of them all of them will be
connected that's the difference they all
be connected which will form part or one
gigantic network right they will
generate completely massive amounts of
data not each and every one of them like
but in total ridiculous amounts of data
and if you look at the amount of traffic
you talk about over network if you're an
operator you probably freaked out
because by far the majority of the
internet traffic that will be generated
will be these devices talking to some
kind of data center or cloud if you
prefer that so all good great vision but
there are some real challenges here just
a single one like how they do we manage
all these devices how do we manage them
just that one little question and you
immediately understand the complexity
that we face alright so my favorite
place is home I'm kind of boring I I
don't mind going out to a bar with a few
friends but I'd really like to be at
home and kind of play with my kids and
kind of pet my cat and enjoy life i play
my guitar whatever I do when I'm home I
don't particularly like the word smart
home to be honest I don't really know
whether I'm a smart person or not but I
don't really want the I don't like the
idea of my home being very smart I
prefer for the home to be pretty dumb
and do exactly what I tell it to that's
kind of how my wife likes me so what I
would i like my home to actually do for
me I there are some things I would like
my home to be able to do for me I wanted
to make my life comfortable I want me to
make things easy for me I think should
be natural I don't want to kind of run
around and do things are necessarily if
I can avoid it I want my home to help me
save money okay I don't want unnecessary
expenses I want to be able to preserve
the environments that I can go to sleep
at night and feel good about myself and
I want my home to keep me safe my home
is my castle now in Sweden you can't
shoot people that enter your home but
even so like the feeling of security
when you kind of lock your door at night
well this is my home it's my castle I
wanted to keep me safe and I want my
home to be safe when I'm not there so I
want all these things and all of them
can be built with technology or
technology can improve all leadings
things for us as clearly visible on this
slide which is not a new idea now the
real trick is what is needed in order to
make this come true well at the very end
of it if you're an engineer I like
myself what we really need is a
network of devices that do different
things now these devices will help you
monitor your home in different ways and
they will help you control your home
some of them will be built in right some
of them already exists but they will be
enhanced and more intelligent some will
be integrated in applies that you that
you buy whether it's your refrigerator
or a toaster or like a lamp switch all
of them will have to interoperate all of
them will have to have a long lifetime
like it may be okay to toss out your
cell phone after two years at least it
made apple richest company in the world
right but it doesn't work if you have
something which is mounted in your home
somewhere to replace it every two years
you don't want to do that you must be
able to control and monitor the data
flow like where does this data go who
can actually touch show these dr who can
make something happen to them well you
want it you need to be able to delegate
some of this to trusted suppliers if you
have a device that monitors your your
grandmother's heart rate it's great if
you can have that and like have someone
monitor at a distance so you know in
advance that something scary is going to
happen have the ambulance there before
she has a heart attack my father died in
a heart attack I wish it had one of
these I bet that they would have been
able to detect it I have analyzed that
before okay but you want to be able to
control that you don't want it to go to
a journalist or your neighbor right so
control delegation of control security
all these things all this can be sold
today you can ask matter of fact you can
easily build a home that does this I
know like I read a few years ago that
Bill Gates had it home fully automated
if you're rich you can do it but the
reality is very hard it's really hard
all right so the real opportunity here
is if we can make hard easy all right so
what is it that makes it this hard what
does that make it hard I'll take just
one example interoperability how many of
you were kind of tinkering with pcs in
the early 90s I'm sure did right
sticking this expansion
cards in the piece in order to actually
make them work and you kind of stuck
them in and he's turned on the piece and
everything was black and it beeped right
you have to kind of move these little
jumpers around and set the proper auto
interrupt the Nile ports and whatever
like memory address is pain in the ass
eventually they became a lot easier now
you go buy something from that and it
just works or a little mac book or
whatever they just work so it's easier
it's not perfect but it's a lot easier
but there's actually one problem that we
still haven't been able to solve I don't
know about you but every time I move I
have to unplug with my kind of stereo TV
DVD things and then trying to plug them
together and actually make them work
together I mean it's a simple problem on
the surface but he takes forever and I
swear and I cut myself on sharp corners
and my wife is very careful to not be in
the house the day when I try to do this
because it really ticks me off so
interoperability we have to solve
interoperability you can imagine trying
to connect an entire home it will not be
easy we have to make it easy all right
what other things make this difficult
devices will need to have a long
lifetime as I said we don't want to go
and replace them I have to know that
something i installed today will still
work 15 years from now I may need to
upgrade it in place because maybe
something changed maybe the FCC changed
some radio regulation I have to change
the kind of bandit which its works right
though it's a radical change sure I have
to rip it out to replace it because the
antenna won't work but if it's simple
change a software upgrade will do the
trick ok many of these things may run
off a battery I don't want to have to
replace that battery all the time I mean
it's annoying enough to have to replace
the battery in your fire alarm which is
only once a year or so ok so they have
to be able to run only with really low
power is that they can run for a long
time they're frequently hard to service
especially if they're kind of built into
your wall of course you can replace a
kind of a lightning switch but it takes
the time I have to kind of go on your
toolbox and bring out your screwdriver
and turn off the electricity as you
don't get a shock I it's hard it's not
like a cell phone so they're actually
very different and of course then we
have all the privacy concerns data
security I don't want my neighbor to
turn on
of my air-conditioning maybe kind of his
pissed because I felt that tree the
other year and now he's kind of playing
havoc with my electricity bill all right
and safety by some of these things are
dangerous right so you know you can
actually remotely program a pacemaker
okay I absolutely don't want my neighbor
to be able to do that okay so this is
hard it's harder than most other types
of development that we've done no
standardization is in progress and
everyone says well done if only we have
standards it will solve everything well
reality standards will actually get us a
long way it will help us a lot and are a
number of good initiatives across the
world of course one of the issues is
there are a number of them so then you
get back to this problem that the good
thing about standards is that everyone
has their own now some of the kind of
early adopters in terms of pushing
standards are the telco companies
because they see they've seen this
coming for a long time they've seen the
kind of issue with interoperability and
traffic patterns and so on and so forth
and they know that they need years to
prepare so they've been out there for a
long time of course they've been
focusing many on the issues that concern
them software companies have entered the
playing field in many of these standards
you have IT companies participate
because we're defining the software
stacks and of course you have hardware
companies because they have to help
define things like how will the radio
communication happen it's a very very
important question how are we going what
components do we need for security ok so
standardization great it will happen it
will happen in due time like it's making
progress now one of the challenges here
that if we think that standards will
solve everything we're very naive I
don't think many people have that
perception let me take one example
tcp/ip okay tcp/ip is a great standard
it works really really well out there
but you wouldn't say that just because
someone wrote the document you have the
first RFC in the IETF that that we're
done
they're really really hard work is
implementing it you wouldn't just pick
up the document they start writing in
the implementation from scratch making a
good tcp/ip stack is an enormous amount
of work okay so standards will get you
part of the way one of the main issues
that we have is also the kind of the
software lifecycle and the ability to
rapidly kind of customize things i would
i would claim that this problem is
largely solved on the enterprise back
end largely sold i mean we can always
tweak things and so on and so forth but
it's fairly easy to replace component a
component from a supplier with a
component from other supplier or to go
out in the market and hire a developer
you can train and fairly quickly get up
to speed on what you're doing and have
him or her being productive and on the
server side this was sold 15 years ago
okay alright so this quote I can't name
the person unfortunately it's a
brilliant quote even it actually sums up
the issue rather well today if you look
at a typical embedded device I know some
of you would argue that we've gone
beyond this but the typical in ninety
percent that depend the device it's a
single vendor that puts it together
built it the sinus and puts together
hardware some components from various
suppliers writes a software on it puts
it in a nice little box and go sells it
to the market once it's out there it's
not connected it'll just run it's
controlled so it's a one-off solution
that it works quite well in terms of
providing a function it's a coffee
machine it provides a good function so
that's great when when that can that
sums up your requirement but if you
really think about it doesn't this
remind you of something
okay computers were one of things a long
time ago all right so how can java help
this now I assume that many of you in
here are familiar with the benefits of
Java so is there anyone that will kind
of dire just shout out a name one no
reduce time-to-market that's an
excellent business benefit and it's
because you always very productive to
work in another one is portability okay
it can take java code and moved from one
device to another so write once run
everywhere right ones test everywhere
whatever you want to call it but if you
overlay kind of this slider buzzwords
that we've been well aware for the last
10 years with the previous slide that I
had with the challenges it's actually
you don't have to look very hard to see
that it's a good fit for addressing
these challenges it has the right
characteristics it allows you to target
the right and application ones and
target it for most if not all existing
devices as well as for unknown device it
will be here in the future it comes with
a lot of ready-to-use components the
core libraries are extremely rich right
so your developers don't have the phone
from scratch they can reuse stop that
someone else already made and there's a
vast ecosystem of ice bees open source
projects and developers that you can
really can it can allow you to reuse and
like if you have a need for a long long
long support lifecycle for java well
there are a number of strong vendors in
this place that will still be here 15
years from now including oracle so we
huge company our entire business well
not entire but two-thirds of our
software business it based on java and
it uses java which is a guarantee in and
of itself that we're going to continue
to enhance job and make sure it still
exists 20 years from now so betting on
java is a safe bet okay all right so job
is good at solving these challenges now
another observation I'd like to make is
that Java is the only standard space
platform that actually provides an end
to end implementation some other
or technologies can solve part of this
but Java can really do everything we
have the development story you can
actually use the same development tools
regardless of whether you're targeting
this little this little toy here all
right or whether you're targeting an
application running on a cloud server or
in your data center and everything in
between Java provides a common
management layer it provides security
components so everything you need in
terms of security I cryptography or kind
of sending things securely over by your
authentication whatever it is right Java
provides it and of course the
interoperability so leveraging something
like Java is it's almost a no-brainer
enables you to focus on the value that
you provide it enables you to focus on
the data because the value the value of
the Internet of Things the value of m2m
to the actual people are going to be
paying for it is the data so we here who
are part of building this will all make
a lot of money out of providing it
providing infrastructure providing
devices and so on and so forth providing
services of the values in the data all
right so what is java this is kind of
one of those moments where you may say
hey henrik let's just go take a coffee
because i order to know this stuff
that's fine but I'm still going to bore
you with it Java is fairly complete it
provides a virtual machine which gives
you an abstraction layer can run the
same program on any type of device has a
set of base libraries that enables you
to do normal things I oh right
manipulate data various ways we have
integration libraries that allows you to
very easily make your application
interact with existing systems all right
they don't have to be written in Java
they can be like because y'all are
pretty much there's an implementation of
every foreseeable protocol you can ever
think about is implemented in Java you
have UI and of course you have developer
tools if you break open this box you'll
find lots of like acronyms and buzzwords
and lambda
so this this is just an example by the
way a lots of components all of them are
tried and tested in the field are people
have been using them for years and years
and years so you can be fairly sure
certain that the quality is good the
components provide the function that
they're supposed to provide there is a
good process in place for like how this
is going to evolve over time and how
additional components go go going to be
added to the box and most of these are
almost all of these are standardized
which means that if you have a need to
create your own standard for your
particular industry I you don't have to
start from scratch you can leverage you
guys pick a version of job and say I'm
going to standardize on this that's what
blu-ray players did every blu-ray player
in the world uses a particular java
standard happens to be cdc one not one
no matter what it means the point is
that the company that that wrote the
provided real the movie real now well
birds that fly around in the Brazilian
jungle it's great moving my kids love it
they have some really cool applications
on their blu-ray disc and these
applications are written in Java it
doesn't matter whose blu-ray player they
stick that little their skin it will
work right and it's smart enough that
that little disc contains an application
that will actually go out on your home
network if you allow it and locate your
printer so from this little application
running on the disk you can pump print
postcards and coloring pages for your
kids that's a great example of
interoperability and because they build
Java into the standard they enable this
all right so to summarize the benefit of
Java it's a very productive development
environment we have historically done
like studies on this sponsored by us or
by IBM or by Sun saying that working in
july's it would take twice as as
effective as working in the native
language and that factors in the entire
software lifecycle so developing the
first application testing quality
porting and maintaining it over many
years my belief is that for
about the value relatively speaking is
probably more but we don't have any
analyst studies to prove that but I
think it's more it's very very
productive it runs pretty much anywhere
so other solutions are available I you
can go and run off with Android but
Android will never ever ever fit on this
little thing never runs java we can run
Java Nate kilobyte the RAM it's a bit
extreme but it works of course it
doesn't have all the same libraries that
you have on the bigger device but it's
the same language and the same tools
there's a huge ecosystem of developers
we frequently use the word nine million
I actually think it's like 9.5 and I was
someone I talked to said well we have
like twenty thousand developers in our
in our ecosystem for our products and
look quite happy about that because it's
a lot of people and they actually find
the the my ability to grow if I don't
have these 20,000 I can't grow good for
you i said i think that's awesome like
but i really want to i want you to be
able to grow faster all right so let me
introduce you to two my friend Bruno my
brilliant runs java user grew up in in
San Paulo in Brazil he has 45 thousand
members in one city one Brazil ok so if
we enable java developers to write
software of these embedded systems for
those of you who produce these devices
like you've just moved the kind of your
ability to grow two orders of magnitude
and believe me the java developers i
interact with here they really want to
do this i think it's super cool ok and
they really want to do it so this is
this is really can go talk to people i
bet you can recruit some people in this
conference and and have them like talk
to you seriously about writing java
software for embedded devices all right
and if you don't like oracle on
understand why anyone would not like
oracle well there are a bunch of
suppliers of java you don't have to get
it from us so yes we use the steward of
the standards but there are a bunch of
different companies that do this you can
get it from someone else so it's easy to
duel source so no login
all right but you say I am old all this
legacy native code I can't replace it
overnight so you're asking me to jump on
a new band wagon it will eat a little
bit more memory I have to re-educate on
my developers they're great developers
they're super efficient yeah I know
their native but like I've been had them
for a long time and they do a good job I
need to be able to reuse my existing
investment so how do I do that well it's
actually very simple Java has great
interpretive native it's very simple to
kind of leverage existing native code
from Java so today right a little
wrapper and then you can make direct
calls to your native code simple in the
future it'll be completely transparent
aiming to provide that and this is
something that we've been using on the
server side for 15-20 years right so now
this is new it's very well known problem
to solve now of course the full benefit
of Java you will not realize that until
you are all Java because that's when you
can stop thinking about porting for
instance okay so you'll get some benefit
in terms of development efficient in
terms of maintenance and so on and so
forth and when you move to old Java for
a particular device for application you
will see a radically radically improved
a kind of economy of scale for that
application all right so so great I told
you the benefits of Java now what can I
sell you cuz i wanna make you make you
buy my stuff here well to start with we
have java for pretty much everything and
if we grossly over simplify everything
you can kind of classify and by the java
in small medium and large I small this
is small right the Livescribe pen runs
java that is small cortex-m
microcontrollers is small like that you
would run something called Java ME my
creation don't confuse Emmy with mobile
it has nothing to do with mobile it just
means small we have a business with an
old name in the kind of medium business
this is what you use for like the Kindle
and for blu-ray players and so on and so
forth which has a really weird product
name I think I won't even try to
pronounce it here today
oj ec and then we have java SE which is
like the big sibling of java now moving
forward se is going to shrinking size
because of modularity and ability to
adapt what components you deploy and
Emmy is going to grow up a little bit
and so the meeting will kind of be
squeezed and small and large will be the
two deployments that would be there
there is an additional component which
is kind of interesting which is Java
card so Java card has been in the market
for about 15 years and it runs in almost
all sim cards in all the phones in
Europe and in the Americas or at least
North America as well as seen many
payment cards so mastercard visa
passports and things like that so it's a
little smart card ship and most of those
more smart card chips they run Java card
it's a secure operating system so why do
I even bring Java card up well it is it
is a generic runtime although it's very
small and and and even more restricted
than my creation the nice thing about
Java card is because it's so small it's
certified according to all the relevant
security standards so fips 140-2 man cry
teria or al or whatever you pick your
poison so Java card for the applications
where you need a really strong security
layer that is tamper proof right which
is certified according to standards that
you can get your products approved by
the banking industry or the
telecommunications industry or standards
bodies or for health care by the what's
it called in the u.s. if FDA okay I used
to do FDA certifications 15 years ago
really royal pain drama card is a
building block that will enable you to
overcome any of these things and reduce
your costs for building a highly secure
solution all right so Java already
exists it already exists for all these
devices so what is new well I'm going to
focus today here on the slightly larger
devices
and my argument is that in order to make
it really valuable it's not enough just
to have Java we need to get closer to
solving your business problem all right
and the business problem is to make
these devices more intelligent if you
really think about what you need to do
with these devices well to start with
you cannot always rely on them being
connected to a back-end okay depends a
little bit on what type of device it is
but say it's your your I don't know your
your air conditioning unit in home no
like if say it drops the connection with
the backyard well probably you'll have
some kind of a fail safe mechanism on
its current study so it doesn't turn off
the heat and your your poor little dog
kind of dies in the sweltering heat of a
can assess summer or runs amok and like
freeze is down your house that would be
pretty bad so it needs to be able to
have some sort of intelligence even even
when your back end is not connected and
furthermore one of the limitations of
this exploding Internet of Things is
network bandwidth all right so you will
have a gazillion on these devices and
there is no way the communications
networks can grow that fast so radio
networking operator networks or 3d 40
all of them are great but the reality is
we like we have a lot of innovation to
do before we have all this kind of
bandwidth we need within the spectrum we
have it's a finite resource to actually
be able to do everything we want at all
times it may never happen so what do you
really need to do is to make your device
smarter you need to be able to enable
your device to make decisions based on
small business rules or your own
personal preferences I want to create
the policy from my device all right so
as as now one of the things that we
believe strongly believe is necessary is
for for the slightly larger devices that
kind of our the gateways that control
and network night might be in your home
or in an industry building or whatever
writing in a car
you're probably going to have one or
maybe a few of these concentrators
gateways routers whatever you want to
call them that kind of our deep the hubs
of the wheel that manage things locally
and they are also that in order to help
you control bandwidth so as a foundation
for our strategy of products that will
help be building blocks for you going
into embedded we released to the product
last week one which I'm not going to
talk about in this particular session
that's the kind of thing that will make
you have a million bucks in here which
is Java ME embedded the other one is
job-embedded sweet so this is basically
it's basically a web server java ee
application server which has been
reduced to run on an embedded device
okay if you want it it's it's almost
like a data center in the box but it's
really really small data center so the
initial release well it contains a Java
Runtime great alright cause the contains
say a small version of a Java EE server
not full feature because you don't need
all the integration capabilities on an
edge device but it gives you the
capability to web pages to do some
messaging it has web services support
for interoperability need and so on and
so forth you can easily imagine one of
these running in your home and you
deploy a web application to it and then
that web application controls your
lightning and then it has a web page so
from your your iPad you just connect
over the web to your gateway new
controller lightning from the web
application on your iPad very simple and
also have a built-in persistence layer
which is necessary well in order to kind
of store state for your applications in
addition to cache data in case the
connection to the backend is down for
the time being so from a strategic
perspective this is almost like exalogic
if you will or Exadata is all the
functionality would ever need in a box
but in this case it's just a middleware
stack you build the device we put this
thing on the on the device and then you
write your business logic
now what developers do you need to build
an application for this well it's
exactly same developers that what you
would use to build a web application and
no offense to our developers here but
they're like a dime for a dozen like
they're very easy to could hold off and
which means you don't be in a
specialized skill set all right almost
done you really want that million bucks
so what ask you are embedded sweet
provide well it like again everything
except the Java implementation itself is
Java so it actually runs on all devices
it has a very very small footprint well
for an application server stack so the
initial releases is a few tens of
megabytes we're going to reduce that
footprint while retaining the
functionality to maybe 20 megabytes it's
remotely manageable because you can't
employ multiple applications on it so
you can technically be multi-tenant so
it basically it's the base foundation
for an application running on one of
these gateways now we have an aggressive
roadmap for adding more features to this
and enhancing the existing features and
of course as I said making it even
smaller this is available today I read a
great blog from a journalist on the
technology newspaper that kind of read
about our announcement and had a little
plug computer in his home and just
decided to give it a spin so he
downloaded it he put it on this device
and he put an application like trivial
hello world application I took him four
minutes including the download time four
minutes pretty impressive he was happy I
was happy because he was happy all right
so say you want a user interface
graphics well in some cases you may be
use your smartphone or your or your
tablet and then you're good because you
can use web or a nap on that thing
that's fine in some cases you will need
graphics maybe it's a wall-mounted
screen for something it's a touchscreen
built into I don't know your printer or
or your AC control unit or a little
medical device or something you actually
want this to be fairly advanced but
maybe made this screen is an appliance
of some sort it would be kind of nice to
be able to play an instructional
you own the screen itself so how do I
like where do I fit in kind of detergent
in this in this washing machine play the
instructional video right you may want
to be able to access a web page right
maybe maybe this little thing it would
be great if you could kind of connect to
my support database you have little like
error reported from the machine and that
error well when you created a machine
you don't actually know exactly what can
cause they so maybe you have something
in a manual good that's a good start but
it's even better if you can have a live
support database based on kind of
support bug reports from your actual
customers your consumers in the field so
you also want to have web support from
this little thing so the the
requirements on these user interface you
won't touch right all the requirements
are very much the same as you would have
on a modern tablet or a phone or
something like that now we have this
javafx technology which in its current
incarnation has been in the market for
about a year and it's really a
next-generation graphics framework which
fully leverages the hardware graphics
capabilities in modern platforms so if
you go buy a chip from freescale or
Qualcomm or whoever right it leverages
the full extent of hardware you can get
great performance and a really really
good user experience in even on a very
small device developers love it it's
easy to build applications it's easy to
maintain and you can keep the design and
separate from the code so it's really
like all these things that you would
have wanted from a framework does exist
in javafx released an early access for
java on arm sunday last week and if you
need a production version today contact
us we can build one for you and support
it until we have the standard product
out on the market sometime next year
number of really great demos of this
technology down on the showroom floor go
try it out it's pretty impressive all
right so now I'm going into the kind of
Oracle hat Oracle mode let's say you
want to build an end-to-end application
it's not just about writing the software
for the little thingy device right
want to build the end to an application
well were you going to need some sort of
infrastructure right either you roll
your own or you go in host somewhere
else amazon Oracle cloud whatever you
want you probably need some sort of data
store its database or a no sequel
database right you need to be able to
analyze and visualize and sold as a
fourth this data you're going to need
Milberg components to manage the
business transactions capture the events
that are coming in make decisions on who
should be able to allow to do what okay
and on the device itself of course you
need to be able to collect and manage to
date and have a run time that you can
deploy things too so all these things
taken together are building blocks to
create an Internet of Things application
it looks complicated well the good news
if is you can get it all from from one
wonder if you want to so Oracle does
provide all the building blocks for this
and it's not that difficult even better
news is that if you have not to like
Oracle well you can very easily replace
a layer here with a building block from
someone else as long as you pick the
base technology which provides we use
you can mix and match or you can get
everything from a single vendor it's up
to you right on the back end well of
course the Internet of Things Mary's
extremely well with the entire movement
to the cloud because one of the
challenges you are facing is how do i
scale my back end when I sell but
gazillion devices oh let Amazon solve
that problem for you or I mean Oracle
cloud solve that problem for you there's
no more from corporate here so i can say
amazon all right so to summarize going
back to kind of where I started right I
truly believe that we stand on the brink
of the next idea revolution I really
believe this and the simplicity of the
things is what's going to change it it's
going to be really really simple
connectivities are prerequisites it's
there so what we need in order to make
this happen is simplicity to get
simplicity I I firmly believe that
is the best technology for overcoming
all the challenges in this market in
terms of hardware fragmentation in terms
of operating system fragmentation in
terms of being able to reuse your
developers okay ask these gross write it
one limiting factor will be the ability
to buy off-the-shelf components because
you don't want to spend time on that you
want to build solutions and services
that you can sell to your customers and
I believe that the Java ecosystem is the
only realistic way to address this
growth fast enough and I'd like to
reiterate at 45,000 number of Java youth
group members only in San Paulo in
Brazil only in one city the number of
developers at Cole Java is larger than
the number of people in Sweden which is
a country I come from that's it's a
massive number and from a business
perspective well Oracle has a number of
these bits and pieces we have a partner
ecosystem man oh you in here are part of
our ecosystem if you partner with us it
will enable you to more quickly expand
your business into this new market so go
take a look at Java come talk to us we
want to make you successful by making
you successful we will be successful and
we will together change the market okay
I want to see this happen because i want
that smart home and i want to make a
million bucks thank you very much
