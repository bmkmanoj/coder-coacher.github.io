Enterprise pack for Eclipse Oh II PE for
Oracle cloud is presented to you by Tom
again thank you Peter hi my name is Tom
again in the next series of webcasts
I'll be doing we're going to take a look
at using the Oracle Enterprise pack for
eclipse Oh a PE with Oracle cloud in
this particular webcast I'm going to
look at or my show you how to configure
eclipse using the OE PE download and on
the next slide we have our standard
Oracle safe harbor notice basically it
states that this webcast does not imply
a contract between us and then what I'm
presenting today should not be used to
make any purchasing decisions but to get
the most out of this webcast I do assume
that you have some experience with
Eclipse IDE and ideally some experience
developing with Java Enterprise Edition
but if you don't that's ok
I think this webcast will give you a
feeling for it clips as an IDE as I'll
be walking through it I want to talk to
Oracle cloud and in particular we'll be
using the Oracle Java cloud service for
this webcast I have installed Oracle
Enterprise pack for Eclipse version
twelve point one point one point two you
can get to the page where the download
is either through the Oracle cloud main
page which will show you or by going to
the tutorial example that covers this
particular topic so I have installed the
local enterprise type for Eclipse I also
have installed Oracle Java cloud service
SDK a software development kit and I'm
going to be using a trial instance of
the Oracle Java cloud service which all
again I'll show you as we go through the
through the tutorial
what I want to do next is spend a little
bit of time talking about clouds so I
probably heard the word clouds in his
there's definitely a buzzword in the
software industry and clouds come in a
variety of different flavors there is a
there is a infrastructure as a service
for
IaaS cloud software as a service or size
as a AAS and platform as a service or
pads Oracle cloud is a platform as a
service type of system which means that
it provides specific application
platform services including database
platforms an application server platform
your local Java cloud service here in
the in the center of my screen and those
services provide specific types of
functionality or capability to you as a
developer so with the database you can
create database applications you can use
Oracle's application development
framework ADF components you can write
applications that use web services
including rest and one of the other
capabilities of the Oracle cloud that
has a built in identity management
system which provides capabilities such
as authentication and authorization
services and with all of these services
you can create applications that you can
deploy for web access for mobile access
and even connected to other clouds or
use it internally you know as an office
type of application so it's a fully
capable type of system
in the Oracle by example tutorial that
is the basis for this webcast as I
mentioned you'll be able to find a link
to download the Oracle Enterprise pack
for eclipse the software runs on a
variety of different operating systems
including windows 32-bit which means are
running on XP and also on Windows 7 as I
have right here you can run it in Linux
and even Mac OS the download includes
eclipse you know version 3.8 K Java SDK
a WebLogic server instance specifically
the WebLogic server 10.3 at-6 instance
and the oracle ADF components which i
will show you in another webcast so the
process for configuring OAP for use with
Oracle cloud is just fairly
straightforward once you've downloaded
the software you install it in this case
here in order to save time I've already
gone through the installation process on
a system like Windows that like I
mentioned that I have here you can
download all the software under similar
tree so for example on this machine I
have it all installed under C colon
slash so EPE
once it's installed and you start in the
your Clips instance CoAP instance you
can then add an instance of what logic
11g the 10.3 ethics server that ships
with or it comes with the download will
add that to our Eclipse IDE as a server
and then you can add your trial instance
of Oracle cloud as a server as well so
when this webcast what we're going to do
is we're going to look at the process of
setting up a weak PE we'll also run some
tests
software in the two locations locally on
our logic server instance and remotely
on our cloud instance okay so let's go
to the demo for that I need to share my
desktop ok so as I mentioned I have
already started my ofe Eclipse platform
but what we need to do in the next step
is to create or add on the two servers
that we want to use with this IDE to
this to the IDE itself so to start with
go to the server's tab in the IDE and
click on this link that says new server
wizard and you begin by selecting the
Oracle WebLogic server instance that
comes with the download so the one that
I'm interested in particular is or
CoreLogic server 11g there's a reason
why this one ships with this particular
download the 10.3 dot 6 or 11 11 gr one
instance of Oracle WebLogic server is
the same application server that is
currently used by the cloud so this way
you can develop applications locally and
test them locally on a local instance of
WebLogic server and then push them up to
the cloud knowing that the two servers
are compatible so I selected the Oracle
WebLogic server instance I'm going to
click Next I need to point to where the
software is installed as I mentioned
that's actually in my C Drive
specifically it's in sequel and
so I select WL server underscore 10.3
which is again is included than download
and therefore was installed into this
directory so we'll go through the
process of making sure that it's a valid
WebLogic runtime form some checks also
locate the local instance of the JDK
that was installed again in the download
now notice that there are two server
extensions provided with this instance
of WebLogic server oracle EDF 11.1 dux
6.0 again this is the version of ADF
that is supported by Oracle cloud and
Java persistence 2.0 so there's actually
an EE 6 technology but we have the
capability of using it with this
instance of WebLogic server so now is
the time we want to actually install it
it's just a little trickier to do it
later so I'm going to click the install
link next to Java persistence 2.0 so
take a little bit of time to install it
and now it's completely installed so now
I have my two server extensions
installed PDF and GPA to doto so the
next thing I need to do is actually to
create a specific domain I don't have a
domain directory yet this is a fresh
install so I'm going to click on this
icon over here that allows me to create
a new domain
okay and it knows where to put the
domain it simply asked me to give it a
name sort of test one I'd like to call
it the main one but I'll leave the
location alone there are a number of
different extensions that you could add
the one that is required or one that I
highly recommend that you include are
the Java required files jrf files so
leave that checked and click finish
takes a little while for the development
or for the creation of this domain as
it's actually copying over and creating
all the files required to the domain
takes about a minute or so hopefully not
that long so you don't have anything
else running
there we go that's creating the
executing the skirt to train the
environment variable setting the main
password creating the main space itself
so it seems longer when you're running
it as a demo okay so not only it has
successfully created my domain for me
put it in as my default domain directory
and then I took the can and simply can
click the finish button at this point
and now I have added a an instance of
Oracle WebLogic server 11g r1 to my to
my IDE so let's go ahead and start this
instance so I'm going to right click on
it and select start there's also a good
way to test to make sure that the
installation was successful in the
console tab the number of messages will
spit out specifically what we're looking
for just for the status to change from
starting as you can see down here
starting and then it will change to
standby and eventually to running and
here in the bottom window here we have a
we have progress let's take that for you
you can see that the progress either of
the throwing so it's at 90% now a few
minutes a few more seconds of the column
a completed
okay zoom in from standing sand boy
again it's still in starting mode for
93% and in just a minute or two or not
that one Jib will go to running these
are one of the two things to take a
little bit of time
besides the download which takes a
little bit more time
95% - done there we go okay now we have
successfully faded into your running
mode and if we go back to our service
tab in just a second we'll see that the
status will move from starting to
running and it will be it will be
complete okay there we go alright so the
next thing that i want to do that is
since i have a local instance of Oracle
WebLogic server running at this point I
would create a little test project to
make sure that it works that I can
deploy to it that I can run applications
in it happen to have one already created
so let's go ahead and import that
project this project by the way just one
of the projects is included as a sample
in the SDK I also have it in the
tutorial itself I'm going to import any
existing project into the workspace
I have this project located in the C
colon dirt
I put into the temp directory oh I don't
see that's in dirt okay
and I'm ham in the thumb loop structure
there it is okay so this project is
called Ajax guest number it's a simple
JPA project this point I'm going to
import this project into the workspace
for the IDE I can copy the project in
which makes it part of the workspace
directory or I can leave it where it is
at this point I think I will go ahead
and copy this into my workspace
you know select finish it's just a
question of where the files live so now
it is copying the files over from where
I have them originally in the doubt in
my downloads directory
I now have them in the workspace
directory so they can let's take a look
at this little project first of all I
want to show you the the web.xml file
for this particular project
okay so here is nine like this a little
smaller get so this is my web dot XML
file this indicates whether things I was
interested in showing you is that this
file indicates where the welcome file is
or the file that will start when this
application is started and that file is
B if the space is flash Ajax greeting
dot HTML so this is a Facebook file it's
going right here that will be launched
first so open that file up and take a
look at it one of the nice features of
Eclipse is that it provides a visual
view of what a Facebook might look like
not exactly what you see is what you get
but it gives you a pretty close
approximation of of what your file is
going to look like when it's displayed
into the browser so this has a graphic
up here that's what the graphic
indicates a heading that says hi my name
is Duke I'm thinking of a number between
minimum and maximum can you guess it do
enter the number here press the submit
button and then there's a response so
looking at the code itself it's a very
simple
facelet again it has a it has a there
are two tags it does the work of
actually displaying the title an input
text field where people will put in the
number that number is then sent to a
being a JSF Manish beam where the value
will be evaluated when the user presses
the submit button and this particular
piece of code also has a little Ajax tag
on it which renders a message based on
the results of the user's guess and
looking at the actual
man it's being itself we open that up
for you as well again a simple managed
bean session scoped some values that
indicate the number that entered by the
user that I usually indicate the minimum
and maximum for the gap and then the
response was rendered based upon whether
or not the number is the number that was
randomized the actual number that we're
trying to guess or whether it was not
enough now we could have done a little
bit more code here to say it's too low
too high but this is a very simple
application so again let's go ahead and
run this in our server I'm going to
right click on the project and then I'm
going to run it on one of my servers in
this case I only have one I'm going to
run it on my local instance of world
logic server
this is a little slow probably because
of the WebEx here we go so the only
server I can choose is to actually
submit it to my local or logic server
instance so this press finish will to go
through the process of deploying this to
my load logic server instance again down
here in the bottom we can get a status
on that deployment right now it says
it's publishing at 0% and then this will
go up and what will happen eventually is
a browser window will open in the idea
again another nice feature of eclipse it
has a built in browser and that browser
will open as soon as the complication is
completely deployed because I'm running
this application locally I also have
access to the output from the console
systems out so in the bottom here I hear
my little cheat code so Dukes number is
7 so if I put in 4 and press amend I'll
get that message saying that that answer
is incorrect if I attempt to go beyond
the minimum and maximum are I will get a
validation error from my beam and
finally if I enter the actual value I'll
get an answer saying a 2 got it correct
so we know that this application now
runs it is an application using JSF
and HR and that application running on
my local instance of what logic server
so the next thing we want to do is to
add an instance of Oracle Java cloud
service to this IDE let's go back to my
service tab here I'm going to right
click and what I want to do is to create
a new server instance this one of the
capabilities of PD is that a
it provides all the necessary add ons to
make this ID capable of working with the
Oracle cloud including adding Oracle
cloud as a server type my cloud
instances are not on localhost so I
think what I'll do is just call that
cloud it doesn't actually matter where
it is or maybe I want to put in let's be
more specific when we put in the name
you know something that makes sense with
data center or something like that it
these are just the types of types of
servers that we have where they're worth
where potentially they are located so
moving on to the next screen we'll get
some we need to put in some information
about my cloud instance before we do
that let me actually show you my trial
instance and talk a little bit about the
one of the instance on an instance of
Oracle Java cloud service looks like so
here for example is the the home page
for the Oracle cloud cloud Oracle comm
and the user interface for the cloud is
this web interface if I were to sign in
I could get access to my current
accounts for those of you who are
interested though in in an account but
you want to try and what you want to do
is to actually request a trial account
and once you come to this page you can
click on this button in the middle that
says try it and request a 30-day trial
subscription to any of the cloud
services that are currently available
the one that I'm using is this one right
here the Java cloud service this Java
cloud service includes and
of Oracle database cloud service so this
particular service comes with two
components and Oracle WebLogic server
instance and an instance of the database
which is useful for probably 95% of the
applications that you want to create
likewise you could just create or just
select a database service if you wished
which would give you an instance of
Oracle 11g release 2 with that you could
create applications that use Apex or
other applications that use the
databases in some other way and looking
at you know the rest of this page there
are other types of services available
some are available for trial and and
some are not
we sign in to my service so you can see
what it looks like when you apply for a
trial account well one of the things
that you will receive after your
application is accepted is you will get
access to a specific trial or art or
specific domain identity domain and you
will provide credentials in this case
I'm going to provide my email address as
my username and enter my cloud password
and then sign in my trial cloud service
actually is shared with some other folks
I actually have two instances of
database services database and database
two and two instances of Java cloud
service Java and Java 2 let's look at
what a Java cloud service looks like
again in the cloud using the interface
so right now I'm loading or looking at
all the applications that are currently
available in my Java cloud service there
are a couple of applications that are
running that are active in the cloud
service is also a number of information
there's information about usage and so
on there's a log which will take a look
at in slow
but so there's quite a lot of
information that you can access through
your cloud service browser so going back
to my IDE what I want to enter them as
information for the connection that I'm
going to make to this cloud service are
all the pieces of information that I
received in my email for my trial
account so my identity domain is trial a
BW e the Java service name again sent an
email and on that web page is Java in
lower case I am the administrator so I
put in my user account I'll enter my
iCloud password and I need to point this
connection to my local copy of my SDK
which again is under mine under that
sequel and oep directory sorry now I put
in that different directory I installed
it under sequel and Oracle there it is
Oracle Java cloud SDK once I have all
the information populated I can test to
see that I haven't set fingered the
password or have something incorrect
this is also a good way to test to see
if your firewall will allow connections
through to the cloud in the tutorial
itself I have some information on how to
use proxies with your cloud connection
so let's go ahead and test this
connection and I got a success so we're
good to go
so click Next
the name is fine although I don't really
need the chat data center so check that
out and click finish ok and here is my
instance of Oracle cloud I has a server
on my in my IDE so now that I have an
instance of the cloud I can take this
application I don't need to make any
changes to it at all
I can go ahead and deploy this
application as is directly to the cloud
so I simply have to right-click on the
application select run as again I'm
running on a server and this time I want
to select my Oracle cloud instance 10
select finish again during the process
of deployment to the cloud I will get
some status messages down here in the
bottom right corner it takes a little
while as it goes through the process of
creating the jar files
asking the jar files over to the cloud
but just as with my local instance what
will happen is when the application is
successfully deployed it will attempt to
start it using a local instance of a
browser in my IDE so we'll just wait for
that for a couple more seconds and here
is now being that this application is
behind or in my cloud and behind an
identity domain one of the things I have
to do is I have to sign it
see this little better
so again I'm going to enter my user
account name password to my account and
when I saw it in the assuming that I did
that properly I get right to my
application now here I don't have the
benefit of a of a console there is no
system that out capability for clouds I
do have access to information about the
deployment so let's take a look at that
before we try and run this application
I'm going to right click on Oracle cloud
and I'm going to take a look at all of
the service jobs all of the processes
that this deployment went through and
the information went from my IDE up to
the cloud makes us a little embarrassed
you can see it it so here is my
deployment
there we go here's my here's my
deployment okay so I deployed it 724
1138 and Eastern time zone this
information about the deployment log
indicates that the deployment action
started the deployer went through the
application of pushing it up to a logic
that action was completed the deployment
was completed successfully prior to
deployment not the cloud actually ran a
virus scan on the war file before was
actually deployed to the application
server and that virus scan completed
successfully and actually prior to that
the application was tested against a KPI
whitelist there's more information about
these specifically what is covered in
the lie list in the documentation for
the cloud but there are certain things
of the cloud specifically does not allow
you to do creating other instances of
GBM accessing system resources that sort
of thing things that make sense you know
given that you're running an instance of
a complication server remotely a Santa
Claus the other piece of information
that I have if I have problems in the
deployment or if there was a problem in
the running of this application I could
take a look at the instance logs these
are things that happened during the
deployment of my or runtime of my of my
application in this case I don't have
any these are showing messages from
quite a while ago from little June of
2013 if there were problems this is
where the problems would show up
relative to to the
application alright so now I have a
running instance of my application that
I can test to see if I can get the
number here for is not correct let's try
7 maybe it's 10 - okay fire one of those
numbers between 1 and 10 is correcting
so when you watch me go to the painful
process of trying to figure out what it
is all along I'll pause here and suggest
that there are some next steps that I'd
like you to consider you can run this
tutorial again by going to Oracle comm
flash you ll and I think that URL will
come up again later in the webcast
request your own 30-day free trial of
Oracle cloud again I recommend the Java
cloud service even if you don't know
whether or not you plan to do any
database to go on the book it's just as
easy to ask for an instance that has
both the WebLogic server instance and
database instance and then go look at
this tutorial or any of the other
tutorials quantum Oracle cloud and we
also offer tutorials on using the
JDeveloper IDE and NetBeans IDE with
cloud as well so let's go back to the
slides I just see a question from
Antonio yes you can use JDeveloper
instead of eclipse
in fact cloud supports connections or it
supports a number of different ideas
specifically Eclipse through the OE PE
gig and Oliver and I do have a number of
tutorials in the or
learning library on using G developer
with Oracle cloud in fact it's very well
integrated Antonio the version of
JDeveloper that I show in the tutorials
but you don't have to do any
configuration at all out of the box T
developer comes with all of the
technology you need basically to to work
directly with cloud thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
