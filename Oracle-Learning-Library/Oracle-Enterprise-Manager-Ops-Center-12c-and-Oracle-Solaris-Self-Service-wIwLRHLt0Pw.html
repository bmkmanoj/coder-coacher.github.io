let's dive into the product I'm going to
begin the demonstration from a
self-service point of view I have a user
Wilson and he's going to log in and see
a completely different interface than
say a cloud administrator has a business
user I just want to see a very clean and
simple interface when that's been built
from me well that has my environment my
choices laid out for me in a predefined
manner Wilson has three cloud choices
that he can work with today it's going
to work in as ERP solution very easily
we can see what resources are being
consumed and allocated in the ERP
solution cloud can drill into the
various memory storage and cpu usage and
see very quick summaries we see the
penetration into the allocated resources
we can go across the tabs see the
network allocations we can see which
virtual servers have already been
deployed in this case we're working with
Slayers own technologies underneath I
can see the private V nets that have
been allocated i can add IP addresses
request IP addresses view the IP
addresses that have been assigned to me
whether they be public or private I no
longer have a lot of network choices
that I have to run through my
administrator has allocated out 44
addresses for me to play with I have my
storage penetration how much storage I
have left how much storage i have used
what my virtual servers are using in
terms of memory size cpu sighs i have
life cycle control of them i have
templates incidents jobs let's go back
to the vserver page coming back to the
virtual server page I can see the
actions I have has a cloud user I can
create a v-net I can create a virtual
server can shut down my servers I've
life cycle control doesn't matter what
the underlining virtualization
technology is gets their zones on x86 or
spark ovm x86 I have a very simple and
clean use
experience with that virtualization
technology where the technical choices
are not exposed to me let's let's very
quickly create a virtual server here we
create a weblogic app server I choose I
would like to have high availability
choose my template I have a choice of
extra large large or small my cloud
administrator has set up what storage
CPU and memory numbers will be associate
to that small mainland large choice I
can come and choose the private VN
entered public v-net I can choose dhcp
based on those IP address allocations or
I can specifically select an IP address
here as I use these IP addresses that
removed from the list for me the next
choice is my public key just like on a
lot of the popular public cloud services
I'm going to control this with a access
key my access key will allow me to do
life cycle functions on my virtual
server and here we have my Slayer zone
being created just finish successfully
we can go back to that virtual server
summary page here we can see my app
server has been created we'll see it in
the list of virtual servers I can stop
it I can start it I have complete access
let's switch over to see from a
application to disc point of view
whether or not that app server ended up
in the right spot in my application
services here we go to the SCA
production dashboard for my spark
enterprise cloud I click on my warehouse
management system I can see all the
components that make up my warehouse
management system the web server the
balancer and lo and behold there's my
app server exactly where I wanted it to
end up in my application suite nothing
can build out clouds like Enterprise
Manager to do this function of passing
between the infrastructure and the
application layers very rapidly now
let's switch over to an administrator
view the cloud admin he goes back to the
same login page based on his roles he
has a completely different user
experience he sees the entire
infrastructure and can dig in to that
infrastructure and anyway he seems fit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
