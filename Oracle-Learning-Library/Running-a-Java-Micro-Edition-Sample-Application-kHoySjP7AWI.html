curriculum developer for Oracle today I
will show you how to run a sample
application using the Java micro Edition
software development kit to get started
go to start programs Java ME SDK and the
interface will open choose a sample
project to open from the sample project
section such as the LW UI T demo
double-click the file and it will open
in an emulator I'm going to resize this
emulator and rotate it by 90 degrees so
it fits better within the recording area
you can use the arrow keys of the
emulator to navigate through the
features of this sample application
click the center button to run the
feature for example I'm running the
animations feature if you click this
button you can view a help file that
describes how that feature was written
click that button again to toggle back
to the animation and when you are
finished viewing that feature click the
stop button to go back to the main
application use the arrow keys to
navigate through other features of the
application here are the fonts these are
the fonts that are available within this
sample application click the stop button
to go back to the main application
screen note that once the emulator is
launched it is an independent process if
you close the project the emulator
continues to run
to stop the emulator you need to choose
application exit or you can press the
on/off power switch for the emulator
some emulators simulate a touchscreen in
the main interface under the device
selector expand the CL DC node and
choose CL DC phone one right-click on
the phone and choose run main project
once the emulator is running you can use
your mouse button to navigate through
the various features of the application
select one of the features and click the
center button of the phone to open that
feature this feature is the video
feature which also includes audio to
navigate back to the main screen of the
application click the back button choose
another feature to look at this is the
animated Giff feature
choose application exit to close the
emulator to explore the code in the
projects window expand the project file
name and go to the source packages
double-click one of the files and it
opens in the editor pane
now that you are confident using the
Java ME software development kit you can
create your own application see the
videos and tutorials at Oracle comm
slash Java ME</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
