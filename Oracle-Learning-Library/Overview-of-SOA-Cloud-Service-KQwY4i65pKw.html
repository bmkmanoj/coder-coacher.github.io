platform for running Oracle SOA Suite,
Oracle Service Bus, and Oracle
Business-to-Business in the cloud.
Oracle SOA Suite includes a complete set
of service infrastructure components for
designing deploying and managing
composite applications. Oracle Service
Bus provides capabilities for service
discovery and mediation, rapid service
provisioning and deployment, and
governance. Oracle B2B enables the secure
and reliable exchange of business
documents between an enterprise and its
trading partners. When used within an
Oracle SOA Suite composite application,
end-to-end end business processes can be
implemented. Oracle SOA Cloud Service
provides access to cloud and on-premises
applications through a variety of
adapters. Cloud adapters like Salesforce
and RightNow; on-premises adapters like
SAP and EBusiness Suite; and technology
adapters like FTP; AQ; JMS and Coherence.
These and many others are included. You
can quickly create development and test
environments and Oracle SOA Cloud
Service. You can transition existing
on-premise production workloads to the
cloud, reducing on-premise costs to run
and maintain the service. You develop
your application, as you always have,
with on-premises Oracle JDeveloper. You
can then deploy and manage your cloud
applications with the same browser-based
tools that you've always used. Each tool
works the same as it does in an
on-premises environment. With Oracle B2B
create guideline files, design Oracle B2B
transactions, deploy and monitor trading
partner agreements, and create and deploy
SOA composite applications. And now the
best news. You can virtually &quot;lift&quot; and
&quot;shift&quot; your on-premises SOA Suite
environment into the cloud and let
Oracle manage it for you.
Oracle SOA Cloud Service provides a
full suite of developer tools, flexible
deployment, and simplified management.
Instead of spending time on platform
building and maintenance, developers are
free to focus on
innovation. Thank you for watching.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
