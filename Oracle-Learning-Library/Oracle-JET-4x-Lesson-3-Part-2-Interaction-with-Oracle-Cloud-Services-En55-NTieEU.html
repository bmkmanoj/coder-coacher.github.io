third of the three weekly lessons about
oracle jet jet is a free and open-source
front-end technology that fits into
Oracle's cloud platform jet is one of
our echos application development
services it exists to support the other
services in particular to provide a
front-end technology on top of back-end
services any services and Express rest
interfaces are very well suited to be
backends for jet applications though
there are Oracle cloud services that
interact with jet in addition to the
ones listed here these are the ones that
we're going to be focusing on in this
part of the course Oracle mobile cloud
service or MCS is focused on letting you
quickly and easily develop backends for
mobile applications including
applications created in jet therefore if
you're creating a jet hybrid application
and you need a back-end for that
application then MCS is a very good
solution for that as is the case for
other Oracle cloud services there is a
very rich set of documentation that you
can consult as well as many YouTube
clips that help you get started with MCS
the community around MCS is also very
active and there are a number of blogs
that helped you get started to correct
mobile backends that you can expose and
then consume in your jet hybrid mobile
applications for example here you see a
jet application that starts up and
connects and authenticates to mcs it
accesses a custom API through the mobile
backend the custom API accesses a
connector that references the open
weather map API on the internet the
custom API receives the post goal and
connects to the connector which then
does a get call to open weather the
native response received from the open
weather map API has a lot of information
that you don't need and therefore MCS is
very useful in enabling you to design
and tailor a custom API to match the
response to your business
a related topic is that of chatbots
jet applications integrate very well
with Oracle mobile cloud service
backends that explains chat bot
functionality the next Oracle cloud
service we're going to take a brief look
at is the application container cloud
the application container cloud is very
useful if you're exposing rest via Java
is e or node.js
among other platforms and languages from
a Java point of view you don't always
need a full Java EE container to manage
your services instead you can develop in
Java SE on the desktop express rest and
then serve up that service from the
Oracle application container cloud
similarly if you want to create a
back-end in node.js you can expose that
service from the Oracle application
container cloud and consume it in your
Oracle jet application on the other hand
Oracle Java cloud service or JCS gives
you full enterprise grade functionality
in the cloud enterprise level security
high availability and performance of
business critical applications in other
words a standards-based full Java EE in
the cloud is provided by the Oracle Java
cloud service next if you are planning
to express rest interfaces in particular
in the context of working with the
Oracle database then a technology to add
to your stack is the Oracle rest data
service a RDS take a look at the Oracle
rest data service site and again at the
related YouTube clips at the
documentation and see if this fits into
your stack in the context of Oracle DB
another interesting technology to look
at in the context of jet is the Oracle
visual builder cloud service or V BCS
BBC s is created in jet and produces jet
applications however instead of hand
coding your jet applications as you have
been doing throughout this course with
VB CS you drag and drop the widgets into
the browser once the application is
complete you can deploy it directly from
the browser into the Oracle cloud and
make it available to your users a
typical user of vbc s is a citizen
developer or a business developer in
other words a non-technical developer
who wants to put together an application
representing underlying data in the
Oracle cloud a very important concept in
the context of vb cs and jet is the fact
that you can extend vb CS via jet once
you have created c CA components which
were discussed in the previous part of
the course you're able to upload them
into VB CS to extend the VB CS pellet to
add new items to it and to enable the
end user to drag and drop items created
by you and jet into AV BCS application
in this part of the course we have
investigated a range of different Oracle
cloud services and related technologies
in the context of jet jet is a front-end
toolkit for back-end services and each
of these auricle cloud services and
technologies provides back-end data that
can be integrated quite easily and
naturally into Oracle jet applications
for your homework investigates a couple
of these Oracle cloud services in
particular the Oracle mobile cloud
service the Oracle application container
cloud service Oracle Java cloud service
and the visual Builder cloud service try
and find out more about them online
investigate related blogs and further
information set of trial accounts were
applicable integrate the output of these
services into your jet application while
also investigating the relevance of vb
CS in your context with that as always
we thank you for participating in the
course on oracle jet and we look forward
to seeing you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
