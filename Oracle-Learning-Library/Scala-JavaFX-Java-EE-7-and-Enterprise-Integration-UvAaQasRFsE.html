talked about Scala javafx java ee 7 and
enterprise integration and what we are
here to do what can we do about it so I
my name is Peter prog rock and i am a
java champion i am an independent
contractor and i work normally with
investment banks in the city of london
UK yeah and I've been developing Java
since 1998 and 1998-1999 tes 1988 and
yeah i'm a former jug leader as well
scholar so Scala is the new champion I
think of the JVM platform Java is a
object functional language and james
gosling had this thing to say about it
if I were to pick a language to use
today other than Java it would be
scholar and that is because ja Scala is
a yeah it's a beast with two heads it's
both an object orientated programming
language and allows you to use
functional concepts so scholar has a lot
of important features and as well as
classes you can write classes that you
have instead of statics you have
companion objects you can have function
objects function objects what is coming
in Java 7 well almost if I think about
it and function objects means that
functions are a first class citizen so
you can pass objects through call
another but you can have a variable
which is a function and you can pass
that lambda functions to other methods
in a sort of delayed execution so it's
really useful for library writers
and then Scarl also has some features
from pattern languages I should really
ask how many people read eNOS Carl or
functional programming languages here so
our fear number so this is bread and
butter to you oh so yeah pattern
matching matching is as a feature found
in lots of functional languages like
Erlang Haskell and ml and closure if
anyone's done any closure on the JVM
also groovy groovy has a functional
programming of a sort and so as well
Scala having that it has proper mix ins
and mix things are like interfaces on
steroids actually so interfaces can have
methods abstract methods where's in Java
they cannot go in Java 7 that they would
java 8 rather they will have default
methods or defensive method methods let
me get my wording right here and the
other thing that scholar has is a great
deal of thought has gone into the
collection classes so as well as your
usual friends as in Java of this maps
and and the other thing Scala has its
own collection which is divided into two
types actually immutable types and
immutable time this means that you can
program it safely without destroying the
items in the collection and also
immutable immutable types means that you
get the same behavior does you have in
in Java claw collections and then our
proper scholar the immutable collection
classes are really that so they and are
really too efficient in memory so the
list this
collection is quite really good for in
the functional sense that you can pre
pan when you prepend to an item to a
list it be operates in constant time it
is really useful for certain algorithms
and the scholar allows you to write
really good libraries sorry so I wanted
to say something about the adoption and
really this is a talk about I guess a
business talk rather than a technical
one there's some technical parts to it
adoption for me has been a little bit
patchy it's been increasing slowly I
think because we have it as I would say
myself that people have been afraid to
adopt scala because it's been seen us
being complicated and but you know there
are people who are willing to take the
risk and it's those people who are
willing to be early adopters that to a
language like scholar then have want a
faster return of investment so they
willing to to go with that language
because they don't have the the
employees a massive a number of
employees or the legacy technology to to
contend with then I think scholar also
is well scholar is also about the only
viable statically compiled programming
language and the moment and but that may
change over the coming years and of
course if your business does really is
invested on the Java Virtual Machine and
the platform
you really probably don't want to be
programming in Erlang or Haskell at the
moment or they'll leave in that the
platform so it's a continuous invention
investment her in last year at the
beginning of last year I had this little
notion to create a chart of where I
fought the whole polyglot seen on
programming and the JVM was going so I
fought Scala would be have that really
nice sweet spot of being ready for
adoption and of course that we already
know it is groovy there's a Jay Ruby and
phantom another's and this is probably
different dis graphs probably not
accurate to the United States it's or to
the UK there's some groovy adoption less
JRuby or Ruby adoption and practically
no phantom so yeah depending on which
locale you are living in yeah Nisus this
is it and so the what this graph says
this it's emphasizing what the JVM has
this portable network of boom and has
secured it off the free pip pillars of
the JVM platform that all got us excited
in 1995 although it wasn't me of course
I was still doing C and C++ at the time
so M now and what I was trying to
suggest there that it is a core of
languages around that run time and we
are all going to be developing
increasingly in a polyglot fashion and
last year I came up with a a projection
all projections are meaningless because
things can change Microsoft could
release their successor to java and
we'll be all doing something different
so this chart is really de-emphasizing
those three pillars of java they're less
important of course we got portability
we got network ability in other
platforms like JavaScript and nodejs and
other things and we've security is less
of a concern about this the the vectors
of progress are about ever increase in
performance on ever on hardware we we
have CP or CPU and GPU cores are
graphical processing units or three
thousand cause and we have no where we
actually uses utilizing them and Scala
being a more flexible language allows
you to write domain-specific languages
and martina dusky thinks or is
researching how to get more from these
cores as other people are so that is the
joint research project between the etf
oh and i guess its berkeley down the
road from here so this is how you
declare a scholar function and it for me
it when i first looked at it it was more
like Pascal so you have your name of
your verbal field first and then you
have the time and some people disagree
with that a certain Stephen Coburn
disagrees with that and I shrink is
right because your scholar has type
inference that means sometimes you can
leave off the type of things so for
example you can I can't walk come on all
right the return type is of this volume
price function is flown and that doesn't
that float doesn't need to be there
Scala will probably infer that as
actually being a double so and bit if
you're a library right and you're going
to work with other people it's probably
best to us to declare the right return
type
a question was as there is that
potential ambiguity as it there is in
power yes there is the esto is indeed
which means that you should be explicit
and prefer to declare the return type
yeah any more questions ok i will carry
on so scala being object functional
supports the notion of higher-order
functions so again this is bread and
butter to the people who already know
about higher order function and
functional languages and i didn't know
this i'm being a oo baby since the early
90s and uh huh functional languages over
my head I don't want to know but as I
started to read more of the press the
industry press and I and Mia imagine
that's why you're all here to understand
and learn what's going to come down in
one year from now I had to say well
maybe I don't really want to learn that
erlang or house girl but I've got time
to play around like Java I want to stay
with the JVM platform and then okay 2009
I actually bought this car intro into
scholar book and the thing is it just
SAT there because doing Java effects and
doing something else at work and helping
the investment banks make money so it
wasn't until I did a course then in
London that ok he's starting to make
sense when you learn from a master I'm
digressing here this isn't meant to be a
java ee integration tool when you watch
martino dusky actually cold air is in
emacs and he's run running these
function i can't keep up with him and
it's all over the head for you for those
functional bread-and-butter guys who put
their hands out they'd probably be
laughing they could probably imagine
that what happened there but I I'm
getting there and it so which I should
explain some of this so
this is an example of in this collection
instantiating the list in and Scala
where an Scala is in firming the time of
that excess this which is a list of
string parameterised type and the zip
with index function is a higher-order
function which iterates all over the
elements of that Miss collections and
maps it to a tuple up here appear if you
come from the c++ where we have only two
values and a very simple data time and
which is the string and also the index
of that of where you are in the list
collection so Apple is associated with
in-depth 0 plum is associated with the
index of one orange is it associated
with the index of 2 which is what you
get out in in the comment blank lines
there so scholars very much like Java in
support him the double slash comments ok
so that's enough of scholar and then
yeah the alphabets you probably could
work out by now and oh yes so yes so the
other part should really explained for
the benefit of the recording that
zipping to list together obviously gives
you the ability to have a competi
necklace together and you can also have
a li a list of a collection of list
collections and it's a important
function in functional programming
supporting the idea of monads monads
anybody well they're flattened flattened
in a list it's very important in that
world but you learn it if you choose to
do it
the thing about the JPM wish I actually
absolutely love is the choice you can
afford to then stick with Java and
that's cool you can not decide you can
stay with it java 7 and then Java 8 will
be okay and your part and you can then
probably find that you like dynamic
languages and then you can work with
groovio or JRuby or something else or
even closure if you're inclined so it's
a choice thing where it comes down to it
is the business the business dick takes
most of our lives and has done for
several years so and this is perhaps our
own for we gave the business a word a
very thick rod to beat us with and
spring Spring Framework solved a very
good problem in in years gone so anybody
here remember Java 20 j2ee are few
people and did ejb did you actually do
ejb one or ejb 22 ok yeah one 1 &amp;amp; 2 well
you probably remember entity beans which
were and I remember a Swiss unnamed bank
that they had an ejb project there and
that was my first encounter with that
world and then Along Came can spring
framework and dependency injection and a
bit of what's that I'm the people sort
of understood it but didn't get it and
it took me a while so dependency
injection is there basically it's the
Hollywood principal for the beginners in
the audience where I am The Hollywood
agent I'm going to call you you never
call me at all it's set to give me a
lambda function
and I'll call you so dependency
injectors frameworks look after the
lifetime of the beans and the closest
relatives to springing into being
framework I'll see juice and seem and
contents context and dependency
injection frameworks of the par such as
Avila net anybody who uses a balloon or
hard code maven guys properly struggling
with and maven writing maven plugins
anyway so I did go to aggress again so
there's there's a bean containers
lifecycle management the spring
framework also has lots of api's rapper
I api's for jdbc jpa there's even a
model view controller framework that
it's really good good for the time it's
a request orientated framework in
comparison to a component orientated
frame whereas that was the case for
tapestry that's how tapestry was a pet
Apache tapestry and javaserver faces
worth were described at the time and of
course if you're very brave enough you
could do some aspect orientated program
to enable cross-cutting concerns so I
doubt many of you have come across
spring integration and I certainly has
so spring integration is an interesting
byproduct of the screen world and the
addresses enterprise integration which
is middleware so order processing
systems transaction management and
customer order in warehouse order in
things like that probably how you get
your Amazon invoices or whatever you do
on ecommerce sites are probably for a
message system and it comes from Gregor
hope his very famous book
to risk describes basically is the Bible
of ea'ae enterprise application
integration and it's all about channels
method tunnels transformers you can take
a a feed from somewhere something it
like PayPal PayPal put send out to an
xml staff sheet transform and get some
different results you can split messages
into two and aggregate them all together
you can even we sequence messages and
it's a really useful way of like
building a message system and it can go
both directions as well so spend a good
part of the couple of months working on
a propriety implementation that worked
with the spring integration framework
there's also camel and what's great
about upside about spring and i should
say is the xml and it means that before
business or independent software vendor
or consultancy they can provide their
classes in a jar and then to the
customer wire things up using xml and
it's still the preferred way even though
they're things like CDI and contents in
dependency injection and obviously
spring integration doesn't have its not
standardized this there's no java
specification release for this or at
least i don't know there is nothing ever
being standardized and because pats then
demand isn't there and spring
integration the competing ones are
servicemix apache camel i think that's
an Apache project they do similar things
as well and of course spring integration
and the last time i looked earlier this
year they didn't a scholar a scholar dsl
of course camel already has and supports
dsl escala dear sir dsl domain-specific
language so that the interesting thing
is materialization and I think there are
busy there are businesses that have
invested in osgi the de facto standard
even though there are others possibly
Apple of us where it's the main guy in
town and the reason I think well the
reason I believe that businesses like
this is because it affords some kind of
protection for modules and reduces the
risk and so that I guess other
developers you hand over a product over
the wall as a jar and then that customer
could be suddenly decide to lie i'm
going to do my own thing i'm not going
to pay you any money as a consultant i'm
going to start programming against your
thing and they have every right to do so
yes so and it's also a protection inside
the business the the vendor then knows
that two different parts of the software
development organization and I call up
NetBeans that they have different osgi
plugins and if you try to access a
something in a module an osgi module
which is not declared as public then it
fails so it is a so there are good
reasons for static moduli and modularity
I'm not quite sure about dynamic
modularity because for everybody just
restarts the server at one point
i yes and the modularity is obviously an
only enforced by the osgi class loader
and they are things that haven't been
ported over not really osgi conformance
I comment log in and the spring source
had a big porting ever effort to have a
spring DM server it's bring an osgi
server they fought that hope that was a
great push I'm not sure what the status
of this of it right now having said that
osgi is it's not a replacement for what
in in my opinion for what's coming in
jigsaw which is not going to happen now
until 2015 so it's not the osgi doesn't
solve the JVM packaging problem of
chucking away or breaking up the JDK
well the java runtime and of course
ultimately you want modularity to be
sorted by the thing that the pizza base
the JVM and that would give you really
good things so let you be able to have
different version of the Java platform
I'm just repeating what Mark Reinhold
said in his talk okay so but the fingers
with skull I like it all the statically
compiled languages and this would apply
I guess to salon and quite cotton in
that they also could integrate because
it runs in a Java platform you could
call any API that you like whether it
makes sense to do so I don't know
because what some be what people would
do is they start program and programming
against this API in a in their favorite
language and it doesn't feel it feels
you know unfamiliar if it's
uncomfortable
also i'm going to my pimp my api frame
thing and put a a scholar rapper or
Stallone rapper to make it more salone
like or scholarly so I'm being pretty
open because the platform is open and
that's my opinion we go all going to
have to learn to live together and of
course i have my favorite which is the
scala as well as java okay so question
probably for me um the chief technical
officer walks in in the morning and that
spelling discs are laughing what do you
think well i've already had this sort of
conversation but how to not give a CTO I
think Scala is going to make it the
adoption is going to be a lot slower
question is how do you integrate it with
java ee where you can use it with java
ee just like any API that's out there so
juggling EE 7 is no longer we focused on
moving to the cloud in fact it's been
repositioned as html5 CSS free and web
sockets enablement so it more whereas
java ee 5 was about ease of deployment
and this year's javaone it's more yeah a
step back and i instead of trying to
standardize in the way that we did in
with ejb to which was top down and they
got it so badly wrong then hi rod
johnson i can write this better i'm
going to have used this dependency
injection i'm going to have clay no
obvious I'm these guys don't know what
they're doing so I think for me the Java
the repositioning of java ee 7 without
the
platform as a service requirement is a
really good thing because yeah the
providers don't cry no or where there's
no consensus and of course that's what
it means for you guys that's what I
would advise I would say yes if you
really want to move to the cloud yes you
can do that but is no standard there yet
so be careful how you architect your
solution we have the knowledge that
there are certain parts of it that could
be vendor locked in that could be the
same you know and this is the case for
anything it's so f EA if you get in bed
with spring integration you're stuck
with it you can't then move to apache
camel and you can't then or unless
without we factor in and then change in
your code base and if you get tired of
that and you want to move to apache moon
it's the same so wherever thing you
invest in you really need to sit down
have a word with the chief architects
and come to consensus there and I guess
that's what it means for the average Joe
and Jane of course that doesn't apply to
you because you're here it's lovely
javaone conference in your learning
things oh yeah so yeah no wonder they
cut it down well I guess robber J of
Java EE but that would be the ignorant
thing to say and did it is a lot in a
standard in Java Enterprise Edition to
force that there's lots of things to
implement and I you probably cannot
reduce light at all it's well there's a
batch processing there's going to be
bean validation there's a CD i canta
currency dependency injection some of
these things are probably not relevant
anymore it's this things there that are
going to be new like Jason
j catch has been revised which may be a
good way to standardize or avoid locking
maybe of a memcache if someone provides
a Java interface to it and yea and so on
of course there's old things like Java
messaging system javaserver faces if I
think yeah the other guests are lots of
people who use serpa faces in America
not so much in the UK I'm not are people
using server faces javaserver faces yeah
so there's a fair number four and this
probably I bet are you using something
like primefaces or icefaces yeah so it's
yeah see half its uses and there's
obviously a restful services or Jax
Arguelles and Jackson WS and but the
most important thing is the CDI which
has came out in EE 6 I really do like
that so spring versus java ee 7 so this
came comes up a lot when really it's a
misunderstood question really I spring
framework has its own container per and
has some for number of years investment
banks depend on it and use it they have
no problems and they probably stay why
should why why do well I want to get rid
of spring and you could say reason well
let's now whether you're its vendor
login but but then there's other things
if they suddenly decide to use spring
data or spring integration then then it
makes it more attractive to stay with
the spring platform and the real
question is can I use these two things
together in
in harmony and that's going to be the
consultancy or the contractor ours if
you really want to do it it's your money
mate you decide what you want to do any
questions any questions I should know
yes okay and there's other things in
spring that spring DM I've already
covered and until java ee 7 for me is
the standard it's still the way forward
for the vendors to cooperate together
and as well it gives you a target to aim
for and yes you somebody could say hang
on a minute do we really need is java ee
stuff because it's so big where the
answer to that is more perhaps more
profiles and you know I for to answer
the cloud question two years ago I
thought it would be a cloud edition
which will be a separate thing
altogether this would be new AAPA I
api's aimed cloud platforms so in it
sort of does not surprise me that yeah
with innovation and experimentation and
customer interest in flex it doesn't
make really good sense to standardize on
on a moving fee suppose we will repeat
the same mistake though in j2ee 1.2 with
ej bees and and the wrong and not being
using dependency injection or plain old
java beans and of course that's what
that is what CDI and java ee mandates
these days and into the upper thing says
factors outside of even spring and Java
EE now if I'm us Carla show me I'm gonna
I've got a brand-new I'd am going to
start a start-up tomorrow how do i do I
really need this um Java EE ei might but
if you can live with and you're happy to
experiment and you know things like you
happy to take the risk of total n play
and oh I spoke to a guy today says a car
is really good then yeah you can go for
it and yeah as more industry stories
come through to and are successful in
here that skull has been successful in
the Twitter and at this conference and
there was cme group which was about a
trading engine and i thought that would
be something in java next slide the guys
showed I forgot his name his name is
Wendy something something he showed me
showed us a slide hey my trade my
matching engine is implementing in Scala
and I and it talks to our MongoDB
database as it were fantastic so if
there's a use case whether it's a
million-dollar a billion dollar company
or a small company you can find it you
don't really have to go to the java ee
route and offering for the rest of us
who work with spring framework and a
daily basis and don't mind it's it's a
toss up from pottsville with new
projects experimental projects you could
say yeah let's try this to see if it
works and it's for me feels a little bit
more complicated than when java server
pages was first announced and everybody
wrote spaghetti pages
put all the code inside the server page
and then Craig McClanahan invented
struts now that's the way to go I put
all my actions in Java and then i will
move or dis present to dislodge it from
the presentation and it goes into the
forum beans and I have more actions
feels like that this gnome kind of clear
winner here well I covered some of this
so java ee 7 a yeah platform of the
surface is the new wild where some it's
it hasn't been tamed people are not
quite sure what to do dared in order to
standardize it and i'm sure oracle and
red hat and patchy will come to some
ideas the property TL elephant in the
room here which is amazon web services
and they why would they want to
standardize they may decide to change
the 91 and their these things as i said
innovation and how we deploy how do you
automatically desai the site and say are
while I'm I ejb really means to the
mountain tennis multi-tenant on some
column or maybe your customers who live
in some continent and all begin with the
letter S I I want to be able to scale
from 10 to 100 servers and these sorts
of things haven't been defined yet but
they will be and maybe going forward
there as it pans out it may I hope it
won't be XML hell I hope it will be a
some way of configuration in that that
we as developers can say Neil in there
so for to give an example of that so CDI
contacts and dependency injection is
great and you can use it on the server
side
and so you can spin up your replication
server cool and have something in be
injected into one being that depends
another being but there's no CDI
container for java SE yet and so there
is Apache what is it ejb and there's
obviously weld which comes from where
tire and you have to explicitly use one
of the other then i think maybe there is
a an open-source api out there that
conveniently wrapped the two together so
i'm not going to go into platform as a
service and SAS and I information
infrastructure as a service I'm this is
then an attraction to the business then
managers so Java ease a question that
the cloud providers as I see want to
provide some modicum support for people
who have worked with Java EE is usually
who jpa and bear with some limitations
obviously and eventually platform of the
service will be standardized and I had
some things to say more about the
management if they decide so if you have
a manager he's been really invested in
Java is to get it's going to be really
hard to tell him or her that you should
chuck away discharge her stuff right now
it's impossible why so and you know
standards are good standards are great
start java ee is a great and will be a
great standard it it really does focus
and the vendors to collaborate to build
solutions and and really going if you're
moving to the cloud i suppose in java ee
eight you really want standards to work
because you're
if you're not unhappy if your cloud
provider in 2016 you damn well sure want
to be able to migrate to another cloud
provider surely they might cost you
cheaper electricity or something like
that so you want that portability and I
think that's going to be Powerman and I
said I don't know but I hope that's
where it is what should we say to this
lion management guys in your business
trading systems at a set bank I don't
know I'm still don't know the answer is
there yeah you probably can work with a
private cloud but because you'll have
really you're going to come on the
regulation you probably don't want to
host all important where's in Amazon Web
Services you rather probably do
something on your own spend some money
one and have a private data centers
which is and not proper cloud i guess
but there you go and and at this point
i'm going to finish the presentation a
so i think the first thing that will be
attacked will be standardization or new
sequel no sequel providers and so there
be a few there that I think our core web
tab will talk to on MongoDB that's a try
and ascertain how can we get what what
is the common denominator there what are
people actually doing and as those
industries stories as you guys in
evitable II will start developing
software out of maybe by coincidence or
maybe you have a great idea and then the
manager does work walking tomorrow and
say this is what we're going to do in
2013 it comes in monday morning that's
it so that it will resolve itself
and yeah sure people who want to do the
bleedin engines on scar low or whatever
language or Caitlin or salon we are
welcome to do it but this is where I
disagree with some of the rhetoric I
think spring framework is good it's old
a definite business need and I think
spring where framework is here to stay
I'm sorry because they are going to be
businesses that don't want to migrate
they are going to stay with the spring
container and you could talk to them
about CDI and all the benefits until
you're blue in the face but they're you
pay the money and if they're happy
that's fine but at the same time java ee
will improve improving addition upon
addition and so there's no worries
really there and thus i conclude my
presentation and end f if you want to
continue and with the discussion or
perhaps with me yourself or with ideas
because this is where it is all over to
you so thanks for coming

good or what's your opinion on spring
framework it's broken proven yes I sort
of I think spring framework is
definitely proven and yeah so what would
you improve on it can it can sense what
Johnson has left can it be innovated
anymore is it no now I think yes it's
going to go into upper areas now as in
spring data and obviously spring
integration will probably continue and
on that front yeah so if there's no more
questions on feel free to come and do
