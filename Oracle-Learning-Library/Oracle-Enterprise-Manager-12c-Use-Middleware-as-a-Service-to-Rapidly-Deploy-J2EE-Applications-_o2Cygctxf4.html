Enterprise Manager 12c to build and
deliver a cloud for middleware services
in the section you will see how a
developer can log into the Middleboro to
request cloud services for Middle where
you're looking at the home page for
developers logged in cloud self-service
portal for Enterprise Manager on the
left hand side you see notifications and
usage of cloud resources on the right
hand side you see the current list of
middleware services that have been
created and the requests from the past
you also see some other tabs here for
example my library and this tab gives
you the list of applications are ready
to be deployed to this middle bear cloud
you can upload these applications from
your desktop by using upload facility or
using API and publish them directly
through your build process there's also
a chargeback area where you can view all
of the many's that you owe to your
provider based on your cloud resource
consumption for each of the cloud
services that you create you can see
different kinds of free source
consumptions and of course you can also
see the cost per unit for all of your
resources so let's go back to the home
page and drill down into some of the
services that already exist let's go
look at this first one here as you can
see the middleware services page gives
you detailed drill down off the health
and availability of the service as well
as the applications deployed to the
service on the left-hand side you can
see the performance summary the
performance summary for the JSP and
servlets in this environment as well as
JDBC connections as well as the resource
usage for each of the servers that are
part of this environment if there was
traffic through the environment you'd
also see response and load times
aggregated across the entire traffic
flowing through this Java service right
now we have a single application
deployed here you can see the URLs by
clicking on the test you are here and
you can manage the entire lifecycle of
this application using the controls
offered through this portal start/stop
deploy etc these will also be made
available through a command-line
interface the self-service portal also
allows you to create data sources to
help the application can
with the database these database
instances can be made available via the
database as a service functionality
enterprise manager or you could connect
to another data source of your choice
this makes it very easy for you to come
in and deploy any applications and
connect them to data sources that they
are required now let's take a look at
how you create a new service instance
you simply go to the request service
button here and request in your service
the system gives you a list of choices
and these choices are published as
service templates that have been made
available by your administrator from the
enterprise side since my needs are small
i will go pick a small java size service
for my requirement today and select the
template now I can name my service
template to anything that I want I can
say my small environment for QA since
I'm doing QA here or if I were doing a
production environment I could have
created a new large service and use that
I also have the choice of deploying an
application to this environment from
this wizard let's say I'm going to
deploy my hello world application here I
can choose the component from my library
which you already saw earlier it had
been uploaded and if I had a deployment
plan to configure this application
further I could upload my deployment
plan in here as well and I simply click
Submit this will create a back-end cloud
request that will orchestrate all the
resources necessary for building the
environment as well as deploying the
application to this environment so in
one shot without having to worry about
servers machine software etc you get
your application up and running and
that's how platform is a service makes
it really easy for you to get up and
running with your applications also if
you look at any one of these
environments these environments can be
scaled up and down based on your needs
so if you needed more resources in times
of peak loads you can simply go here
let's get it up by a single node or
multiple nodes and if your needs are
less you could scale down this
environment by one or more nodes the
system dynamically allocates resources
to scale up and down the environment
making it a very very elastic
environment for you to deploy your
application
and get your work done as you deploy
more applications and as you consume
more resources your usage changes and
your quota keeps you in check you can
never consume more resources than your
Cora making sure that any one user in
the environment will not completely
bring down the cloud and as you consume
more resources the system keeps track
off your resource consumption as well as
charged back so again for the
applications that you're consuming you
can see what's going on what any
applications and how much you owe or
