Cloud Control 12c demo series focusing
on the best practices for or upper bi
applications management the screen watch
is a part of a series on service level
management or slm for obiee applications
in part 2 of modeling we'll show you how
to create the generic services in a.m
top see the user recorded the pis daily
transaction model me the service
involves four steps first step is to
provide a name of service second step is
to importing the open screen third step
is to associated beacons to the service
final step is to review before
generating the service let's start off
creating the service to create the
service go to target and selective
services and in the service menu click
the creep and select the generic service
test basis you wanted to choose the test
based in air service because we are
using the open script to record the
transitions on the Oracle bi application
provide a name of your service so in
this case i would say bi slm and select
my time is on next select the test type
as a test transactions and again provide
the name of your service and i'll just
select the production frequency time as
a five minute as a default and i'll
upload my eight HD file which i have
created in the previous steps using the
open screen so go to my VI folder and
select one of my 80s screen and click
continue
once the script has been uploaded you
can see that the squib information has
been populated click Next third step is
to associate the beacons to your service
click Add button and select the beacon
that you wanted to associate to this
service so let's select my bi HQ asthma
become for this service and click Next
so lost is just the review of your
service once you're satisfied with the
input that you provided click finish
button once the service has been created
you will show the status as a pending
one way you can find that the screen is
working you can check by going to
administration and select the service
test and beacons in this step you can
run a service test to verify the service
is working so click verify service test
and click the perform test once the test
is done then it will bring the status of
your farm service and what will be the
total time and connect time and all the
information that is needed for your
preference so we know that this service
is working then we need to create the
performance and utility matrix because
the creation service only required for
step which didn't include creation of
performance or usage metrics to create
the profiles matrix go to generic
service menu administration and click
the province matrix select the based on
service test click go button in the
nature you have a multiple choices and
you can add one or more or all of the
matrix that you want to include on your
province matrix so let's try to add by
starting the status and continue
and you can put the threshold or for the
warning in critical and if you wanted to
add the multiple a matrix click go and
this time i will choose total time and
continue and provide my warning
threshold as six second now the notice
that the you need for the total time is
a millisecond so if i wanted to put it
as a six seconds for my warning i'll
have to put 6004 my critical threshold
all right there at eight second if you
wanted to add more our matrix you can
click simply go or if versus by with the
matrix that you have you can simply
click OK similarly if you wanted to add
the user to matrix go to administration
and click the UCD matrix here you see
that the one you say I cannot add our
usage in matrix because i have not
associated the system to this service so
to associate the system to the service
corps general service administration
system association and select the system
that i wanted to associate to my service
so for the system i select the target
target Oracle bi instance and select the
one instance that is associated with
this service click select now the system
is associated to disturb you I can start
to create a usage matrix based on this
system in the target I choose the target
that you wanted to create the usage
metrics for so I select the Oracle bi
server as my target and for the material
I will choose the CP usage and you have
also options to choose the user met you
from a specific component or aggravate
the measure across the multiple
components continue I can prove my
warning and critical threshold my cpu so
i'll provide a tea person as warning and
ninety percent for the critical similar
to promise if you wanted to add multiple
users images click Add button and select
the one that you wanted to create the
user T matrix for
so in this case I will select Oracle bi
scheduler as my target type and memory
use it as my metric continue and provide
my warning and critical threshold
similar to my a cpu usage if you want to
add more you can simply could add or if
you satisfy with the matrix that you
have click OK button once the province
of the new system matrix has been
created and have those threads going up
and running for a while you can check
the performance and utility matrix by
simply going to the performance and
instance tab here you'll see the
province metrics and usage metrics and
if there was a time that the either of
them has crossed the warning or a
critical threshold you see that under
the instance and problems tap down here
this concludes our demo of creating the
service and the metrics the benefit of
writings internet transaction is to make
the system proactively by running tests
periodically on the various locations
and evaluate the performance of the
synthetic transition next step is to
create a service level agreement based
on the metrics that we created in this
demo and generate the dashboard this
concludes our demo of modeling the
service test please continue to part
three of our demo of creating slm thank
you thank you for watching this
