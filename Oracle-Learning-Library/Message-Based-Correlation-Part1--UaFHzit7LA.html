developer at Oracle this is part one of
a two part video series focusing on the
use of message based correlation to
manage communication between two BPM
processes in this video I'll show you
how to set up correlation between two
processes in part 2 i'll demonstrate how
to use correlation when iterating
through a loop with process instances so
let's get started when a BPM process
communicates with another BPM process a
conversation is used to manage the
message exchanges between them the
business of making sure that the correct
response is received by the calling
instance is called correlation in most
cases a simple conversation as you see
here involving to process instances is
correlated automatically by the runtime
engine using WS messaging that is web
service message headers the conversation
used in this case is the default
conversation there are however some
situations in which automatic
correlation is not sufficient and you
must use message based correlation for
instance automatic correlation isn't
available when WS messaging is not
supported or when a participant enters a
conversation that is in progress having
only the data values but no information
about the conversation and one of the
most common scenarios is when multiple
threads of a process are involved in the
conversation such as when you're
iterating through a loop of process
instances in these situations you would
use message based correlation either in
the context of a named conversation or
the default conversation in this video
we'll be focusing on using message based
correlation with the default
conversation message based correlation
enables process instances to communicate
with each other within a conversation it
works by
creating one or more pieces of processed
data that represent the state of the
instance with a correlation key in this
way the correlation key is used to
identify the instance that sent the
response for example an audit process
recognizes a specific order instance
using order ID an inventory service
recognizes a specific order item using
the combination of order ID and order
item ID this is similar to using a where
clause in a sequel select statement in
this example a caller process sends a
message to a reusable sub process called
squaring process thereby starting a new
instance of the squaring process the
send request task in the caller process
initiates a correlation key that
contains a single property this property
is mapped to a process data object
called number let's assume that that
number has a value of five the squaring
process is instantiated when the
received requests task is executed
receive tasks can be configured to start
the process when used with a nun start
event as you see here the squaring
process received some data from the
calling process that includes number it
calculates the square of that number
delays execution for one minute which
makes it easier to test this scenario
and then responds to the caller from the
send response task returning both the
number whose value is still five and
that's square the caller determines
which instance of the squaring process
has the response it's looking for by
using the correlation key to match the
number value returned in the response
now let's look at this process in BPM
studio
here you see the collar process which
has not been implemented yet I've also
defined a data object a business object
called work which contains two
attributes number and square they're
both ends and I've also defined a
process data object of that type called
work now a work object is mapped into
the start event for the caller process
mapped to an argument called arg1 so
that's the caller process let's take a
look at the squaring process this is a
reusable subprocess the only thing
that's implemented here is the script
task which performs the squaring
operation on the number and the timer
event which creates a one-one minute
delay in the process flow which is
helpful to in order to test multiple
instances of this process and see
whether the correlation is working let's
go ahead and configure the
implementation for the receive requests
activity
I'm going to check the create instance
check box so that when a message is
received here it will create an instance
of the squaring process I'll also define
an interface which includes an input
argument that will call arc to this time
of type data work
and we'll go ahead and map that will
math arc to to work the process data
object
okay now looking at the sand response
let's configure the implementation for
the send response again it's will define
an interface that sends out an argument
so we'll call it output 1 and this is of
type same thing data at work
and will map out the work process data
object to the output one argument and
that's all we need to do for squaring
process let's take a look at the collar
process now and set it up to use
correlation and to call the squaring
process will need a correlation key and
the way to start that is to create a
correlation property so will it will
have a property called number of type
int
there you see it and will create a
correlation key that contains that
property will call it seek a number and
we'll select the number property for it
so there's our correlation key for this
in this conversation now let's implement
the send request task so that it will
use correlation and call the squaring
process I'm going to set the message
exchange type here to process call and
then I'll look up and select squaring
process and you notice the target node
is set to receive requests which is the
flow element that receives the message
now let's map the work process data
object from this process into the ark to
input that is expected by the squaring
process now let's define the correlation
I click the correlations link and I'm
going to select as property the number
property notice that it's automatically
mapped to arc to number now I'm also
going to click the initiates check box
to indicate that the correlation is to
be initiated with a value here in this
send requests task so whatever number
value was passed into this process at
startup will be the correlation key
value and will now set up the receive
response to receive the output from the
squaring process and to match the number
sent with a correlation key that was
initiated in this process
I'm going to select process call once
again squaring process and the target
note is send response now let's map out
put one from the incoming message to the
work process data object let's define
the correlation now I select the number
correlation property but I will not
select the initiate checkbox because i
want the receive task to use the
correlation key that was initiated in
the send task notice that it maps
automatically to output number
okay and that's all we need to do the
only thing remaining now is to deploy it
and test it okay I've deployed the
calculator project to the server and
then logged into enterprise manager as
weblogic to test this we'll click the
test button and select the service that
we want to run initially which is the
caller service in order to test that the
correlation is working will create three
instances within the one minute time
frame that the timer process is allowing
us and I'll start off with two for the
number value and I'll always use zero
for the square and then I'll go ahead
and click test web service which creates
the instance
and then I go back to the request tab
again and this time off for another one
another instance and this time I'll
choose three
initialize it and one more
this time I'll choose for
and test that let's bring the dashboard
tab back so that you can see the three
instances that have been created I use
the value to value 34 and value for so
those will be the correlation key
numbers for each of these process
instances so in order to see what
happened let's go ahead and click click
them one at a time and look at the flow
trace and here's the flow trace window
let's click the caller service and if we
select receive response and look at what
hat look at the payload for the time
when the instance left the activity
that'll show the result that was passed
in from the other process so you'll see
here that the number two returned a
value from the squaring process look for
so that matched up as it should have and
try the second one
once again I'll click the collar and
receive response and when the instance
lefty activity oops I guess I named I
gave that a 35 value instead of three at
any rate it returns a correct square so
it's talking to the right instance of
the squaring process let's go back I'll
click the next one here this one should
have a value of four for the number
and it did indeed return the right value
for the square of four which is 16 so as
you can see the correlation worked to
manage the kind of the three different
conversations with three different
instances of each process so i hope this
demonstration was helpful that completes
this video demo be sure to watch part
two of this series to learn how to use
correlation in more complex scenarios
