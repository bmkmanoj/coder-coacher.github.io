to SAS and on-premise to SAS
integrations in just a few clicks with
the integration service a powerful and
intuitive visual designer and a wide
portfolio of adapters allow you to
connect securely publish and subscribe
to messages and schedule
monitor and manage your integrations
integrating applications starts with
adapters adapters simplify connectivity
by handling the underlying complexities
of connecting to applications the
integration service includes dozens of
different adapters for both SAS and
on-premise applications if no adapter
exists for the application you need to
integrate you can create a custom
adapter using cloud adapter SDK you can
create adapters for cloud on-premise and
legacy applications after you've created
your adapter you can upload it into the
integration service and use it in your
integrations to connect securely with
authentication authorization and session
management before you define an
integration you create connections for
the application you want to integrate to
create a connection you select your
adapter from a list and add basic
information like wisdom you are l's
credentials security policies or other
configuration values specific to the
application you're connecting to after
your connections are created you're
ready to build an integration an
integration includes a trigger or source
connection for requests sent to the
service and an invoke or target
connection for requests sent from the
service to the target an integration
also includes the field mapping between
those two connections patterns help
streamline development of your
integration orchestration integrations
enable you to invoke remote services and
orchestrate process execution
you can include a number of different
actions in your integrations like switch
actions to create multiple routing
expressions for each actions to loop
over repeating elements and scoped
actions to define fault handling and
group multiple actions together map data
integrations enable you to create an
integration with a source and a
destination that you associate with
adapter connections you can also create
a single routing expression publish and
subscribe patterns allow you to connect
your trigger and invokes to send and
receive
messages from the service when you
create an integration a wizard helps you
define endpoints endpoints build on the
connections you already created by
defining how to process the data for the
trigger and invoke connections
this can include defining the type of
operations to perform on the data the
Business Objects and fields against
which to perform those operations
required schemas and so on when the
endpoint connections are configured you
use the mapper to define how the
information is transferred between the
trigger and invoke data structures for
both the request and response messages
from the mapper you can also access
look-up tables and use standard XPath
functions to map your data between your
applications
lastly you define business identifier
zon payload fields which enable messages
to be tracked in the monitoring pages at
runtime with that your integration is
complete with the click of the mouse the
integration is made active it can then
be invoked from the command line or from
a REST API for more information visit us
