video training series this is a video
recording of application testing suite
to offer four new features and updates
my name is Carolyn lui and I'm a
principal product manager for
application testing suite this
presentation covers new features and
updates we have in Oracle application
testing suite released 12.4 the video
recording will run for approximately 23
minutes we will begin with an overview
of the new features for open script for
functional testing open script off were
introduced a new EPS forms module for
JRE seven support there is now a new
feature to require Siebel open UI name
attributes in addition we have also
released a Siebel open UI function
library created by our very own Siebel
QA team the 12:04 really supports
Firefox 2040s our browser and chrome
browsers released 32 and higher
however we continue to support testing
chrome 27 to 31 in the area of web
window capture page API previously all
screenshots are saved to the results
directory with this release users can
now specify the location to store their
screenshots using this API finally we
have expanded our ADF solution by adding
support for ADF context info component
for functional testing as well as adding
a new gate items API to enhance support
for the ADF select many choice component
the first update I want to introduce for
1204 functional testing this jr. e 7
support for the EPS forms module prior
to 12:04 our support for JRE 106 was up
to build 38 and our support for JRE 1.7
was up to 1.7 build 11 with the 12.4
release we now support JRE 1.6 built 10
to 45 and junior e 1.7 up to build 45
one thing to know as a business suite
versions running on J initiator are not
supported in 1204 users who are required
to test with or Kil'jaeden Ishi ater
should use Oracle application testing
suite version 12.3 or older for the new
JRE 7 support it is required to enable
EPS automation from the Tools menu this
will copy the required deal
into the JRE folder a confirmation
window will appear when the installation
is completed what's important to know is
ApS forms automation should be disabled
after testing is complete it should also
be disabled prior to an installing open
script disabling automation will remove
that ATS DLLs from the JRE folder as
mentioned on the slide I will go ahead
and demonstrate how to enable EBS
automation after launching open script
click on file new select Oracle EBS
forms under the functional testing
folder and click Next save the script
and here we'll have a new script created
click on tools and select enable EBS
forms automation this will prompt open
script to copy the ATS DLLs to the
active JRE folders a pop-up window will
confirm that install action has
succeeded so just click on OK to dismiss
it when testing is complete please
remember to go to tools disable EPS
forms automation to uninstall the DLLs
from the JRE folders with the new JRE 7
support open script will automatically
try to record forms components with
unique control names this is how it
looks like in tree view and Java code
view when the forms recording is
recorded with unique names if this does
not happen then please refer to open
script user's guide chapter 7 1.24
instructions to enable recording with
unique control names in December 2012
Oracle released Siebel CRM using open UI
and web-based technology because open UI
uses a web user interface the web
functional testing accelerator should be
used to record Siebel open UI scripts
Siebel open UI has unique name
attributes to identify the object these
attributes are repository name or RN
object type or ot and UI name or UN for
short
open script is the only tool on the
market which can identify Siebel open UI
objects using RN ot and UN name
attributes this is a result of the
collaboration between ATS and C both
team in order to record with open UI
name attributes there are a couple
requirements that needs to be met the
first thing is to enable Siebel test
automation according to the instructions
from open script user's guide chapter 18
to 3 the second requirement is to attend
SWE CMD equals auto on to the recording
URL to record open UI name attributes
after these requirements have been met
you will see that the open UI name
attributes are recorded in both treeview
and Java code view the attributes are
denoted by RN which stands for
repository name ot which stands for
object type and un which stands for UI
name in order to further extend the
script our Oracle Siebel QA team created
an open UI function library this library
is not required however could be used to
further extend the script the library is
downloadable today from the Oracle
technology Network ATS site please visit
the Siebel open UI function library
chapter in open script programmers
reference for download instructions
usage and documentation of the function
library after downloading the function
library and importing it simply add the
function library as a script asset to
the web script and it can be used to
extend a recorded script here are some
diagrams to demonstrate the flow of how
to add the function library to a script
for Siebel open UI first you would
create a web script under the functional
testing folder then go to the assess tab
highlight scripts
and click on add navigate to the
function library and click OK
the result is the function library will
be added to the web script as a script
asset the open script programmers
reference guide can be found in the
Oracle ATS installation direct
docks and the language folder of your
preference on a linux server the path is
the same except for you will need to
navigate to the orca ATS installation
directory chapter 16 has all the
information you need for the Siebel open
UI function library the instructions
will walk you through from downloading
the open UI function library to
unzipping it creating a web script
adding it as an asset and how to call
the functions let's go ahead and
download the function library from the
Oracle technology Network asset the
License Agreement and scroll down to the
test starter kit section then click on
the link for Siebel open UI function
library to download it save it locally
to the file system and then unzip it
create a web functional testing script
for your Siebel open UI testing project
and then add the function library as a
script asset let's go ahead and
demonstrate how to do that click on the
new icon to create a new script select
web accelerator under the functional
testing folder and create a new script
for Siebel open UI you can proceed to
record the Siebel open UI script at this
point and then later on add the function
library however for demo purpose I will
go ahead and add the open UI function
library now and to do so click on the
assets tab highlight scripts click on
add and navigate to the Siebel open UI
function library select function lib and
then click OK
once the function library is added to
the script as a script asset users can
call the functions either from the tree
view or from the Java code view from the
tree view right-click on any node and
select add other navigate to the
function Lib library and highlight any
of the functions that you want to call
and click OK from the Java code view
type the name of the function library
alias in this case its function lip
followed by a period and then press the
control space keys at the same time to
invoke intellisense to
see the list of functions let's quickly
take a look at how this works in open
script here we are in a tree view
right-click on any node select add other
expand script functions expand the
function library and then browse through
the list of functions available and
select and use any of them
after selecting the function you need to
populate the required fields and click
OK to insert the function into the
script from the Java code vo you will
see that there is a function library
class added and this is the alias of the
function library use this alias to call
the functions in the function library
after entering the period open script
will automatically displayed a list of
functions available in the Siebel open
UI function library scroll through any
of these functions and highlight the
function and the Javadoc will display on
the right-hand pane to display more
information about the function call
double-click on any of the functions to
insert it into the script and then
update it accordingly another new
feature we have added in 12.4 is support
for the firefox 2040s our browser
ATS 12.4 now supports Firefox 2040s our
browser for record and playback on
windows there is also support for
playback on Linux 1204 also provides
support for chrome release 32 and above
for functional testing playback on
Windows as mentioned previously we
continue to support chrome versions 27
to 31 the steps mentioned below is only
required for chrome 32 and above there
are a couple of ways to playback in
chrome 32 in newer browsers one way is
to add to always authorize plug-ins
parameter from open script preferences
to do this click on view open script
preferences expand general and then
highlight browsers remember to select
chrome for the playback drop down and
add - - always - authorize - plugins
into the additional arguments field
under the chrome section entering that
parameter into open script preferences
will allow open script to playback in
Chrome every single time with that
parameter another way to enable playback
for chrome release 32 and above is to
call the add extra params API from the
code view please note this is only
required if you do not want to add the
parameter into open strip preferences so
either you would need to add the
parameter via the java code view through
the script or you need to go to open
script preferences and add it in the
additional arguments field for those who
are playing back the script from the
command line user should add the dash
browser the extra RX argument to the
command line one very important note to
add is for camilan playback there is a
space after the double quote in - -
always authorize plugins in 12.3 in
previous releases the default behavior
for web window capture page api is to
save the screenshot to the results
directory now in 1204 user can now
specify the file location to save the
screenshots and this is done through the
code by entering the path to the folder
where you want to save the screenshot in
this example we are saving the playback
screenshots in the C directory at the
following location you can see that
after playback the screenshots are saved
to the regression testing folder as
indicated in the capture page API in
12.4 we expanded our ADF solution by
adding support for ADF context info
component for recording and playback in
ADF functional testing actions inside
the ADF context info component will be
recorded into the script and simulated
during playback along the lines of ADF
there is a new API to retrieve the list
of values from ADF select many choice
object the ADF select many choice get
items API where we turn all this items
except for the top node which is all so
here we have an example of the select
many choice object which contains a list
of items using the ADF select many
choice get items API will retrieved a
list of items for playback there are
some general enhancements and
announcements in 12.4 with regards to
open script reporting there are some
minor enhancement
such as printing the oats version and
browser information during playback
there is also a new timestamp column in
the result report and results pane which
displays the actual time of playback we
added support for Oracle Linux 6 and
starting with 12.4 ATS no longer
supports Windows XP due to its end of
life the open script result report now
shows the open script version used for
playback browser type in version used is
also printed in the result report and
results view we received input from our
users that sometimes they playback the
same script in different browsers
therefore this information is extremely
useful when the user does not remember
which environment the script was
playback in the open script result
report in results view now has a new
timestamp column this column provides
the actual time the step node was
executed having this information is
useful when user needs to check the
application server log in case there are
errors
ATS 12.4 is certified for Oracle Linux 6
64-bit operating system across the
entire product line Oracle Linux 6 can
be used for command line playback in
Firefox or as an agent for both Oracle
load testing and Oracle test manager the
ATS agent should be installed on the
linux server at a minimum this is a
playback only feature and recording and
debugging should still take place on a
Windows system on April 8th 2014
Microsoft and a support for the Windows
XP operating system as a result we have
also ended our support for Windows XP
more information regarding microsoft's
announcement can be found at the website
referenced here here is an overview of
the new features for open script for
load testing and oracle load testing
there are a number of new browsers added
for browser emulation in oracle o
testing we also add a support for oracle
linux 6 for oracle load testing in 12.3
we had a pretty good list of browser
emulation for load testing we extended
this in 12.4 by adding a number of new
desktop and mobile browsers in order to
emulate users with modern desktop and
mobile web browsers most notably we
added
and safari browsers in addition to the
newer Firefox and Internet Explorer
browser versions such as Firefox 17 and
24 in addition to Internet Explorer 9
and 10
the 1204 release was certified for
Oracle Linux 64-bit for both or Gallow
testing server and agent we now support
both Oracle Enterprise Linux 5 and 6
here is an overview of the new features
for Oracle test manager in 12.4 there is
a new feature to add test cases to an
existing test set run in Oracle test
manager users can now also run a test
case for as many times as they like and
then manually complete a test set run we
have a couple of exciting new test set
reports in Oracle test manager and also
there is certification for Oracle Linux
6 in o TM top 3 in previous releases
users cannot add new test cases to an
existing test at run once a test run is
created the test cases are static
starting with 12.4 there is now an ADD
test to this run link to add test cases
to an existing run this feature is
helpful when there is a need to add more
test cases to a test run during a mid
test cycle to demonstrate the flow first
you will need to select show all tests
from the runs drop down following that
click on the add/edit link add any new
test cases and click OK afterwards
select the existing run from the runs
drop-down and then click on add tests to
this run link and repeat step 3 I will
now go over this process in Oracle test
manager here we have a test set called
regression tests with three test cases
there's already a test run created for
this and we want to add more test cases
to this existing test run
to do so select show all tests from the
runs drop down click on add edit link
either search for the test cases you
want to add or click on the tree view to
manually select the test case
and add them let's go ahead and add test
cases 4 &amp;amp; 5 and click OK
so from the hello test run you'll see
that test cases 4 &amp;amp; 5 has been added the
next step is to select the existing run
which is already in progress after
selecting the existing run you will not
see the test cases that you have added
to all runs to add those new test cases
click on the add tests to this run link
and then select it from the selections
available here you will see here that
the test case is added to the previous
run are italicized while the new test
case is added or not
click OK and for this particular test
run you will now see the new test cases
and you will be able to run them in 12
top 3 in previous releases when all the
test cases from a test set has been
executed the test sets run status is
automatically set and user cannot rerun
a test case starting with 12.4 test runs
are complete only when user selects
action complete this run this provides
the tester an opportunity to rerun a
field test case without having to create
a new test run let's quickly walk
through this process in this example we
have a test set with two test cases that
are passed notice that the result is
incomplete to set the test run as
complete hover over actions and select
complete this run a pop-up will appear
asking the user if they are sure they
want to mark the test set run as
complete once you click OK you cannot
change the test run status to be
incomplete again so please make sure you
really want to mark the test set run as
complete before clicking on OK after
clicking ok the result of the test run
will be displayed in the result column
going back to the test run we had
created previously notice that all the
runs have completed and that the status
under the result column is incomplete
the user can re-execute any of these
test cases as they wish so let's go
ahead and read
this test case that has a warning and in
this example we will go ahead and pass
the test case now that all of the test
cases have been executed and in some
cases some of them have been reacts
acute 'add to complete this test run
hover over actions and select
completeness run a pop-up will appear
make sure you really want to mark the
tests that run as complete and then
click on OK after marking the test run
is complete the result will be displayed
in the result column under the run
history section and the run will no
longer be available under the runs
drop-down there are a couple of new
reports in ATS 12440 TM one of them is
the test and execution summary report
this report shows an aggregate of the
test case results from all tests at runs
the links in the table are clickable and
drills down into the test case results
to see detailed information for each
test M let's quickly take a look at the
report to see the report click on the
reports tab expand public reports folder
if it's not already expanded and then
expand the other reports voter highlight
the test execution summary report and on
the right-hand pane you will see the
report under the name column you will
see the test set and then the next
column is run name if you have more than
one test runs it will be displayed for
each test set click on any of the links
in the status columns to drill down into
the test cases for each test case you
can further drill down by clicking on
the test case link in order to see the
test step results another new report in
OTM 12.4 is the test set execution trend
report this report shows the trend of
the test that runs based on status the
data view tab shows the information in a
table format as with any reports in otm
graphical reports can be exported to
jpeg while table reports can be exported
to excel or HTML format this makes it
easy to report on the progress of a test
cycle sprint release or project let's
quickly take a look at the reporting otm
the report again can be seen in the
reports tab
under the other reports folder simply
highlight the report test the execution
trend and you will see a graphical view
of the test set runs click on the date
of you tab and the information will be
presented in a table format click on any
of these buttons to export the report
the 12.4 release was certified for
Oracle Linux six sixty four-bit for both
otm server in otm agent we now support
both Oracle Enterprise Linux five and
six for Oracle test manager among other
flavors of the Windows operating system
this concludes the application testing
suite left off for new features and
updates presentation thank you for
