call control 12 see a demo series
focusing on the best practices for our
upper bi applications management the
screen watch is a part of a series on
service level management or SLM for
OBIEE applications the purpose of this
screen watch is to highlight the out of
box capabilities and benefits of ian
call control 12c for service level
management and administration for oracle
bi applications service level management
or SLM is a key tool in the proactive
management of BI applications the
benefits of SLM are following it can
provide a confirmation that multiple
rated targets are up and running by
using the aggregate service you can war
up data from the multiple individual
service tests admin also quickly
identify the availability or performance
issues of the BI application and if
there is any problem and you can easily
do down into their problem components in
this series we'll cover three parts of
Oracle bi best practices in SLM in part
1 will demonstrate how to record those
indebted transactions in part 2 we'll
demonstrate how to modeling the service
tests using synthetic transactions in
part 3 we'll demonstrate how to create a
service level agreement to maintian
system usage availability and service
performance in this demo we'll show you
how to record the BI synthetic
transition using open script the use
case of this testing is to use an open
script to record the process of logging
into the BI application they v8 to the
dashboard and log out of the application
once the recording has been successfully
completed we'll also examine the script
by replaying the screen after you launch
the open screen go to file and click new
and select Oracle Fusion ADF on the load
testing click Next and in your script in
this case our
the recipe I test and click finish
so once the it and you initialize the
project and create the screen or click
the record button and it'll launch the
default browser ie and type the URL for
your Oracle business intelligence
applications once you login to your
Oracle business intelligence we will
never get it to the couple of different
views here we are going to dashboard and
select the trendy after that we click
the histology tab under the trendy and
once you are satisfied the view we
started application and we'll stop the
scripting once the scripting is done we
can go back and play back the script and
on the bottom table will show all the
steps of the scripting and whether the
scripting has been passed or not you can
see the result on the bottom part of the
of the screen
and save the script and then I go to
file select export script you need to
export the script that will be imported
back that you can control for later so
once you specify the file name in the
path click OK this concludes our demo of
creating the open script the benefit of
using open script is that it is easy to
use and it is native to Fusion
Middleware application also it has a
tight integration with Aegean Cloud
Control our next step is to upload the
script that we just created into en
control and create a bi generic service
test this concludes our demo of records
and data API transition using open
script please continue to part two of
our demo for creating VI generic service
tests thank you thank you for watching
