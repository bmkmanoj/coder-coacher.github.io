the Enterprise Manager team in this
tutorial I'll show you how to use
Exadata sparse clone to create a thin
clone of a pluggable database as well as
a thin clone of a non pluggable database
running in Exadata environment in
earlier releases of the Enterprise
Manager product we introduced snap clone
functionality with engineered systems
such as Exadata snap clone is a way of
taking advantage of copy-on-write
technology to bridge the thin clone of
the database allowing cloning of an
existing database in a way that takes
only a very small subset of the amount
of storage is by the existing database
in earlier releases snap clone on
engineered systems used external storage
such as the oracle ZFS storage appliance
on that app filer to store the data file
artifacts on the clone the downside of
using these external storage systems is
they are not exited or aware and cannot
take advantage of a lot of the unique
innovations that extar deter is brought
to the table as you see on the right
hand side here such as smart skin and
hybrid columnar compression now with
Exadata sparse clone you can create fast
space efficient snapshot databases in
two simple steps firstly you create a
space disk group on your extra data
storage and then you either create a
snapshot database or a snapshot
pluggable database that reads data from
a read-only test master database and
writes to the space disk group depending
on the environment you are building the
extra data snapshots were initiated
either by a snapshot copy for pluggable
databases or a clone DB operation for
non contained databases the test master
database must be in read-only mode
because we're using a disk group on the
extra data storage all the extra data
features work as expected on the
snapshot databases diagrammatically you
can picture this as shown on the left
hand side of the picture we have our
production database we use data guard or
an our main clone operation to take a
full copy of the production database to
our test or development environment the
test master is read-only
the snapshots are made up of sparse
files composed only of change blocks
other data is read from the test master
now we understand the concepts behind
exodus pass clone let's have a look at
it in action firstly we'll look at using
it to clone a pluggable database and
then we'll look at using it to clone an
on containment database here you can see
we have a database called crm prod in
this case it's actually a real
application clusters database you can
see that by seeing the different
instances on two different nodes again I
can right click on this database and
walk through the cloning menu to create
a test master I need to provide some
credentials on this environment and
again I'm taking this test master as a
current point in time I can change the
display name so it's something more
meaningful notice it's defaulted to a
database type of rack that's because
we're doing this off a rack database but
remember this is a read-only environment
we want to build here so let's swap that
back to a single instance because rack
environment will give us nothing so
let's select the oracle home for that in
this case i'm going to select the second
node of the Exadata cluster and again I
need to provide some CSS and credentials
we have the same sort of configuration
options that we had available to us
before so at this time I'm going to
leave it again in the same disk group
and I'm going to pick listener and set
up a password for the administrative
users at the system and DBS and MP
this time I'm going to change some of
the parameters so let's drop the SGI
target down
as well as a TGA
and in this case I'm going to change the
CPU countdown as well
again I'm not going to change anything
as far as the data masking is concerned
I'll change the name of the deployment
procedure so it's just a little bit more
meaningful to me and again I'm going to
schedule this to run immediately
so let's submit that to run and again
I'll do and expand all and I'll set it
to a 30-second refresh again I'm going
to pause the recording while that takes
place we can see that the test master
has been created and it obviously didn't
take anywhere near as much time as the
last one that is because the size of
this database was much smaller than the
test master we created last time so
let's go and create a sparse clone off
this one to do that we need to go back
to the databases page so we can actually
see the database we can see here the
same great snapshot clone link as we
used before like until the database is a
test master because I have this disabled
test master link available to me as well
we can of course just use that crate
snapshot clone command like we did
before but this time we can take you
into the clone management dashboard so
you can see that as well here you can
see the clone management page we can
hide the target navigation region by
clicking on this button to see a bit
more of the client management region
instead at this stage we can see there
are no clone databases created for the
database as you would expect since we
just created this test master so let's
click the create button here and create
a snapshot clone as you can see this has
started the same wizard as we used
before so walk quickly through the next
few steps without too much explanation
because you've seen it all before
one thing you will notice is slightly
different is on the second step of the
wizard we have a couple of extra
configuration options we didn't have
before the redo log file size and also
the recovery file locations I'm going to
leave those at their defaults
finally once we get to the review stage
I can again just look at all the details
of their being provided and if I'm happy
with those I can submit it again you can
see it's only taken a few minutes to
create the client so I can go back to
the database targets page now and if I
drill into the clone management page for
that database I can see there's now a
sparse claim has been created as we
expected in the screen what you've seen
how easy it is to create exadata smart
clone snapshot databases using both the
pluggable database and an uncontained
iraq database as the source I'm Pete
