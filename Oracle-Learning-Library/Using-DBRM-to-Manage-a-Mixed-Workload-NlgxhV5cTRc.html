show you how parallel execution in a
mixed workload can benefit from
statement cheering and database resource
manager this demonstration includes the
following steps first review the setup
consumer groups retail analytics which
runs long running queries and retail
critical group which were in short
running queries then review the consumer
planes batch pain and data daytime plan
they will see the parallel statement you
initialization parameters values then
we'll run a few short critical
statements when there is no competition
for resources to view the execution
times for later conversions then we'll
load the system with long running
queries of the retail analytics group to
see the execution times and resource
usage with sequel monitoring within a
batch plan the top is set to 64 which
gives 128 processes to each sequel
statement limiting the use of the
parallel resources prevents overloading
the system as more long-running
statements are initiated you see them
queuing the statement is an important
workload management tool because it
stops statements from being downgraded
to serial which happens once the system
runs out of parallel processes then
we'll start short running critical
queries of the retailer critical group
while the system is loaded with long
running ones already as expected the
critical short running query struggled
to get enough resources there are not
cute and eventually get the appropriate
top but they are starved for CPU
and eventually I oh sorry then we switch
from the batch plan which favors for
long-running statements to the daytime
plan which waivers the short running
critical ones after switch the planes
you can see the new dog limit for any
statement within the retail analytics
groups then set to 16 and the short
running critical statements of the
retail critical group complete their
execution very near to their original
run times let's familiarize yourself
with a setup then you will see sequel
statements executing in a data warehouse
environment however you have mixed
workloads you see long-running are your
intensive statements as well as short
critical ones that should get the
required resources right away begin by
reviewing the retail analytics and
retail critical consumer groups with
their users so go to server resource
manager consumer groups and in this list
you'll find the retail analytics
consumer group and the other one the
retail critical consumer group the first
one reticulate x group has to users
retail and artyom members of this group
and the other group with which we are
going to work the retail critical group
which ones short running queries here it
is contains one member whose name is
retail critical user to view and
understand the effects of different
resource plans with a parallel workload
we created a batch plan on a daytime
plane let's review them so we go to the
plans down and on this page you see that
this plane the
edge planned applies to all eight
instances of the database cluster
database machine for single servers this
page displays active in status because
it applies only to one instance so let's
see this batch plan batch clan resource
plan favours the retail analytics group
with seventy percent of the system
resources it is designed for a heavy
workload of long-running queries that
the retail user remember if this group
execute that none during the off hours
now let's see what other directives for
this batch plan all directly values are
set to unlimited for the retail
analytics group the top is limited to 64
and the maximum percentage of parallel
service has a target value of 70 the
parallel cute I'm out another directive
new with oracle database 11 202 has not
been modified this means if parallel
statements are cute they were remaining
the queue for the resource group until
other system events take place for
example enter resources are available
and the statement will stop now what
about the date-time plan the other one
the daytime plan favors short critical
queries by giving seventy percent of the
system resources to the retail critical
group the retake critical user which you
will see later is member of this group
for the retail analytics crew the dog is
limited to 16 during the day on the
maximum percentage of parallel service
has a target value of 30
now that we have reviewed that consumer
groups retail analytics and retake
critical groups and their users and the
consumer plans batch pan and daytime
plans with the directives we are going
to view the initialization parameters
for the statement queuing go to the
server tab and in the current
initialization parameters and set the
name to parallel to get all of them so
the main royal parameters are the
parallel degree policy which needs to be
set to auto if we want the statement
queuing to kick in unparalleled
agreement which has been set to CPU
which derived its value from the cpu
count and the parallel threads per cpu
which is 16 on the parent max and min
servers next service at the startup of
the instance which is they'll initiated
at 256 and the main servers minimum
required which is set to 32 and the
parallel meantime threshold which has
been set to auto which means 10 second
and the power service target which is
very important for the statement queuing
feature set to 2 2 128 now we will run a
few short critical statements where
there is no competition for resources to
see what health what's happening and to
look at the current system will go to
the performance tab and in the sequel
monitoring in the additional monitoring
links section of this page so let's wait
until a secret monitoring is appearing
to see which executions are currently
running for the moment so here we are so
soon will appear the list of executions
here you see some critical statements
which completed in four to nine seconds
on an average of five seconds or so and
here you see that the retail user who is
a member of the retail analytics
resource group executing a long-running
statement is currently executing as you
can see with this icon the statement
received one hundred percent of the
system time that is they have not spent
time in a queue waiting for resources it
is executing so you can see the detail
of the request and the statement is now
completed we can see it with the icon
and it executed within 33 seconds you
can see the degree of parallelism which
has been decreased to 64 instead of 128
as requested by the user the statement
has executed with this dot 64 over eight
instances the statement run within the
boundaries of its resource plan its dot
was limited by fifty percent so the
statement was reduced the statement
spent sixty-six percent of its time in
the CPU are not in the IO this is an
elapsed time and not CPU time as you see
the statement has performed a
substantial amount of work now let's go
back to the list of executions that are
currently performing and we wrote let's
go back to the statement itself and we
see that it has been downgraded to adopt
64 over eight instances and amongst the
eight instances we can see the number of
slave sets that executed the blue I can
denote the producers and the red one the
consumers and dispatched all over the
eight instances so let's go back to the
top to seek to the parallel tab in the
parallel town how these parallel query
servers were dispatched amongst the
instances so let's expand the first
instance
and we can see the parallel coordinator
and the two slave sets each of them
consuming eight query servants the first
one now that the execution times for
each parent server are all pretty
similar around 17 seconds and the second
slice at let's load the system with long
running queries of the retail analytics
group to see the execution times and
resource usage with sequel monitoring
remember that the retail critical user
executed several short queries which
completed in four to nine seconds at the
moment nothing else is running on the
system so even why the bench plan is
active these five queries can use all
CPU resources the resource manager
allows a group to use the available
system resources as long as other groups
are not working while the statements are
executing you are reviewing some details
sorry we are hiding some connection
information for security purposes here
but you see that the retail critical
user is executing a statement with a dub
of 128 is not limited by the batch can
Derek t your mixed workout continues
very actively and now the statement
completed within four seconds more short
critical statements executed with a
duration between three and five seconds
now the retail user begins executing
statements with half of the top of the
retail critical user which is 64 and the
retail user is beginning even more
long-running statements
note the change in icons statements are
now queuing remember the retail
analytics group in the veg plan has a
limit of duck 264 and a percentage of
parent servers said to 17 parallel
servers die gate being 128 it limits the
group to use only 89 query servers one
of the statement is already using 64
then there is currently no more query
service available for other statements
for the group statement Ewing is an
important workload management tool
because it stops statements from being
downgraded to serial which happens when
there are no more query service
available and the cube grows and over
all statements are taking longer to
complete but the overall workload runs
efficiently while reducing outliers due
to downgrades to serial what you see is
a system loaded with queries
and it's working now you observe short
critical statements which should take
between three to nine seconds to execute
that they are running already for 12
seconds waiting for resources in the
environment loaded with queries that
critical query struggle to get enough
resources remember the active batch
plant favors the long-running statements
not the short ones the critical
statements are not viewed and they are
not down created to serial statements
they finally get the appropriate top
which is 128 only the statements of the
user retail are queuing remember in the
batch clamp only the retail analytics
group has a limit on the percentage of
the browser service not the retail
critical group this execution of
critical statements is exceeding your
expectations in a very bad way there are
far away from the average of five
seconds ready to change the situation
now we are during the day so we are
going to switch from the batch plan to
the daytime plan which favors the short
running critical statements and after
switching the plans you will see that
the new top limit for any statements
within the retail analytics group is now
set to 16 no more 264 and the short
running critical statements of the
retail critical group complete their
execution very near to their original
one times now let's switch from the
badge plan to the daytime plan with new
directive for both consumer groups now
the daytime plans is active with new
directives and let's go back to the
sequel monitoring page so as to observe
the changed system behavior and we see
the retail user executing new statement
with the DA pub 16 and no more of 64 and
though he had requested top of 64 with
128 query servers he could only get 30
to query servers are located because of
the limit of the top at 16 with a new
directive in the daytime plan change to
a false refresh cycle to observe the
treatment of the critical query is so
let's switch it to five seconds see some
sequel executions of the retail user are
in the queue for this resource group
remember in the daytime plan the retail
analytics group has a top limited to 16
and percentage of parallel servers to
thirty percent hence 38 query servers of
the total of Mount of 128 set in the
parallel service target one sequel
statement already uses 32 of them hence
the others are queuing the retail
critical user receives
requested from Paranal resources here
you see the switch of the resource plans
knew that the completed statements with
the top of 16 are not particularly
slower then when they had a top of 64 in
the background as the long running
queries consumed a lot of query service
with the top of 64 they consumed CP
hence the short queries were starved for
CPU while getting the requesting dump of
128 in this daytime plane the long
running queries they were using less
query servers with the dope of 16 now
not particularly slower or the short
queries one faster and rulings cpu for
other groups now let's see the parallel
statement Q and in this screen you can
see all active parallel statements on
the left and the Q parallel statements
on the right we are all parallel
statements active and now one is chilly
one active has completed and the other
one is still queuing let's end this
demonstration with the consumer group
mappings what can be interesting to use
our other mappings with consumer groups
then the oracle user name a user can be
identified by other means than his
username for example the service he
connects to or the module he uses in the
application or the chloe program he uses
or the client machine he is connected
under and between these different
criterias you may use then you have to
set some priority between them for that
click on the priority tab and set the
priority on the criteria you decide to
promote promote either the user name or
the service so that
when a user retail connects to service a
he is associated to one or another
consumer group thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
