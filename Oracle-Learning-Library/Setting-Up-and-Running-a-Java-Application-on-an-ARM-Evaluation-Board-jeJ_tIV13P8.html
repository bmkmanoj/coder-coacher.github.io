manager for Java tools and Oracle I will
show you how to get started setting up
and testing your Java embedded
application on an arm evaluation board
so to get started you need to purchase
an evaluation boards from Cal calm
this is a debugger you link Emme it is
called we have two cables here let me
first of all let me check the board to
see if everything is okay so let me
connect two cables here so this one
cable goes to one of Peter and that is
used to power your board so you can use
either one of these two slots doesn't
really matter so let me just insert and
you can see this demo example before we
go there let's check out this board so
there are two serial ports for buttons
and there's one twist ik there's even a
camera you wanna see it later and here
you can insert your micro SD card later
there are two USB slots each regular USB
slots plus micro USB slots and this one
is used to pour power but we don't need
it now
let's test this demo application it
comes with the board so any value you
use this to increase or decrease your ad
value you can try this button tamper
button user button it's working fine and
poor way through sticks I can press this
or even I can try touchscreen that
the next demo is acceleration and then
your rate so this has this board has an
accelerometer so if I tilt like this you
can see this y axis acceleration value
changes and if I tilt like that you can
see this x-axis also you can see this
angular rate changes a next demo is this
camera so here's the camera so I can
move my fingers like this you can see
that camera is working fine okay now we
have tested the stem application you
need to download it install mdk-arm ID
from the KL website then go to
oracle.com slash Java ME to get Java ME
SDK return to your browser and download
the Oracle Java embedded client file you
will use this file later to install the
Java embedded on the evaluation board
next setup the microSD card by copying
and installing figuration files let's
set up the microSD card open an explorer
window and navigate to the directory
where you extracted the package file
locate the platform that cont file and
see if all the settings are correct
open RTC conf and setup the time and
date that the device should use and save
the file copy the files onto the micro
sd card eject the card from your
computer and you are ready to insert the
card into the board now you need to
prepare your board for a jwc
installation to download your Java ME
one-time you need to use this u link
debugger insert them here and one more
USB cable the computer and
your debugging interface so connect that
USB to this slot until you hear the
click now your computer is trying to
recognize this port so see if the
drivers are all set up there's one more
step you need to do before you install
Java ME runtime there is this jumper
called EA t3 III so you need to move
this before you install Java Runtime so
move this by one King so that make sure
you have this jumper in the right
position now that we have everything in
place let's install our Java Runtime
under on the evaluation board navigate
to the directory where the runtime is
double click the flashed a DAT file and
it opens the mdk-arm IDE it'll take a
few minutes to write the program to the
board and verify the installation once
it is done you'll see a message that
indicates that the process is finished
install your sample java application and
run it on the board
plug your micro SD card to the slot
connect your ethernet cable like this
once you connect it and then click this
reset button once you will see this
diagnosis messages initializing LCD
initializing time memory measure ok ok
ok and file system then it tries to get
the IP address from the network now an
IP address was assigned this means that
you can access this port using this IP
address let's write a simple application
that you can run on your external device
I have
snap-ins ID installed on my machine I
also have Java ME SDK installed to
verify that I'm now looking at my
installed tools by choosing tools Java
ME and then active device manager and
here is the Java ME platform SDK 3.2 I
will write an application and run it in
NetBeans first go to new project Java me
mobile application then click Next
uncheck create hello midlet because you
will create your own midlet I am naming
the application as embedded application
1 click Next change the device from job
IME phone - I am P&amp;amp;G phone and change
the device profile - I am PNG make sure
the emulator platform is 3.2 and then
click click finish in the project faint
pane right-click source package and
choose new midlet let's name this as
HelloWorld click finish
open helloworld.java using this template
I will write a simple application that
count from 0 to 100 once you once the
application is run so it's a for loop
system.out.print line
hello world and the counter i let's run
this application and see if the results
come in the output window so let me turn
on the ipod p window here's the
application here's the emulator and you
can verify that the application is
running on this IM PNG device emulator
without a problem
ok now let's see in fact if we can run
the same application on a device first
of all select device selector to see all
all the devices that you can use now
let's try to add a new device to this
computer so I have currently have a
board connected to this computer so I'm
going to type the IP address you can
find this from the LCD of the board if
the connection is good then it will say
the device is available soon you will
see that the device name pops up here
now that you have the device name in the
list you can run your application
directly on this device from your
NetBeans IDE let's open a putty session
so enter the device IP address make sure
the port is 65,000 and
connection type is ro open okay this is
a logging window now I'm going to run
this application on this device and see
if the if we see the same result
okay the application is running fine on
the device as you can see here now that
you have finished setting up your board
and testing it you can write your own
Java ME application and test it on the
board please visit Oracle comm / tab I
mean for more information thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
