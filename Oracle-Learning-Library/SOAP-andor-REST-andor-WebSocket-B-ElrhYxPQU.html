and WebSockets and I usually lets us
move on a little bit so I'm and this is
a boss and boss typically what that
means
it doesn't really turn out that way but
you can interact a lot so anytime you
want you got an idea way to do something
way not why you shouldn't do something
feel free to speak up we'll talk about
how to do this cuz I've got a lot of
thoughts and ideas but there's certainly
not definitive answers I think it's way
too early for any definitive answers so
this is more like an exploratory session
I do have some slides prepared so better
so but we can talk the whole time that
would be okay
but just in case I have a few slides and
they go in about this order oh now what
well I had some slides they're gone
amazing
position
well maybe we better switch to own I
took that out well we're off to a good
start here
are they really gone okay look they're
there so how about if I don't can you
read this the slides okay I'm afraid to
put it in full-screen because who knows
what'll happen so let's just go with
this yeah okay so my name is Harold Karr
and I'm the soap web service architect
at Sun and generally I've been giving
lots of soap talks and in 2005 I gave
one at JavaOne and it was to a room that
had actually about twice as many of this
because soap was the sexy thing then and
every year I give talks to smaller and
smaller audiences but I got smart this
year I added web sockets to my title and
look what happened so but you're gonna
hear about soap anyway so
so yeah and here's the disclaimer ports
I'm not talking about any products at
all just ideas but in case there's any
thought that I've promised you anything
you're out of luck
no no promises and this talk is
copyrighted you notice I'm not using the
slide deck I didn't have time anyway
by the way there's a whole bunch of
other WebSockets presentations so this
is a bunch of them from all over the
spectrum I won't read through these
because it would take forever but
there's two pages of these so make sure
you go to your schedule and look them up
if you're interested in WebSockets
there's a few other soap presentations
and one of them I'm giving this one here
this bottom one the remoting perspective
is there a technical guy
okay fine this is that the deal okay
so anyway the bottom one I'm actually
giving tomorrow night and it's in a way
it's related to this talk because I'm
trying to show what's been going on when
you try to write programming frameworks
that allow other programmers to write
programs that talk between computers and
it has a long history from DC even
before DC but I'm starting at DC and
ending up at a WebSocket so I'm doing
that tomorrow evening at 7:30 here if
you happen to be in need of some fun and
then there's a whole bunch of rest
presentations and so don't forget to see
those okay so some of the questions I
was looking at you know how to use rest
what is the rest I mean what a
WebSockets have to do with soap or with
rest cuz soap until rest came along was
the was the what CORBA was the dominant
paradigm then soap was and now rest is
and now a WebSockets everybody keeps
talking about it so well where do they
fit in and we're not sure facts a I
think a lot of people are but let's
pretend like we're not sure so it can go
somewhere anyway so soap and rest use
WebSockets as a transport or should they
be used in a complementary way which how
many people here know much about
WebSockets no not too many okay maybe I
should skip these discussion points and
talk a little bit of intro to WebSockets
first yeah let me come back to this
because it won't make a lot of sense
unless I do so let's go yeah let's let's
start here so this is kind of a history
of where WebSockets fits in so in 1994
that's kind of like the inauguration of
the
like web you know it been around a long
time before that
but that's when everybody else got on
mister my mom got on and that's finally
I was always been wondering you know it
was in my edu account sending her an
email but it never worked but at that
time HTTP was just strictly request
response so people were just serving up
static pages and then they did CGI and a
whole bunch of cool stuff to dynamically
generate a static page a whole page and
that was a useful certainly it caused a
big information revolution but it was
still pretty clunky compared to like a
desktop app so then Ajax came along in
2005 which is actually quite a long time
if you think about it 11 years in
internet time and Ajax is an attempt to
make it a little more dynamic and
there's really nothing magic about Ajax
it's just polling the server it says do
you have an event for me instead of the
server saying here's an event the
clients asking do you have an event a
little bit more detail on that and then
in 2006 a whole bunch of techniques that
kind of go into the name of comet like
long polling it's been streaming came
along and they were trying to make this
a little bit better and the trouble is
it still was a fake so now within 2011
to that 2010 actually 2012 I think it's
finalized this year is it final yet
anybody know thought the jsr birthday is
WebSockets spec with the IETF spec I
can't remember if it's finally anyway so
it does some cool things so let's go
into a little bit more detail so the
HTTP that is just strictly you know it's
still setting up a TCP connection right
but the HTTP protocol says I'm going to
open the connection I'm going to send
one message from the client to the
service the service is going to send the
response and then we're going to cut the
connection and that's it and best
excellent for
that lets us scale because a server
doesn't have to have a whole bunch of
connections open and if you've ever
implemented a Corbis system it's a
connection based system and you have to
do connection management which we'll get
into it in a minute about WebSockets so
then with Ajax all that does is the
exact same thing except for it does it
in the background on a thread so you
know then it's doing this if so you can
have this Ajax saying going in the
background periodically poling and when
it gets to information then you can
redraw some of your Dom or the whole
page or however you handle it and that's
all Ajax is this request response in the
background so not much really going on
there either
but it was actually a big breakthrough
in a way and then this long polling what
it did the long polling is actually
create interesting all it does it's once
again the client makes a request and
then the server just Waits so the
connection is hanging out and the server
just waits until it has actually data to
send an event and then it sends the
event and then after the event comes
it'll the client will and immediately
reconnect again after it does something
with the event you know to redraw the
screen or whatever it'll send out
another one so all that's doing is
holding that connection open so somebody
can send the service can send in the
event when it happens and that's a
little bit better because there's no
latency at all but it does mean it's
still a fake there's been there's a the
last little wrinkle this thing called
HTTP streaming and instead of like in
the long polling one-foot which I just
explained where the client makes a
request the server doesn't respond until
it has an event the event comes back the
client then handles the event and does
another request and so there's a
connection for the server to send a
event on instead you keep that
connection open and the service sends
back frames of responses
and then but it doesn't close the
connection that way it continue to do
that continue to do that all of these
have problems because if you go through
you've got to handle connection timeouts
all sorts of things like that or you
might have a router that wants to won't
send a partial response and what I mean
by a partial response with a Stubbe
streaming is from HP's point of view
it's partially even though you put in it
some sort of data that your application
thinks is a consistent unit from the
HTTP for one point of view you need over
you need the whole response and then you
terminate the connection this one you've
got a application level unit going
across and you're keeping the connection
open fortunately most routers don't like
to buffer ever much so they usually do
send the partial stuff through so that's
H to be streaming now we have the thing
that's also coming along with web
sockets called
server sent events and all that's doing
is standardizing common it's really the
same thing it's in a way but you don't
have to do it with somebody special
framework or depending on this it's a
standard way to do comet Ajax long
polling streaming all that kind of stuff
and it's all wrapped up in a very simple
little thing that's it so you have this
thing called new event source and here
you'd put in the URL to your events and
that's going to open up the connection
and then this thing on message whenever
a message comes in the event will come
and then you process this is your
JavaScript code so there's more to it
than that but that's the fundamental
idea so so the sir I'm not really
talking about server-sent events though
I just wanted to mention it because it's
really working in the same territory and
it's from a different from the same
angle actually that comet was and now
WebSockets is a slightly different angle
I don't I don't trust this thing did I
skip one
okay so what websockets why they're
still necessary compared to like service
in events or common is increasingly our
applications are becoming more
collaborative and commet type things
their service in events they work great
for downstream what I mean is for their
service just to push events to the
client it's pretty fast I don't you have
that connection that's hanging out you
send stuff down it comes immediately but
you can't fake they go up because
upstream you can't suddenly start
sending new stuff yeah the the output
channel from the client side initial
request so you have to do all sorts of
tricks mostly it comes down to just
sending more requests and that doesn't
scale like a single connection so the I
that's really where WebSockets comes in
because you want this two way channel
that the client can send stuff to the
server anytime a wants and the service
can send stuff back oh I see what's
going on it's somehow switching into
that mode see
okay so let's be very careful with this
thing okay so this was this thing okay
so let's talk about a little bit where I
want to kind of jumping around now
because yeah I'm gonna forget the slides
from it so what WebSockets does
WebSockets is absolutely nothing
conceptually or technically technically
new all it is is TCP that's it the
difference is now you have TCP in your
applications which you couldn't do
before that's not completely true with
applets a long time ago and maybe still
you could do it but no one uses applets
so in what it means is there's now a
standard protocol that the client says I
want to talk WebSockets but he says that
in
she'll message on HTTP so it's an HD
message it goes to the service and the
service says if it can handle it it says
basically it sends an HTTP upgrade
message and which is how the asset sale
for instance is handled but in this case
now they're adding a standard WebSockets
upgrade so if the service says oh yeah I
can I can handle WebSockets so it'll say
yes I can and there's a little bit more
magic that goes between them and what
happens is and what they're sending that
message on is already a TCP connection
it's a TCP connection running HDB on top
of it
and so suddenly that TCP connection
becomes completely open as TCP for the
client and the service to send and
receive data on the streams that input
in either direction so that is it that
is the main thing WebSockets is and that
opens up a whole bunch of IDE
possibilities now if you think about it
the real motivation again is we already
had the downstream link from the service
taken care of so for a collaborative app
if anybody changed out there you can see
the stuff fast but do you change
something they're not going to see it as
fast so this allows that upstream link
now to go fast also on the same
connection that's a good thing but
people are going to be tempted to use it
to do other protocols and that's kind of
my big question is is that a good idea
or not and I'm not sure yep
though the main problem before was is
the upstream link from the client to the
service there's no open stream that you
can send data on from the client so you
would have to open up another connection
and say here's some more data for you
whereas the downstream link was always
open with HTTP streaming so with this
you've got it that same thing now both
directions on one channel oh why oh
that's politics that's not a joke it
really at this quality
exactly exactly that's the deal about
web there's nothing's free right and
that's that's the main my main question
too because I came from a core of the
background and Corbett was connection
based and so we had all sorts of
connection management strategies to deal
with you know what's the least recently
used or the one that's been idle the
longest all this kind of stuff so you
could kill them off and because h-2b the
nice thing about it the service didn't
have to do connection management you got
the request you gave the response you
got rid of the connection case closed
now with WebSockets all of us pour
middleware writers will have to deal
with connection management so they're
all going to have to go steal the CORBA
code see it lives on it then that's does
that answer your question exactly I
don't think so
one part was the politics why so long
well really literally it's people when
enough people are interested in
something you really need to standardize
it and there been enough ad hoc attempts
that people say yeah this works
we shouldn't standardize it so I think
that part is and the other one is
scalability is definitely an issue so
what do I say oh yeah so I remember
trouble is that's when you when you
start jumping your slides around then
you're really in trouble okay actually
we'll I gave you a little introduction
do you understand WebSockets good so
it's not much to them is there so you
can skip all the other presentations
okay so let's go back to my original
questions and that is that's why I say
should soap and arrest use WebSockets as
a transport because all it is is this
TCP connection that you set up
you see told first the client said
here's an HTTP message remember dates to
be is really flowing over TCP never TCP
never went away and it says I want to
upgrade to a WebSockets the services if
the server says I can't handle it
you better have you know some common
code back there to back it up which is
most people are doing still because not
everybody can handle WebSockets and
it'll be a while but that's another
issue so then the services know I can
handle WebSockets so they do magic and
then suddenly they can just start using
the input and output streams of that
it's a TCP underlying TCP connection
that was always there to begin with it
never you know just kind of covered up
under HTTP so now we've got that what do
you do with it
well once again the motivating use case
is so you can send real-time events back
and forth from the client to server
particularly from the service but if
you're doing a collaborative acting like
drawing sums together you really want
that to work fast you need it both
directions but just because you have
these oh that's very tempting you know
like well we got these streams let's use
them and so let's run soap over it well
should we exes skip ahead to the so
first this slide because it turns out
doing soap on why would you want to use
soap oh come on don't give it away why
would you want to do soap on WebSockets
basically on a TCP connection there
actually is some thoughts either just
some thoughts if somebody thinks they're
wrong please tell me because I certainly
haven't done it just thought about it
but there's a sink called make
connection make connection
is a thing for the soap protocol which
allows if you've got a client behind a
firewall and you want some potentially
long-running requests the client can do
the request and then the service can
determine like I'm gonna I'm gonna
schedule this to happen tomorrow and
it'll just send a 202 or whatever I came
up in about two or two with somewhat
magic code it's saying okay call me back
and I'll have your answer later so then
later when at some polling card make
connection will go back and say okay I'm
trying again to get the response for
that request I sent you a while back and
you know it has a magic I knew you ID in
there so it can identify it and their
server can say not yet I told you
tomorrow and finally when the client and
it's always pulling can say okay now I
have it and he gets the request and that
that exists mainly because if firewall
like in the reliable messaging case if
the sender didn't get a message it's got
to tell the other side like I didn't get
it with it with make connection you can
that the client is blasting out of the
firewall because the server can't come
back in with with WebSockets
you wouldn't need that because you've
cut that connection already set up
trouble is the connection will have to
wait as long as the takes for the
execution to handle and that gets back
to your question and you've got a new
connection management and if that thing
really is meant to take a day then that
connections probably going to go down so
then you get you have to devise a whole
bunch of connection client connect
connection management strategies I was
talking a minute ago about the server
can say you know when can I close the
connections but if I close them but the
client says no I really meant I have
something I want work done on that
so client has to reopen the connection
and say hey remember me I was trying to
get this done so not only you have to do
connection management with WebSockets on
both sides but now you've got some state
management because they both sides have
to say well what were you and or you
have to just throw it away and say start
over but like I said there's nothing for
free
and you could also use maybe you could
use WebSockets
instead of SS reliable messaging because
one of the things we're I'm messaging
allow you to do is process guarantee
that you'll process messages in order
and with just regular HTTP and routers
you might send some messages but they
actually might arrive in a different
order but that's because they're all
going on different connections if you've
got one connection it's a TCP connection
by definition you're gonna send them
they're going to come in order unless
you were doing stuff like running
multiple threads but in Web Services if
you're using the standard API you can't
do that because the standard jax-ws
client site API is are not thread safe
so anyway it's a possibility for a
reliable messaging and of course the
kind of easy use case is just multiple
messages if you know you've got
something that's going to start up send
a whole bunch of messages and then be
done then it's actually really good
because you don't have to create a new
connection for each one of those
particularly if when you're done you can
actually say okay now I'm done now I
close the connection because that way
you're decreasing the burden on the
connection management side because the
connection management has to make
decisions and it's not always going to
make the right one when it closes a
connection because it's not being used
and it was the one that was idle the
longest that doesn't mean there wasn't
work that was going to be done
eventually on that connection so let me
see this keeps doing
oh I wanted to show that okay well I'll
get back see I'm skipping all over the
place but that that's okay so I'm gonna
skip to this slide first so I'm I'm
actually one thing I'll point out about
soap soap is actually well suited to
doing WebSockets because the soap
specifications like wisdom wisdom has a
place in there that says this is what
kind of transport it doesn't actually
assume HTTP transport it's got a place
right in the wisdom which says what kind
of transport it's got a place right in
there that says here's the address and
it doesn't assume HTTP style addresses
and so it's actually really well-suited
to doing WebSockets and turns of the the
existing specifications because you know
a lot of people complain about so in a
lot of the complaints are valid but some
of them just are kind of whining because
rest is a sexy thing now of course now
we know rest isn't sexy anymore either
right WebSocket is sorry Martin see and
look I got 300 people I'm gonna go sorry
this is a we we work together on soap so
he he can take it anyway so what was
they saying I gotta last again no yes so
so the yes so so the actual conceptual
infrastructure behind it the wisdom
everything else is meant to go on
multiple transports because it's an
enterprise protocol that gets enterprise
work done like end-to-end security is
it's a really strong point and strong
typing of messages okay so the let's
switch out of that that was my that was
my plug for soap because I still work
for soap so you know I feel sorry for it
because no one cares
it's true anyway so look here's here's
the wisdom speck and all of this is
standard stuff oh and this is this is
from a Microsoft specification there's
no standard like w3 gyro ASIS
specification for soap over WebSockets
and I haven't even really heard any talk
about it but but Microsoft has done one
and probably for good reasons some of
the ones I was talking about earlier but
here it is right here this is where it
says soap onto binding transport equals
you know before this would say something
like HDPE instead they've got their own
you know Microsoft specific one that
says WebSocket so that's it once you've
till it's done that then your client
side says okay I need to talk to this
guy in WebSockets and then it says here
is the address WS which is what they've
chosen to represent it by which by the
way WS is makes it really hard because
I've always used WS for Web Services
right and now it's WebSockets so another
another acronym that's going to get
confusing so anyway this is this the
address but that's it the rest of the
whistle doesn't change everything's
exactly the same so then the handshake
message there's really nothing to show
as far as the messages go over TCP the
message that would go over TCP would be
exactly what you see now you actually
should have put one in here they'd be
exactly what you'd see in the body of an
HTTP message because you don't need any
of the HTTP headers
everything's self-contained in the soap
message so that's what's going to flow
across the TCP connection but to get the
handshake going it did one thing one
somehow Microsoft's that the document
says where it said WSU magically
replaced that with HTTP and do an
initial get there and you notice there
it says it's an upgrade to a WebSocket
and they got some other magic stuff
which some talk to probably tell you
more details about this that's
not the purse the purpose of this talk
to go into the nitty-gritty of
WebSockets and then the content type and
here they're saying it's Microsoft
binary Microsoft's because that's
another thing about WebSockets is they
have they can handle binary or text data
and the text is mainly because
JavaScript can't it doesn't have byte
arrays so you need to have text to talk
to so you can do Jason basically to
JavaScript and that's it so that's the
upgrade and then here is the upgrade
handshake says okay I'm switching
protocols and we're going so that's it
so I'm actually saying web's it's
tempting to maybe do WebSockets
over HTTP and I'm probably gonna spend a
little more time exploring this because
if you've got like a whole bunch of
applications written on top of soap that
are communing internally I wouldn't use
this for interoperability right now but
if you're internally there might be some
benefit so I'm not completely sure yet
well the main benefit is one avoiding
these two things make connection and
reliable messaging particularly reliable
messaging I've grown to really be wary
of reliable messaging yeah that spec is
one of the seemingly simpler specs in
the ws star catalog but it turns out it
is really insidious it's got so many
corner cases and if you use it with non
anonymous addressing replies to so I
better talk give a little detail on that
so in soap if you send a soap message
you have these what's called WS
addressing headers and what it says is
where to send the response and if it
says anonymous that means just back on
the same channel that you sent the on
the back channel on the on the output
stream of the stream that it came in on
and the connection it came in on but you
can also say no send it this whole
completely different address
well that thing alone really causes a
lot of problems because if you have to
say you need to retry I didn't get a
message so you need to retry this one or
I wonder I've got a response for you and
you never got it and I want to keep
sending it to you it gets to be a real
problem
so I'm actually other than that I'm not
completely sure you know I can if you
have a lot of that your web services are
talking a lot a lot then saving all that
connection setup and teardown might be a
win by leaving connection but with the
caveat that you have to do connection
management or your apps will just say no
I'm done now so terminate the connection
so the apps in a way would be doing
their own connection management
right and what what happens with this
once you've blowed balanced the request
you know when you first set up the TCP
connection it's going to send you to the
right place and that connection is going
to flow all the way through even through
the proxy so the TCP connection so
you're actually making eventually a
direct connection to this service itself
right so let's go all the way back up to
some other slides here so we're going to
better look and see what time it is Wow
okay let's go here so yeah say it again
before you mean for a WebSocket service
or soap oh okay so I would say that it
would be probably a program it wouldn't
be a browser but there might be a
browser on top of that program but it
would Brooke
actually you could point that's actually
look at this slave good good lead-in so
I'm just got some top-level use cases in
the next slide show some web service
stuff I mean WebSocket stuff and I think
this is what you were getting at
footprint so and that's pretty much you
know nobody uses soap on mobile devices
because it's too big you need too much
infrastructure to support it
everybody uses rest so this I'm kind of
saying that for rest that sweet spot is
public API is in today that's what's
going crazy on the Internet
right there's just there's a new startup
every five minutes that's publishing an
API so you can use their service and
they're all publishing quote REST API is
that you only mean by quote right they
call them rest but you have to talk to
Roy fielding to see if there really are
rest but but they're restful or rest ear
rest like ER anyway so and they're good
for interoperability because the thing
about rest is it doesn't define any ape
at any standards right it just uses
existing internet standards so it's
great and soap you're going to use in
the enterprise and by definition you say
enterprise you're talking right big
heavy metal and big machines and it's
got all the memory you'd ever want to
run so for you
right that that's exactly one of the
reasons why enterprises love soap
because they really do need the strong
type checking all across the board in
the end then security and authentication
and authorization and soap does all
those really well but I don't want to
argue to not argue but to promote any
particular technology right now just
because I really want to stay on the
WebSockets thing but anyway you had a
question which one said what are you
talking about well you have a jax-rs is
not a schema either jax-rs is a
framework to make it easier to write
rest programs in Java but there's no
what's what it's sending eventually is
just HTTP headers and then a body and
the body is completely up to the
application what's in the body and so if
the body wants to send XML documents and
it's got a scheme that it wants to
validate it can't and in jax-rs we'll
give you some help when that hooking
that up together but there's no spec
that says you have to do that whereas
with XML if soap you have to well
actually that's not completely true you
it's validating scheme is somewhat
optional too but pretty much everybody
turns it on
yes yes okay you should about something
slightly different and that is but it's
same idea and that is we're getting into
a so pressed debate but I don't want to
go too much longer on that but but so
that's a description right of this
service and there is one called Waddell
for rest but it's not standardized and
it's not widely used but it doesn't seem
to have heard its adoption at all so so
getting back to - I asked for right I
put soap and rest in the title so thanks
for keeping me honest
so WebSockets here's what I'm saying are
the top-level use cases and that is
browsers as universal clients know that
it will work even in highly
collaborative two-way applications that
to me is the sweet spot for for
WebSockets you can do anything you want
on those TCP streams but this is really
what they're built for and people come
up with amazing things the trouble is
the amazing things will have to be
maintained and that turns out to that's
the trick you know you could write
amazing things and they're great and
that's it two minutes oh wow okay so
we're let me just show you so I was
gonna ask you you know here's what wrist
looks like on on WebSockets this is John
Francois swagger socket there's a number
of things out there but all it does is
take the same information that was put
on on HTTP and stick it inside Jason and
send that across the TCP streams and
then but by definition this is not
interoperable so you need it on both
sides but there's some goodness about
that because you can if you've already
there's libraries that will turn your
jax-rs application into a WebSockets
application just by plugging in your
code doesn't have to change at all but
let me show you one last thing this is
the one really
it can't be time to go I got four
minutes uh does everyone know who Roy
fielding is he's the father of wrist
he wrote this dissertation about wrist
and some guy asked him so you know
wouldn't it would it be cool to do rest
one-one okay
and he said case is the end then he said
it would be a different style of
interaction generally speaking wrist is
designed to avoid tying a server's
connection little resources to a single
client that's why I was getting the
saying that you know you make a request
you get the response you close the
connection now you've got that
connection always existing in that
connection what's going on cross on it
nobody can tell because you can't you
know look inside the routers can't look
inside it's indistinguishable from a
denial of service attack so Roy doesn't
think too much about rest on WebSockets
but it certainly is possible but it
definitely breaks a lot of the risks and
strengths which are stateless it's not
stateless caching you can't catch the
stuff because no they the content
delivery networks don't know anything
about what's going across it doesn't
have a uniform contract it's not a
layered system so anyway the purpose of
this talk is say WebSockets are cool
they have a place they have a very
defined use case if you do anything else
with them other than that you define use
case think long and hard before you do
it because you'll have to maintain that
