curriculum director this presentation is
a quick overview of the Oracle Database
12c architecture this diagram shows you
the main processes memory and file
structures used by a 12c version of an
Oracle database and its associated
instance square elements represent
Oracle processes Oracle processes can
either run as OS processes or OS threads
if an Oracle process is surrounded by
dotted lines on this graphic it means it
can run either as an OS thread or the
West process if an Oracle process is
surrounded by solid line it means it can
only run as an OS process there are only
four Oracle processes that can only run
as an OS process
PMON wickety M PS p0 and data as writer
others like Esmond or reco can run as
either OS processes or OS threads the
SCM n case is an exception when using
the multi process multi-threaded
architecture each OS process running
more than one Oracle process also runs a
special thread called
SCM M that is basically an internal list
in a friend
old Fred creation is routed through this
thread dr square elements are new
processes introduced with Oracle
Database 12c for example L reg the
listener registration process as a DSG a
alligator or RM the rat masking slave
inside one square element you may see
two names this is to indicate the sec
in smaller letters is a slave of the
first for example LG processes new to
12c I'll redo log writer slaves the
processes on the left starting with our
s and M and including also of CB g are
all work related processes files are
represented by cylinders storage
location for those files are divided
into three main areas fast recovery area
database area and automatic diagnostic
repository these areas are designated by
background rectangles exception is the
server parameter file for example
control files can be stored either in
the database area or the first recovery
area same is true for redo log files
however archive log files flashback logs
image copies and backup sets installed
only in the fast recovery area similarly
the change tracking file can only be
stored in the database area the diagram
also depicts the two main memory areas
used by the Oracle database instance the
SGA and pga associated with their
important structures this is the end of
the presentation thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
