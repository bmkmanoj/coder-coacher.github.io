data grids and WebSockets the way it's
gonna work I apologize for the screen
isn't on full screen but because I need
a VM in a minute so I'm not using
PowerPoint so what we going to do is
going to do a quick 10 15 minute intro
into WebSockets and data grids then I'm
gonna introduce guys on the panel can't
reduce themselves and then we've got
both Scott demo but that should take
about 15-20 minutes and then it's up to
you guys because this is a buff to ask
questions of the panel okay so I'm Steve
Miller chap from c2v2
we're a consulting company on data grids
and middleware in general mania and
scalability we've also got on the panel
Nikita even off of site how you
pronounce it that's correct from grid
gain is there we've also got Greg look
from terracotta th cache that correct
I was software AG isn't it to record as
far we got my exit area from Red Hat
infinite span we've got Dave fallacy
here from Oracle and coherence and tell
it goes to exact letter from hazel caste
so we've got a very you know great panel
and I appreciate them all spending the
time to back me up on this so like I
said we're gonna look at a bit intro
into WebSockets the intro data grids the
demo and then each panel member can have
a couple of minutes to introduce
themselves and then it's open questions
okay so you look at the standard HTTP
model HTTP is request response client
request data server responds problem
whenever you want to use push
technologies so we're talking about
sending data asynchronously down to the
browser is that HTTP doesn't really
HTTP request/response protocol is
half-duplex in the sense you can send
data one go one direction and then
respond sort of stateless so if you do
do polling or whatever in HTTP there's a
lot of redundant data on the socket
there's a lot of headers lots of cookies
lots of overhead and you caitli
depending on whether keepalive accept a
new new connections are required for a
lot of traffic there's currently ways of
achieving of mimicking push on over HTTP
all of which are really a bit of a hack
so how polling where you keep an HTTP
connection up and for all
period of time waiting for the server to
respond with some data long polling
which is you could keep the connection
on for a long period of time taking
multiple responses or there's you can
use various browser plugins so a lot of
our customers in sort gaming area will
use flash and open sockets through flash
or through Java or any other browser
plugins so that's all going to change
the web sockets next you know five
so what WebSocket allows you to do is to
establish essentially a dedicated socket
socket to a back-end web server which is
you know brand-new thing that haven't
been able to do before without a plug-in
and that socket will enable full duplex
connection communication between a
server and a browser and it's a raw
socket so you can well it's almost raw
socket but essentially you can send and
receive whatever protocol you like over
that socket so you're not using HTTP so
it doesn't involve HTTP headers and that
will allow web browsers to sorry web
servers now to natively push data down
to the browser okay so that's better
than long polling is it won't keep
connections or threads of
open on the server-side it will reduce
the data traffic the volumes data
volumes and the API is actually very
simple so this is the websocket api for
html5 that's one the other talks said
html5 is more of a javascript spec than
a HTML spec so this is essentially you
open the socket they call in a WebSocket
constructor give it a location which is
a URL give it a protocol which is a bit
of a opaque string really so it allows
the server to decide how to handle it
and then in JavaScript there's a there's
a for callback methods that you add
which we'll see in some code so it's on
message on open on clothes on error
there callbacks that the browser will
give you to your JavaScript when a
message is received when there's socket
opened when it's closed when there's an
error and then the two functions that
you can call or close
and send okay so that allows you to
close the socket to the to the browser
and send allows you to send some data
that could be byte arrays or strings or
whatever that's quite very simple
protocol so this talk is really around
both data grids and web sockets most of
the panel here is you probably noticed
our data grid experts not web sockets
experts so the buff is about using data
grids to push data down so this is what
a typical data grid would look like okay
it's AIT's grid is a whole bunch of JVMs
with objects in memory the objects will
typically have duplicates for high
availability at the idea essentially
being that you can scale out the number
of data map data you can store in memory
by adding more nodes into the cluster
okay and that gives you an H a datastore
the the feature we're interested in
today is events so
most data grid technologies and JSL 107
has a concept of a cache listener and
what a cache listener does is when you
have a data grid like shown there so we
have a cluster with four nodes that each
one has data in it when data is updated
into that cache then essentially an
event can be fired to a listener on on
the cache and that'll listener can do
whatever it wants in which in this case
will be to send data down a socket okay
so JSON 107 has an API to attach
listeners to a cache using register
register cache any listener and that
callback is called whenever an entry
expires is removed updated or read so
what we can do is we can pull that
together to essentially hook those
events into web sockets to push data
dent to browsers so backup that so what
we're going to show a little demo and
then open it to these guys to give a
intro to themselves what their thoughts
are so demo architectures we have a
bunch of J cluster nodes which in this
case well we have one which will be
GlassFish enabled for web sockets as
data gets pushed into the grid then an
event will fire and a web socket a data
will be pushed back down the web socket
to the browser so I'm going to show a
little bit of that for five minutes so
the demo I'm going to show you I've got
a tutorial session on Thursday which
will take you through writing all the
code for two hours hopefully so if
you're interested more on the code and
I would come along to that we haven't
got time here to dive into the code too
much okay so demo if it works so the
demo is going to show a updating stock
price in a Chrome browser
so essentially what we'll see is we have
a graph of a stock price it's not doing
anything this is a html5 graph there's
not flash so there's no Flash plugin in
here this is pure html5 it's using a
semi open source library called high
charts which isn't actually open source
but it's free for non-commercial use and
so this is rending using a canvas we
have a piece of code here apologize for
some of the panel members this is
running in coherence which is just going
to push a stock object into a cache okay
on the web sockets and the GlassFish
side this is we have a listener a map
listener so we're nice sake gets
connected we had a math blister on to
the cache and then when we get an entry
we send an update and that update they
can find it essentially grace takes a
stock object uses JSON so the json
library built into GlassFish which is
jackson and marshals the stock object
into JSON and then sends it down the
WebSocket okay so
if i refresh this to make sure it
connects and then if i run this
standalone java process which is going
to push data into the grid you'll see it
starts connecting to here until it's
connecting to the grid and then it
starts pushing prices and you can see in
the GlassFish server which is receiving
the data to urine spot hey you know
right that always let's restart your bug
know it's demo god isn't it so I restart
GlassFish
I think my socket is timed out
so essentially in the server initializer
it's getting into the cache so we saw
some coherent stuff
I run this again
so you can see basically these are these
are real-time updates being pushed down
to the browser and getting rendered in
real time so it's not using rep not
using comment it's not using a long
polling or Pauline or any other other
technique we stopped the grid updater
and see that data stops if you start the
grid of data again
and see that data start flowing again
okay so that's just really to set the
scene of what's possible when you hook
up data grids with WebSockets
so what I'll now do is pass over to each
person ten they could spend a minute so
saying you know what their thoughts are
what their products Direction is
whatever they like I'll give you a
couple of minutes each and then we'll
open the floor to questions okay thanks
so it's interesting I've actually been
looking at this stuff recently what
we're planning on doing so a terracotta
the terracotta we really don't support
anything less than a server client our
if you have your education API and
terracotta toolkit which connects to the
terracotta server ray we support up to
about a terabyte of memory in there it's
quite heavy weight it's meant it's meant
to that clients meant to run your
application server so we haven't really
we've never really had anything suitable
for desktop or for mobile or for HTML we
we're changing that so we've got a new
project that we kicked off a few months
ago we're adding a terracotta
communication server that's going to be
based on the Nirvana codebase Nirvana is
a high speed asynchronous messaging
system that software AG acquired about
six months ago
so the Nirvana team of building this
what we're building is we're building
cache clients based on asynchronous
messaging for a whole array of things
including html5 and for html5 we will
use WebSockets so I said a little bit
differently to what Steve has here
Steve's basically putting this putting
this together
using cash event listeners what I think
what I think will have is will actually
have a cache API expressed in each of
the various things and so for for for
the browser it will actually be a
JavaScript case library and so you'll be
able to specify what size you want
there'll be local listeners on that case
library so so what we are building is
relevant to this is actually a
JavaScript caching library to allow tens
of thousands of browser connections
through to a new component which we call
the Terra Cotta communication server
based on the Nirvana code base the Terra
Cotta communication server itself will
actually be a heavyweight client of
Terra Cotta just like app servers are
today so it will hold up to you know
terabyte or so of data in memory so
they'll still most of the time be a
single hop from the browser to the Terra
Cotta communication server or the Terra
Cotta communication server will be
receiving changes it'll just be
naturally pushing but it won't be doing
at whoa casual business in Korea moment
we do have some extend clients thing
clients that connect via proxy to to a
cluster and a great settlement we're
exploring things to do in this
particular area describe sounds a
sensible way of doing it having a
basically exposing an eventing mechanism
where you have a JavaScript client
library we have customers using um
coherence with a large number extend
clients
which are basically thin client thin
clients but clients connecting into a
cluster which aren't part of the cluster
so in terms of scale we have customers
with up to 10,000 clients of cannot
compute grits accessing coherence class
tact I think that's that's not necessary
the way you would do it with WebSockets
because you be connecting to the into a
cluster and receiving events from the
actual cluster members a little we're
doing similar things at the moment but
we're not actually doing a WebSocket
venting mechanism we provide a REST API
but that's not that's Paul is not push
one thing that's happening in the
michaelis basis there's a closer
alignment in WebLogic server and
coherence and the next release we're
looking at bringing the two together so
you could push events down to clients
through a web socket API in the same JVM
that the coherence cluster members are
actually running in so you wouldn't have
a any kind of hops to to go and fetch
the data to push down but I can see
there's been very useful in sort of
gaming space and things like that where
we want that kind of real-time real-time
events being sent to clients or running
to fin browser applications it's only
got a lot of peer and that's of a space
- to leap and tundra is passed with 2.0
we try to address the big memory part of
the new era big day that you wrap with
with version 3 we want you to be able to
develop your own data structures circles
if you the data structures that we
provide the mass multi Maps queues if
they don't match our needs you will be
able to develop your own distributed
data structures on top of the crowd the
white I have a torque next to this
session on his caste downstairs clinging
to this WebSocket thing hazel cows
socket can can understand HTTP right now
directly without a facade this is this
was done for supporting HTTP rest calls
we then started thinking what if was
what will happen when we have give up
WebSocket thing can we convert
everything with among all the hissy-fuss
communication can convert everything to
grab socket communication and things
like that eventually we decided not to
doesn't it doesn't add value to the to
our case because there most of time
great start rendering and having a vocal
to network and so further for the demo
like this one I always think that
browser should not be directly talking
to talking to deliberate the JavaScript
library or anything
like that should never because I mean I
shouldn't say this like this maybe I
should say low latency connections are
not good for it a good so I would avoid
every low latency I'm sorry high latency
connections to data grids so I cannot
imagine having I don't I don't think you
should be having a web browser with a
high latency connections big grid
connecting directly to the grid then
reading writing from the good I think
there should be a facade in between so
that you can tolerate arrange the low
latency high latency traffic so
everything inside the database should be
super fast and optimized so that that's
why I think data goods should be I
should be there should be a facade in
between when it comes to browser Mobley
connection to a great ok thank you
everybody my name is akia Vinoth I'm a
final gig in systems so we do a men a
day of life and allows it to store
terabytes of data aim them across
multiple computers and computing process
across there's large datasets real time
so when it comes to web sockets I mean
I'm kind of we're on the size here for
us over the way up we actually working
right now on that technology for us it
comes on the side of clients connection
to the grid gas data platform we have
number of connectivities right now we're
job based products are java scowling
google native languages to us and we
have various clients that allowed to
legacy C++ or dotnet or memcached
Rast application connect to us natively
NSA natively support full affinity
colocation on all of those different
languages so something we've done
recently we out of the objective-c for a
while devices in a no-knock Mac
computers and we currently work in the
JavaScript client again we have a full
affinity colocation builder than that's
and the protocol for that is the
WebSockets for us but again I would
slightly aware the helicase folks that I
mean in a real life I'm hardly seen
anybody connecting directly from a
browser to a freaking great you gotta
have something in between
I mean department departmental
application so I can probably see it
somehow that if you have a small read
and it's just you know 2000 users you
can connect directly provide that for my
phone or from browser on a different
scale you never come back to grid
directly you always have some
intermediaries between that and I mean
look we have common for a long time and
that gives you pretty much the same
functionality as a WebSocket without the
organization and its a cool stuff but
again I in across our clients if you
look me across or know we have about a
thousand different users using us and
companies I can probably find maybe on
double my hat maybe like five or ten
companies that I've heard of actually
utilizes something like comet and right
not maybe WebSockets so I'm kind of on
the sides here okay hi I'm onyx irani
the founder of the finish been
associated grid interesting stuff that
you guys have been saying and I kind of
agree again with will make it a 10
about the relative value of having high
latency connections into a trade that's
said in Finnish spam can be accessed in
two different ways a bit of
architectural work here it can be
accessed in VM that's this primary mode
of operation but we also have
client-server connections into the grid
the will being built that I mean this
being open source or you built that was
around a lot of open source connections
which means very extensible we primarily
support three different protocols rest
and cache D and our own protocol as well
but someone has actually contributed ie
WebSockets endpoints for infini spam and
that actually is there's an experimental
thing I don't actually know who uses it
in production or why but it does exist
you couldn't clearly do that that comes
with a JavaScript library again so kind
of below that when your browser directly
talking to the grade you could do that
attach listeners to it but for me that's
a little bit less interesting than
another interesting part that I've been
playing around with recently and that is
at least from what I've seen people
don't tend to write WebSocket code
directly they tend to use libraries
right everyone uses the library to
generate this stuff for you you're not
directly wiring JavaScript yourself so I
want to be what one more interesting
tool at least for Java developers is GWT
and there's an interesting framework
called Arai which generates a lot of
WebSockets based code around GWT now
Araya is CDI compliant which means it
runs in each other.you server in a
standard way with injections and
everything else and what I find
interesting is the work that we've done
on Jace r107 and the annotations we have
for distributed caches and data grids
which tie into CDI which means that if
you have a CD ID compliant library like
RI that is generating the WebSocket code
for your browser just with simple
annotations you can now tie that up and
wire that to your data grid that I find
is actually quite interesting in a more
interesting way that way things won't go
yeah well I'm actually doing a talk on
that tomorrow something
just come by a bit of the devil as well
all right so if we any questions no one
color
excellent Dorothy
which is
so needs to be
we
acidity
it's
well if I can take that what I mentioned
about so using libraries again that's
where you'd have directly your
instruction so something like there I
will actually generate different pieces
of JavaScript so different browsers
basically browser capability and then
you're tying it in again using CDI into
your datagrid you don't have that
problem anymore that's that's fat little
problem can i armies can I just tonight
can I just jump in here because what we
have the panelists um probably the kind
of sound like I'm the most Pro this the
reason is that there's a lot of these
ideas came from the Nevada guys so the
Nirvana Nevada guys basically Wall
Street London trading systems Dave day
for ten years have specialized in last
mile so they have all the different
client libraries now with their a
messaging some like the last mile
messaging system they have this feature
which is called registered events and
essentially it's a case now the use
cases that you have a trading desk top
trading desk top and there's changes
there's changes to price and so on
that's actually happening and you
actually want to push that to the
desktop also when a new desktop connects
comes up you bet you want to connect and
actually get the the latest values both
so they call it a last value case and I
looked at this registered events thing
I'm like you know what this thing is
basically a cage so they have just about
every one of their customers actually
using this today and it's essentially
the same the the Nirvana
existing Nirvana html5 library is
already in the process of being changed
over the WebSockets so no the violent
stuff with register bans which is a type
of cash they could easily be sitting
here as a panels basically is actually
doing this today
so what we're simply going to do is is
basically connected to terracotta so
instead of Nevada getting the vacation
business will basically use their stuff
connected up to terracotta and educate
now I think the use cases for this will
be the same use cases that I've seen so
I think you I don't know if it'll be I
think it'll be authenticated users I
think it'll be
it'll be they'll be trading applications
and will be things like that probably
with hundreds of connections but I mean
the technology should commit tens of
thousands but I don't think you'd want
anonymous and authenticated access into
your data grid I'll just jump in
actually and in the demo is probably not
clarified here we're not actually
connected direct to the data grid we're
connected to GlassFish GlassFish is
connected to the date grid
it's the what we're leveraging is the
events capabilities of data grids to
push in real time to GlassFish updates
that are occurring and they're getting
pushed on the website by a switch but in
Nevada you actually connect directly to
the Nirvana server including across the
web using HTTPS and like you might go to
a load balancer because directly to
Nirvana and the way we're designing this
thing you'll be going directly to the
character code of communication server
it's kind of like a it kind of is like a
gateway I guess rather than raw into the
into into a grid but it's still direct
connection to one of our servers there
are number different ways of
architecting if you want to stream the
VINs from data Quinn and me obviously
depends on the particular technology
terminology but for coherence for
instance if you wanted to access come
here to cluster from a thin thin client
from the dotnet C++ Java client and you
are outside of the cluster say like a
computer it note and typically you go
through a proxy which is basically
passes requests on to the to the rest of
the nodes in it in a cluster I mean if
you're using if you're if you're making
say for instance the application server
part of the cluster itself you could do
that you can make it a proxy so you
could pass the requests on to other
nodes in that unit in a cluster I think
your security and things like this if it
does the layers of security you need
obviously depend on whether it's public
facing or sand
but you know a lot of application
servers have a ton of security features
they can add in themselves so you know
basic authentication and obviously a lot
more complex ways of actually
authenticating clients and so it I think
you know the actual architecture in
terms of you know who you look hard
especially direct and connecting to and
just depend on the level of security and
isolation you want around today degree I
agree with that look nirvanah have been
doing this to the owner for 10 years
they've got all security built in you've
got to deal with it I think there's an
interesting point about this example the
way Steve's framed it is event-based now
then the way you've done it Steve is
great for a stock ticker but what but
what if actually what they want is is a
list of prices so hundred fifty stocks
and prices and when you so in the in the
event model that you've got you'd
basically start up the application you
have to wait for a trade that happen
before you'd actually before that that
particular stock would get updated turns
out I think the actual use case is when
you connect you actually want to go and
grab the last value for each one so you
can't that's why I don't really think
that you actually want to use an
eventing model that's why I think of
what you really want is actually to
extend the the case of the data grid
client directly to the browser I think
you would
the first JSP would get those values and
then connect right well the eventing
yeah but you'd have to do all that
manually yourself yeah well you go
through each of the stocks and you'd
basically do a call or if you're using a
cash client you'd simply connect to it
whatever there because it was actually
just bootstrap in as soon as you're
connected and in these case we see in
like Europe which you can't really see
in the US is for the gaming online
gaming but inplay betting where you gain
price updates or ODS updates on games
pushed people's browsers in real time
at the moment they're using the long
pole in which uses significant resources
in their environment and for their
bandwidth is expensive and if prices are
out of date even by a few seconds and
people may not place the bet so it's
similar to the stock one it's just how
much work you want to do as a developer
if you have a user
when that first something that the
vendors are gonna and WebSocket is in
html5 so it's a socket it's you can't
create many many sockets for each
browser you have keepalive now so I
don't see that it's huge different you
how if use comment or anything else
you're keeping a socket
I mean I think I think the the Java wrap
servers some have changed their
architectures over like five or six
years ago from one thread per request to
by the niño style were you like a cedar
architecture where you configure you
know you can have ten tens of thousands
of sake of connections but but I've just
in a pool of threads they're actually
servicing those requests so suing the
sequence Deventer of an architecture I
think they have all changed over to that
they all have to because of for other
reasons they've got to cope with a large
number of concurrent connections so I
don't see this as adding anything
between you know we don't that's how
most servers end up working today and
you even if you're building a custom
server if you're building its top of
something like Nettie or whatever you
end up doing niño and I you - nowadays
under the covers so so when using
infinite span as a server for example we
saw the bills are tougher Nettie and you
get essentially a lot of asynchronous
i/o so don't get a few sockets with
threats or threats are not walking
sockets and sockets you can become as it
ringing it's not stupid
such an soul like the switches big
bucket
so it's a file socket so you can have as
many suckers as you like as long as it
has locating one thread person yeah as
long as below 64,000 so yeah you're
gonna have a feather pool
imagine this thousands of sockets and
then you spread over a month it's then a
mess with scale horizontally so every
box can handle tens of thousands I mean
I think I think it's not solving actions
I will solve far easier yeah you have
that problem with people I've met so it
has to be 1.1 yeah most of the mark
water and that sir is already fixed this
10,000 connection problem noise even one
server can handle that yeah there's an
old website actually it's is called the
10k and the 10k problem of the website
that there's a website called variants
and what does Tim cave in what is it see
10k see see 10k like this websites 10
years old like people have been working
on this problem for a long time the job
wraps over community as I said I think
they pretty much all changed over I used
to use them back when it was one thread
for request his problems and that's long
gone now it's just about now now it's
really just about configuring the pools
so just tuning your pill sizes so you
can actually service the number of a
quest coming through
several engine I can know some so if
anyone knows others to just support her
if it was standard well to the latest
RFC I say I mean jetty does talk about
Tomcat 7 GlassFish okay seven yeah yeah
you have to be careful which one but
they're like very latest supports
WebSocket well this is running on
GlassFish 3-1 and there was also a
proposal to get that into a Java EE
standard so their new locations can a
standard way but that
trying to do
certainly any question right it's
because because both client and server
I've written by myself so they
understand the data that's going across
the socket but it's opaque to the
GlassFish yeah but that's that's kind of
where I think I think it you know we
plan to provide a client library it
won't look much like the current Java
one it'll be much more simplified but
it's kind of I think that's an important
simplification yeah
have to be honest I don't know whether
Apache supports WebSockets yeah I might
do I don't know
start there anyone else no sorry
any more than many
I'm hoping it can be cure well if
usually I'll just go first what you need
to do is get a consultancy like ours and
do your evaluation I don't think it's a
good use of the panel's time for us to
see actually any consultancy but sure
the impact on the evaluations rescue
another goose and get the SAS to talk to
you
okay
I want to take I mean my view is it's
very much it's much more lightweight you
can add event listeners onto datagrid
and they can have filters associated
with them so you can get a subset of the
data you're interested in why so you
don't need to sell penny queues or
anything like that it just B is in this
case when the connection is created it
creates a listener on the cache for that
specific connection all right the
temperature but once again I don't
believe that that like using cash event
listeners coach event listeners tend not
to work very well with most data grid
implementations anyway in terms of you
know high volume the only reason that
this demo has been done with messaging
is because as vendors don't currently
have html5 WebSocket cache client and I
think that's what needs to be built and
then you don't need to worry about how
it works under the covers just have a
simple JavaScript API and there you are
no agree with that
obviously the common thing that I think
all of the vendors on their support is
story in asia-pacific and stream across
samples
give you the whip so that's our stateful
like a truly stateful connection she
goes over there in flames
the state made two sets of
because I mean if I'd remain I think it
would scale out because you would just
be added in addition cash listeners but
you below balancing across fish no
yellow balance that would spread to the
autopsy well if it fails over the
WebSocket protocol has reconnect built
into it okay
I'll let these guys take one foot but
firstly if you're connected to a data
grid it doesn't matter what node you're
connected to you'll have the same well
you'll have to sign view of the data
more or less depending on the
consistency model that you choose so I
don't think it really matters if the
reconnect if let's say the socket closed
and you reconnect it to a different one
I don't see how that matters right the
other the other thing is that I'm a
scale out listen the architecture that
I'm planning terracotta communication
server you can have n of those right you
have a live balancer you always connect
through a load balancer and then the
light bounce up you can choose your
strategy I think round-robin or whatever
just it just basically will choose
between them and so if you need to add
more you know each one will be rated for
so many you want to add more you just
keep adding to your economy
communication service they just clients
at the Terra Cotta server right
well once again well once again this is
just because this has been prevented it
presented as events and like what you're
really doing what you're saying is okay
I'm interest
this guy's interested in this topic this
guy's Kinect interest in this topic if
you say forget that and it's a cash
client then it's then you know one guy
might be interested in one case or one
another case or somebody might be
interested in a in a certain case key or
start where the case client might be
performing searches so I think I think
these problems are introduced by
thinking about this is messaging yeah
well that's pretty much what we do if
any not talking or web sockets are using
internet Spanish as a remote grade and
you're connecting to it say by a
hospital here's one of our pillow tools
before that essentially does exactly
what they described where you end up
computing consistent hashes on the
client as well so you know exactly which
nodes in the back end hold which pieces
of data and you're able to to route your
request accordingly that could be done
full of songs as well
yeah Persico piece of data that you need
okay again yes yes job basically yeah
it's almost like a forceful shouting or
something that's going on
further so submitting to different
services
parents right now technologies require
another one was a synthetic liked it if
two people are shocked at the
notification
and if it's message
one of the key things is most of the
products allow you to place a filter so
it's not and it was those events then
delivered to wherever that listener is
that matches that filter so the state
can be set in the filter you don't have
to sort filter you know send it to
everybody they call that goes to the guy
who's got the listener with a correct
filter one minute
send all the data down to the WebSocket
clients are slow to respond and it was
piling up on receive messages
severity of that risk but it's a typical
back pressure situation there is no
magic here
somebody has to have a wealth and
control the back pressure we know if
it's a client like a JavaScript client
screaming fine I guess it's a lot easier
to control on the blind because in all
your logic
I mean trade oh yeah
yeah on the client typically and that
client would then be able to like the
timeout certain requests and retries it
could be a kuba Steinbeck brush yeah I
mean he again when it comes to back
pressure hand on the back Russian bears
there's no magic somewhere somebody has
to drop the message somewhere and report
back to client but actually now I'm not
the client but actually some service
side code to throw exception say hey I
cannot send this message anymore if I
filled up my bathroom with something
like this okay I think we're actually at
I'm so sorry all right
I'm just very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
