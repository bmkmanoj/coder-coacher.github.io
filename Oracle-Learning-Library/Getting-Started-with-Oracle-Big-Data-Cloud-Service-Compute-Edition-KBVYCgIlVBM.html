engine combines open source technologies
to deliver a complete Big Data Platform
for running and managing big data
analytics applications the welcome email
you received have links to resources to
help you get the most out of Arkham Big
Data cloud service compute edition as
well as details about accessing your
account provide your identity domain and
proceed to the login screen provide the
username and password to sign it the
Oracle Big Data cloud service compute
addition services page is displayed this
page displays all the clusters on Big
Data cloud service compute addition to
create a cluster click the create
service button provide a unique name to
identify the service in your identity
domain and optionally provide a
description for the new cluster
configure your cluster by providing the
values in the service details page
provide the cluster configuration
parameters specify the total number of
nodes specify three or more nodes to
provide high availability with multiple
master nodes these nodes run off compute
only nodes without HDFS any node in
excess of the first four nodes which are
not designated as compute only slaves
will run as a compute and storage node
the number of Oracle compute units and
the amount of memory for each compute
node of the new cluster specify the
amount of HDFS storage you want your
locate to the cluster Big Data cloud
service computation uses a replication
factor of two for HDFS hence the usable
HDFS storage will roughly be half of the
total allocated storage specify how you
want to manage the queues and workload
preemption off indicates the jobs can
consume more resources than a specific Q
allows this will lead to potentially
lower cluster utilization
on indicates that jobs can can view more
resources than a QL else if preemption
is on and if the cluster is unused then
jobs from any queue can utilize 100% of
the cluster capacity this will lead to
better cluster utilization next provide
your credentials associate an SSH key to
this cluster the create a new key option
allows you to create and download a new
public key for this cluster if an an
administrator username for the cluster
enter and re-enter a password for the
administrator the Oracle storage cloud
service container is where the job locks
are pushed upon completion you can
specify an existing storage container or
create a new one if you have an existing
container enter the credentials provide
a name for the Oracle storage cloud
container provide the username and
password if you do not have an already
existing cloud storage container
click create cloud storage container the
last section of service details page
displays associations select the other
cloud services that you want to
associate with this cluster on the
confirmation page review the parameters
once you are satisfied with the
information you are ready to create a
cluster usually the cluster creation
takes some time once the cluster is
created the status disappears navigate
to the Big Data cluster console enter
your cluster console credentials here
you can create an execute jobs which
Reeves input from HDFS or consider base
or the Oracle storage cloud service
performs computation on the data and
provides output you can also create and
execute nodes within the notebook nodes
allows you to explore and visualize data
