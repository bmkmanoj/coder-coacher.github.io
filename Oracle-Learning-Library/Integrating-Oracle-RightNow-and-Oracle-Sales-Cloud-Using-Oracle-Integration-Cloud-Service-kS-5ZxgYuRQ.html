integration cloud service there are two
main steps you need to complete first
you need to create a connection then you
need to integrate those connections for
each connection I will add a contact
configure the connectivity by specifying
a whistle URL and then secure the
connection by adding credentials
to configure the integration I need to
configure the source the target and then
map the Business Objects to each other
let's start by creating the right now
connection
I'll select the right now adapter from
the list and add basic information about
the connection
I'll add the email address that the
person who's going to act as the contact
administrator next I'll add the URL to
the wisdom that allows integration cloud
service to find my right now instance
because my application is
password-protected I'll add the
credentials required to access it
now I'll test the connection the test
completes successfully so I can save an
exit the canvas
the new right now connection is shown at
the top of the connections list
now I'll repeat the process this time
configuring for the oracle salescloud
connection
you
the new sales cloud connection is shown
at the top
connections list
now that the connections are in place I
can create the integration this is the
list of existing integrations but I'm
going to create a new one since I have
created both source and target
connections I'm going to map the data
between them
now I'll enter basic information about
the integration note that new
integrations can be added to newer
existing packages but I won't add this
integration to a package for more
information about using packages go to
the online help or view the video
entitled using packages in Oracle
integration cloud service at Doc's
oracle com
on the integration canvas I'll configure
the right now connection as my source
the connection configuration wizard
opens and I can add basic information
about my connection
now I can configure how to process the
request because I want to receive
organization objects in the request I'll
select organization from the list then
I'll move on to the response
because this is a one-way flow and there
is no response I'll select none
I can review a summary of my selections
and then I'm done
now that it's configured the canvas
shows the right now instance and it's
inbound flow
now I'll configure the target using the
Oracle sales cloud connection that I
created like I did for the source I'll
fill in the basic information
this time I'll select the account
service service because I'm creating
accounts in oracle salescloud
i'll also be sure that the create
account operation is selected
that's all I need to do for this
connection
before I go any further I'll save the
integration
now that both the source and target
applications are in place I can map the
data to be shared between the two the
source data structure is on the left of
the mapper and the target data structure
is on the right to map the two fields to
each other I'll drag the name field from
the source to the organization name
field in the target the green check mark
and the line connecting them indicate
that these fields have been mapped
because I have a large data structure
I'll use the search feature to locate
the next fields to map
now I'll drag the number of employees
field over the employees total field to
map them finally i'll search for the
currency field and map currency name
with currency code
I'll save my work and exit the mapper
now I'll configure a business identifier
this identifier enables me to use the
monitor dashboard to track The
Associated payload field in messages
during runtime one business identifier
is required as the primary business
identifier but I can define as many as
three
now that the request is mapped the
mapper icon is green and the progress
meter is at a hundred percent I'll save
and exit the canvas and then activate
the integration
to activate the integration I'll click
the activate button
the status is now active and the
integration is complete
