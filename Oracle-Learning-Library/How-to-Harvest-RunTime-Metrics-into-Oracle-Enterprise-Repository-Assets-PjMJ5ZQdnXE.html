principal curriculum developer here at
Oracle in this demonstration I'll show
you how to harvest runtime metrics from
enterprise manager grid control into
Oracle Enterprise repository assets here
you see oracle enterprise repository or
oer before you can harvest runtime
metrics from enterprise manager grid
control into oer the asset needs to
exist in o yaara in this case we've
already harvested a composite asset in
20 we are called hello google so here we
see the endpoint for the hello google
people process we see the overview and
the taxonomy and the properties for the
endpoint note that there are no
statistics here yet
now let's look at the solar composite
that's being monitored and Enterprise
Manager grid control here we are on the
homepage this go to targets middleware
and we'll scroll down and we'll look at
the solar infra on this domain let's
expand default and we'll look at this
hello google composite this is the asset
we viewed earlier in oh we are that we
are monitoring here we can see metrics
for the composite average response time
and message throughput and also a graph
that shows messages per minute and
errors and if we scroll down we can see
detailed metrics on the sower people
component being monitored if we go to
the solar composite menu then monitoring
all metrics we see all the composite
metrics been captured by Enterprise
Manager we see how often metrics are
collected when the metrics are uploaded
and the date and time of the last upload
if we click on this detail metrics link
we see detailed metrics on such things
as throughput response time total folds
and so on so you can see that there are
a lot of detailed metrics collected by
enterprise manager we've looked at just
a few of them but there are many more
now we'll run the oer am integration
utility to bring in the metrics data to
the Oei endpoint asset first let's look
at what you need to do to set up the e/m
integration utility in a solutions
directory under your OE our install
directory you need to unzip this M
integration zip file I've already done
this into the e/m integration utility
directory here we see the files required
by the e/m integration utility let's
look at this a.m integration settings
xml file i have it open here in a text
editor this is where you configure the
connection details for OE are as you see
here note that the password for OEM must
be encrypted using the encryption
utility that's supplied with the e/m
integration utility and you also
configure the connection details for
enterprise manager there are many other
settings you can change here too but
that's all will concern ourselves with
for now so let's close this file now
we'll run the e/m integration utility
and we'll wait for it to finish and the
IAM integration is now complete and we
can see that one asset was up data with
metrics
now we're back in OE R and we've
refreshed the window that's showing the
hello google endpoint and if we scroll
down under properties we can now see the
metrics that were harvested in 20 er
under operational information we see the
percentage availability times response
times requests and false and also when
these metrics were collected and updated
so that's it for how to harvest runtime
metrics from enterprise manager grid
control into Oracle Enterprise
repository assets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
