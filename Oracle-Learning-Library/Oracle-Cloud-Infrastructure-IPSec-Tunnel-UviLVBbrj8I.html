infrastructure IPSec VPN
hi is there a way to privately connect
my cloud network to my existing
on-premises Network
yes you can do it by setting up the
IPSec VPN or with Oracle cloud
infrastructure fast connect
what exactly is IPSec VPN
IPSec stands for Internet Protocol
security or IP security IPSec is a
protocol suite that encrypts IP traffic
before the packets are transferred from
the source node to the destination
IPSec can be configured in two modes
transport mode
IPSec only encrypts and/or authenticates
the actual payload of the packet and the
header information remains intact tunnel
mode
IPSec encrypts and/or authenticates the
entire packet after encryption the
packet is then encapsulated to form a
new IP packet that has different header
information Oracle cloud infrastructure
supports the tunnel mode of IPSec to
create the VPN and it is offered as
self-service using either the web
console or the REST API the IPSec VPN
site-to-site tunnels offer some
advantages requirement of buying
dedicated expensive lease lines from one
site to another is eliminated as public
telecommunication lines are used to
transmit data
the internal IP addresses of both the
participating networks and nodes remain
hidden from external users
the entire communication between the
source and destination sites remains
encrypted which means the chances of
information theft are extremely low
please tell me how exactly the IPSec VPN
functions
the IPSec VPN consists of multiple
redundant IPSec tunnels that use static
routes to route traffic
Oracle uses asymmetric routing across
the multiple tunnels that make up the
IPSec VPN connection make sure to
configure your firewalls accordingly
be aware that a dynamic routing gateway
or DRG must exist before you can create
the IPSec connection
what is the function of the DRG
you can think of a DRG as a virtual
router that provides a path for private
traffic between your cloud network or
your vcn and your on-premises network
let us take a look at the network
components required for IPSec VPN when
setting up an IPSec VPN for your vcn
there are several network components
that you must create you can do that
with either the console or the API
the components are CPE object dynamic
routing gateway or drg IPSec connection
static routes let us take a closer look
at these components
when setting up the VPN you must create
a virtual representation of the router
in your on-premises Network the CPE
object contains basic information about
your router that is needed in your cloud
network or vcn for communication
consider this as the VPN had end on your
cloud network or vcn after creating a
DRG you must attach it to your vcn using
either the console or API you must also
add one or more route rules that route
the desired traffic from the vcn to the
drg connect the CPE object and DRG by
creating an IPSec connection which
results in multiple redundant IPSec
tunnels Oracle recommends that you
configure your on-premises router to
support all the tunnels in case one
fails or Oracle takes one down for
maintenance when you create the IPSec
connection for your VPN you must specify
one or more static routes remember after
you set up the IPSec VPN you can't edit
or expand the list of static routes
associated with the tunnels
are there any access requirements as
well
yes to manage IPSec VPN tunnels on
Oracle cloud infrastructure you must
have been granted full access to network
components within your compartment
how do I ensure availability of my IPSec
VPN connection between Oracle cloud
infrastructure and my on-premise data
center
when you create an IPSec VPN connection
Oracle provisions multiple VPN tunnels
by default it is important that you
configure a minimum of two and ideally
three tunnels for redundancy on your
on-premises VPN device Oracle
automatically routes traffic to your
instances via an available up tunnel in
case any one tunnel becomes unavailable
great I'm now familiar with the various
components and requirements for setting
up the IPSec VPN connection can you take
me through the process of setting up the
connection now
sure before you get started you need to
collate some data points here's a quick
checklist for you to gather the required
background information also draw your
own diagram of your network layout think
about which parts of your on-premises
network need to communicate with your
vcn and the reverse map out the routing
and security lists that you need
here's the overall process for setting
up the IPSec VPN one gather the
background information to set up the
IPSec VPN components
a create your vcn and DRG be attached
the DRG to your vcn see update the
routing in your vcn to use the DRG D
create a CPE object and provide your
router's public IP address e from your
DRG create an IPSec connection to the
CPE object and provide your static
routes three
configure your on-premises router
remember your network administrator must
configure your on-premises router with
general information of about Lavie CN
and specific information for each IPSec
tunnel this is the only part of the
setup that you can't execute using the
console or API without the configuration
traffic will not flow between your vcn
and on-premises network oracle has
published generic templates for
configuring the on-premises router for
IPSec VPN for some known commonly used
devices like cisco juniper Palo Alto
checkpoint and so on these templates
will be helpful for customers to set up
the required configurations at their end
great thanks for the detailed overview
you're most welcome hope this gives you
a better understanding of IPSec VPN
site-to-site tunnels
