content on your FBA site including text
images HTML and Merchandising zones this
content is placed in predefined areas on
the page and the areas are defined in
the different template files many of the
template files already contain default
areas but in this video I'm going to
show you how to customize an existing
template file to add a new area so as
part of this we're going to inspect the
page to determine where we want to add
the area then we're going to edit the
item details TPL file in our custom
module to add the new area and finally
we'll deploy the change to our local
server in tested first let's determine
where to place the area on the page so I
go to a page on my site where I want to
add the new area and in this case I want
to add a new area to the item detail
page so I'll browse to an item page
Marney logged in to site management
tools and if I go into edit mode I can
see the existing areas on an item detail
page I want to create a new area where I
can place a specific content you can see
I already have some page specific areas
these are labeled this page I want to
add a new area right here I need to know
where to place the div that defines the
new area so I'm going to inspect the
product detail page and search for the
string dated there CMS - area and that
will let me quickly jump through the
page and inspect each of the existing
areas before I do that though a logout
of site management tools so that the
site management tools controls don't
show up in my search now I'll go back to
the item detail page and do the search
you
and this is it here it's called item
underscore and so underscore bottom so
now all I need to do is open my template
file
find this div and add my new div
directly behind it next we need to edit
the item under score details TPL file in
the custom module the div that defines a
site management tools area has two
attributes the first is the data CMS
area which is a user-defined name for
the area and the second is the data CMS
area filter and it determines on which
page is the area displays the filter can
have one of three values global which
displays the content on every page page
type which displays the content only for
the specified page type and path which
displays the content only for the
specified URL for our new area we're
going to use Pass
I already have everything in place for
my custom module and you can see that
right here I have my item details
template file open I just need to search
for this string that we found when we
inspected the page and that was item
underscore info underscore bottom
so here is the div segment that we
already have on our page we want to add
a new one directly below this one and
you see that I've named it item
underscore info underscore bottom
underscore page-specific that's just a
name for it and the data CMS area
filters accept two paths now we save it
and play it to the local server and
confirm the change
there we see the override
now this local server is up and running
so let's refresh this and we'll log in
the site management tools come back to
our item detail page go into edit mode
if we scroll down we see our new area
right here insulated this page so let's
talk about these two areas for just a
second the first area labeled product
detail pages any Content placed in that
area will display on any product detail
page in our new area which is labeled
this page any Content that we put there
will display only for that specific page
in this case it would display only for
this vini page once you've had a chance
to test it all you need to do is deploy
it to your development SSP application
