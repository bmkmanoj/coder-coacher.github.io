good good
my stewart's
so this is what we need to build think
the best bet is to set out oops
like this so now you gonna say that
so reactivation all react native
navigation that's the question
things better if I go with the aviation
and I'm gonna need three dogs three dogs
we ducks down react a follow-ups
you
you
just for now videos are fine and nothing
more now just like okay just air counts
reducer because I'm gonna have I'm gonna
have the reducer for apply answer like
this okay
just for now
so my up here gonna have the I'm going
to take the provider of redox fern and
I'm gonna juice
you stick that
here we can add a stagnant Gator and at
alligator now here I can see you know
I'm going to need to have my screen
now I can't just keep and your C decks
and we're gonna see just like that and
now I can go back to my rotten and
importing my feed from screen feedings
now your CV and now what I can do what
I'm going to need to do
it's creating a component here and in
this one finale so now I'm going to see
app main this one's going to need to be
connected
map state the props boom after that Eric
and creating my
or Irfan I can just take dispatch and
also the state coming in from the lab
state of crops and after that here can
see navigation and I plus data like this
like this like this and now I can just
say export current rather equal app main
nut butter if you good I'm sure I should
have a technique it our data that's it
Bob is done so now here we can just put
some navigation option man I'm so done
without the autocomplete of flight flow
something like that so you're acting
yeah I'm going to navigation option and
then this one I think marketer title I
can see like Instagram yeah
No so I think this thing here should be
the setup so where we when we're gonna
start we're gonna start from here
you
so how can we say it's gonna be I the ID
can be 100 okay after that I should put
the I should put you're gonna have some
border at the top so I can do a straight
bar top we're gonna say one order button
with wit I'm gonna say one and four now
because I like beautiful color like red
and now can save you you can put the
style route and now this story
like that like that yeah oh my god
my feed because I mean Instagram MAV do
we have I mean sorry one sec you know
watch I'm gonna play with the app do
Instagram have the stories on every
route nope nope okay they have in the
search but it's not the same okay yeah
so the feeds gonna have you so the feed
when I import my story is coming in from
my component stories and now I can just
pass my stories right there and you see
right there is gonna be the ID of my
story I can say - so now I'm gonna
create a folder called util inside this
one I'm gonna create another folder
called teams and inside this one I'm
going to create a file called colors as
yet and in this one I'm gonna export
Khan's color and that's gonna be I'm
gonna say white so that's gonna be what
I'm gonna put all my color and now
because I've set up some of the color
I'm gonna say red of envy
things get to just crash yeah brand-new
MacBook Pro and
maybe more green
I don't know black and now what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna go to my team I'm
gonna have a index @gs and in this one
I'm gonna explore my car local meaning
from my color yep
so now what I can do it's my story
then I import the color communing from
my UT on that team and I'm gonna see
color and now here you can have
background color of white now if I do
this perfect
from Allah
No
it's gonna be the stories do when you
scroll the story stay at the top the
story we get remove perfect and after
that here we have the image so we have a
card so because I have no data for the
story I'm gonna keep it like this but
I'm gonna start to do that core call a
feed car I'm gonna go to my story I'm
gonna take everything takes it there say
free car and I'm gonna after that take
that go to my ear and see I'm gonna have
one here and now I can work on my feet
cause so the ID I think the ID I cannot
really say I I but I can we put them in
ID and I'm gonna say before hundra I'm
gonna have no border no nothing but for
working with that right now I can just
say well I'm gonna have others who's

background color of Y and this one have
a padding of 15 and 10 I can see

can you roll this thing
okay
thirty-five I'm gonna say 40 40 and
border-radius
of 40 divided by two so what we can do
for that is we can create here inside
the time matrix

twin what
and so network interface
really
you
oh yeah so phoenix alex is just so in
exits another language
Lulu looks like Ruby and and it just
really really perform an and really easy
to write code in that is just crazy and
Phoenix you just like a rapper so thing
about Phoenix like rails for Alex rails
for Ruby so this one is the rails for
elixir and it just like if you look here
you set up your schema and stuff like
that and after that you have your kind
of function like we did in graph QL and
in in no GS it just for me this language
looks very very nice and also it's a
very very performant and really good for
WebSocket and this is what I'm gonna
show so the first video is gonna be
about building this stuff and getting
this kind of career where we can get
like the photo with the user ID but a
lot of like cons the comments come
double that and also a user can come in
and add tag it to a photo actually
around so we're gonna have a lot in this
tutorial so that's why when I'm gonna
release it we can have like almost all
all we need and 50 and 15 video done so
the first day I'm gonna release it so
you can have the time to learn this
little stuff ajor you

link so here we see now
oh yeah oh no problem even oh yeah I
find the view and Jarrow hey what's your
general process when southern you
project what do you plan on oh yeah it
doesn't for me I mean I don't know where
to start so that's why I like when I did
this project I did like I sketched
before like deer and when I came here I
just like after I've done like what
Instagram was I just finally okay I'm
gonna need that I'm gonna need that I'm
gonna need that I'm gonna eat that and
okay thank you you know and I bought the
technology for me I started with the
back end first after that I can came
with my friend and I get my stuff thank
you oh wow
okay so I'm going to need now
yeah about the caching
okay okay they asked we're gonna add
graph QL tag I think they say two
graphical tie and graph cure
after that they say that and after that
they say that
oh nice nice
nice yeah sometime when you when you
don't want to use video it's gonna be
awesome
it just meant this why don't like apple
oak okay so oh it's coming from Apollo
client now really
oh boy and do when you go to Europe
Allah provide are you still use Apple
provider like that okay so for that it's
good could not find star in other the
context of crops or it Arab the root
component in provider or I sorry my chat
I thing is really really slow to some
diet just ear could not find store
you
okay I see I see I see I see I think I
understand I need my provider now from
react react we docked and now I can wrap
and now this one's gonna have my store
yeah I think that's going to be the hood
finale I mean now what I can do it just
yeah so I'm gonna create a folder called
graph you are maybe not really many now
I gonna work it in my feet I'm gonna
have like SQL and inside this one I'm
gonna have my stuff and I'm gonna have a
victories bakeries that GS and now I'm
gonna need to import it from graph QL
tag from what I've read and now I'm
gonna export default I think so
looks like like this now I'm gonna just
take all of them and I'm gonna say QE
feed crease to wreath equal
why'd you do
okay so for now
just for now just because I want to have
that set up for today
really
need to make sure I have my idea
yeah thank you even for that I didn't
know the other new dogs oh we have the
render item we have the constructor
Singlish oh we need we need the most
important thing I think it's data either
prop the feed corrida oops that kind of
looks like pick your feet tree
oh man I don't like it I'm gonna just
change here I'm gonna say photos I mean
if I see just photo like that yeah
you're gonna came as data all right I
mean like that and now I get as a
Vickery photo like I can come here and
see photos you know well not one or two
and why distinct keeping so I'm gonna
just coming out this one for now
yeah of that so I'm can go to my feed
car removing the background color red in
the background color blue so blue and
red and now what I can do it's for the
other tour here that's gonna be these
the props that data dot use our avatar
really what do you mean by alias
oh yeah but like I I mean I I did hear
like that
okay so yeah I learned that like I think
like two day ago so I still learning a
lot so you all three come in here the
tags
you
you
and I don't like to do this like this
I'm gonna say
you
and now
Sunday night summer spring winter Monday
morning but the thing it's should put
that in a view and the view is going to
be a style of style and on this one it's
going to be a flexed
flex one and marching when I sit
padding-left of five and I'm gonna say
flex direction of row and I'm gonna say
justify contain of center-aligned item
of Santa I don't need the padding you
know what because I'm gonna put the
margin here and I'm gonna see merging a
left of five oh boy oh yeah mmm
ear effects start what the background
color
okay okay okay okay Kiki Kiki it's
because of the meta item it's not a flex
direction of row yep
so now I can say Center and now here
flex start then now I need to change
looks like I have no passions for this
little design study so what happened so
I can delete that and now
so I think if I put John snow in a view
and this one I mean I know it's bad but
just forcing yeah so now they're gonna
Kim like that but now stall that met
username and now if I do this I'm gonna
get a line item Center flex one and
justify contain I see flex started oh
man I'm really bad so this thing its
center back start
okay okay we're close now we're close
but this meta it's going to be zero
point four and maybe zero point three
okay so now we can remove the red from
here well now we're gonna get another
problem I mean I don't need to put a
flex here because if I don't put a flex
you're gonna just take that space as as
you need and this one's gonna just fill
out but now you see the problem right
now I get a big problem right here
yes that was a problem zero that was
they came from the same pattern but
because of I told want to take the Flex
one you take the full height of esperen
but just putting a text without a flex
you don't take the full height so the
tech just take finally the light the
line I need so that's why you said let's
get like that looks like this yeah
now our Instagram work when you have a
lot of terrier they do a new line okay
so finally what they do it's like here
you call that a flex wrap and you see
wrap and meta item i'm sposed weather
I know it's bad but just for now okay
and now I need to so okay for what I'm
gonna get more attack I can do this
later low now what I want to do is I
just want to make sure that I can like
because I can I mean in my back end
right there right now I can create a
mutation why I do it create a light or I
put the photo ID right now because I
have no user stuff what I've done it's
it's what I've done now it's inside my
reaction here create light my resolver
sorry you see here when I create a like
it you see finally the user ID is gonna
be one so finally just thing like it's
always a user ID one so now if I like
you see so example right now I have one
like have one like on the number one so
now if I like suppose us to see to know
yet I can do this mutation quite easy
oh boy okay I see see so now so what it
should be better for me to do it's this
one get up as a create like function and
now I'm going to need to get there
compose because I are going to have more
and now it's here I'm gonna have Mike
read like oh yeah and I'm gonna call
that as a prop so you have on props I
don't need that yeah I'm gonna just
passing oh yeah I need their own props
and I think it's mutatis I don't think
one sec
thing after that that's going to be done
for me for tonight my eyes are really
really bad right now
okay so I was close
so here I'm going to need to pass
through the photo ID
we have access to this unlight function
very well
mm at one request fail with status of
Fondren
so I started like last week but I like
play just for fun cause I mean in same
time I've learned a lecture so but I
mean I just did the back end really
quick and now I just play with the front
end and after I'm gonna do the video
about how I did that
so in same time that's gonna be good for
me to just go over all what I've done
I did wrong quick like
oh thank you I really I really
appreciate then you you when you like it
I just want to really start to do a lot
of video about Phoenix in the lecture
and maybe just just do simple little
application but just forgetting like all
that stuff like this one Instagram was
good for learning how to do like a
following like like I mean learning how
to do a like a following and so this is
what I sit whether people who start it's
always like I always clone the website
because I just want to learn all they do
stuff like example a social media it's
like you're gonna do this for client for
sure after that you're gonna have some
real time stuff so that's why it's good
thing to like build discord or slack or
something like that
after that do ecommerce for learning or
to do payment system something like that
so you can do like a kind of udemy clone
or something like that
have a good night I hope you enjoy sorry
I play in HQ in same time like you know
the new application from the vine
HQ up this thing here I'm gonna almost
it's almost done
oh yeah it's the same for me Anais if I
can help you on that for me I'd my
problem is I always try to do like
example I want to build something I'm
gonna do with the stuff and when I get
stuck sometimes too much I just want to
just quit in
I really don't know this them
mara don't that's not what happens
what'd I do wrong so I like my back-end
get the curry you see you know what
happened is it's a mutation create life
who we take the photo like but I do the
stuff the thing is I just think it don't
get past the photo ID
you see undefined so create like this I
create like go to my free car and now
this oh my god you see I don't see see
right so you see sorry my iPhone it so
now if it's working now we are supposed
to see here a delete action boom
delete from like photo where the ID is
equal to the 14 because they did a
select blah blah blah so now so if i
refresh I should have one yeah perfect
now the question is okay yeah but are
you gonna update this thing you see
right now so now I'm gonna need to do an
update store and after that I'm done
with this go out do the still up day
like here so after you mutate if I
remember you have the update here where
you have the store and your create like
function
and that's gonna be my figurine I want
to override this one and now after that
I'm going to say I need to find my
element
so that's gonna be there at that speed
that's gonna be photo but find the
element wired the element that ID called
a photo ID and after that the new data
for this one is going to be what EF but
the lights huh
it's going to be what you have plus one
and now here store the right Cory and
now I see the same pure again Vickery
and I see that I was gonna be the photos
and now I can see that the photo no I
should have a 68 50
you
you
feed us cow
oh yeah see when I'm like you oh oh I
think it's because here no oh yeah it's
because you have calleth Curie's I think
our wedding result to stall for Chloe

get my element

eyes right now is really really bad
