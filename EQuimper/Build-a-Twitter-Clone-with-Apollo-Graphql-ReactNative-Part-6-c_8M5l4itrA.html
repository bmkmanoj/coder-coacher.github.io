mobile stuff now so what we gonna do
today is I'm going to just go over a
starter kit I build for this project why
I did that is because on the last time
with the meetup app we get a bit
overwhelmed because everything was
changing and stuff like that so what I
have thing is we're going to go over
with like a butterfly's set-up time with
every like stuff with a good version in
the package.json so we're going to make
sure then someone else came in like a
month we don't going to break everything
so this is what we're going to do today
and I'm going to go over everything as
buildable react with that I don't know
let you with stuff you don't know what
we do first thing we're going to use
Expo Expo what is Expo Expo it's also
exploits I mean it's the way to build
the aggressive app right now when you
don't need to do like a lot of
background kind of stuff and and yeah so
I mean so it would expose it's a way to
force thing for the Windows user to
build iOS app so don't think it's like
like they see in their explanation here
it's like kind of a Ruby on Rails for
magnetic so you have a lot of already
billion package for example if you want
to have the photo capture like you want
to do some kind of photo shot or stuff
like that in your app you don't need to
like connect the image picker stuff
coming from a real native community and
stuff like that it may be like break
your Xcode stuff and thing like that
will expose you just need to import the
camera and you're good to go so this is
really awesome so for the setup of that
so me for me I'm going to use the CLI so
I love this command line stuff and so
this is what we're going to add it's
we're going to use the CLI so for you I
really want you to install the Global's
of your expo and for the iOS user if you
want to use it you're going to need to
Alex Cole and stuff like that and I
don't want to go over the installation
of the stuff so really if you
want to like to go over the installation
of react native and stuff like that just
go over the reactive dog here and go to
where the guests start a you click on
the building project when that is code
and all you're going to get all the
setup stuff and you can have a microwave
android windows and stuff like that and
I really want you to read that because I
don't want to go over that because this
course is not about react native instead
it's about how to build an app with
graphical and react native and no geo we
have already a lot of port to to to
learn so the the starter so I've treated
thing this mobile starter it's pretty
much simple so this is what are we going
to do so just for sitting this thing
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
chrome this thing you can fork it you
can do whatever you want with going to
work so now you are in the root of your
project where you can see the server you
know you do get clone you pass this
thing and you call that like mobile like
something like that so nice that I can
jump on mobile and make sure as my stuff
perfect I'm gonna run a yarn
install or I can just run yarn after I'm
gonna run another tab and I'm going to
just go inside my server and I'm going
to just run my server because I'm going
to need that because of Apple oh my
server is running and now this thing is
installing the apparently don't don't
worry like I told you we going to drop
on everything I just want to make sure
everyone is at the same place here and
I'm going to open my Visual Studio code
right inside a mobile folder perfect now
or we can start with expo we're going to
drum EXT start so here we export going
to make sure the project is set up
correctly if yes you're going to create
a project we're going to see that in a
moment
so your project look good perfect this
sounds good this is what we want after
that you're going to see oh wow what is
that it's a your code yes with expo you
can download their expo application on
the App Store or the Play Store and
after that you can take your phone
grab your QR code stuff right from here
and now you can play with you you will
app right inside your phone in real time
so that's just crazy
now here what I'm going to run in so I'm
going to run exp iOS I'm going to run
Expo opening for my iOS yeah so now that
opening iOS I'm gonna work on iOS but I
came with what I've seen from my stuff
everything was working with anywhere to
if you have question again you can eat
me on the comment so now we're going to
make sure so here I'm running on iPhone
6 so why I'm running on iphone 6 because
for me right now I don't really care
about iPhone 6 and lower because we're
gonna like you I mean we had a lot of
fun to care so i phone 5 s maybe but 6
is the most where I work so now when the
refreshing stuff
the mixture is working and now you see
now if you see this thing welcome if you
see that mean everything is worked
perfect we good to go it just build this
book no I'm just giving right there what
are we going to do I'm gonna go over the
code I've done and this is so because
like I told you we need to add all this
version and I don't want you to like
copy and pasting my stuff coming from
that description and make sure you have
this version just all with this kit and
we all make sure I've done installing
everything because this thing is are
just on one row I know maybe 10 break my
stuff so here we add a react almost like
react cyber so alpha to oil this is what
X Pony we have Expo 19 after that we
have Apple ok and 1.9 point 0 0 make
sure this is receivable zero because
zero point one this thing just at the
top here you see that as we just break
the app we get our error with this and
react navigation we work on the reactor
data 11 this is the last one we dogs if
you have readers and stuff like that or
all there yes I'm going to still use
redox Apollo makes a lot of suffer but
we're going to save or use video after
that a dsdm like we have in the backend
after that the ESN right there after
the battler see I don't need setup it's
already built as put editor config
forget everyone working within the size
of two and working with space after that
inside the ad the GS this is why we
store the application so this thing it's
where the app is working so as you can
see important react nothing strange UI
manager is to get the layout animation
enable experimental it just like
automatical automatically animate view
to their a new position where the next
are happening so it is more for like
Android stuff but I just set up like if
we have it accessible we're going to
just set up that to be true after the ad
Apollo provider so this is from react
Apollo so for the one coming from redox
that's going to be that's going to looks
like the provider from you guys and yes
here the photo provider take the store
and the client the store it's just so
like we did with redux it's going to be
the redux store and the clients gonna be
the Apollo Cayenne I'm going to show you
that in the moment what is then provider
so I'm going to make use a time
component so if we search right there
for style components that's calm it's
finally it's a way to build CSS and
JavaScript and oops not the github but
if I click on documentation it's all the
stuff here like it's all like he's like
a glamour risk for the one who didn't
know that like a word finally to just
build really a visual component and not
need to do like CSS stuff and I just
like it and in the magnetic just makes
sense and I'm going to show you some
stuff and I what I've used to is the
teaming stuff right there were here you
can pass a team and now you can have
multiple team stuff like that so inside
my code what is the screen colors it's
like put inside a source inside user my
constant I put a constant called colors
and I put the color of Twitter like the
blue of Twitter and the song under green
stuff like that and when I pass them to
the temp provider as a colors like that
what happen is if I go to my welcome
page example this is all you create a
component with the user here I just say
that's going
we have you there's going to be a text
and now I can use them like that was a
comforter but now look at this I can say
props that team that white so by doing
this I'm going to get the white color
from here so if I did prop that team
that primary I'm going to get the
primary code from here so after that I
can just change the code from you that's
going to change there and yes you can
told me yes but that you can also import
a color yes but I mean I may be lazy and
I don't want to do this but I like this
way perfect so here inside add that GES
now we have the welcome so the component
I just show you would just show a
welcome if you see that that work and we
have to component from cell component
inside that I call always a top one as
the route and I've put text for now for
this one so you don't you see I don't
need to import we act as if I just
import style coming from slash Nessie
really important if you use my snip app
we do EMS n like that and you get that
for my sickbed you go there you search
for react and that's going to be this
one here with my name perfect after that
the store slowly the thing you want to
see oh I get to this point so here we're
going to create the store like we did
with read up I'm going to make use of
readers devtool extension what I'm going
to show you in the next it is odd and
this is just a dev tool to a just a way
to make the reader that saw working also
with reactive because by default is not
working after that we're going to make
use of that for loop lion so we need to
import a new Apollo client so this is
what we create a variable with the net
falling so fast and finally during that
water fast it's an instance of the
create network interface from here we'll
take the URL the uary
why are you grass fuel is running and
this is my back-end stuff so if i click
on this thing that's going to be my
back-end stuff so that's why I like if I
do graphical like that and that's called
like that but yes it cool like this now
I'm good after that ear I speak on
middleware so I like to do my stuff so
here I put the client middleware so the
guy in the middle war so this is all you
can get like access to the middleware
coming from Apollo and I'm going to put
tongue with
no matter what almost everyone known in
the redox world going to make us be able
to do asynchronous actions after that
here this is the thing why would you
don't maybe gonna see a lot it's air I
could my store and I do reducers and I
put a client then because my reducer
need to receive the client to do up a
load line reducer so this is the word
Apollo Act us to put the reducer it by
putting there they put in their deck
they put that inside the same file and
this is pretty easy but for me I like to
manage my stuff so that's why I put that
as a function here and I put a client
reducer for me and now I combine with
you sir and after I put initial state of
undefined I do the compost with their
tool coming from here reacted that's all
extension and I do the stuff like that
here we have almost done see I don't do
I don't eat I didn't do a lot and now I
mean we are good we have something wrong
I mean just like I just said up the
social I don't want ain't nobody here to
get break and here I mean if you like
this stuff you can just start up a new
set up with that and I have nothing more
I just set up to make sure nothing going
to break with the other versions so now
when I'm going to work with with you on
the on the other video I'm going to just
add the other packaging and I'm going to
make sure they are not breaking with the
version we run but keep in mind all this
version in the package is done need to
always stay the same you can try and go
rogue and try to oh yeah I can try the
next version of react like that but if
that break that's going to be art from
yesterday to manage that so out that
makes sense I'm going to put the link in
the description for you as you can see
that was really simple you clone this
stuff and you set up this thing in the
root why I see the root you can make
that another report you want for me just
because I want to ask my both we pull
right inside my roots like that so hope
you enjoy it out you're going to enjoy
the mobile part that's going to be
awesome
trust me on that we're going to learn so
much we are learn subscription we
mutation we're going to learn the key
stop we're going to look up Timmy sticky
why and after that you're going to just
fall in love like I did with rescuing an
apollo apollo make my life so much
easier and right now in the front end
and I just cannot live without them so I
hope you enjoy and we're going to talk
in the next one
have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
