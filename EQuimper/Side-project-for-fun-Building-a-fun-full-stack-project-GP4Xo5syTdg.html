I'm gonna do this so I'm gonna do change
a bit of the disease and I've did
yesterday so I want to make it that bit
I think it's gonna be it looks better
and this is what I want to do from now
and I'm gonna just change the title here
for find me movie so know what I want
find the leads I want just Excel here
ooh so you can scroll and that's gonna
be the maybe a bit more than the apps
going to be the picture of the movie so
we don't gonna really change something
but here we're gonna have the face of
one of your friend of theirs someone you
follow who just rate this movie so and
what I'm gonna do it in the back end
it's I'm gonna show their economic Rico
foundation it's gonna be about which
movie in your friend the the most recent
West with the the better with you so the
only thing I need to change now it's my
flat list here right there so inside my
render horizontal item so this is this
one so now the thing I don't understand
if i sat with of one et and I put a
background color of red hey okay so this
is what I was thinking and when I put a
width of 100 I get nothing no no I get
something
if I remember I scrolled you Sheila I
stopped like what I want it's like I
want my the swipe to just be like one
one movie at a time oh yeah
so I think it's the naked last version
of 48 he came with the slider so now
here I should have Unchained visible
Kelvin I set up you little chain know
oh really I can no nope nope so I think
I have no possibility to do what I want
to do because now it's I my feet small
car where I am right now here my route
so now if I put a background so I've
begun cut off my route and it don't
looks like you work so if I remove the
wheel
no but if I put a width of example 180
yeah inside the number so if I see flex
more do we gonna take the floor nope
so you're really gonna need to put
because now I don't want anymore
border-radius so I want this movie to
take the fool it's gonna be a bit higher
so 200 so after that I can know 180 was
good but now maybe if I take my
dimension and I create Arab oil ball
it's equal to the dimension that get
Windows so this way you can get the in
pixel all much the width and I see so
just with I do yeah
perfect so this is what I want oh it
depend on me hell it's like weed I mean
it's for me I use release for the a
memory so I mean it's but I really love
MongoDB in same time but for now I'm
using Postgres for my Kenneth's own
project I restart too real of a sequel
database so what I'm gonna do
so nothing I'm gonna just remove this
wrapper put it down
gonna just we say so that's gonna almost
remove everything I'm gonna just so what
I want now it's I want to separate my
image ear in two so what I mean by that
it's my image it's gonna take like gonna
stop here so what I can maybe do I'm
gonna need to have another rapper for
this one I'm gonna have my image because
my image gonna always take that the full
cycle of is rapper and I'm gonna have
another rapper ear so this one's gonna
have a type of style the image rapper
and I'm gonna just put it with flex also
I want maybe 60% of the Flex and this
one phenomenal just say hello and I'm
gonna just put style and this one's
gonna have a style of contain rapper and
this contain rapper now is gonna add a
flex of 0.4 but now I think I'm gonna
need to change my rapper so the one who
would go so that Iran to be Row was in
the row so no that should be the route
sorry about that
if I put their root now I'm gonna have
perfect so this is what I want so it
looks a bit better I think so now the
background here is gonna be white yeah
so this is what I think I'm gonna won
but now I want to remove from the image
the bottle radius okay so now what I
think it's too too too big maybe 150
yeah I think it's gonna be better like
that
but I think I'm gonna make it point five
and point five no I want it point six
point six but now this ear now I'm gonna
have my friend icon here with his name
right there and I'm gonna have like
everything and here I'm gonna have like
the first maybe like twenty character of
what you write so what I'm gonna do so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just we
put the new style rapper this one
uncommon this thing but now if I want to
other well let's see if I'm gonna just
put it right there and I need to put the
image rapper with the position when I tu
so now if I save that sure okay now I
just think this text it's too big so I'm
gonna maybe put like 18 yeah sounds good
the subtitle font size I'm gonna put
like 15 yeah and what I wanted after
each one of them
so right there what I want it's right
there I'm gonna see if I it's not equal
to zero so if it's not the first one I
want to have this so what I can do is I
can say is well like that if I do this
okay yeah but I shall say if category
that land minus one yeah perfect but I'm
gonna need one space
yep yep yep yep yep but style category
and I see - now that thing is gonna look
a bit better I'm gonna have the movie
like that so now I'm gonna just design
this this box but I want you to put like
some background color ear in my car so
I'm gonna just uncomment this one
sixty because it's gonna be tenure so
now I think I'm gonna remove the
recommendation at the top I don't want
that I don't want more dinged up
kind of light yet
yeah this is I'm gonna go and now I'm
gonna just design my right side right
there so I'm gonna put the other tower
here and it's name here I'm gonna put
desert is reading yeah this is what I'm
gonna do so finally here
this movie is gonna be like the five so
not the fiber that's gonna be a list of
latest reviews from you you the one you
follow so like I told you yesterday when
you you like some movie like act like
you some category of movie like example
for me I really love each morville and
DC comic movie I know someone else like
it and like I always like have the same
kind of who you really like so I can
just follow him and see what he watch
and if I can find some new movie and TV
show and well know of this what I think
I'm gonna do I'm gonna change
I can maybe be put to the bottom later
I'll put it there not yet
I can why it's not there
oh because it should be there right
thing
yeah
so my content wrapper it's like that I'm
gonna have another view right here I'm
gonna have style that met rapper this
one's gonna have a flex Fighting's gonna
take like maybe 0.4 and I'm gonna just
put a background color yellow for now
and I'm gonna have another ear rapper
but this one's gonna have a style of
review rapper because that's gonna be
like the review of your friend and for
now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put
some low-rent
text oops but I'm gonna remove some of
this that perfect
take the Flex one but here I need really
a bit more six maybe five okay and my
content wrapper I'm gonna put some
padding like off to a bit more like five
so now I get some padding around
everything okay so now here the ellow is
gonna be replaced by an avatar
so yeah I'm gonna separate that in to
order box inside one of them I'm gonna
have my image for now I'm gonna use my
avatar so I think I put that in the feed
car so I'm gonna just copy paste that
just for now and I'm gonna say yo a fake
URL and I'm gonna say style that avatar
that oMG for image this one's gonna be
style of avatar rapper
so I think I'm going to just put that
this one's going to have a flex off with
0.4 in here I'm gonna say flex direction
row because I want left to the right and
now my avatar mg is gonna have a width
of Neil and I know this one's going to
justify contain Center and a line item
Center but my wit frankly I want to be
like 40 40 and a border radius of 20 to
be take here sting it's too big so 30 30
15
what happened
oh I see flex one that's maybe why okay
yeah I think I'm gonna go with this side
but my a line item is gonna be flexed or
yeah and 0.42 being I'm gonna see tree
and I'm gonna see - yeah why I did that
there it just because I want to make
sure like yeah I can put some margin but
the thing it's I get some whip problem
with bigger size and I don't want that
to happen anymore but zero point wrist
it's too slow too - laughs so I'm gonna
see 0.35
I just want yet so now I get some margin
so now my name can go right there so
what I'm gonna do so you have the avatar
now here I'm gonna have my style of
style that we view a rapper and I'm
gonna have to text one's gonna be like
it username and this one's gonna be a
text is gonna be icon like I want to
show a five-star review so I'm gonna
just put the name for now oh
so now it's gonna go right there to be
as a fun side
he acted better also I'm gonna put
number of flying maximum of one so I'm
gonna get the dot if you go more than
one line and now I really want to have
like my five star ears so what I'm gonna
go I'm gonna go to vector icon
ello ello
or you'd store okay I'm gonna go with
the iron-icons and I have already so
that's perfect so I'm gonna create a
component called feed card store reading
that yes so this one is gonna be a
finally just a star reading stuff for
now I'm gonna just make it with just a
functional so vector icon you need Khan
and what I won here it's gonna export
you full a function feed card store
reading return you're gonna have some
props the props I think I'm gonna pass
is gonna be the reading itself so I'm
example if I say I'm gonna stick for
this water so it's gonna be a number so
I'm gonna start reading and there's
going to be type of props and now here
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna have a
view and a size sheet
I'm gonna salute like always perfect so
now what I'm gonna do it's reading
finally yeah it's gonna be a number so
what I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do
it's ear I'm going to second with things
equal don't even remember I can do this
here
what I'm gonna do
I don't know like what I'm gonna do but
for now
name I think that was I Oh a store call
our phone I'm gonna put read-only inside
I'm gonna put maybe 20 and I'm gonna put
a key equal to RA
I really don't like this but for now
I'm still I'm really stupid because I
always want five
what I can do so if I do this too much
that caught our ears gonna be yeah it's
gonna be
at least for now too big again
perfect
and I want him to have some space so
what I'm gonna say I'm gonna say star
wanna see merging left of two and I
don't want to toggle the first one so
a bit what I want no it's bad code but
an easy word for now and I want here the
note I can just put that in the reading
and what I'm gonna see here it's I'm
gonna say average reading it's gonna be
another number
now I'm gonna need to have a text I'm
gonna put it right there
why did I put everything and I'm gonna
see average reading I'm gonna see 7.5 so
I'm gonna manage it it's really wrapper
I cannot of like it yes I'm gonna use a
color I know I can maybe like
now change the review give you rapper
styler review this one gonna have a
color orgy orgy being 2 to 3 and 31 and
I'm gonna smooth this oh maybe no
no it's really - maybe gonna go as a
palette of color right next to me so no
think I'm gonna go with more distal
so I think for the rear I'm gonna go
with that this red it's maybe
I might you tell I'm gonna create a file
called constant that yeah and inside
this one I'm gonna have one of my
constants gonna be colors I'm gonna try
with that and sign my star
yeah I think I like it much more
for this review I'm gonna say number of
flying no more than one two three four
five star that's gonna tranq it for me
and I need to put a font size of 13 and
I don't like this color so I'm gonna use
greyish
I mean that's great but like to to to I
think it's gonna be good I don't want
black so yeah but black to to to energy
be a oh yeah can use the package and
p.m. colors I think
no not this one
this one so what I want to use this is
because I want to add in X but I don't
want to manage like all the RGB and
stuff like that so here that's coal I'm
gonna take it in my constant I'm gonna
say black like that I'm gonna go here
I'm gonna import colors from color oh
yeah they put there and now what I'm
gonna do is these colors I'm gonna
import first my constant now what I'm
gonna do is you put your color inside
and you see like name finally so what I
mean it's you say color you put your
color and you say like them and give me
0.5 do you work
oh it's cold back here okay I want so if
I do this No
hmm no I mean not like that colors that
yeah that was like I did alpha maybe the
Alpha
oh yeah now it work so now like when you
see like kind of color like that when I
want to change the white I can just do
this not for now but because it like
this way you don't need to change your
variable but you're gonna have your RGB
for that now I can remove a new variable
thank for this one it's better
yeah but here I put 7.5 but that should
be like 4.5
okay
now I'm gonna change this thing so
finally I want to have a list and what I
want its ear we can add like TV show
movie and you can scroll a bit like
Netflix do but from your feed
yep yep yep yep
what are you working on this everyone
are you working on some of your side
project you are if some of you asked
what I'm doing it just like a social
media for like movie and TV show just I
really love it but it's like just an
update of the thing I've done to inside
my 12 and 12 challenge so if you want to
see like the video why I did this app
but didn't like push it to the star
something like that this is the link so
I want to do like almost the same kind
of stuff but much more advanced feature
with stuff saving inside of the real
database and stuff like that then
by doing new UI when I don't know what
to build or to build its test
but
I think the top is done I think I'm
gonna stay with that so you when you
click that you're gonna have a list of
movie you need to watch later so
think I can maybe put their link when
you click that you add this movie to
your list watch it later
and now yeah yeah I'm gonna have my
swapping right and left and I have some
sitting I don't think I'm gonna go with
this side menu something you gonna just
not for now at least
something I can do it's good
magnification and I know the maybe don't
want to have setting because that's
gonna be my profile
he will come
255 83 84 255 8284 255 83 84 255 83 84
should I should have to other tab so I
should have one before this one who's
going to be in cinema and another one
this one's going to be to watch screen
so I'm gonna have
okay
it's kind of icon I can put for that
maybe
yeah like this one TV from what is your
name
not area like so I want it to be this
one material like on tv
2d so that's great but I'm like to watch
I put my out of my navbar
okay yeah I put 50 and the second one
why I'm gonna say in cinema hello
what do you mean by list like a list or
run yeah maybe like that like you want
to see man I really don't know what I'm
gonna go with that for now
run
okay yeah you mean Alice yeah I think
I'm gonna go with that for now
like this is that something I really
want to lose time for now but oh
run fast because you want to run and see
it yeah so like that
I'm gonna have my movie now this is this
thing I don't know but I think it's time
to do some back-end stuff and see oh I'm
gonna do this or
plus I'm gonna put the placeholder when
you load
yeah I think we can jump on some
back-end stuff and look oh sorry
what the movie database API time to
create the API for that stuff what do
you think about that working on the
server-side I get the time I just think
about how I'm gonna do my I'm gonna do
this design so so so didn't have me be
an icon yeah
okay
really
I can keep it start so what I'm gonna do
it since I'm my Mojo's I'm gonna have a
module called movies and one of them is
gonna be TV shows I'm gonna have a
module about icon so for the user I'm
gonna have a module call for now I'm
gonna just go that I'm gonna go to the
movie is so movie movie
right
movie movie movie movie movie movie /id
get
I know we're gonna test it with the pop
fly so get moving
popular I'm gonna go with
but now we're gonna just try
Oh
it may be just and now here
should have done like the movies before
and now I would have put my movie route
so yeah I don't need to put movie and
now here I can export the fold Israel
and now what I want its ear I can
for EPA everyone movies / popular
movies
what I did wrong here
yeah I've created this card for the one
we didn't know I put the link on the
description it just like if you have
some questions sometime I am NOT always
on YouTube so I can and so much more
faster on this thing
that don't came as I want I would like
to have
hello he may just something free image
get image movie / image what is that
poster pad
so what I think I'm gonna deploy it on
Shirley Amazon or or maybe Google App
Engine if I look at the linear copying
address a copy image address image so
what you told me it's if I copy face
this thing
okay okay
oh nice
so I'm gonna create a em data from my
data equal data that reduce or yeah I'm
gonna just finally create my own array
because I don't like the way they have
managed it so I'm gonna say are and so
art is gonna be this error and not one
item so that I'm gonna say current EMG
account post are equal I oh I know
that's a good idea I'm gonna create your
Utah folder
what I'm gonna have a helper helper that
as a so what I'm gonna create it so I'm
gonna create a el parque who's gonna be
cow get movie DB e may post are yet
movie DB post are so you're gonna see
what I want to do here it's gonna be
pretty simple first thing I want off
first thing I don't know why I didn't
set up flow yarn add that deep flow bin
really
I like when I clean my own function to
have flow so here what I'm gonna do so
this function get movie DB poster it's
going to be a per function we're finally
going to take the their constant the URL
of the movie API okay
so this function here is gonna take ID
and a width by default if I have no IDE
I'm gonna say 100 and if I have no
weight I'm gonna see one on drill so I'm
gonna destructuring for that and I'm
gonna say I it's a number and I need to
add a width as a number
and okay so I'm gonna have a I'd end of
it and you're gonna see why because as
you can see in my URL right there so
this is the URL we need for building the
thing if you see we get wit and the ID
and after that we have the ID so a I
shall say ID yeah but maybe not inside
an object
yeah but you're gonna eat it you take it
no I'm gonna sit number and ID is gonna
be a string and then what we gonna
return it's a string so I don't need
that so now in what I'm gonna say is I'm
going to finally just return the URL
slash no it's so an ear /w with the
width and H right best V 2 / ID so this
function
this function gonna take a number and a
strain
perfect now I'm going to import this
function
okay
and you're gonna see why here I'm gonna
sit Khan's movie equal so that's gonna
be one single movie and inside that I
want to add a value of post star who's
gonna be finally equal to get movie
poster
yeah I need to put the I I don't gonna
put default value for now I'm gonna see
100 yen 100 yen and the ID is gonna be
called item that underscore ID and now
I'm gonna just type just for now really
quick type movie and I'm gonna just copy
paste all that you're gonna see why I
really love flow type it's a number it's
a number boolean number it's a string
it's number it's a string so you tack
for any what you got said the way we tap
finally what we got
so this thing is gonna be an array of
number I'm gonna see why it's really
awesome and I'm gonna make it inside his
own folder after that it just so you
type everything you can got and now yeah
but this thing it's almost yeah I'm
gonna see date
oh yeah and yet I was there at that
result what I'm gonna say type data
equal an object where I'm gonna have a
whistle
who's gonna be an aviary of movie I'm
gonna see data equal data so now if I if
I show you that now you see if I just
put my mouse over my item right now
I'm gonna get everything an item can got
so by doing this I can say I turned that
poll start at so that should be post our
pad and not ID
like that and now if I put my mouse over
you see I get get the booster with our
certain dimensions so this is what
happens when you you you add your stuff
here so I'm gonna want to have the movie
DB ID equal to item that ID so that's
gonna be its own ID after that I'm gonna
want to add the title so I'm gonna say
item that title after that I have access
to is the vote average I want to use
mine
maybe release date
so if I do this and now I refetch again
and I crash everything oops
oh yeah
oops
what I didn't grow
well
what
you know what then we move that gonna
remove this and I'm gonna say Knight an
enemy equal to a movie
thing my
that's two parents like that
unexpected token so it's really my bad
well don't like it syntax flow
think that was this thing
what the heck
I'm gonna need Bible core
what
understand why I got that
so I need to put that inside never like
that
no sir okay so now I get the stuff slash
slash oh yeah because this one don't
so now I'm gonna just put this type here
so this is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
see movie DB data like that and I'm
gonna create an index @ GS here right
this one then the export type I'm gonna
import
oh I did that
like this
something is wrong oh my god
yes I know
you
okay so now when I sang I get this kind
of stuff
how much movie do I get so will be nice
to send that in same time so I can
say movies and again sick
20
which Beach
of oh that's true they send me that page
so I can say create biasing data that
page I think each one and now here what
I can maybe get its
so if I want to send a page I can say
recruit page
yeah - like our one and now here I can
say and Paige
I think equal
minion three that work starship true
trooper perfect so my upset is working
oops
okay so so now when I want to get movie
DVID Oh star
you
good good good good
and Paige is still working yeah perfect
that's gonna be my get request here so
that's gonna be get popular movie so I'm
gonna I really need to have
recommendation so this is what I'm gonna
do with the recommendation
I'm gonna slash popular for movie
so I think each that's gonna always look
almost the same for them like I think
each movie gonna almost always look the
same because now I've get popular get
now playing I'm sure if I do this now
playing oh I see something you can
specify a region like what like like
Canada or Quebec
maybe so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
just reuse this same for now
we're gonna see if that gonna work the
same way
yeah the same same way King Arthur don't
think this is what I want to see and
just for testing Quebec
ezal
oh boy
really
Oh like see maybe you know
I'm gonna just don't let to have this
world
IT Iran
so my view one's gonna be rest but my
vetoes gonna be with graph QL so think
what I'm gonna do now it's not my movie
the thing it's it's not a good name here
I should say
and I will call the service
and you're gonna see why in this cigar
oops
Oh
really
oops
still work but now looks cleaner so this
is gonna stay my controller but now I'm
gonna add a services where I'm gonna
call my turbo DPI here
I think he's gonna make my condi bit
cleaner and if I want to do some
business logic I'm gonna go there
because this service here I think I'm
gonna maybe just create a class because
if we look at this I think and always
take almost the same kind of logic and
maybe no because I'm gonna want to a
similar movie so this is I can show
which movie to look at it with the Recon
domination
yeah so
what do you think of this desk oh dear
I mean I'm just take time on this one
just because I think they're gonna
almost all be in the same so if I do
this one room right the other one gonna
be really easy to implement so now I
just remove this function and I think
what I can do it's right there oh no I'm
gonna keep it with the variable
yeah I think this thing is yeah you know
when I get to my controller I just need
to call my services
how we do this it's like that
oh I don't remember
I was close
and I'll check if you good if he looks
right and I didn't get up
is
