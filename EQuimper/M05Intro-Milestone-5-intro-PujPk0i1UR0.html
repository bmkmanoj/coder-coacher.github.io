number five introduction so for this
video is gonna be like the other video
just a little introduction about what we
can build for this week so this week
finally we're gonna do a command feature
so a user can comment on that photo so
as you know right now in the application
we are there we can like unlike a photo
but would like to when we click on add
comment to push to a comment screen
where we can finally come and add a
comment on top of the other one who is
gonna be there so for the first part
this comment is gonna be pretty static
so what I mean by that is you can create
a comment and with a command but no real
time stuff but later in the milestone
five sargon portion we're gonna add the
subscription so we're gonna get that as
a real time so this is what we're gonna
do so we're going to need to create a
photo command module inside the server
create a comment screen also so when
we're gonna click here we're gonna push
the comment screen after that we're
gonna create a mutation for create a
photo so we're gonna add the get a Curie
and a mutation and also we're gonna use
the FNS wits like moment @gs but I like
this one much much more and it's lighter
and that's gonna be for showing that
date for the comment okay so after this
one is going to be done with the command
I think it's gonna be time to add some
testing on this stuff so maybe for this
feature at the end we can add the
testing about like getting the post
action era you know so we're gonna need
to add some pagination here so I hope
you enjoy the series and we're gonna
talk in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
