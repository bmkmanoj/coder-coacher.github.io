three for this my son five so the plan
for this one's gonna be just about some
kind of UI stuff so this is finally what
we're gonna finish with come in because
right now we have just like just plain
plain JSON right inside the command
screen I don't think that would be the
best thing here so the thing we're gonna
do it's gonna be pretty simple just some
come in and the command ear are gonna
have the date we're gonna make use of
data FNS I don't use moment when I use
client stuff just because I think moment
es it's too big so I use date FNS I'm
gonna show you all this in this episode
and we're gonna just set up that also to
get the like icon here so we can after
that start to work on the like feature
in the backend and be able to like so
one thing we're gonna need to add is
because we want to get this date it's to
add insert add value inside the curries
so if we go to the comments screen we
can just add this right there at the top
okay
after that what are we gonna do is we're
gonna create inside a component ear a
new fool our call come in in singular so
that's gonna be a simple plain come in
friendly and in this one we're gonna
just put an index at GS okay this one
we're gonna just finally create a plain
pure component after that we're gonna
just import the view text style sheet
and also we're gonna need the image
because of the avatar after that we're
gonna create a pure component funny in
the class and we're gonna call that
comments so that we're gonna just wrap
it with a view sayyaare sayyaare that's
gonna be a text with ello and finally
we're gonna just put style with root
because I always talk with approved and
I'm gonna just say and I think really
like just out of 50 and just like that
just for now and I'm gonna put that here
in my style that
after that we're gonna go inside index
@gs ear we're gonna do shift command D
to copy this one and then we're gonna do
comment right there just to get both
okay now what we're gonna do is we're
gonna go back inside the comment screen
we're going to replace the flatten the
scroll view with a flat list so what are
we gonna do it's now yeah that's gonna
be a fat list and here we're gonna have
some value okay first thing we need to
have the data and as you can see that is
an object and inside this object we have
the comment so we're gonna say data that
comments I always almost do this when I
start with react native like I when I
start a screen or something like that
what I'm gonna receive data it's I just
show my data right there inside the
screen just because that can give me an
idea when I'm working here after that we
can also need a constructor we're gonna
call this function key instructor I can
type so this one here you remember this
one gonna receive an item so one object
and finally what we're gonna do is we're
gonna do an item that ID so what we want
it just returning something unit so the
ID after that here we're gonna also need
the renderer item and what we're gonna
do is we're gonna call a function window
right then this function gonna be right
there but this one here receive two
thing receive the item and also the
index but we just need to item and now
here we're gonna call the comment we
didn't import yet what we're gonna do
this so now we can remove the shrewdest
view from that you know the comment
gonna came from the common folder
component folder I'm sorry and that's
going to be the comment and now here we
can spread the item like that okay I
think that can be good so now if I save
and I will refresh my screen I'm gonna
go to the one aisle and I'm gonna just
click here and now we see lolol because
this one after comment so now we can
remove the scroll view and one thing
also we can do if you want to just make
it faster because in the air we need to
scroll always is I
thing if I remove we verse no I remember
no we don't have it so we don't gonna
complicate so now we're gonna go in the
comment and what are we gonna do it I'm
gonna click here I'm gonna do command D
and I'm gonna click on enable out
reloading it's not the best thing
because you don't always keep the good
state but at least we can work in the
screen and see the reloading refresh
right there okay so now fold this screen
if we check back the email okay
we need to get that entry container okay
so we have one comment so this coming
here is this thing okay what we need to
do is take one container for the avatar
one wrapper I mean for the content and
another wrapper for the earth and also
this earth here this full wrapper going
to be a touchable so this world the one
with big finger can eat this like button
okay so this is what we're gonna do so
what we need to do its we're gonna
create finally three set of you and
we're gonna already design some ear so
we're gonna add here for the avatar
wrapper content wrapper and for the
button wrapper and why I just say button
because right now we have just one
button you can say button like whatever
you want and now here okay what we can
do so we need to test that the space
okay so we can say that flex one
background color red and a finally I'm
gonna just copy this one here and here
but I'm gonna change the color to be
blue and you need to be yellow okay like
that
now I'm gonna say style style avatar
wrapper
style that content wrapper don't know
what too many thing like that
and finally style and this one's going
to be button wrapper okay now if I say
if we get an error okay and now we see
we get nothing
one thing we need to add is aligned
selves stretch okay okay I maybe know
why so we got any to add some kind of
sorry i refresh so what are we gonna do
it's because now these flags don't take
the day okay take the space after the
refresh so now the roots what we need
it's as you can see we add it top to the
bottom so it's : we want it to be row so
we're gonna see flex direction to be row
okay now if I say if now we see it's a
full flex one of each so each one of
them at the same space but this is not
what we want when we look error so you
know we need to take some space so from
one I I take it the Avatar gonna have
only a flex 0.2 the content that I
always keep one so what I do is I always
keep the bigger one with the Flex one so
both gonna take the space the one but
this one gonna always take the full
space and for the button what I do with
the button its I I see 0.2 also so now
we see because this won't take two and
to the full one take this space but this
won't become bigger because this one is
not anymore one also you see the point
first thing we can do also it's now
changing the height okay because as you
can see when you work with Instagram
they have some common with bigger than
the other one example this one this one
actually I like they all become just
bigger and so I'm gonna just change that
to Avenue
ight of 70 yeah okay yeah let's say I
take this note but I don't remember why
I 70 yeah so now what are we gonna do
with the avatar now it's we have access
to the avatar from the graph QL okay so
remember I spread the prop so we can
have access to the user by doing this
that proves that user and that avatar
for that at all here we can put the
image with the source you re this that
props the user that avatar okay if I do
this and I say now we don't see that at
all because this Avatar need to have
some style because it's not a picture
coming from your mobile it's a picture
coming from the web so react native
don't know how to size it so here we
gonna say style that avatar and we're
gonna take the user we have Korean in
one of the first episode from the youth
cell team and that was the make a circle
so if you remember this function is just
a function and you take a side and we
turning finally the add in the width
with the sides but the border radius
divided by two and now I'm gonna say
avatar here for the style we just have
put there and what are we gonna do is
we're gonna just say dot dot for
spreading that make circle and we're
gonna security okay I know if I do this
now we get on my face okay I see now
that's why we get this problem it was
just finally add I mean I'd seventies
perfect it just they are all stacked
together so so we see here my face right
there so what we need here we want that
to be in the middle so justify contained
Center remember justify contains entire
air because it's row gonna go next
because it will be because it's : gonna
go from the top to the bottom and if we
say a line I 10 we get that from the
left to right okay so now we have the
frame right there so now we can remove
the background cut off that at all
because now we know this is per
okay after that we can do already the
one for the icon so if you remember when
we did the action button in the photo
car we have used this ion icon here for
the light so we can use the same so
we're gonna look the same so like that
close the view put the avatar and we
just need to import it so we say import
from vector icons /i on icon and now we
get that there but it's really really
big and this is not what we want so what
I say it's 15 and now what we need also
its to get this justify content adding
item right in the middle okay like that
this is what we want and we want to
remove the background color and also now
I want that to be a button so important
from a ventral touchable take the
touchable wrap your view with this and
just don't forget to put a feedback of
opacity and now just by doing this we
have a button now the thing is we have
booked here the same style one of the
thing is what we can do it's I mean you
can do a lot of stuff when you work with
react native and you see this kind of
not dry cold but the thing is example I
want to change hunting like I'm I mean
for me I think it just better to have
each one who have his own style you just
because if I want to change the size of
the editor I can change it there but if
both are the same
I'm gonna need to wrap that in celeste
and every nav but the thing you can do
it's inside you you soul inside the team
matrix I think I put that you can create
that maybe like a concentr element and
this thing the what are you gonna do
I'm gonna just say justify contain
Center sorry
and a line-item Center pass it right
there like this and now okay okay I
think the UH Trillo this is one of the
reason why the UH tree load is not every
time the best thing so I'm going to
check in my package package look cool
don't know what happened thing I can
check is just inside my matrix
did I make no it's just a plain object I
think it's gonna be good and now if I go
there it should be good oh no we can
make use of this Center element and now
what we can do
it's replaced on both thing here we play
this bolt here with this period right
there and that's gonna do the same so
now we can get this Center damn and you
can do whatever you want there but I
just think can be nice to just don't
copy yourself there so now we have the
the like and now we can just add that
tag so for adding the text what we need
to do is we're gonna have tweet to to
container and why that it's because we
have this one and we have the date okay
so I'm gonna say a view here and I'm
gonna already wrap that with the text
I'm gonna say this that drops that text
remember that text I get that just
because I spread and there's a drop that
text and for the date there is that
drops that inserted at and I'm making me
stay I forget to put that inside a
texture
okay now we have it okay now we can
remove the blue because it's pretty hard
to work with perfect so now what we can
do
it's first thing I want that to be Santa
with my face right there so what we can
do
it's either say justify content center
just to get from the top to the bottom
but I always want my text to be flex
start so remember what flex star do flex
tour mean you start from here but if I
say flex and now I go to the other side
I want flex start okay now one thing
it's the text it's not what we want so
what we gonna do it's add this library
okay so we're gonna do your add date FLS
if you can turn I think I need to remove
my reload wanna install a package
because I get somewhere problem in the
pass should be good I think so and now
date FNS they have a really good
documentation so you just type that
right there in the left whatever use
choice and I chose a distant in word to
now so finally what they do is they
gonna return something like that like
less than 22nd in about a year like
finally the distance we get like finally
the time that was create vs. now okay
and forgetting that you click here
es2015 you import this one so it because
you don't want to import all the library
like that and now you can just wrap this
thing inside that now if I save and I go
right there
okay now I get like again the metro
building stuff so it's a problem again
which we hang Nets a vector icon so what
you do is you just run this thing
removed on module magnocellular cause
you like or picture packages on and we
should be good after done sorry about
this when I close this and just restart
the packager
so I'll just make a mistake I run the
comment outside of this mobile folder so
just rerun this thing and now we should
be good to go with the reload perfect so
now if I scroll down and I get my we get
about two month at was finally the last
time we did that I'm gonna rerun the
enable at Widow again I'm gonna scroll
down sorry about that this is one reason
why example for the windiest kind of
component I think storybook it's really
awesome for that and this is something I
maybe you're gonna want to show in
future video but for now yeah so just
add I go here in the tag just to get
this I go because right now we just get
about two month and we don't really know
what happened and now here we're gonna
import some stuff from the typography
package and what we're gonna import is
gonna be the human system boy and I
guess colors okay now what we gonna do
it's finally for that text here with the
text right there we forgot to do
something is this is to add the username
so there's that props user that username
and now one thing also because we always
repeat that is that Pro so we can just
destructuring this stuff and say here
we're gonna need the users the text in
the inserted at so now we can just
remove this this that prop ear ear and
ear like that I say everything still war
but I think now it's a bit more cleaner
also you can if you want you can finally
destructuring again say Avatar ear and
also say user name so you don't get any
the user and the dot like that same
thing and now what we're gonna do
it's now we're gonna add some standing
for the text I go from that so for this
one we're gonna just add for a text
style that date so that date when you
get create and for this one what we're
gonna add it's system weight that 10
object we can add also the human caption
1 object so just by doing this we get
that text a bit smaller and now we can
change the color by seing iOS color dot
mid gray and now we get this kind ish
gray okay so that I don't like that it
is too much next to the text here so I'm
gonna just add a date wrapper and so
what I try it
oops what I try to do when I have a
wrapper is put it at the top of the
element and I'm gonna do some merging
top five just to go down a bit but now
that thing is the text if you see here
and you see the preview is not the same
like here we have the Avatar right next
to it so what we do is we can wrap all
that in one text so you can do this like
that and just taking the text like this
and putting space right there and now
what happen it's both become like one
text and now what we can do is we can
sty the full text we're gonna call that
body I'm gonna put that right there and
the body you're gonna have the same
thing as ear but for the human that's
going to be food note object
we'll get a bit smaller but now I would
like my avatar to become a bit bigger so
what you can do is just put in here the
style and you can just add system-wide
Bowl finally so what happened it's gonna
keep the same size as the body but
you're gonna override is font size
that's it yeah so I think that should be
that for this video we'll just about
styling the next one what I would like
is to add this feature about the liking
the command and this way also after that
when we if we create a profile of the
user we can see each like this user so
now when you have no command also we can
maybe add no comment yet please come in
and Chalobah and also what we miss it's
a way to add a new comment so we shall
add your like a button or like an input
and when we click on that that gonna
screw or we can already do this from
here so when you click add come in that
open this also one of the thing in view
out written comment right there we
should change that so inside the we have
the command input but here inside the
photo car so the command input was just
add a comment and we check this provider
like that and navigator so now we can go
back in the photo card just look where
we get this so that was this thing
putting it on press sing this that go to
comment putting that right there
and now this photo car we have already
in the dis that props but that's gonna
be disapproves the ID so now just by
running down if I click on my view all
thirteen come in we can push to the
thirteen come in and see if that gonna
work right there and now we know that
number is not good but we're gonna need
to manage that because the thing is this
command here we receive gonna need to
have some pagination because right now
we have just two it's pretty easy but
when we're gonna get like 200 command in
that picture we're gonna need to start
to do some pagination so I hope you
enjoyed this episode and we're gonna
talk in the next one bye everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
