time to do some reactive coal now so the
plan of the day it's to designing the
card for the photo photo finally for the
feeds screen so here are just an example
of the real one and I'm gonna - we're
gonna try to make it like looks the same
but again
we don't go there looks 100% the same
because we don't add this kind of icon
erection ever so so this is what we're
gonna do so all we're gonna work its
first thing we gonna create inside the
SRC a folder called y-component inside
this one I'm going to create another
component and I'm another folder and I'm
going to call this one photo car inside
this one I'm gonna have an index that GS
and I also I'm gonna have an index that
GS inside my component fuller and this
one what are you gonna do from the Lee
we're gonna import photo car from my
photo car and after I gonna export photo
car but now so now here we're gonna just
do a basic boilerplate of the photo car
for like getting this one start just to
to make our life really much more
simpler so we're gonna make use of yeah
see you are and and I'm gonna have a
view text and style sheet after that I'm
gonna create a component photo car and
I'm gonna go here I'm gonna open text
and I'm gonna say ello photo like this
after that what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to go to my screen to my feed
screen here and I'm going to import this
from the the component fuller and now I
can take the photo car right there
No
I'm gonna just need one and if you were
we CLO photo right there perfect so we
get something so we're gonna work with
the photo car so I'm gonna do this one
and I'm gonna make it like that so what
are we gonna do with this code its first
thing we're gonna just make use of color
so this is something I always say on my
other tutorial sorry it's build with
colors flashy color color you're gonna
find really easy with your eyes so what
I mean by that it's example in this one
we're gonna create a style sheet and I'm
gonna see route so I always call the
route for the first style of each
component so it's for this one and what
I'm going to sitt I'm going to say min.i
and I'm gonna say say 800 and I'm gonna
also put a background color of red so
now by doing this if I go air and I say
style the route
oh man now I know where I am you see so
one thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just
find out put my my stuff inside a
scrollview
because you take turn on the screen so
now I can scroll a bit and play with
this one or it's one card so that's
going to be the size of the car and
after that also for 18 years we're gonna
add some padding at the bottom like a 10
and I'm gonna see just to getting like
II don't stay below that's gonna be
helpful to folder folder when we're
gonna have some text ears excetera
so now what are we gonna do it's we're
gonna start with the first step it's
gonna be the other so right there so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create a
component inside this component a folder
that yes if you understand what I do
it's because the other go below the
photo core I know this a door don't
gonna go outside of this component when
I'm in like that
it's add are gonna be used only by this
photo core so that's why I put this
inside this folder so I'm gonna create
this header and this one is gonna be
just a function function that no need to
add a class so view text style sheet
let's type up sorry about that style
sheet after that ear what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to create my style really
quick route and I'm gonna already put a
I of 60 and a background color doing
what do you think about doing I think
it's a beautiful color and now what I'm
gonna do
it's here I'm going to create my header
like that oops
for the full function another
or here I'm gonna return and I'm gonna
put you on now I have something I forget
to do and I really don't like you it's I
forget to just install it
yes then we're gonna help me to just
adding my code constant so we can do
this really quick just open your
terminal and do right there not here but
here your ear slim and
tybo yes lien yes in consequence equal
bar
that's it it just because I forget some
time to put like yeah like Coomer I
bought some stuff it I don't believe
them so now you're in just create a flag
inside your route called yes and RC and
finally we're gonna wait its finish
in the beginning perfect it's finished
I'll just open here to the bracket see
extend now it's a equal per inside there
your est NRC so now it should work we
close everything we open the add our and
now the other is the perfect but what I
mean by that it's now if I forget to put
something like that you see Texas define
but never use and this is awesome so I
use mine drop this project at least just
to get all nine similar so it's gonna
help you here
so first thing I'm going to add the you
ear and I'm going to see style that
route and now I'm going to import this
inside my photo car I just create but
here I can import my other just get from
my other and now I can put this thing
right there at the top like that so now
here is the a door right there at the
top and if you look looks the same no so
now it what we can do it's starting to
work so if we look here oh you were to
go over my thinking will be to create
two bucks
so one here in the left and one here in
the right but they are the one from the
left I will take on all this place so I
will take like a flex like almost like
90% of all this stuff and here this s
will be small all the button and after
that aim this one will just say flex
direction to get left and right and also
as you can see here they have some kind
of the padding I think by default of
thing it slide yes 16 so this is almost
always the same
so 16 padding so if you follow what I
try to say its ear we're gonna add a
padding to this header so a padding left
and right so we can use a return code to
get 16 from each side
after that we're going to create one box
would take Flex one in the second box
going to be flexed 0.1 so this we take
only 10% of this size after that here
we're going to make use of flex
direction and I'm going to say after
that justify counting flex start to get
everything at the start in adding item
Center to get it at the center from the
top to the bottom and after that we just
need to put some margin here so this is
what we're gonna do so first thing we're
gonna do here because take the user in
the information I'm going to call that
user info say use our meta wrapper this
one's going to take Flex one and I'm
gonna put am a background color of blue
and I'm going to put this
right there instead of you style the
user metal wrapper if i refresh
everything because flex one take
everything you give them to him you're
gonna touch whatever you like gonna stop
him
so right now we have nothing to stop
this thing so what are we gonna do it's
because like I told you is gonna be a
button I'm gonna say BTN rapper and I'm
gonna say this thing gonna take flex 0.1
for 10% and I'm gonna also put a
background color of yellow and I'm gonna
put that this yellow now I want you
before I save to tell me what's gonna
happen like I won Saigon and yeah you go
below right there so if I put that a bit
bigger
then to do this to do this
now you see monitor it's below and why
it's because by default its its flex
direction color and so now here what we
can do it's flex direction row and now
by doing this I'm gonna get that right
there
so here as you can see we get all the
stuff like I told you and 30% we're
gonna take this thing now what I'm gonna
also say it's here we can have some
padding or reason code and I'm going to
say 16 so that's going to be the padding
here we're gonna just finally make sure
then we don't get a touch outside and
now because of this thing I'm gonna just
say here the background color and I'm
gonna say white for now like that so
make more sense so now this is where we
are so now what I'm gonna do it's a now
we want to create the avatar in also
putting the username of the user and as
you can see the username that always
been at the same place of the avatar
so you have to where you can work with
and but I have one way I can of light it
just ring another box for the avatar and
put my letter inside and make sure then
don't gonna go outside and after that
clean another box for my username man
that's it's gonna be pretty simple so
all we're gonna do this is by creating
another view inside the user meta and
I'm gonna call this warm start avatar
whatever and this one what I'm going to
say it's I'm gonna say flex of 25 for so
forgetting 25% of the the all this blue
so 25 we like you need to take that in
quarter so 25 and I'm gonna say also
decide that this 100 background color
I'm gonna say pink and now you say
another program so now you will just
need to see flakes direction and you say
row and now we are there so now I just
think it's really too much being I'm
gonna say 15 texting sounds better but
now we are here so now I'm gonna Quinn
know my a my my add a tower and oh I
start sorry I start with a view you're
gonna see why I'm gonna stop with the
view and I'm gonna see style that EMG
because I don't have any other mg in the
I can do this or I can do an authority
and gphin anymore sent I'm gonna go here
and now this thing just need to be a
circle
but whatever I like to do with my circle
is I like to create here in San martÃ­n
and matrix file and inside this one I'm
going to create a function called make
circle or we can do this in the exits
next to code and this one will I take a
size and look what I'm gonna do here
then I return
I with the size a width with the sides
and also a border radius and you know
because if you want to build a circle
the border radios need to be the out of
the eye and the width so you just do a
size divided by two and now what I can
do it's here I can export make circle
like that like this and now here I'm
going to import the stuff from my util
folder thing
and now don't forget inside your index
inside the team we just need to say
explore everything from your matrix that
now here I can say make circle and now
look look at the magic I'm going to see
background color when I say on ping what
can be good in green and I'm gonna say
here dot dot dot because it's gonna get
object make a circle in the I just need
to put a size and I'm gonna put a size
of 45 and now look I got my circle right
there
now it's not in the center we can do
this VDC by saying justify contain
center and a line item center and now we
get this right there so now we have
color perfect now I'm gonna change this
this like this view to begin mate and
I'm gonna do this by quitting send my
YouTube a constant file I'm gonna put a
lot of constant here I'm gonna put one
color picker at all just for now and
this figure at all oh we're gonna get
this one it's by go example for me to
take yours but for me I'm going to go on
Twitter and I'm going to just copy email
address I'm going to close and now I'm
gonna paste this email address
now here I can import this image address
from my YouTube folder constant-time
fake a data and are also going to import
from react native the image component so
now here I can see image but now also I
can see the source which is going to be
the Uwharrie of my fake avatar and now
if I run this stuff you see myself right
there but you see when I low I get a
product at the background color green
you can do whatever you want here but
for now I'm gonna just remove it so at
least I don't get nothing and also I
don't need anymore the pink I'm gonna
maybe see the pink for now but you're
gonna see in a moment so now we have
that so it's a pretty we almost done the
the third of what we need to do here in
the others so now what I'm gonna do it's
I'm gonna create another view
here inside the user meta wrapper and
I'm gonna create another view and this
one gonna have a style of use or info
wrapper so that's going to be where we
then they put the did the user avatar of
the username vanity of the user and this
one I'm gonna just need to see just the
 thing Center
I'm gonna see why in a moment yeah I'm
going to create some text and I'm going
to put example John Snow
like that so Jon Snow is right here and
also it's really hard to see but I'm
gonna do this for you style that
username that username and I'm gonna
take color or white for now just oh
right there but in this one we don't see
that but on some other we add a location
also so we're gonna add the location
right there so I'm gonna sit and
parallel
Quebec Canada that any I'm going to see
style a location
maybe I'm gonna put money yeah and now
I'm gonna go there it's a location I'm
gonna say color of real perfect we have
good here now the only thing we need to
do it as you can see like the user info
here should take the Flex one of all the
other space we have perfect and also
another thing we can say it's getting
some padding air in the left padding
left and I'm gonna sit down
so that gonna just give us some space so
now if we remove this pink color and
also this blue color we stay with this
thing here but that don't make any sense
the color and the color for the location
but we get this thing here don't worry
we're gonna work without typography in
the moment now time to put the icon here
and we want that to be a button that we
really love to work with it's a pen flow
touchable you wanna add a pin to the
table why I like to use this library
it's because I don't gonna care about
the Android version so this thing gonna
give me them material UI you see like
when you click the little bubble from
the depth
and now here I'm going to import
touchable from up into touchable and now
what I'm gonna do it's inside this
button wrapper that inside the button
all gonna become touchable I'm gonna
close it I'm gonna say all food the
button gonna have a feedback of opacity
so by default is gonna be opacity and
anywhere it's gonna be the wave and now
here I'm gonna make use of some icon I
fun on the vector icon and just one on
the ear is gonna be from the material
icon community back to our icon material
committee icon and we go here and I say
name's gonna be dots or we don't oh and
I'm gonna see a size of 25
get the mirror again
that looks like gonna do this with
what I'm gonna do it's younger than just
second Aaron no the other lad this stuff
here I'm going to put again this stuff
in the description
I know I should work you see I get the
treetops now the only thing I need to
say in my BTM its I need that to be at
the center I'm going to copy paste this
stuff and I'm gonna paste that right
there
so now I can remove my yellow and we got
this stuff here and now I can click on
this thing
another thing you see it's add a big
finger and here it's pretty like I need
to click on this stuff so another matrix
I really like to build it's make it slow
slop itself function inside your each
button again we're gonna take the size
and this thing when they finally just
return left with the size right with the
side go up with the size and button with
the size like that and this one now we
can make use here makes it slope we go
here we say it slope and we fast make it
stop and we're gonna pass to me so this
way what happen it's now I can click
here and you see it's still knowing work
I can go further so now my big finger
can work okay but not we didn't finish
yet so what we're gonna make use now
it's this library called reactive
typography which awesome you need to use
it in a view project bill and this one
just creates some typography already
built for us with some color and
everything to get the good to start iOS
and the real say to do so we don't need
to build really the text for us so we're
going to just install this library here
so we're going to do yarn add reactive
typography and now the way that gonna
work it's I'm gonna go here and I'm
gonna import from tap mode here I'm
gonna import humor and also a system
wait some what is for the word like bold
and everything gonna see that so now the
only thing I need to do it's inside my
username the thing I want for my
username is going to be
this thing here sub it so I want to get
15 15 cell
hi so all you work with this if you say
here that the human the sub and object
like that and now if I do this
what a turn I think yeah this problem
like it's something like I'm going to
need to resolve what well now we're
gonna remove again every time that I
install a library this is what gonna
pencil and I need
this RR I think they work on it I see
some pull requests they don't we just
don't get accept yet so don't worry you
don't gonna get that in the future I'm
sorry it's going to be blue
so yeah so this library really like it
why get you some stem oil so you see
like you have the TN semi bald eagle ah
no need to do you sell all this stuff oh
sorry
and also they give you some great colors
the i/os color and everything and also
they do the material color and look here
they give you some example and a pretty
nice design and you can open this if you
want to play with this example the day
after that with Xcode so you can play
with this stuff so it's code should be
almost done
don't know why to recompile that much
you see so we get that for the username
but now for the location I'm gonna make
use of the human that food not object
oh that's gonna make it a bit smaller
and I want it to be light so I'm gonna
say color not color but system light
weight light you see it's a bit lighter
it's really hard to see maybe for you
but it's a little bit lighter and now I
have my function here of my avatar and I
think if we look here we get pretty
close maybe the Avatar it's a bit bigger
if I sit for a year I think it's better
for you see my function is pretty nice I
just changed one variable in that word
and this is for making that'll work
another stuff we still need to do for
this this component it's I'm going to
create here some props like Avatar
and I'm gonna see right now is going to
be equal to fake out at all when I have
nothing why I do this is because gonna
help me a lot when I'm gonna get really
the real stuff coming in from the back
end
well username I'm gonna replace that by
equal part I'm gonna replace this to be
username and I'm sure that I'm gonna put
location and I'm gonna replace that to
be Quebec another and I'm gonna replace
this one here
really
you
location now it still work but now when
I'm gonna put real value that's gonna be
better
perfect so now data we can close it so
we done the other so we did one of the
power here we need for the photo card
after that I think we can already put
the image err I'm going to put an image
don't forget component
and this image gonna add ear style of
3ds and pearl flex wound and I take all
the space we gave them to him so I'm
going to take all the space you need to
take that and now I'm going to see
source so what I'm going to do for now
it's I'm gonna go through here and I'm
gonna type I don't know like whatever
you want so dog and just open image take
the picture you want like this one right
there
copy image address just look if this is
good good I'm gonna take me to this one
well gee peg is going to go and I'm
gonna paste this one right there
yeah don't gonna work is that HTTP and I
always don't like you but we need to
find some so this one could make address
yeah this one's going to work
you
yeah perfect we have a beautiful day
right there also can we remove the RAM
and now we have the image to display
just for now
again this is just for I think of us to
develop after that if we go inside the
photo we add some action button so why
not create a component action button did
you see their component gonna just take
all the action can happen in this boat
so the bookmark the share the comment
and the light so go inside photo car
come color and create a file called
action the beauty and s4 button and this
one what are we gonna do it's for this
one's going to be a react component
because we're gonna have some action and
I know we're gonna need that you we need
text I know we don't text you just
stylesheet after that we're gonna
already import a table I know we're
gonna need this thing it's all about
button so and after that err I'm going
to create my route
you
and this rule I'm going to say I'm gonna
add an eye of 50 I don't need to have
more than 15 and I'm going to 50 I'm
going to put a background color of real
now here I'm going to clean my class
action that et NS
the penis and I'm going to save you
like that that's it and a style of root
and now if I go to my index back I'm
gonna just sing as ear so shift coming
if you want to be the same and I don't
know why I got I'm gonna action that
dpns and I'm gonna just put that right
there so I'm gonna replace a little
world to be that TMS so now I'm supposed
to get some red stuff so here is the
action we take 50 say lights stuff we
can do now is I'm gonna enable/disable
live reload but I'm gonna enable at
reloading so the earth will Elaine it
just when I'm gonna save you're going to
reload without losing the state of the
application right now so I'm gonna be
easier for us to work with
okay so first day the rule we're going
to also add the same padding as the
other one so 16 so padding a reason
tall-tale 16
and now we're just gonna need so the way
that's gonna work
it's we need 22 bucks one bug then I
take all this stop another dog both
unity again almost as the other one like
10% no more so yes but I have another
idea I've done in this one panini was I
create one but here pick one box and
inside the eggs one box here and I
create another one who is going to be
just a fake view why it's because I want
this one to like be push together so how
can we do this by creating three view
here so you like that
and this one is going to add a style of
action rappers or all the action I'm
going to paint this one and I'm gonna go
here and this one gonna add flex one and
we're gonna put a background color that
of blue to see this one and I'm gonna
take almost all the space just not the
padding of 16 we have put right there
okay
and now in this one we're gonna add
three button I'm going to create the
first one so touchable first thing you
need to do when you use touchable it's
passing feedback oh you're gonna have an
error
Oh C T and this button here I'm gonna
pass to the end a style of action that
booty and in singular because we have
and this one now what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to subtract someone so if I
add tree gonna take all the space photo
for them so one of the thing I'm gonna
do for the first icon it's we need a art
and I'm gonna take one from the I own
icon if you don't know oh I search this
stuff it's again I go to doctor this
side here and what I've done
save saves my word what I've done
it's have put search time I don't know
if this is my internalized video
you
I searched earth and I take all
Yanik on looks like this is the same so
that's it you can change whatever you
want but I like this one so now I'm
gonna take a yawn icon and you see the
title was iOS earth outline I'm gonna
make it so I'm gonna say name ius earth
a line and also I'm going to say a size
of cutie
if I say you see right there we we see
this one
you see for now color of color why this
is right there
so now I want to do the same trick come
in be three times if I save I get treat
or right there you see one of the thing
I want it's I don't like them to be at
the top of each other so I'm going to
say flex direction of when I get all
them here but now I can change the icon
so the second one is gonna be evil icon
and that's gonna be for the comment so
if you like on it's gonna be here and
the name is going to be coming try say
you see it's coming but it's really
small so that's why I say to go with 25
take the space in the song on one it's
again with iOS but this is iOS same line
like that and again this one it's really
small so I say to go with 35 well now
you see they take some space and I
really like it and they are not in the
middle of each button so we can fix that
by sing justify contain center and a
line item Center probably take the
middle of each of them so now thing is I
want them to be like not spread like
that so that's why at this side to
create your a fake view
and this one here what that's gonna do
you're going to just take two time the
same space as the other one but you see
again problem it's its color and the
roof so what you need to see its root
need to be like direction row now you
see so now they become together if you
want to see in yellow you see now we
take all this stuff perfect we are
really close but now we want this thing
here who's going to be now a touchable
because it's going to be the button of
the bookmark
this one's gonna have a style and like
what I say don't forget the feedback is
going to crash I'm gonna say style of
book mark rapper
in this one finally you're going to just
take 0.2 I think
and we're going to just say
background-color
purple the sports sing perfect is right
there yeah
baby tree okay and now this one gonna
have an icon from high on icon also and
but the name is going to be iOS bookmark
or line like that I want this to get the
middle and I want it to be at the end
touch the end here I want him to touch
the right I'm gonna say a line item flex
em but I gonna touch the end perfect so
now for looking all that look we're
going to remove all the color
now boom
and room with nothing because they are
all white just remove all this white
color you know we get to this point
right there it's not quite the same but
what I can maybe do just in the space
between each of the stuff here so first
thing one thing I forgot it's the action
rapper air show a digestif icon thing
of flexstar to touch the left part and
the thing I'm gonna say also I just want
to take a background color or ramp and
just make it the ER so you can set 1.8
yeah so you see it's going to take a bit
more spread so now if I remove maybe it
looks a bit better
while the only thing I think left ear
it's going to be action rapper to see a
line-item Center to make sure they get
Center and also don't forget the it's
slope because of the big finger
make it slow take that go here say it
snow once again 20 and I'm gonna copy
paste this one here yeah by doing this I
can click here I can click a bit here
and now you see when I click here and
here and I can maybe take a bit more
space one point six last thing I'm gonna
take a stand it looks a bit better ok a
lot of code I know but we are really
close of what we are supposed to 2n ok
so now we can close this action bit ENS
and we don't need that anymore for the
rest of this tutorial with this video so
now why not going with the meta
and the comment section on the next
video just to give you a little break
again don't forget this repo is in the
description so that can really help you
to like follow if you think I really
speak really bad or something like that
so I hope you enjoy and let me know in
the comment or you feel about this stuff
