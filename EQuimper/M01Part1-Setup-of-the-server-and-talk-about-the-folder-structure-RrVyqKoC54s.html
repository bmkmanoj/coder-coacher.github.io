milestone so first thing we're gonna go
with the server side as you know
with my other video I prefer to start
server side and I just think that's a
good idea because here if you came to
this channel before we have work with
reg native but we didn't work with Alex
in Phoenix before so we're gonna surely
put more time there and you're gonna see
all much also male extreme Phoenix or
this is really an ISTAT squeezie first
thing for those who never really work
with Phoenix and they Aleksei go to this
website it's I don't gonna go with all
the installation but click on gear at
the top left click on the installation
and top and just do all the installation
here they're gonna ask you to do and I
started all this stuff it's done you can
came back to this video so I will pull
the video if I was you and I will do all
the installation I don't want to go like
I don't want to do this here in this
video and the first thing also here as
you can see this is a really beautiful
dogs and you're gonna see that
everywhere this is all the dogs you're
gonna see a lot with elixir and if you
don't like the denied you can switch
here and this is all the stuff you have
and also what we're going to install is
going to be AB sign here which is going
to be the graph QL library for elixir so
the first thing we're gonna do sorry to
make sure you have installed Phoenix and
in Excel I can just show you
and the first thing we're gonna do its
ear so and in a brand new brand new
project one sorry
and here what are we gonna do now it's
we're gonna create a brand new Phoenix
project so we're gonna do mix if pH X
that new I'm gonna call that Instagram
I'm gonna say no branch in newest
channel for those who have never done
Alec same Phoenix Phoenix or you work
it's like a a bit like Ruby on Rails
where you have your front end and your
back end also you have your template
thing enjoying but here we don't want
branch so it's almost like a website and
we don't want any HTML because we just
want to build like a API so I'm gonna
click on turn and now here they're gonna
ask me so look at first thing look at
all the library and the library but the
file and folder they create so that they
ask a or fetch and install dependency
I'm gonna just click enter because as
you see the why it's in uppercase so
that means that why it's by default so
if you click enter that gonna run it and
as you can see the comment they run it's
mixed yep yep so for those who came from
no GS
it's almost like an NPM install after
you have your packages on and now here
they are they compile all the dependents
innovating so we're gonna wait here but
we cannot already open something can
open it forget on code visuals Duke oh
yeah but sorry I did a mistake we're
gonna just do what they say CD Instagram
and right there I'm gonna do code
insider
or code for you with your so this is
what we have here first thing if you use
Visual Studio code and you never abused
the lexer go to the extension and just
search for elixir here click enter and
install the first one with the you see
they had a lot of download so because
that gonna give you this kind of
indentation at an indentation but this
syntax color right there so in the mix
ena e6f it's almost like the
package.json you have inside a node.js
application where ear day it's about
your project so where we have the name
of the app so again like I told you in
the first video I talked in December
it's not a beginner course in elixir
hope you have done some search on elixir
before you you have you can either so so
it's all about the project version zero
zero one we gonna use the elixir version
1.4 after that here we have it's nothing
crazy we don't really need to know that
for this tutorial after that here we
have the depth and this is finally
everything we need it for the product
it's all the dependency so as you can
see we have Phoenix 1.3 and we have all
the pub/sub active with the kind of ORM
for Phoenix and elixir Postgres this is
the lair database we gonna use after
that we have other library whew it's
been used by Phoenix now so that here we
have some alias which almost like NPM
start and PM test and stuff like this
but now here we have AK to reset example
who's gonna drop the database and after
that gonna run the setup who is there so
that mean we're gonna create migrate and
run the seed and the test it's finally
the test so this is the project here
after that this is a Phoenix 1.3 so that
means now we work with context so here
inside the Lib folder we're gonna have
this 2 folder here so as you can see
because we have the protocol inside
we get Instagram and Instagram will so
here if you don't really know all the
context work I'm gonna give you an
inside the description link for a video
it's really really good about this and
why how so it's good it's because it's
by the author of Phoenix this guy is
really smart and you have done a really
good job to teach a bit about this stuff
you really need to know all context
gonna work I don't really want to pass a
lot of time there because this this
video it's more about like building a
full project damn like focus on small
little stuff again it's not a beginner
of course it's kind of an intermediate
course begin our material yeah so inside
this lid this is where everything gonna
start this is where all the project you
have the bill don't touch it I'm never
going to really touch it it's just
finally the project compilation the
other config worry we have all the
configuration as you can see this is one
thing I really love about the Phoenix
they add the DEF the crowd and the test
setup so when you want to add something
just in there between their test and
prod and you have your secret right
there one thing why I go there is here
for me it's good for me but I don't know
for you I use first we add and pulse
grass by default my user name is paws
grass and my password is possibly us if
it's not for you you really need to
change this stuff because the second
comment we need to run its mix ecto that
create
now you see if you get this thing the
database for Instagram that repo has
been created everything is set up you
are good to go with the DB if not this
is really what you need to change so so
yeah and this isn't there because we're
gonna work in there first this is the
config the DEP you don't need think
about that as a node module
here the private we're gonna work can't
have a lot here because we're gonna have
all the migration and we're gonna also
add all the seeds we're gonna do because
we're gonna work with Cena I don't want
to create like a pose for like 20 time
if I want to make like kind of active
project which what we're gonna see it's
gonna be pretty pretty easy I mean
everything in a lecture it's really
really easy when you get you when you
can understand the syntax
after that ear inside the lip I mean the
tears that I said I'm gonna go right now
there but it's why are the tests finally
here in Sandy Instagram we don't get a
really touch here inside inside the
Instagram web I think we're gonna came
here one time in the app and as you can
see the app adds so many comments here
and you can just read all of them I take
again I take I think again I play like
alfalfa do one time to just read all the
comments a put everywhere and just make
sure that now understand all the setup
and I really really pay off so sometime
it's really really good to do stuff like
they're building nothing but just
reading code so here it's where we're
gonna pass all the time so the Instagram
in the Instagram well so the Instagram
web is going to be the web interface of
the project in the Instagram it's going
to be the business logic of the
application
so either Instagram is where we're gonna
put the context so for those who don't
really know all contexts gonna work
think about this as like our team say
that like a folder for your business
story but when you separate that so
example for us we're gonna have to
context we can treat context we can add
the accounts so it's going to be
everything about the user and the
account and stuff like this after that
we're gonna have the post context who's
gonna be about like a photo can tag
stuff like this so the thing you can
post and also we can add another one
who's going to be called reaction
reaction is gonna be about like liking a
photo liking a comment or example
following another user because yes we're
gonna do all the stuff in this tutorial
we don't get a really touch about the
application in this tutorial I think
about building another application what
we're going to talk about OTP and stuff
like this and that's gonna be one of
them my project for this year and the
rapport so we don't get a really nice as
you can see they take the environment
variable they get from the config folder
I just show you
in air inside Instagram where we can add
the router this thing it's really really
simple as router you can see scope API I
get to the API and all the pipeline
we're gonna just plug finally we just
connect transform everything as a JSON
here
the end plan we don't gonna really need
to touch it
the view we don't gonna touch it yet
controller first thing we can do we're
gonna delete the controller we don't
gonna need because we use graphic you
earlier so anyway we add the user socket
we don't gonna use it yet so this is the
setup of of sannakji
just set up phoenix so in the next video
we're gonna start to just add app sign
and we're gonna also just set up the
schema for doing that first tree we
request with we ask you are you enjoy
and let me know in the comment if you
kind of like how I teach this tutorial
now and I hope it's gonna be better than
my last one as I good day everyone bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
