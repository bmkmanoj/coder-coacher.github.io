we're going to add a study but in this
poll gonna talk about the domestic UI
right now it's so much easy with us
we're that we have it we work on all in
local laws we have good Wi-Fi chera but
now we want to add some kind of
performance like if we other to do we
wanted to do to show right now
but if your network take two seconds
renders you're going to see on the
respondent in two seconds so I think
it's called optimistic it's like you
finally you put whatever you want before
and if the success is there you keep it
like you are but if you have an error
you remove what you add finally this is
when I talk about creation so here
example we're going to make the text and
we're going to create it to do we're
going to the dispatch finally inside the
videos are going to be right before but
now we're going to need to change what
we did here because we did the complete
here but we're going to need to change
this stuff so finally here we're going
to keep the art liquid to do I'm going
to import a UID I'm going to make it in
some action right there
now I can remove my stack now here this
is what that's going to start if they
are we gonna in decree to do I'm going
to add get state is a certain argument
coming from here a redox point for that
here what I'm going to say cons to do
equal an object I'm going to ask text
gonna have ID equal to uu ID like that
before and a complete so that now Mike
we to do I'm gonna add data equal to I'm
going to add my to do like that after
that here I'm going to send like to do
in my TR but here the success don't
gonna have nothing but if add an error
now if I have a it's either never what
I'm going to send it's only day one
needs
say sorry now I'd like to do so now what
I'm going to do is send my dispatch here
I'm going to send my to do two inside my
error if add an error so you're going to
see in one moment what if we're going to
do so here in time I reduce our now
inside a creek to do when we create it
to do now that's going to be the place
where we're gonna have this stuff here
that should be true you don't need any
more to shoot that we're going to stick
the baduk stain in air what you gonna
fix that are going to be equal in action
that to do because we have to do if we
have a success we just return the state
that's it but if we had an error that's
going to be what we're going to touch
it's there now we need to filter the
data but we need to filter the data
solely to do save that data that filters
are we going to return a new error and
then we need to remove the to do because
we receive an error in that something
happen but we have in the UI so you need
to remove it
so finally you you create a to do a show
right there
if it success nothing happens but if you
have an error we need to remove it so to
do to do that ID here we have action
that's to do ID we're going to deal if
I'm eager to do we just add like that so
now if i refresh my screen now the never
will say good idea since i'm action to
do oh yeah right there we don't need
that anymore okay so now look what
you're not I'm going to say welcome back
you can't are we to do I get my to do we
do do success nothing at that now if I
I'm not sure we're going to see it
because that's going to be quick here
but example if I go to my to do API here
and I make like a mistake and I change
example my
can I change like my fat like that and I
sense a low oil like that I get it to be
success oh I know because the thing is
Big E quick is only P I call but at
least you get the idea about what I try
to say just if you receive an error
finally when you catch an error you're
going to like get it so maybe all I can
say kit it just by closing my here and
now I'm going to make welcome you know
exactly I'm you know I don't get my do
you ever what happened
I want to do creating so my error should
be right here
ever now gonna receive an error so my
server so not hello
now you see other to do but because I
get already a quick to do error but to
do don't like show cuz it's really quick
and I extended to do here but if I get
my if I McAdoo Washoe cut the service
was slower we remove it so this is
optimistic UI so I hope you enjoyed this
little part and we see later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
