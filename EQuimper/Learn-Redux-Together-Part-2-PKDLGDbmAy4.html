the tutorial for learning with us
together so today after we had already
done the Redux store in the last one now
it's time to do some stuff so the first
thing I want is to create to do so our
our work with my stuff is first thing
I'm going to create a folder or equal
action first thing I do I do my action
always first I'm going to be much more
easy for me to understand what I need to
to do with my reducer so here in time
action I'm going to call a file called
two loops I'm going to do a sum in the
reducer so I really start going to have
this action perfect so here in time I
took some action the first thing I want
so I'm going to air create the spec we
want so we want to create to do we want
to list all to do so we want to see all
to do after that I want to click for
complete to do and I want to delete what
to do and finally I want to delete our
complete to do so this is what we want
to do so first thing I'm going to create
a cons air called create two dues cup so
after that I'm going to create a
function export function create to do
this one I'm going to take a to do or a
text I'm going to return a type of
create to do and text why do I do this
line of code first thing you need to add
a unique type for your riddles or
because this is the way with the reduce
or no which action you call so you want
it to make unit and after that way I
could have a variable here is because
I'm really bad and typing in this way I
know after a treat this variable I can
use this variable really easy because
now if I make like actually like that
and I forget to do table that dongle
work so here are my creature do
so if you can see it's a perfunctory
turn an object with a type of Crete to
do and attacks after that air and time I
reduce our I'm going to import at the
top to the bracket because we import
cons from action to do like that I'm
going to import create to do so I import
only my type
why because air you're going to see I'm
going to create a reducer and we have an
empty error for sale so here as you can
see we have this is the reducer so like
I told you in the last desert this is a
function will return and data so here
the function takes finally the state Y
alright now take an action with action
that type action that type right here
going to receive a cake and you're going
to change the state and return this new
one
and don't forget by default inside the
switch here by default we're going to
return the state so by default is going
to be an empty alright so here what I'm
going to do is I'm going to add my
create to do type sorry for this yellow
thing it's just because I have a to do
stuff with sorry sorry so here what I'm
going to do it so it's an array so here
when I add it to do I'm gonna do I want
to push but you want to keep you stuff
in tables so you're going to want to
return a new array so here what I'm
going to do is I'm going to do that that
that state so here what I mean it
everything as before going to be there
and I thought I'm going to create my new
object right here so here there's going
to be the object of the to do so here
this is what I'm going to add text to
the equal to action that text so think
about this this is the time so now you
know we don't agree to the start node
this is the type so now we know action
that text is this text so here text
going to be there after that to do we
want it to be complete by default so
complete to be fall so that's going to
be a boolean after that I want something
to make my life easier when I'm gonna
toggle stuff complete dealing so you
want an ID for this oh yeah I'm going to
get an ID but yeah that need to be
unique so that's why I'm going to add a
library called u u u ID so this is a
library forget a unique ID so at the top
here I'm going to import UUID from uu
ipv4 so here my ID final is going to be
equal to uu ID and this is a function
that so now add a quiz to do as my text
and now this is work but oh let's forget
it's I need to put this thing to replace
this one I'm going to import my to dude
from two dupes and now I'm going to
change this thing to be just an empty
like that because yes six key value
thing you keep it like that so now my
video so I'm going to add it to do like
that so now what I can do it since I'm
Mac without dev tool I can air inside my
tag I can say create to do I'm going to
put a coma I'm going to say text equal
hello well and now if I click this patch
if you still inside of 0 so you see here
now I need to do and now if I click on
state my state now added to do with the
lol right here so if I click another one
lol - and I you see this patch now I'm
going to ask - to do right here but you
don't want the user to add the to do
into the console so what we're going to
do is we're going to jump inside the app
here I'm gonna just make it really
simple so I'm going to just add this
thing here and after that here I'm gonna
do my phone and I create a form with the
input type of text I'm going to put a
name of to do and no ID but I'm going to
add a placeholder oh create to do that
so now if i refresh so now you see I get
my quick to do that's that form cannot
be a form cannot be inside
yes so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to just put this last name in sign my
form I'm going to believe the T so that
was 10 at 60 HTML now like that now if
you use period calculus get that it's
not defined yes so this is the es10 they
show you we have lagu a we don't use it
so now we can remove it so if you remove
it we have notes nothing here so now
what do I have to do so now if I add and
I click enter my phone refresh the
screen so this is not what we want I
mean it's make no sense so what we're
going to do its first thing we want to
control the input of this test before
this stuff before we show we do the
thing in video so here I'm going to
create a state in time I app and I'm
going to say text be equal to an empty
array and I'm going to change the name
to be text if I do this if you open the
render tool and I search for my app now
my app at a state of text it's an empty
so here if I start in I do value going
to be equal to this that say that text
now one good happen
it's my to do here it's okay but now if
I type nothing at them because the text
keeps and then P if I put some text here
and I say now look what's gonna happen
I get my state but again I can attack
because my stake don't change how can I
change that is by creating a function so
we're going to create a function called
interchange you can give it the name you
want going to take an either
so this even it's the same even of if
you came from jQuery that's the same
kind of even so this is the Equality
that you can coming in from JavaScript
so so here what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create an unchanged I'm going
to put on change here and I'm going to
see this that now it just goes to too
much thing I'm going to just format
really quickly okay and I'll change so
now what I want to show you is here I'm
going to control on ie that target if I
console on my editor here now on inside
my input now look at ax I get my input
right here so it's my input so what I
can do with that is if you know react
you know we can change
we can change the state by doing this
that sustain and here I'm going to put
square bracket eat that turgut and if
you look here eat the target that name
is the same name of ear so now I can say
easy that target that name so if I have
more than one input I can change
everything in one function and that's
going to be equal to e that target that
value so the name is here so now if I do
this and I click on react I click on the
app I see here the state I'm going to
put highlight update so you're going to
see that you're gonna hear the change so
now if I plug the type you see I get a
low coming so we so we benefit the value
with the stay right there
so now but now if I click enter nothing
happen again because now we need to add
a function to the form so here I'm going
to create another function called enter
submit then I take I get a neither this
one we don't want anymore to refer this
intro we're going to prevent the default
after that inside the phone I'm going to
add an ounce submit even answer meal and
there's going to be equal to this the
Enderson yet so when I click empower or
if you have a button here that's going
to be the submit so that need to be
inside the form so now if I do this and
I click enter no refresh but we don't
edit to do first thing you need to
connect for using what you use any video
so I'm going to do C or R for import
connect Rama duck and here at the bottom
I'm going to connect my app component
with redux no if I say and I open my
provider I'm going to get my connect app
and now if you sing the context I had
access to the store but now I have
nothing here so now what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to import my action so
here I'm going to import from my action
folder to do I'm going to import create
to do I'm going to take this action here
inside the connect the connected to call
back the first one it maps it to props
we're going to use it later so for now
we're going to use on the fire that's on
one it's not dispatch
crap so if you put curly bracket ear
like that you're going to be structuring
decra to do so you don't need to do all
the stuff inside the map stage props so
here after that inside the Internet I
think that's a good place to put that
these that crap that and the key to do
because now the key to do if we look
inside the app came as a props so this
that product it to do and now easy can
just let's take that text all because we
have only stay we can just do this that
stays but I so now if I do something
like that if I open my console and I CLO
example and I can't are now my without
sugar
so the middle where we add in the last
teaser inside the store so redox lugar
this thing here now we added to do so
now as you can see in redox we have an
object so this is my stay wherever to do
it sanitary I come action creature do
with the text hello and now I get a new
object so this is my new stay with it to
do it's an array where one object
complete Falls and add IDs coming from
the UUID and hello if I add another one
I'm going to add the same but now my
previous day wasn't in one stuff instead
of to do and I have to but why I don't
get that is because I why I don't see
nothing and because we didn't get the
list so really easy here we're going to
do we're going to break the line here
and here comes in here I'm going to do
the matchstick to prop so what we can do
is state here so stay here I'm going to
do to do equals theta to do so for the
one who know more the current map stay
to props equals state and now you do
like that is the same but I put my
action right inside Mac you connect so
that air now because I'm doing this if I
save in i refresh now inside my react
here inside my app I'm going to have
access to the props to do but it's an in
theory if I add a new one
now ever to do of one item so now what I
can do it's right here
I'm going to map over that I'm going to
do is that proves that to do the name of
this dot map I'm going to add a to do
like that and now right here I'm going
to add a deal and now here I'm going to
do to do that text if I do this and I
show you what's gonna happen if I start
to Thailand I say ellos and I get my
yellow I get new star first thing we're
going to change that we have to thinking
yes we have an error but we're going to
do this thing first here right after we
submit we're going to just do this at
set state so we control the input so
it's easy to do text equal an empty
string so if I do this after I'm going
to refresh I'm going to add the thing
whatever this error is react as Q we
need to have a unique key for each stuff
here so here I'm going to do key equal
to do the ID so now if I do this no
error at all everything work perfect so
an elderly I think we can do I like to
do structuring my stuff so we are gonna
see text in ID because we did track we
say we want detect and write different
coming from the to do object so now I
can do like that so that's going to be
really easy to just get the same perfect
so that was that's going to be this for
this it said I hope you enjoyed please
