video it's not about cutting but about
talking about what's gonna happen on my
channel for the next week and month so
as you know I was a beginner in
programming for less than two years ago
so I start programming in 2016 in
January and when I've started learning
programming I start reading by watching
some video on YouTube and stuff like
that so all the free content and this is
something who get me fall in love with
programming is the fact then a lot of
person giving back to the community by
teaching and give you free knowledge and
stuff like that
and now with with my year experience and
stuff like that I want to read it back
to all of you because this is also me
I've learned and I just think that's a
good idea and in same time that improve
myself because as you know when you
teach something you start to know
something because teaching for me it's
the best way to learn so as you know
I've started my programming channel here
and I didn't really get like any idea
about where I want to get so some of my
plan was to build tutorial and stuff
like that but I take it take root of
time and lot of energy and I just think
then I cannot do anymore just tutorial
always because I'm not the kind of
person who always keep in one thing I
need to do more thing to always keep me
motivated so that's why sometimes you
want you see me going somewhere else
forever so this video it's about what's
gonna happen in the next few day week
and month so sorry if I talk really bad
I'm really sick going now so so first
thing I'm gonna try now to do one two
three video a week on a tutorial I'm
gonna build right now I've start one of
my next one's gonna be with the elixir
in Phoenix and graph QL with react
native and I want to build a nest around
clone I've done the sketch and stuff
like that I think
show you a video about this later my
plan about this is to blue the basic
Instagram with all the same design with
the thing then you can follow someone I
can comment on photo you can upload
photo with react native also you can
send in chat and also we're gonna maybe
have like stories kind of ish and stuff
like that so this is something I want to
check I was going to build with Alex and
Phoenix because this is right now I
think I've done this for one of my clan
right now Alex the project and I really
fall in love with that so this is
something I really want to improve now
in the future because I love this
language after that one of my plan
before the end of the year it's gonna be
to build like a multiplayer game on
nodejs
or maybe elixir for the backend and with
javascript with phaser that are you so
for the one we don't know phaser that IO
is this thing right there so it's a
library finally will let you build a
desktop application so example if you
want to build something like one of the
game I really like it's a slider that IO
where I can put a name and finally when
you play you become like a snake who eat
some stuff like that and you can get it
by bigger than you so this is something
I may be gonna want to do and because
it's gonna be able to player you need
like web ii and stuff like that i think
Alexa will be really nice because it
like so make you real time stuff so much
easy with Phoenix and I just think that
can be good with that or I'm gonna use
no J's because this is the thing I know
the moves after that I want to do at
least one video about tips on everything
about what I've learned so as you can
see like example you said I did the
video on the front and why it's because
that was yesterday in the morning I
learned this technique about uprooting
the fun of my relative so I don't like
to keep in mind for myself so that's
what I sure to you and I want to do this
with everything I know so it's going to
be no GS javascript react native
react Redux everything maybe or some
observables sharara after that I want to
do one live coding session of some of my
project so like maybe my crypto app
something like that and yeah everything
I want to do finally and now here it's
the big thing I want to talk about you
and I'm not sure if if this is something
you guys won me to do but I think that
can be a really good idea sorry what I
want to do it's one life cutting session
for helping people helping people with
specific problem so I know like it's not
everyone here who have like money or
stuff like that to get course or maybe
get mentor and stuff like that and in it
that's someone to get question and get
like a lost in all this internet and
stuff like that so my plan now let's do
one hour to one hour in Alf on the
Thursday maybe a hangout or a Skype
session with maximum of five people so
whoo you can came and ask some question
I'm gonna try to continue the Mo's as I
can so it's going to be like a QA
session and all that's gonna be live
coding and putting two on you tone so
the thing is if you get with kind of
question about I don't know like you
have some problem with your education
system or something like that you need
you need to know that if you came to
this and yell or stuff like this your
codes going to be show after that on the
the YouTube so we example if you have
some problem on a part of you code just
take it
so because it's you're not alone to have
this kind of question somebody else
gonna surely have it so that's why I
want to at least if I done this I want
to share it to the most people as I can
so more people can be better and better
and better so that's gonna be on each
Thursday
so that's gonna start in today from 8
p.m. to 9 p.m. and this is East so if no
one is there at least that's going to be
a live cutting session so now all miters
day 8 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. is gonna be live
coding session but at least if you want
I'm gonna send you my email so yeah I'm
gonna put
my email right there so if you want to
get this live cutting session so
Thursday ETM is just remind me at this
address and just put them there subjet
live cutting session helping on youtube
so at least I can know how many people
can be there and like I told you that
can be like I mean boring question if
you think this is boring I mean no
question is boring so if you get some
question about I don't know like CSS
grid or or react native you get some wit
problem with something like that I'm
gonna try to do my best to help you if I
can't sorry but at least I'm gonna try
to give you the math knowledge I can on
your problem so I hope you like the all
my channel gonna go for the next few
week and whew man the first thing to I
want to thank you everyone to follow me
and like my video I really appreciate
that that we really motivate myself and
and now that's why I want to give you
back this kind of stuff so I hope you
enjoy please eat me on the comments if
you have some question about this if you
think this life cutting session right
there can be a good idea if you think
then you can maybe don't want to ask the
question but maybe watch the video after
that so at least you can see what other
people do and what kind of program you
can get after that when you get to real
project or something like that so again
have a good night everyone and thank you
you are the best audience other good
night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
