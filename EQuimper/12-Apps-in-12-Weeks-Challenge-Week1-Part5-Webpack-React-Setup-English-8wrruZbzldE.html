to continue that trial so today we're
going to start to write some front-end
code not a lot because we're going to
set up what pack so for today we're
going to make module with configs I'm
going to just put what we got in the
server as a configuration and then we're
going to make it more modular so much
more easy for you to scale and add
something and i said i was going to set
up web back what back is the bundler so
have an image for you this really quick
so let's take all ugs file that takes
your CSS and every day and that compiled
that much more small and that makes you
up faster and make you use like react
and kind of stuff regular browser cannot
because they don't get a load or with
babbles I'm gonna set up some basic
react so time to start so last one we
finish with that anyone i want it i just
want to remove the database in the
middle where configuration so here
inside my server i'm going to create a
config folder inside this one i'm going
to create a DD that gso they just get
that's going to be all my database and
shut up so here I'm going to cut what I
need in time a database like they're my
Mongoose and I'm going to take a
everything hey I'm going to create a
function export default would take some
configuration em I'm good just add some
indian air like that so now i'm gonna so
if you follow i'm going to export a
function E with a configuration as an
argument and i'm going to connect that
i'm gonna cut this one right now i'm
going to just access right there just
for don't forget it i'm going to take
this configuration and i'm going to put
that inside like on it so now my
database is right there learning to go
any further after that we're going to do
the same with middle where we're going
to create a file called me delaware yeah
here I'm gonna cut one out inside my
body portion right there
under export default the function will
take my app as an argument like that I'm
going to take my body posture right
there and I'm going to pass it right
there so if you follow the app going to
be the one ear and because I like to
import everything inside in one line I'm
going to add a index GF what I'm going
to import DB country from DB and i'm
going to import needlework country from
my middleware and ear i can export
everything from the same file go now
inside my index i can import from my
country because you know you will
remember if you have an index GS just
keep small enough to understand if you
just import a fold or going to look at
index PS here i can import my DB country
and you see visual studio as also
compilation for that and my middle work
on see from now if I put my middle world
right there I can put the app inside for
this app gonna go right there but now
just cleaner for us about the database
we're gonna stop touch about this we're
gonna jump after we set up some wetback
configuration because it's a big chunk
of code so we're gonna import some Sofia
first thing we're going to import as a
dependency what pack version 2.2 PS
we're going to use the version 2 for the
one who have used a version 1 no more
not a lot of change but just much more
easier and let you use some vendor etc
here i'm gonna add my website oops sorry
web stack the middle way
like that and after that i'm going to
import HTML web back plugging and i'm
going to import another one extract this
one is really long text webpack clogging
i'm going to told you i'm going to tell
you what is that lettuce i wanna move
down its lucky you and we need a version
2.0 point 0 dash better that five
everything looks more King per se after
that we need because we want to use a
CSS with wetback yes it loader we need
by below door for compile yes 62 es2015
we need some preset for battle like
preset react better preset ii h 0 and we
need babel preset and we'll take give us
all the last battle to all the last
javascript cool like that perfect we're
going to put the subtidal a preset right
now easy react and and finally stage 0
let's take stage we're good to go with
that now we're going to create pull back
wetback that come say that yes inside
this one lot of coke gonna happen here
we're going to import wetback it require
remember this part of your app is in es5
because you don't take the battle right
now so web what's actually and now you
get an error no extra genius so
differently we're going to take this
error we're going to jump to ESL and ESN
you can add some rules
that I'm going to put that here and I'm
going to put 00 main fault so if you see
now i have no more error i'm going to
take my fat coming from oh sorry take my
back route from pact with the library
inside no GF no need to install this one
I'm going to take my ex track text
plugin equal require extract text plugin
and I'm going to take my own HTML web
back oops sorry web back plugging equal
require a female what excluding if we're
going to create a vendor live with an
array of what which library you use
externally like which kind of code you
don't write the kind of code will not
really change a lot so this vendor what
they're going to do is they're going to
compile each other so here example going
to add viet plus react down to library
who use for get react but don't change
the a lot like every day so what that
means when the customer going to go to
your website the first time they're
gonna get all the vendor as a cash so
that's going to make you up much more
quick for the second and third and four
times because you don't need to get this
gs5 so here I'm gonna use module export
hear that take a century so this is the
real wetback confide in if we take the
bundle you take wire the app start we're
going to fix our serisi index a GF so
we're going to treat this one so in the
root folder called source and i'm going
to create an index GF file that's
nothing more after that here i'm gonna
take vendor and we pass generally the
way we just create
after that we have all put why this
won't take a pack would take tap that
joint here with the deer name and we
told which kind of photo you want to
create for me I always put this you can
put build if you want but I like my idea
so that's going to be the folder where
everything doesn't go now that take a
five and main here it's some variables
named chunk ash dep dep gia here it's
how it's where the chunk for making a
vendor in and many tests gonna after so
just follow what i right I mean nothing
really awesome to know you're just some
kind of variable you're going to see
after when we come to compile and the
public that we're going to be the root
like that nothing more after there I'm
gonna have a module here this is all
react what back what now so we can add
some rooms take an array of objects
inside this object take a use here where
I want to tell them I want battle odor
so you want to come back es 62 e f-15es
62 ef5 sorry yeah we're going to sit
there so which kind of fight we want so
we want because of some kind of rejects
JavaScript like that thing more a we're
going to exclude node s module we don't
want to combine no module that's after
that here this is the place for the CSS
we're gonna have a loader with the name
of extracts or the one we just installed
extract X plugging we have a method call
extract with a loader CSS loader so what
they do here if you don't extract like
that what's gonna work so what we're
gonna do is we're going to take your
style and keep them as an inline style
not like a CSS file so I mean for you
it's your choice you can do this in line
etc but for me if I do success I want
them to stooges at THX it says the
stress out and JavaScript so here I'm
going to add a tip like we just in a
peppermint we're going to put Seth now
so this is the place if you want to
change I like SAS loader spss load or a
left rotor actually where you can change
right there after that here I'm going to
go here I'm going to put plug-in who is
an area of plugging here I'm going to
have new web back that defines plugging
air this is why you define with your
enjoyment I'm going to have press s dead
end where you're going to look at node
environment and people address on that
stringify projection so you know when
you go through the app you have a kind
of some kind of environment like there
are tests or projection so this is the
place where we told the way back to
compile as a projection if we say in the
node and remember that we're going to
add another one called new word pack
optimized and the comments on plugging
so this is the plug-in where they're
going to create the chunk here this is a
metal will take some names we're going
to call them vendhar and 95th so if you
follow the name air is going to be the
name there after that we have new HTML
web pack plugging so if HML walk up
again what they do it's let's take a
thin plate and that look at the template
and that recreate your HTML template but
they gotta put the vendor with the
variable inside so we're going to just
create right now index HTML inside the
source file like that a last one knew
xtrac textplus
with the witch named we want to give to
the stuff the defining it'll just
style.css that's perfect so the web pack
is good to go so just forecast we're
going to add some react code so young
add react and react done inside the
source and saima index i'm going to
import yak i'm going to import render
coming from react them i'm going to
import the app i'm going to create a
further their class whether the data
component inside my layout and my app
yeah here i'm gonna use the render here
i'm going to have my component and i'm
going to do document that get element by
ID and i'm going to pass up now i'm
going to have a problem with ESS the
command is not define you need to go to
ESPN at the top you set up ends and take
a browser variable and you can see those
are so entries and here and then I'm
going to say brother is true if I do
this now yes L understand i can use in
the brother another i'm going to go to
my layout i'm going to create the app I
just have right there let me be react
and going to be a stateless function
with app like that with the h1 h1 of
ello nothing more so you have my app if
I come back okay he's working I need
some HTML I'm going to do mmm so if i do
exclamation yeah i'm going to see a
short URL nothing more and here I'm
going to have my days with my app so
time to test I'm gonna do wetback alone
let's see if we have an error perfect no
error and look at that my vendor 663
kilobyte my bunder one kilobyte my
manifest 5.63 so if you see now this is
my bundle so you easy now have the name

and look this is the chunk a ash that
giver and now my menu chef so this is
over pack can work in my window you see
so this vendor is react so you see
Facebook action and I they have all the
comments this is work back and inside my
index.html this is a shame LOL pac

for yourself okay so now we're good to
go we're going to come back there in no
time just for showing you some good
stuff so here time to create the stuff
which web pack first game we're going to
create a variable called mango con maybe
I let worry about only going to change
it if process then em that node and it's
not projection we're gonna use web back
middleware so we want to use the dev
middleware equal require the middleware
now an error from the effluent global
recovery they don't like that but you
need to have require here inside the
signal so i'm going to take require like
that i'm going to go to my ESPN i'm
going to put another rule and i'm going
to put 0 for 4 and now my record gun
