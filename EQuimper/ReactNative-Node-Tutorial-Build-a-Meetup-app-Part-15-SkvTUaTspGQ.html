your soil so what we're going to do
today it's funny we're going to do the
correction of the navigation so I know I
get a lot of requests about this so this
is the time and but we're gonna start
with the redox process stuff because
while happening is if we don't persist
with anything to log every time so it's
gonna be a lot simpler so start time to
start so what we going to do first is to
do yarn add redox process so relax
procedure is just a library we're going
to help us to persist with the async
coverage I think the rate of the
realities so when that's going to be
done perfect now we're good to go so we
get a fine we're going to start inside
the store
so just jump inside the star of the
three dogs and we get a first thing
we're going to delete this line of code
we don't need that anymore because we
don't use anymore this there to here
after that year what we're going to do
is we're going to import Auto from redox
process we're going to import auto
reiterate yeah
so that year we're going to change
inside to become post and at the end
here we're going to add a to read rate
like this so finally we add this to the
stack of the compost so we apply the
middleware and after that we have to
read read after that we need to jump
inside the main that GS right there and
we're going to set up the app to iterate
over the async storage and take the vs.
stuff so yeah the top we're going to
import from react native we're going to
import anything storage after that we're
going to import something called you I
mean under two again I'm going to show
you what the do a stud is so that here
we're going to import from Redux persist
vs. store yeah so
here we're going to just set up it's
really simple it's your UI manager you
just forget all the lettuce and stuff
communing from reality we just for be
sure and mission enable XP we meant oh
if like that I think I'm okay I'm going
to see you I manager that set to be true
I'm going to be good perfect
enable yep no typos perfect after that
we need to set up that inside the air
we're going to set up a state called we
default inside a component in mount
right here we're going to do persist or
who takes an argument of the store so
you take the store or fee dogs after
that you take an object a while we tell
we give him him which storage because
you can use with us persist with the web
so you can use the local storage yeah
I'm going to set that whitelist so
finally with whitelist an array of item
we want to persist the reducer so I'm
going to say I want to process the user
reducer after that here come that we're
going to have call back here and that
this is why we can say this asset state
ready to be true like that and we chose
you but that need anything we need to do
it here if the phone is that load or
this that state that really the app not
going to work and now you see because
you remember I was again the I did some
stuff so that's one we do again I need
to click again on Google now I get the
error coming from the tab Bob because I
get my reduce are hereby Redux persist
now so
now what I'm going to do is we're going
to change this stuff here of the fat
ball to make it working here what we've
done is I wasn't really them I didn't do
a lot of pre aggregation before and now
I have more experience with it and I
know now I don't want this anymore to go
inside the class like that so I'm going
to make the change right inside finally
the Navigator right here
so this is where we're going to make all
the navigation stuff and that's going to
be much more better that's going to be
much more easy for us after that to work
with so you're going to see awesome
power that can be so the thing we're
going to do first thing is we're going
to set up the home screen so we get a
signal option here going to be another
function here we return an object and
what are we going to do is we're going
to add our style so finally if we go
back so I'm going to say if we go back
to the home screen you see what
happening is kind of style wise like
that but now we do other style so I'm
going to close this close that sorry a
lot of window yeah what I'm going to do
other style now is equal to a background
color of color red colors so that we
place finally this stuff here after that
I'm going to say add our right so don't
need any more to just do we don't know
do any more right we do at a right now
I'm going to copy paste this line and
I'm going to make it eerie like that at
the top after that I'm going to add es
then say I need to use a reaction but so
I'm going to import react and now I'm
going to import a library I've read with
my team it's coming from a pen flow in
flow touchable so it's just a library
it's just a helper to help you with the
touchable opacity chatter ball without
feedback and everything
you just need now to import a table from
the library and now you don't need any
more to import or travel opacity and in
feedback you're going to see in one
moment or we can do this but I'm going
to import material icon from Expo
perfect and now I'm going to import
styler going to be easier now look what
we can do current so this is the Add
button
remember this is the add button at the
top right I'm going to say add button
equal style and I'm going to wrap my
touchable component now I'm going to
just say I want a map merging right of
10 like that it's a CSS now I'm going to
use this one I'm going to make use and
replace this and I'm going to replace
right there but I need to provide which
kind of feedback I want so I want
opacity you want highlight you just
right here if you want no fight a
feedback you say none and by default so
Android this is the next one after that
here we want to add access to the
navigate so that's going to came from
here we had access to now navigation so
now I can do navigate change that
navigate perfect
so now after that what we need to do so
down that's going to work that's going
to be either right but now I'm going to
reset the air above the tab bar icon
that doesn't define because we need to
change the way of that ball outside both
work now is that was like that so what
I'm going to do is here I'm going to
copy/paste this ball here and now look
oh that's going to change its now that's
going to be you know just important out
some at the top now that's going to be
that bar I found like this and I think I
did them at that ID because of yeah but

option and there in the navigation and
negation but not station screen always
much more simpler now you see add again
the background color red color so what
I'm going to do here I'm going to take
on now bow nutbar default style going to
be equal to an object and I'm going to
add a background color and I'm going to

so I'm going to do here navigation
option now here what I'm going to do
it's this one gonna take again the

take the navigation props and a what
we're going to have its header style so
we have the topic name for the colors
yeah I'm going to make your import
colors from constant and colors I'm
going to sick background colors colors
the red color yep perfect then I'm going
to have a title style off color colored
white colors so that was the style of
title so as you can see they all make a
candle kay so you don't have not anymore
an object inside an object so and now
I'm going to do now here we're going to
use the material icon because if we look
in the Crim meter now they use the
material eyes on air so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to import material
icon at the top I'm going to import my
library touchable from a pin so
touchable I'm going to import some
component I'm going to create a close
button component so just a sky component
I'm going to put the touchable in so
when you do the wrap here like like here
finally you keep all the props you
finally you just tie this thing so you
don't need any more to inline style so
here's anything we in one it's a merging
layer up then that's it
so after I can see others left oops
like that but like that be close button
remember we need to pass a feedback and
we want the feedback of opacity so that
I'm going to have a unpress even that's
going to be equal to the navigation that
go back after that ear I'm going to pass
