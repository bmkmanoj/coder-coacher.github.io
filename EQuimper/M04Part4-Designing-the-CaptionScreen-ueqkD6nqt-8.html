four of this milestone number four so
what are we gonna do for this one is
gonna be about designing the caption
screen so the one just after the where
we pick the image so that's going to be
the last screen before you can send a
photo to the server so this is what
that's gonna look like not a crazy
design just pretty simple here we're
gonna be able to see the photo we just
have pic and after that we can write
some caption at increase here and also
after that we can we're gonna create a
tag page where a user can finally search
between the tag we have X address so
this is this is what we're gonna do so
now the plan is gonna be abound when we
click here on a photo we want to have a
Next button just showing there so what
are we gonna do is we're gonna go inside
a create photo screen and in this one
what we're gonna do is we're gonna do
inside the selec function right there
we're gonna add a function from react
nets and navigation or finally we can
show a button so what are we gonna do
it's right there we're gonna say this
that proves that Navigator so if we know
we're gonna have photo select so this
that props that navigator that set
button so here you can set about a new
one and this thing it's a function we
take an object Y you can have a key
called right button we take an aviary
inside this one we're gonna add one with
an ID of go to caption remember decided
need to be unique and the title is going
to be next so this would because we have
a title you gonna take Jers that's going
to be a text ya know icon nothing that's
like it what we can add also its
animated to be true okay so now if we
run this code I'm gonna just put my that
sorry about that okay so now if we check
what its gonna happen I'm gonna click
you know you see we get this next button
right there but now these next to
nothing when I
so what I can do for that yes we're
gonna do like we did on the other one
where we can finally bind the navigator
it's gonna be about maybe about binding
the navigation function here inside the
constructor so what are we gonna do it's
finally we're gonna add a constructor
right there what we're gonna have the
props we can add the super right there
we're gonna have also the props now we
can say this we're gonna just finally
cut this thing and passing right there
and now right there we're gonna do like
we've done on the other page it's we're
gonna create a function called on
navigator event so on Navy Gator even
we're we're gonna add an even and now
what we can do here it's if either type
equal nav bar button press here now we
can do if that ID equal the ID we have
put so this go to caption so that ID
equal go to caption now here we can do
something with that so what we're gonna
do is we're gonna this that prop that
navigator that push we're gonna push a
new screen and the screen is gonna be
the Instagram clone dot caption screen
we're gonna create this one don't worry
we're gonna have a title of new post and
also we're gonna pass props so here this
pass props function we're gonna give you
access to the key you put there so here
that's going to be image so we can use
the image we have here inside the select
by saying this that proves that image
and now it what we're gonna pass is this
that state that's selected okay so now
we're going to create a new screen
caption screen inside this one we're
gonna do a really quick component so
we're gonna create that as a per
component we're gonna have a view text
style sheet a style sheet
we're gonna do just do really simple
thing here with a route of flex one
we're gonna create really
sorry we're gonna create a caption
screen right there well here the
components going to be now a pure
component now here we're gonna have a
view with a style of route and inside
this one I think crazy but just the text
if I can type hello
okay now what we're gonna do is this
caption screen we're gonna go inside the
index @gs from the screen folder we're
gonna finally import a caption screen
we're gonna copy paste this one and
finally we're gonna just change both
caption screen right there so we're
gonna do be just so this new component
so now if I came here and I click on a
photo and I click Next nothing happened
why it's because now we have forget to
bind this thing so now what we can do is
we can say props that navigator that set
on navigator even so finally you we're
gonna finally bind the this that on
navigator even that vine this right
inside a constructor and what we don't
use this that process because we have
the props here inside a constructor like
that so now if I say next we get the new
post page so you see we get to this
place so now we're gonna close this page
we don't need any more liquid for the
screen and now we had access to the
photo okay just by showing you what I'm
gonna do
it's right I'm gonna control lock this
that props and I'm gonna set this that
props okay
so now you're gonna see right there the
process of what we're gonna get so if I
close this one I select one and I click
next with the props we got we get all
the Navigator stub blah blah blah and we
also get the image where it's a node and
this node has the image and inside the
image we have the file name right there
and we have all the stuff in the
Uwharrie the one we need okay so now
we're gonna design this stuff really
quick so what we're gonna do
it's we're gonna put here a view so
we're gonna replace this text with a
view this view here we're gonna have
another view inside that
and this view here I'm gonna have a
style of image rapper and this one's
gonna add a style of adders okay we're
gonna just put this boat here and ours
and image rapper after that we can add
another one called image because we're
gonna have an image right there so we
can call image and the image here what
we're gonna do is this one will have the
style of image and the source now it's
going to be equal to this that proves
the image that note that image that you
re so the thing I'll just show you right
there okay so now we have the image so
now how can we design these headers in
this image rapper will be pretty simple
the other is gonna add ID of 150 and a
flex direction of row image rapper is
going to add a flex of 0.4 and I justify
contain of center and a line item of
center so if I would if I do this what's
gonna happen now
it's yeah we don't get anything because
the image have nothing so for the image
we're gonna have a ight of 100 and a
width of 70 pixel okay and now that's
gonna looks pretty boring but at least
we're gonna get this image right there
okay now we're going to create a new
view inside still inside others right
there but now this view ears gonna be
the caption wrapper okay so style that
caption wrapper this caption wrapper is
going to be the finally the box of the
input okay so this one we're gonna see
flex of one so take all the space we
still have and you're gonna have both
justify another item Center so we can
just paste this thing here so now if I
do this what's gonna happen it's that
gonna push a bit the image we have a key
to the left so now we have all the other
space if you want to see that maybe
better way
if I sit back on kolovrat what can
happen in the caption wrapper then I
take all the other space we have right
there okay so now we can put we can put
a text input right there
so I'm gonna import the text input from
the react native and now this text input
it's gonna be right there first thing we
can have a placeholder off I think I
have say write a caption right caption
da da da and now I'm gonna just remove
this rail okay so now if I put my input
like that what's gonna happen
it's my input it's gonna be just like
this in the middle okay so that's what
we're gonna design this input so how can
we do this gonna be pretty simple so
first thing don't forget to say I'm
gonna call that caption input just to
make sure
oops caption input and this one's gonna
have that inside this tie right there
this and the caption input I'm gonna
take a width of 100 cell of esperen so
all the flags and we're gonna also say
padding vertical so that means padding
from the top to the bottom we're gonna
say 10 and we sleep padding right on
knee of 10 okay and now we're gonna say
out of 100 so now if we look at this
what's gonna happen with the caption its
the input you're gonna take this space
right there the thing is if I type you
see I'm still in one line so how can we
manage that is bad he's just passing the
multi-line property inside that because
it's misaligned called true we don't
need to say equal to so now if I do this
now you see the right back action come
out the top and now if I type we get
take all the space okay okay and now
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
create inside the state here a caption
who's gonna be an empty string by
default just to build a controller input
right there so we're gonna save value
equal to this that state that caption
okay now we can we move this console and
now I'm gonna create on caption change
this fuck this callback here going to
receive the caption oops and you're
gonna just finally set the state of the
value to this day like that and that's
gonna be on change text so poops on
change text so lets me read a function
where we're gonna call the on caption
change so now we're gonna have nothing
to that change for you but at least now
we keep track of what is the caption now
what we can do also it's for the Android
user I think we need to say underline
color and oil or GBA and we're gonna say
zero zero zero zero just don't get the
underline on the text input now what
we're gonna do is as you see right now
what I miss it's like this kind of a
divider so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna create this component really quick
but before that I'm gonna go inside my
team and I'm gonna create a color that
yes so this thing gonna be gonna be now
Jack wire finally we're gonna just do I
think I'm gonna like it much more if I
say like yeah and I'm gonna sit light
gray okay I'm gonna create a fun color
called light gray and this color finale
is gonna be just a C 1 C 9 c9 + d3 like
that ok now I'm gonna take this color
inside that export everything from color
and now if I go here if I go to my
component I'm gonna create a new one
called divide out a GS and this divider
idea is going to be finally just a view
with the ID of one we're gonna take the
full space and the background color
nothing more so import we are from unity
we need the view and the style sheet
we're gonna see here a root of I of one
width of 100 pixel a portion so take the
full space of the parent background
color now what we
say it's we're gonna import this color
so from the team
so you'd seal team and now I can see
colors so here that gonna let me do in
color that light gray and now I'm gonna
save margin vertical from margin from
the top to the bottom
I'm gonna save five so nothing can be at
five pixel from the top to the bottom
from it so now I'm going to export the
full a function call divider and this
divider gonna take nothing more than
just nothing as a browse bug gonna just
return a view finale with the style of
fruit okay so it's just a really plain
component and now what I can do here
it's because I want to import all that
from the index I'm going to show you
something because we import that export
that as a default we can export default
as divided are from the divider right
there and now because of this I can do
this with the photo coral so yeah so now
it's gonna be a bit more cleaner okay so
now what I can do
it's take this divider from my component
folder you see like that and now what I
can do
it just right there putting the divider
so now if we look what happen it's now
we get this night was just for that but
at least now that's gonna be that gonna
help us in the long run so now what we
can do here it putting another view here
and this view and not a view we're gonna
use touchable because we need the row to
be touchable so we're gonna say
touchable from app and float up table so
now we're gonna say check ball touch a
ball right there too don't forget to
pass the feedback to be opacity
and now this one's gonna be pretty
simple we're gonna have a view here why
are finally we're gonna just see text of
tags and another one here while we're
gonna import from the doctor icon so Ian
icons from vector icon yihang icon like
that so now we're gonna add this icon
and this one's gonna have the name of
iOS arrow forward with the size of 20 so
now if we get that we get that row there
and the tag but now as you can see we
need to put that as a flexed Direction
row so we're gonna create here as a
styling detachable this item this lease
item now I'm gonna have a good amount of
CSS we're gonna say finally height 40
width of 100% border button width of 1
so we're just gonna have finale line
below each of them so this way that's
going to be easier for us to have just
like looking to be a this item and not
to divider each of top of the other one
so now here we're gonna need also to
import the color we just create so from
the util folder so you'd seal team and
we're gonna say here border button color
color that light gray we're gonna softer
that padding or is on toast
a recent own we don't own so the padding
from the left to the right
16 so 16 right 16 left a line item
center justify contain space between so
we want each element to go at the
extremity of the list item and finally
the Flex direction
this is where the magic came so now if I
save this thing what's gonna happen now
it will get this line okay first thing
here you see the color is not right we
not want the color to be great so like
we like that and now also for the text I
think we can keep like that so now you
see when I click on that it's pretty
nice so this is the touchable thing came
up for us I think also we don't need to
have the view here but I'm gonna show
you what we do this in the future video
so now the only thing I think happen
it's now we have the keyboard okay
and now out we want to close the
keyboard if we click outside okay so
what we can do for that is gonna be
releasing we're gonna import a keyboard
we're gonna wrap this view right there
to be a touchable and now make sure now
the feedback is going to be none and for
the in Android part we want to disable a
native okay because by default we're
gonna see the repo and now here we can
see on press keyboard that dismiss don't
call it here just put the dismiss like
that so now well it's gonna happen it's
now if I open my keyboard I click
outside you see we close yeah so I think
it's just better for the user experience
okay so that's it for this screen and
that's it for this video so that was
pretty quick that was just about putting
this this one but you see now because we
pass props if you think that gonna
change this red caption thing okay I
think it's pretty nice so now what we're
gonna left to do it's reading a caption
or not
M maybe a choosing tag and after that
here we can add their shirt button right
at the top and now we're gonna upload
that to the back end that's gonna be in
the next video so I hope you enjoy this
one and we're gonna talk in the next one
remember the code is on github and the
github repo is in the description
