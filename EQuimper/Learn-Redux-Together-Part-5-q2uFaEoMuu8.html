so now time to create the to do but in
the API so we can add some kind of like
size suit that can we don't need to
always create so air inside the DB we
have already some to do so now we're
going to just make it as an empty area
first so the thing are we gonna do is
inside my source finally I'm going to
create a folder called YouTube inside
this one I'm going to create a EP like a
another folder called P I and in this
one I'm going to create my to do epi the
GS so that's going to be what I'm going
to do my abstraction of my epi there's
going to be much more easy for us after
that work which we don't so here we're
going to import Axios from axial so I
access the library for make a request
after that ear what we're going to do is
I'm going to create my class to do epi
like that and inside this one I'm gonna
create a constructor and I'm going to
create this that path and I'm going to
create a slash to dupes so this will see
me to a multiple kind of value for X
election era so here like inside this to
do here Mike left to do I'm going to add
after that here I'm going to create an
async function so using it's a New Year
seven a seven feature just better than
promises or called back for me so create
to do here we're going to take an
argument and finally we're going to have
a try catch or a catch if we have an
error we're going to return the error
but here the catch going to be cons data
when we go to avoid Axios that post
HTTP look at all
Edie Edie / to do so what we don't need
to do as we have it in the constructor
like that so here I can put this that
fat with a like that so because you have
the slash
but again actual give us a way to make
Axio that default that base URL and I'm
going to paste my led by default
actually going to toggle this and now
what I can do it just remove yes any
move that and now we need to send an
object and object gonna be the arch
after that I'm going to return my data I
think I bring something somewhere okay
Kooks why I get you know my spacing my
class cost rixton class to do my concept
are missing okay enough so here sorry
I'll make people that's the beauty of
life code Eiffel I'm gonna already
create my get out get out to do another
try cap I'm going to recoup then I
return e and here I'm going to do the
same but now there's going to be a gap
and the arcs need perfect so now I get
all and I create so now here I'm going
to export default new to the ETI so I
don't need to like create my class so
finally what I can do now it's inside my
direction here the top I'm going to
import to do epi
from util API to do we do
yes like that
so now when I create it to do I want to
toggle mighty I but I always I also want
to fulfill my Redux in a way to make it
like real-time so the way you can undo
this is with Vedic Stone you have no
access to the dispatch method or the
dispatch it's a way to do is sing a
dispatch method which we does so here
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
copy by listing three time and I'm going
to success and fire it this one I'm
going to do error so you're going to see
what I'm going to do air inside my Creek
to do here I'm going to do dispatch and
I'm going to dispatch my type of create
to do a pad I'm going to add a try-catch
we're here if I whenever I'm going to
return my dispatch a side create to do
error and my error here in time I try
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to
do con data equal and air what I'm going
to do is equal I wait because we have
these in here a way to do API to do API
dot create to do and now I'm going to
put my text but I wonder there needs to
be as an object so I'm going to put here
inside curly brackets like that and now
here finally when it's done I'm going to
return a dispatch of type create to do
success and with my text
this week's not the best way because it
ain't we get a galaxy so I'm going to
show you first thing the reducer or that
going to looks like I'm going to secrete
to do error and create to do success I'm
going to use the formatter prettier okay
so air inside the Crete to do I'm going
to have a key case Crete to do success
and I'm going to have case Crete to do
ever well now I need to change the word
and dull my to do in everything so now
another good thing to do it current
initial state here I'm going to have my
two dues going to be a nine theory or
what I like it to have data so I'm gonna
have my error is going to be new and
after I'm going to add is section to
post I'm going to be able to show
eluding after that year inside the Crete
to do so here we're going to need to
change a lot a lot of stuff here so now
what we're going to do here and then you
add initial state so here's a quick to
do
oh we're gonna continue to do now good
to do going to be now so this function
is called when that starts so what we
want here is to just return phonology
switch on the state when you add a
success we want to return the state so
we're going to keep the state l ER right
now we're going to is search to be true
so if such a so that means it's it's
it's been done and after that we are
going to have data
oh the to do we gonna have so there are
going to be equal to dot dot say that
data and we can add the action that
action that not going to be the text now
it's going to be this data so action
that data like that in the success so
this way but now enzyme action now I
need to make my UI
because the thing is finally today we do
Sodom we're going to tell you yet so now
it's a good place to put it inside the
API here you ID from your ID before now
we're going to change finally liquid to
do eras my Ark so here what I'm going to
do finally is I'm going to do text I'm
going to be equal to argue that text I
thought I'm gonna ID equal to you ID
like that and complete to be false by
default on that paycheck so now here
what I'm going to create I need to do
and I'm going to be returned here I'm
going to be returned with the this text
and everything so now inside my we do so
that's what we're going to do action
that data like that after that here what
we can already toggle to as an action
it's now going to be the attach to do
because now we need to catch a B to do
because we don't we see the to do by
default so now I'm going to create
another so and call fetch to do it that
this one going to be such to do success
and this one let me set to do error so
I'm going to create a function called
export function fetch to do it we turn
amazing dispatch this before we're going
to dispatch type of fetch to do after
that I'm going to have a try catch here
if I whenever I'm going to return this
such type of fetch to do error and my
ever and elite here what I'm going to do
is count then is going to be called out
wait to do API that get out to do and
finally I'm going to return a dispatch
the type of fetch to do success and my
data so
going to get all the to do coming from
the ETI so now that that's big that's
why here we have this thing so now here
what I'm going to do is that that that
I'm going to attach to do such to do
error and such to do success here I'm
going to create a case called
fetch to do yeah I'm going to return
turn this side I'm gonna fetch to do
success and I return my data equal to
action that data because now it's an
average so whatever ninja we're going to
be taken away and it's fetched to be
true so it's done such is gone but the
stay here and I forget to make the error
ever going to be equal to action that
error and I'll give you almost the same
for fetch to do ever going to be
perfect so this way but now these are
supposed to be not not perfect so now
we're going to interchange inside that
all that going to being do first thing
we need to fetch the we need to get the
set reduce action right there after that
I'm going to change my visit props here
so what we can do is we can create a
function for that to do component now
we're going to start with a lot of stuff
so we're going to create a folder called
component I'm going to put the to do
that GA here we're going to be a that's
going to be a perfunctory
we win it like that and we're going to
return so finally we're going to
copy/paste what we have here but we
don't need the key are you here we can
add the text we're going to be
structuring the text and just for now
we're going to remove all the action
we're going to get some bug sign here
right back like that so now here I can
import so import to do from to do anti
component so here I'm going to map over
here now that's going to be just a to do
maybe much more simpler and less code to
write so here I'm going to just seek to
do it what I can say it to do so I'm
going to be structuring everything I'm
going to show you what they're doing and
execute of this thing here I'm going to
put a key off to do the ID but now again
we have the same problem because this
approach that map is not working so
that's going to be these across the data
that map but now that we're gonna have
nothing because the data it's empty we
need to fetch API first so that's going
to be a good place to do this
the component in mouth so we're going to
call this that proves the catch to do if
I do this look what can happen in the
console I get such to do and now I get
such to do success so I get my data and
I get my data coming from the back end
so and because if I can have nothing
admitting I received nothing that's what
so now UID inside to do action P do so
so I don't need anymore UUID here
perfect so now I want to add the the
like the new to do for for when I create
air the to do so now what I can do is if
I start to here hello and I make a click
enter now I get I get free to do so I
call my quick to do function and now I
get pretty to success air I receiving
data and now I have an object so my next
thing now is that that I would and new
to do if I look in my to do here and i
refresh the beauty again now I get a
text with hello and my ID and everything
and if i refresh now I may have some
kind of database set up for that so so
now one thing is because I want to show
a loading so cuz now it it's quick but
we want to have some kind of floating so
inside my up here I'm gonna here I'm
going to read if is that probe that to
do that is fetch so if it's not sexual
if it's not true fill I'm going to
return here and each one see loading so
now if i refresh the screen I'm going to
get a loading for one sec move and I get
Mike data so now if I say L well again
and I click enter I get my hello world
right there
we're going to make some kind of a
performance stuff in the next section
I'm going to show but I want to set this
one let's start to belong so hope you
enjoy hope to see you in the next one
