where we're gonna start to do some
reactive identification so what are we
gonna do in this episode it's about
managing react navigation to make it
work with like when it's lower you can
see that when it's not you can see that
so this is what we're gonna do so if we
if you have follow me in the pants it is
on if you start your reignites a project
you're gonna get this problem and we get
that because we are not at all right so
first thing we're gonna do go inside
your schema EXO inside Kimo X right
inside the the diagram way up here and
just coming out this line for now well
now I'm gonna refresh and now you work
perfect so now you see I'm not logged
and I'm not supposed to be there so this
is what we're gonna do I don't know why
this folder here okay so what are we
gonna do
it's we're gonna finally create another
file like that another screen where are
we gonna call that login screen and
we're gonna make sure we want to make
sure that the user this is what you see
if he's in that load so this is what are
we gonna do so here what are we gonna do
it's a new full door looking screen I'm
gonna create index that GS inside that
when I just start a really simple
component you text style sheet we're
gonna just set up a route a style
nothing crazy just a prior contain
Center just well a text ins in the
middle for now really okay and here
we're gonna have the logging screen and
then we're gonna say logging screen and
here I'm gonna put a star or route like
that
I'm gonna do as what we've done in the
other screen so I'm gonna create the
same as the Explorer screen and I'm
gonna do command D - getting Bo and
right there what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna just remove the same thing change
that to loading screen and change that
to looking screen like that so now I
have much been on can I handle that now
it's the way I handle this you don't get
a work for a simple thing like that but
I think it's gonna be better if we can
manage that another way I'm going to
show you all we're gonna do this right
there I'm gonna create two functions
first one's going to be called start
logging so one one's going to be called
star main hat okay
the start main app is going to be
everything we have already do here
gonna be the main application so this is
when you're a lot here the start logging
app is going to be when you're not so
we're gonna start with a single single
screen a sink
start single screen app so not a tap
it's gonna be a login page so we don't
need a tap is gonna be just okay just a
single screen finally
so here what are we gonna do it's a
screen what we're gonna say right there
screen it's gonna be equal to Instagram
loan that login screen the one we just
create after that the one I don't want
to have the header at the top I'm gonna
see that the other style in here that's
gonna be an object I'm gonna say nav bar
I don't need that I'm gonna do select
that enough I guess and now I'm gonna
remove this snap here
how can I initialize this is by doing
something like that I'm going to pin
another function trout in it okay
so now I'll go new are we gonna start
that first thing is we're gonna create a
new you till here function call app e me
see lies the GS here is gonna be where
we're gonna start the application hey
what we gonna do is this function we're
going to exfoliant in me see lines that
it's gonna be any asynchronous function
and I also gonna explode before we're
going to be easier and what I'm going to
import also is the easing storage so
like I told you in the other pizza is we
work with your ability so we're going to
see that everything is in storage so
here is gonna be the place where this
thing is the first function get calling
the application and we're gonna make
sure then this is the place where we're
gonna finally avoid missing storage that
get item when I call that Instagram
Chrome and I'm gonna sit okay so here we
get a check if we're gonna get the
toolkit after that what I want to do is
if I don't have a token let me do
something else doing something else so
if you follow me what I'm trying to do
here is I'm gonna import finally my
function oops
the from here but on my nap will import
my start login and start main app so if
I have no token I want to make sure you
get pushed to the login page if you have
a token I want to make sure you go to
the right page
but now the thing is now we had this
icon the load we need to make sure we're
gonna load the icon first so that's why
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
import that right there at the top so we
need to make sure we get the icon'
loading first so we're gonna do this
before the token and this is a premises
so we can call that right there like
that but the thing is this function
you're going to add really we're
programming we do this so all we're
gonna manage that it's we need to make
sure then that's going to be a function
we're gonna call it promises or like
that so a function of color premises now
you see we have some arrow with the SDM
we're gonna figure out right now remove
react we don't need that or - we don't
need to Vijay don't use it and now here
they say there is not defined so what
are we going to do is we're going to
take they're gonna go inside yes Liam
global
copy paste that and we're gonna sit fall
so this way we get nothing
okay so now we have that we have that
but now if I reach F you see how I get
this thing because why because inside my
index a GS I'm using again than that at
the app here I'm gonna say yet and now
here I'm gonna call my content in it
it's gonna still don't work because
right now we're gonna still ear like you
don't know where to start
but what we're gonna do is we're gonna
go inside the nav right there and now
we're going to import this function we
just create inside the YouTube until I
finish a line and we're going to import
this had initially and finally we just
call that right there
initial on me she Eliza and now if i
refresh public entry now we ceased if I
get this adult I'm gonna remove that so
like a navigator style I'm going to say
that bar Eden to be true I don't want
well and I've got here because that's
going to be the need to looks like this
one
so I'm going to refresh and that's it
clogging screen you see so finally if
you want to test it what you can do it's
going back to a Finnish allies intercept
and in the ear if I let okay I'm good a
good clogging it's not I'm going to go
to the start main app I'm going to
refresh I know you see so it's the
inverse that's at Foley Zippy's up next
one we're going to design this page here
it looks pretty boring right now after
that we're gonna install the Facebook
SDK I hope you enjoyed this little it's
done and again the codes going to be on
Gator as a good day on by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
