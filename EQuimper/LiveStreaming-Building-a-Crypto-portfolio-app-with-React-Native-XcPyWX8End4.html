this one now what I'm gonna do
all my style it's breaking right now
just queasy all breakers of the star
company and prettier so merging top on
the top merging top holding talk boy so
this one oh now I'm gonna go here oops
here I'm gonna see
again launching top padding or is until
padding
here with a week age here with a big age
here this is a big deal but I can almost
all VD here I'm gonna quit that with the
star shooting star shooting some view
and text Reuter when I pass all the CSS
inside that this thing this thing and
this one this one and this one no this
isn't gonna be a view and now it's gonna
be an arrow with style that rotor and
this one so now can delete this thing
thank you after that I'm gonna have
title
I know from the ye it's always in string
so title is going to be a text with an
arrow where you only study that title
same for this thing
and same for this one
so not a new title after that I'm going
to have the amount
I'm on is ear text where you find that
inside an array and you see Skype that I
mind you do the same for this more deco
know that I mind and now anyway that's
going to get texture and a text
I'm on this way so now can you learn a
the last one table table element and the
style component really up my app
I have a lot CSS to redo and don't know
why you get treated like that
it's a thing just if I can't
thing oh so what I think I can do it
justify contain search for all that and
now I can just say justify contain if
you were yeah perfect
and now it's not supposed to believe you
yeah I still have one in justify no I
have nothing yeah this is what I do
thank you
I forget it
and now man justify contain justify
contain it's not a variant where a line
sell I'm gonna replace that alight self
man what is this down
we play string yes this is what I want
to do I'm not it's not supposed to man
you need to all save them that's why how
do you save our safe oh oh so now it's a
line-item sorry about this mess up a
line I eat em when I replace all that
with a line I am we plays all of them
after you do it's coming sheesh
come on I'm gonna just click Save Oh
perfect I think that all of them save Oh
font size
all of them see well and was really long
zine decks z-index who is a singer very
but never use more than top I'm going to
all we do my next CSS with plane yeah
that's it no I don't want to get this
problem anymore
just crazy
we're saying it's it's love not with s
no margin yes
okay
okay so now what I will need first thing
I'm gonna first thing to commit for this
thing what I've done here feed your flow
time okay
it's the new PDO who did all that Soviet
sorry about my bad mistake but push
origin master now it should be okay
perfect I can close everything we start
from scale yeah
so now I'm gonna manage it I think it's
I kind of like this design but what I
would like I have to it's now I I've set
up one detail here I've set up another
coin graph in this is this candle thing
the thing about this thing it's thinking
about this candle thing it's look at the
mess up I I do they can dealt in here
when I put so much stuff you just become
too much crazy that the thing I will
have to be able to go light right laughs
if I go to my shirt and I go to my
detail candle if I remove the bat if I
remove the background and I change this
to be a length of maybe 50
look at what that do I really don't like
this
this candle stuff here yeah so that's
what I'm thinking about I'm gonna still
use this one but what I'm gonna do I
kind of like this but here I should put
a pattern ear we say like more detail or
something like that I think so air it
just a really quick view and now here I
should put a button about the graphite
thing so if we go here vector I can this
is what I think
and that internet is so slow today but
thank you a gyro about the tips sometime
when you forget some stuff grass
so here what I think I should do have
two idea bow though I'm gonna manage it
say I think I have to take this thing
here so this thing it's another
application and you see like they put
this kind of graph here a blend are you
oh you see so I mean I have really not a
lot of information so what I'm thinking
it's maybe I'm gonna remove the Bitcoin
the Bitcoin icon here maybe gonna put
that here but what I'm gonna do
it's what I think it's a shoe maybe make
a lot of this kind of square all this
screen and put it right right in at the
top corner I grass icon good there now
you are gonna have another page like
that with some button at the top and
that's gonna be where you can have like
a graph like all this kind of graphic
because I I'm really missing a lot of
stuff yes I have the market cap but you
see like first thing I really want to
make it much better to read because I
mean ear I I mean it's impossible to
read that from there for the first one
you see here it's like this 64 I don't
even know I think it's 64 billion so
just crazy how much stuff that go I mean
I really need to format this with maybe
space like you do I think space it's a
really good idea or I can maybe put
kkoma also here the price USD here I
shall have ten and that dot one because
the price is the price here it's it's a
present dollar I mean you never see this
kind of dollar and I kind of like the
effect that neat show when it's red or
green so this is what I think I'm gonna
do so this kind of graphic at the bottom
it's going to be inside its own kind of
you see here what I've done this kind of
stuff here but now this thing gonna only
change this thing I'm gonna click on the
button where I'm gonna get to the graph
I'm gonna still add this thing but right
there at the bottom of this thing I'm
gonna have now a some other bottom where
you're gonna just change the graph I
think that's gonna be the great the
better ID and maybe what I'm gonna do
with the graph it's I'm gonna make it
drag and drop so you can reformat the
graph and put the graph in the order you
want because you're going to have many
graphs so I think that's going to be the
plan for tonight
sorry so now what I should do now it's I
should remove this line here and I'm
gonna also remove this thing the thing
it's if I do this now now I'm gonna have
really mess up stuff here but this
Bitcoin here don't make sense to put the
icon here so now what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go to my point up title we
have the image wrapper here I'm gonna
remove it and I remove it here okay so
this is what I now what I think it would
be better it's price price BTC
so my metal wrapper here
I think I'm gonna put this style at the
top kind of like it when it's at the top
right there okay so now I can remove the
image I don't need that anymore really
good clips here you see I have the red
thing we'll see you new styles so all
you can have via loops is by installing
the plug-in react native and talk about
that like no new style no inline style
no color literal and split that form and
component do like that after that that
mean I don't need anymore this get image
function okay so now you're nothing
gonna break I think you know I'm gonna
make a enable enable live reload because
what I'm saving I want to again so now
whatever I would like it's maybe to have
another for car if I do this what's
gonna happen yeah the thing it's that
film too too big so now I should have
met Accord so here the meta corn here at
the root and the eye of 35% that don't
make any sense I shall just put like a
value of might maybe like 50 like that
but the root yeah this thing it's 52 so
I should say like 100 I'm going to test
it by putting a background color okay so
you see so this is the size I think 100
it's too much or any
these kind of IDI looks like okay maybe
like 90 I'm gonna remove the background
color and now you can just maybe improve
this merging vertical now I break up
everything so if I go with 15 the thing
it's yeah I know no it's really bad the
way I am working because I make it
really like iOS size you just I think oh
I can save me here in chain is putting
that inside a scrollview so I'm gonna
save my life a lot if I go with if I go
with oh you call that not a scholar I'm
gonna get when I'm so sorry I'm really
tired today I'm gonna take this thing
and I'm gonna go in my quaint up here
change my meta reporting I was gonna be
at risk of you and this meta rapper
rohff Lex Edie
this thing should become now content
container style now you see at least I'm
gonna get this kind of stuff area and
what I should maybe say it's because now
it's inside what I can maybe see it's
padding vertical and I'm gonna at least
say maybe ten so this word if I get too
much stuff that gonna go to the bottom
so now this kind of so if I have another
size of another size of mobile I think
follow so now I shall have price BDC
okay so now it's the very way I'm gonna
change it first thing it's really bad to
do this way but for now so what he put
you put the price I have yet
market cap circulating supply volume 24
I think that can be a really good idea
to put that so all I can test that it
just by going to my graphic q1 and just
check out my back-end what I what my
back-end can send me I can add the
volume USD in the past 24 hour so if I
want to do this I'm going to need to
change relay to restart real a compiler
so relay oops not the test but real a
watch because all that's gonna work now
it's Mike when I think it's the coin
here because it's Mike Wayne total here
get the coin ask when you get that from
the prop so I should go to Mike wins you
when I wear as for my stuff and I should
say vol II was the 24 hour
so price USD market cap price Batista
total supply volume
so now I'm gonna have the value of the
volume okay why I don't say volume 24
because here I will have work at that
with the 7/3 maybe I'm not sure if I can
get that answer that which kind of very
you show so percent change so I have
three stuff so gram would be doing so
did I get this thing so person change
person change one hour nothing have one
hour 25 were 70
oh you know what you have a better idea
I'm gonna get this presentation for our
and also this person change 70 what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna say current person
one our percent change one our equal 80
X when that person change when I work it
are 0 yeah that should be 24-hour and
now that will be 70 so now you're all I
can change that it's our
I don't know this one's gonna be one
hour this one's gonna be 24 hour and
this one's gonna be 70 you and there
will be person change on our person
change 24 hour
Quinn market epi okay
follow me we have some stuff here now
here as you can see I will have lied to
have it red or green when it's negative
and I have created a function if I
remember in my youth see live quit a
function here I get if % is negative so
I shall import this function is import
from my youth sell my helper and get if
present if negative okay and now what I
will do its air I will have a function
called get get % colors and this one's
what's gonna do
yet person and get percent this one's
gonna be one our first and this one's
going to be about if this that Pro ups
the coin the person change in our but
this thing I need to put that inside my
get if percent so that's going to return
me return if they're presenting negative
or not so here if this thing with Tony
ass
yeah would like to return so I'm gonna
return a string and what I'm going to
sit I'm gonna return this that props
that team team that red color yeah well
I else we turn these that traps that
team that ring is gonna be in positive
so now this thing error gonna go to my
right there and what I'm going to sick
this the this thing oh no this one this
thing now you should be able to work now
see boom right there and I'm gonna have
to do some error ear yeah so the error
ear now it's cause of this type is
incompatible with the expect parent type
of string and so I DX air become crazy
with this value net idea it but flow so
for because this thing can be noon or
not so what I can just say it's ear
saying hi DX this that drops or air the
props going to give me the coin what
action seconds coin equal this thing
after that year I should stick cons
person change one hour equal idx coin
the person change one hour and now this
thing can go there
okay and now if here I can just say zero
yeah so now remove the flow error
I know just for now I'm gonna go there
laughter that
so now on the ocean work okay
oh no the thing is this thing it's
really not good for what I need right
now
so what I can do it's not putting the
icon here but putting replace this thing
to be the react native slide writing and
making with some icon not slider
styler Swiper
show button this is a Swiper oh this is
tab react native tab you know it's not
tab nerdy and raining that is credible
tab view I think yeah this thing
what do you think of this so what that's
gonna do it's you can swipe right to
left and the first one is going to be
like that that data and after I'm gonna
have an icon about maybe like a candle
graph and stuff like that
five man without any change
I mean a chicken same time if I have
some dependent second of doing
Oh Andrea navigation have a new version
not really for using it I mean they I
get break so much with do this thing I
can use it for making other tab
individual
can we use this thing yes or no
okay now what is this thing
yeah start to maybe
I'm going to make it as a component for
now
I'm gonna take all this thing
you
this thing is going to need to be
changed for sure yeah
the only thing now I would like to see
its do this thing here now if I see
metal wrapper I put background color of
red
another thing too it's I think I would
love to add this thing to like
navigation and animation by doing this
after the I thing I wanted to have this
wipe enable try doing this now I can go
there and you see what I mean just poof
poof when I go there so now here I can
put some icon that's gonna be done so
you see I'm gonna kind of can use this
kind of icon what I'm gonna do here is
I'm gonna import and people from vector
and now here what I can say I think it's
navigation option oh yeah but that don't
gonna be this one this one's gonna be
this one navigation option for air I can
return like that and I'm gonna just go
back to my own navigation option and yes
this is tab bar like that okay here I
can maybe use this thing I'm gonna use
it later not yet yeah that's gonna be
empty PO I'm gonna say maybe Trudy and
I'm gonna say this one it's gonna be
area graph like that not by doing that
we're gonna see if that's gonna work
okay so now we have that so now what I
should say it's labeled false
where I go navigation label show label
in September option okay so now I'm
gonna need this kind of stuff here show
icon to exit corner okay so now I'm
gonna need the colors so have it so I'm
good
so now you see perfect okay so we're
pretty close I think after that the i50
to be forty will would be better I don't
think the idea go at the good place so
how can we see that it's by going back
to the one we have
okay so fine I need just highlighting
yeah so you see what I mean it's this
thing not navigation
okay it's better now just for now for
dissing it
kind of gonna need this bar line to I
think I can provide the Kendall the area
graph the bar graph so I'm gonna have
another bar
what that
okay so I'm gonna need to connect this
thing so what I'm gonna do I think it's
I'm gonna when I clean all this
after it just no it's
think this is all I've done here
Holden
oh boy
it's not pork
okay because I are getting the turbo
bottom for me here
I don't see why you will need this thing
oh it's not this thing now it's this
thing
oh
turbo option
fell for props what I give you a color
color that primary
a man what is the problem
you're gonna check for this thing
peaceful now
so what can I put there I mean like what
dollar sign or something that maybe if
you have an idea button icon you can
look at and told me that this is for
like the detail for the first one I
think maybe grid but I you know what I'm
gonna go with the grid for now because I
have no idea
yeah
like that and now this yellow thing I
don't know but I'm gonna keep it for now
now I'm gonna be about passing the data
I'm not quite sure but I think I can put
air some drops by default
all did I set up that in my navigation
for passing the team I say that in
screen props okay well I'm going to say
its ear cons screen crops quote and I'm
gonna say team and coin screen props so
now what I think it's now I can go to my
market little time and I'm gonna get the
coin
like doing this that perhaps that
navigation that Parham that screen props
no so my god I'm glad that buyed is that
screen crops when I need to change all
the place where I have the props by
doing screen crops
now that's going to be is that progress
screen corruption
this is what I think and now I can take
this thing put it back inside my scroll
view put it back there
Oh Oh
boom-boom-boom
not on that
what was the name that was indicator
star lighting
for tab bar button tab bar option for
tobert oh yeah that was this is the same
thing
Oh
so it's like this and here you say
background color
mm what do you think of this new change
I'm gonna try it on my phone oh yeah
it's really better but you know what we
have already done a lot of job so here
this one's gonna follow the pattern of
what I would like to do before and now I
can just put the diagram right there at
the bottom for this one and maybe just
like I don't know what thing with the
tree you can show Shawn some number at
the bottom and at the right at the left
so but what I think it for now I'm gonna
just make first thing they stab gonna
start to take a lot of place
always about refactoring some code yeah
I know I'm gonna need V Docs and also
I'm gonna need what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna take this take that go here take
this thing and see what we need so we
need just from type after that I'm gonna
need this kind of stuff
okay now we have kina a lot of disco so
not I've already dysgraphia and this
graph it's my queen detail line
you
Wow really
really or God
some diction
Oh
no no no that time writing
you
like that like that after that we need
to go to coin little tag I'm gonna
import here the graph non-growth detail
no if I go there okay
finally I'm just redoing what I would
have done before man
what do you think of of depth
for this one I can maybe sell easy
hmm do you like it they return my will
fall
I think I'm gonna just disable the side
view
what as I can set up this thing here I
would like to set up that I just you I
can maybe show like Ivan Lowe is I'm not
relaxed radar so this is this is the
thing some older boy and I also just I
do this there because this is what my
friend who trade asked me to to do to
add a feature
so what I'm gonna need for the next day
so surely Friday I'm gonna code and I'm
gonna do the API call to get the graph
here gonna be a good amount of coal and
I'm gonna need to cash it with Venus I
kind of like it I think it's going to be
the Kendall you're near it's going to be
the graph
like I think if I go to Expo
and I'm log yeah okay I think it's react
native victory victory for victory short
what is that you Explorer
oh whoa
custom combo
candlestick this is what I need live
preview time candle color positive or
negative so use asunder props so they
ever unload
well that's gonna be good fun for the
next one without that I think that's
gonna be the plan so for your I'm not
sure if I'm gonna change this one but
for the barrier I can surely go with
this kind of bar here
and for the candle here I'm gonna go
with the candlestick right there
yeah that's gonna be what I'm gonna do
to Friday tomorrow its record they
record a foursome video
yeah hurry well
yeah so I'm gonna finish that later I
think it's done for tonight my eyes is
my eyes are burning right now so so hope
you're gonna you have enjoyed this thing
so if I messed up I mean it's life
cutting so I have nothing prepare it's
all live code so I hope you enjoy and
we're gonna talk surely tomorrow when
I'm gonna record a video I'm gonna
restream my Friday night so hope you
enjoy and have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
