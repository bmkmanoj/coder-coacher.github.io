hello everyone
part number eight so today what we gonna
do it we're going to continue with the
mobile design so yes again that is going
to be most like kind of boilerplate code
you just like because we need to set up
the front end part so this is always
finish the last episode so that was good
just a simple scroll list nothing more
just with the same duplicate data what
we're going to finish today is we're
going to set up finally the router thing
so we're going to add a with the stack
navigation for the others here and we
can have also the tab navigation with
the fourth screen so this is the depth
and for today so we're going to manage
that so after that tomorrow we can start
to much more but on the other itself we
can start to plug really Apple client
with the back end and fetching the stuff
so this is what we're going to finish so
I'm gonna take this thing I'm going to
put them there I'm gonna take my code
and I'm going to make it right there and
also what you don't need you don't want
forget to at start of the server because
the number Apollo client need to have
the server running now so I'm going to
just open this bill are we going to be
good to go so first thing we're going to
do is right now the way we under all
that if we add the home screen and we
importing the home screen inside the app
that yet but we're going to change that
are we going to do this if we going to
change we're going to add a navigation
file inside a source file so if we close
this thing this thing here we can add
the navigation GA so this is where we're
going to finally create all the stuff
about the navigation so ALR the first
thing I'm going to import its react
react component like that after that I'm
going to import stuff coming from react
navigation you don't need to install
yang navigation as setup that in the
mobile starter so here I'm going to just
say I want the navigation helper also
want the tax net
and I want this tab navigator this is
what we're going to need for today after
that I'm going to import the I'm going
to import connect from redux if I find
mine like that and this is what we're
going to start for a stirred up we're
going to import the screen we need first
so that's going to be phone screen
coming in from screen on screen and now
here what we going to do is we're going
to create the app main nap so this is
all I'm going to call that and that's
going to be an instant of the stack
navigator I'm gonna sit home so that's
going to be the name of the screen
they're going to take an object where
you pass a screen on it I'm going to
pass oh we can't run out so after that
right there what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go down I'm going to create a
class call up navigator like that in
this one with dong a nap stay here what
I'm gonna do right there it's because I
want to manage the navigation which
Redux a bit so here what I'm going to
fix I'm going to create my navigation
helper this is kind of boilerplate code
right Dom I don't like it's not me it's
what we had navigation asked so here you
just need to pass some stuff inside that
internally here what you return is the
admin nav and you pass inside the
navigation you pass the net so here what
we need to ask is we need to have access
the state communing inside without state
for the navigation and we need to also
add a dispatch method who is built-in on
V dogs so all you do this is by
connecting this thing right there by
connecting that now I like says to the
dispatch just by doing this so here what
I can see now it's a dispatch going to
be equal to this that Club that dispatch
because now I've accepted is that
because I have connecting my components
after that mean I need fast state so
that state here I'm going to take it
right from here so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to do my nap schedule crops
right there I'm going to take the state
and I want to have the nav and I want to
have this take that nap so we're going
to create that in a moment
hey I'm going to take this that plug
that map so that's going to be this
props here but now that's going to crash
maybe not because I know why it's in
crash because we didn't import it so you
don't see it right now so if I import
this file right there so I'm going to
remove the own screen I'm going to take
the app navigation from source
navigation and I'm going to pass it
there now it crashed because we don't
have like the the nav reducer so are we
going to do this go inside the reducer
create a file called navigation and this
one this is where we're going to plug
everything about the navigation in this
code again it I don't read this thing
it's really coming from the ducts of
react navigation so here we need to take
that from the navigation file but the
Raza we didn't import it so we need to
make it import you're going to see that
so it's pretty simple all that warfare
you just so if they want to know where
are you with the router and by doing
this the only thing you need to do it
States imported I'm gonna import
controls are and I'm gonna say that's
going to equal to the map at that name
admin nap because this is going to be my
first navigation and I'm gonna say that
router so this is the instant at the
router object coming in and up me not
yet
so now what I can do from here it's now
I can take here and now I'm going to do
a reduce our yeah but I'd only read this
one I'm going to take like that will
take a night I stood in action and tell
you what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take on new take equal russer russer
that yep get the state for action and
I'm going to get action here and I'm
going to pass the stick to so this is
action and they say we pass and finally
we return the new state all we're
returning the state different
change so now what I can do is take this
reducer go here say import nap from
navigation and now here I could just a
snap key value the same I can just put
like that and now that should be working
yeah and now magically we have a headers
right there so we did we did like yeah
good amount of code but finally just
thing like we set up the the domain that
navigation here we create a class called
opening the guitar group here inside the
class I can put my and navigation alper
and I get access to dispatch in the NAP
because I've connected that to the redox
state SR and now I'm importing the
wrapper careening from the abdomen and
have a from ear but this code you just
do this one time in your apps so I just
really for setup everything perfect so
now I want to do some change about the
design about the others because we have
this one already building so that's
going to be pretty easy so first thing I
want to change the card and now I'm
going to want to change the card style
so like that kind of background color
and stuff like that and I also want to
change like the mode and so all we can
do this it's right there after this
pretty bracket here I can put another
pretty bracket here and put some
function so yeah I'm going to see chord
style I'm going to put a background
color and I'm going to see a background
color of f1 s is s yeah like that so
that's going to be there cards so when
you change you're going to see that in a
moment after that I'm going to see and I
want to get a navigation option where
I'm going to put the other style and
this one I'm going to have the
background color and I want the color
coming in from my color file of the 940
stands so on there the background color
of my derp to beat white so if I do this
now the others here at the top going to
be
why perfect this is what we want after
that I want to change the other title
style so we're going to add a adder
there at the top and I want to change
that so what I'm going to want is just
to have a big fun wait
I think it's Hg yeah and I'm going to
say both and I want to add the color and
I'm going to put my famous song on the
record right there yeah so now we don't
get to see that a lot because I didn't
put a title but you're going to see that
on moment because it now remember what I
show you is we don't just want to add a
stack navigation so the second
aggregation it's like the navigation
like it's a push and pop so like you go
from the left to the right and perfect
that now what I want is my tab - so I'm
need to create a tab so this is what
we're going to do right there so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to click on
that equal tabs navigator and now here
I'm going to sit on this one going to
add the same screen home screen so now
because I can do this now I can put the
top here and I can put right there and
now look at it and even if I save
boom now I get my tab and on my own
so as you see so you can see so now I
can say here at the home screen right
there I want to have the time that Gator
from here and the name of the screen
here is going to be home and stuff like
that perfect so now here I'm going to
put some navigation option - navigation
option and now I can put a header title
either side and I'm going to say oh so
now because we have the the side
navigation now I become with the own
right there at the top perfect this is
what we want now I want to change this
icon like this lab dear first thing I
don't want to have leather I can put an
option here and now what I can do from
here is I'm going to say I want to go a
warm my tab bar
and I'm going to see so icon to be true
if I don't do this the Android don't
going to get icon by default so here I'm
going to show that the close so if I do
this I'm going to remove the leather but
I have no icon so we're going to can
have the thing also what I want to do at
the top is I'm going to sillies the true
I'm going to talk about that later in
this series also I want to put tab bow
position to be button and I want to
remove the swipe enable I don't want to
let the user swipe for changing the tab
now so what I want is a we gonna stay
with that for now
but now what I want it 12 an icon I mean
right now it's over where I am right I
don't know that so how I can do this
it's now I can import so I'm going to
import some power some coming in from
the expo package about the vector icon
like that in here what I can do from
here now I can see tab bar icon here I'm
going to put a thin color right now I
don't have it I'm going to show you what
that do in a second that's like double
like this I don't want to be caring and
I'm going to say give me the font
awesome I want to have a size of 20 I
want to have a color of 10 colors and I
want to have the name of oh now if I do
this magically we get the own icon
remaining compose also so we don't need
to install that because like I told you
we are doing a vector icon in coming
from Expo so now here I want to change
this icon I don't want this blue when
this is active because now it's active
it's the state active so all we can
change that is just by going there right
there and see active in color and now
I'm going to see colors that primary and
when it's inactive
I want to add a color that's a nunnery
nothing on the ribbon library now if I
say now my icon going to be with the
blue of Twitter and now you see it's
kind of gray here it's not the white
stuff so here what if we can do it
things tile where I can set background
color and now I'm going to see color
that white also I want to have an eye of
50 because I think by default 55 not
sure about that I'm going to set padding
vertical so padding from the top in the
bottom I'm going to take five now it's
going to start to have some look yeah so
now it's white and this is what we want
okay so now now it's pretty easy because
we have only one screen but we want the
fourth screen to be there so what we can
do is here I'm going to create another
screen called explore screen because we
can have a explore stuff and here what
I'm going to do I'm going to import my
VI I'm going to just go really quick
because here I don't want to touch this
one I just want to have the four icon at
the bottom so I just need to have the
page I'm going to save this that for now
so we if I go back it's really simple I
don't do nothing I just say finally I
just create a component we're going to
just have a text in it with explore
inside that and I need to add the expo
inside the T because I need to be to add
the text and now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to jump I'm going to shift
command D I'm going to take command D
come in the air and I'm going to paste
the explore screen you can add type it
sorry I didn't say copy and pasting this
one and now what I want is I want to add
this same thing so I'm going to do shift
command D I'm going to see this one
Explorer I'm going to put the explosive
in now if I do this what happened it's
now I'm going to have to time the same
with all but this one now it's Explorer
now you see this blue is the decor style
I just told you so now what I can do for
now just because I
I don't want to forget this one it's
changing this background color from here
from the home screen just remove the
background color now you see now we have
the blue below perfect but now this is
the same icon I mean we need to change
that so now what we're going to do is
we're going to just change the name of
the icon so I'm gonna see search I want
to have the like that kind of a little
loop and I'm going to change the name to
be explored so now if I do this now we
get this nice icon and you see inactive
icon size become with the color like
grid perfect so now this part is done
era the font size where I do two times
the same value so I'm gonna say tab bar
tab icon size and I'm going to see 20 so
now I can just pass this variable here
chicken and be the blooms like that and
I just I need to add the other one
because if I look at the year what I
show you now we need to add the bell for
the notification page and I need to add
the profile like that kind of user icon
so what we can do again it's now go to
the Explorer screen that's going to be
almost like the only copy and pasting we
just do shift command a or I'll just
take everything come and see for take it
to another screen called profile
notification screen like that yeah take
this thing here take explorer screen a
command B or control D I think
notification screen change this to be
notification this one is watching
copy and paste the name so come in C go
back to navigation shift command D
command D take the boat like that so
just to having the the good import go
here take this thing shakin and D for
just copying pasting again this stuff
changes
to be notification so notification code
unification screen change other air to
be notification so the title what if it
creation and now the name of the icons
going to be Bell so now if I save now as
you can see we have the belts we are
pretty close to what we need we just
need another one last one tap in place
again exposed screen fill another screen
called profile screen the GS pacer
command D for take it boat profile
screen here we're going to profile
repeat your command C to copy the name
profile screen just to go quicker shift
command D to copy paste at to the bottom
come and these take about thing here
shift command D after that selecting
this stuff we are close call that to be
profile profile and now the name of this
icons going to be user and now we are
good we have the fourth page like that
all working like we want
when I say swapping it in avoid because
as you can see now I cannot swipe but
when that was true by default I don't
like this thing it's like it you like
you can swipe from here but I just like
this one and the type of position you
need to say button because and weird
some application example like Facebook
of stuff like that they have the tab bar
at the top so if you always want the tab
at the bottom you can just see right
there so you see the card style others
chord style colors here this is like him
that is when we like finally when we
change but we can have see that for now
because we don't have a card come inning
because we just work with that tab right
now so
that pretty much what we have for now so
the next one now what we're going to do
is we're going to remove an illiterate
application about the Apollo stuff in
the server just to make the first query
with reactivating the front-end so
that's going to be pretty exciting about
that so I hope you enjoy please like
subscribe if you didn't and hope you
enjoy and without later I have a good
day
