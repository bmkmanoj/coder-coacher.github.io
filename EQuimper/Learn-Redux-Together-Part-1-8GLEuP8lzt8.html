start a new tutorial don't worry the
middle app is not done we're going to do
other stuff it just I get a lot of
question about videos and I just want to
set a bit and and show you like all for
myself I understand it and maybe that's
going to help you to maybe get better or
too low in Vidocq so this store going to
be taught you learn redox together so
that's going to be in the seventh part
so as you can see that don't going to be
like my made-up app that's going to be
much like in a small amount of time so I
want to done everything like that like
called in the next day so so for the
fourth one for this today we're going to
set up redox and we can adjust after
that drum already on the part 2 and part
3 we're going to do a lot more of stuff
so for Thursday what we need to do first
is if you don't have a creative react
app so we're going to use square bracket
so first thing I asked you to do is to
do if you use NPM NPM I - G creative
react app so we're going to install it
crazy I get a new global like the global
bin if you use yarn yarn global add
quick app after that what you need to do
is you for any that you do create react
app space and now you put the name of
with you whatever you want to get the
name after that when it's done you do CD
inside your project you do NPM start our
yarn store perfect so for Redux forget
setup so this is what you're supposed to
get after you get a yarn store start you
get a folder like that where you have
your Adygea you have your index a gif
and everything but we're going to change
some of stuff here don't this is not a
course about design so don't judge me
with this design so so what we going to
do is that we're going to install some
library for now we're going to
we do so npm install Vidocq and react
redux why do I need react Redux readout
at a library is good for any kind of
frame a JavaScript library or framework
so can you be used with JavaScript it
can be used with ember angular view and
whatever you want so react with us is
the library for frog Vidocq so after
that when it's done inside the source
folder we're going to create a new file
called store that GS so here we're going
to import treating from you ducts we're
going to import create star apply
middleware and compose so we need to
create a store so that normal we import
a crystal apply middle wire it some
inner work we want to apply to the store
so it's like we want to end and then
compose it for for major finance sanity
then enter so I'm going to show you what
what we need then I need to do but the
thing I forget it just because why we
need two products we does is build for
making really scalable application it
don't think about like here we're going
to use with us for it to do list yeah
but don't use it for mega to do this I
mean you can like for me I'm going to
use it to develop you look so much but
it uses for when you want to think about
scaling and you want to push your
application like to do to the limit so
it's easy to add feature it's so much
easy so we got finally going to take all
your state of you you're going to put
your state as global inside your
application so that's going to be much
more easy to get your props on some
components for example you have like
maybe a thousand component in your app
and you want and this is really painful
if you use it which reacts first thing
good job if you make 1000 component with
react with no video source in managing
but if you did that I'm sure you already
understand this is true that was painful
so cuz you need to pass down your props
to some level but when it's like
an underlayer or just to layer down
that's really bad and really hard so
that's why Redux came here it's like you
want to use your stayed in this
component this company is really far
away from something else you can just
connect this component and use the stake
so for the one who came from back-end
stuff maybe what that can help you and
this is what I told - with some of my
student is think about the action it's
like your controller it out thing about
you your reducer it's going to be like
your schema model so it's like how you
want to manage finally you yo your model
anything about your store as like a
database so something like MongoDB
something like that so I hope this
little into make sense so so we can s
continue so first thing we need to
create a store so here what I'm going to
do is any first thing to import my route
reduce our from and now I'm going to
create a folder called we do sir we're
going to jump right there right now so
I'm going to create a folder called we
do sir
inside this folder I'm going to create
an index that GS so this way I don't
need to add slash in the name because by
default others could do it here I'm
going to import from redock I'm going to
import combined with user because the
comedy reducer mean we're going to take
a lot of your reduce our enemy and we're
going to create a big one so finally it
just I could just map over all your
reduce or increase just inside one big
object so here I'm going to export
default combine we do sir oops
for default combine we do so on and I'm
going to add two dudes going to be from
now just a function we will return Anna
and I'm very sorry video I we do start a
function return a data okay here what
I'm going to do is I'm going to export
default create store
natin inject take first documents that
we reduce our second argument is the
initial state we're going to put on the
fight and third argument going to be
composed so we're going to put the
answer now I'm going to copy paste one
line of code ad right here so it's a
boots now it's free it's a it's a
library it's a tool build on election
where you can pay snippet of code and
can be reused so so I'm going to just
copy paste this one so finally this to
err is for open the windows they have
tool extension of p-dogs for install
this one you just need to search google
extension VDOT and that's going to be
the first one and one where you can
already set up its reactive tool we ask
them to and you install the this first
one but I've already this one if you see
we act at all gonna work like that and
we are going to be this thing but now
it's not working
but because watching cuz now I have no
start first thing and you need this sign
of code here for make it available so
now as my react so if I open my
inspector and I take my react here I'm
gonna have my component tree but area as
you can tell only my app so I'm going to
make it at the bottom we don't live here
yet so I have my app with no props at
all so now what I can do it some time I
index a GS right here I'm going to
change stuff I'm going to import
provider coming from react Redux so yes
this line this thingy we import is where
we connect react which we don't I'm
going to wrap provider and I'm going to
pass your wired inside the app so now my
address provider if I say no I'm gonna
be super never cause provider
need to other stores so this is the so
we Chris I'm going to import store
coming from my store right here and now
I can plug my provider with the store if
I do this and everything is supposed to
work after that now I'm going to get my
reactive tool here working right at the
top and now as
my state and I'd like to do here in time
I react now have the provided my hat
that's it but now we want some other
middleware we're going to set up all we
need that we're going to use it in the
next video so again so you as a PI
middleware so it what I want is to do a
consider where where I'm going to have
an aviary and here inside my compose I'm
going to apply me the one I'm going to
do the middle work why you need to do
that middleware here it because I play
video already returned and every so
finally here if you do that the dot you
don't have an area inside an aviary so
it is real so if I do this now nothing
going to add them because I need to
install some you don't work so first one
we're going to install just for this to
do without epi going to be don't add
there's D V Doc's Lumiere
so this is a way to get all your action
in your console so it's almost like you
do a console that load on the erection
so here finally I'm going to import
create lugar from redox Luger and I can
put it right inside a bit of work little
girl and this is a function so now I'm
gonna have it in the middle work but we
have no way to see it because it's we
have the thing to it so we cannot play
with this in the next teaser so as you
can see the readme I'm going to put
everything on get out don't worry there
with me we set up Redux after that this
part going to be all about in the local
place so we tell like nothing to say but
after that we're going to cut ndj is an
EPS by using JSON server so this is a
library for make it really easy JSON API
and so all this for gonna me with a Ajax
request so that's going to be up dis for
the first integer so I hope you enjoy
and when we see in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
