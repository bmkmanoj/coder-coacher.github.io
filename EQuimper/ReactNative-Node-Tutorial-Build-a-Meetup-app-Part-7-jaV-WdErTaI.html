that show y'all so I've set up the plan
of what we're gonna do tonight so the
plan today it's to update some
dependency because an exponent there a
name for expo so we're gonna just make
it right now because I want you to able
to do other stuff with your app so I
just want you to oh you can update it
and don't get problem in the future
after that we're gonna update a react
navigation too and I'm gonna show you
how to use the X global command line so
this is alternative to the XDA coming
from exponent so I mean for me just much
more easy maybe to go with the command
line and after that we gotta move the
phone I said just to make it much more
easy to see cuz right now we have a mess
in the main app after that we got an
installed react elements so react native
element so it just I just play around
with native base and I just get some
problem and I don't have really the time
right now to just look at what I can do
so I just use recommend something I know
easier so with that we're gonna change
icon in the navbar gonna be much more
easier we gonna do the create meetup
screen so we're gonna use a package
called native mode model date/time
picker so that's what we're gonna use
for free today and we're gonna add
moment yes for the time zone and we're
gonna time format I mean when I created
a meet-up
and we're gonna see the result after
that in the backend so we're gonna use
redox in the future but I just want you
to know I'm showing in you react way for
the beginner who don't know redox so I
do this now with react and in the nesib
design we're gonna just reef act and
take this this state and just put it
inside videos and after that one of my
plan it's - it's to show you what we're
gonna get in the in the back end after
we've done the creation and just finish
with that so at least if you never
really work with react native I want you
to be able to at least pose to you API
so time to start so I put the link here
so I'm gonna put it in the ring me so
here they told it he told why they
changed the name for Expo so we're gonna
just make what they asked you to do so
the the first thing we need to do is to
go inside the package JSON so I'm going
to open the package JSON and then we're
going to change what Cal with exponent
so will you just remove the end MT from
exponent ear and ear after that this is
the only two dependency we need after
that they told us the thing we need to
do is to update the battler you see so
we go to the battle or you see here
we're gonna change that to be babble
preset expo and after that we're gonna
need just change everything we'll call
exponent so I go to worry its ear I can
click on find our do shift command F and
now I'm going to type exponent so here
I'm gonna look so in my getting now I'm
gonna remove that to be Expo after that
don't touch on the X JSON go inside cash
fund we're gonna change that to be Expo
we're gonna go in the main we're gonna
change that to be Expo we're gonna do
that same here so just go at the bottom
where we initially is the app after that
we're gonna go inside the home screen so
like I say just follow what we do
whatever I have here material icon here
and finally the profile screen perfect
after that yeah you know we did and now
with the only thing we're gonna need to
do it's to delete the the new module and
delete the yarn that lock so they take
some moment so I get my yes link program
here cuz now you just did you try to
fine a lesson but I don't have anymore
so now I'm gonna type in your for me
install
all the dependency finally we just
delete just to be sure we get everything
is running perfectly don't worry that's
gonna come back and after that we're
gonna install the X command line so it
just you remember I was open the XDA and
everything but I'm gonna just show you
an alternative so for you if you like
more to have some UI stuff just open it
in the XDA for me I'm gonna show you how
to use the command line I think for me
just much more easy with the video
because it's less CPU usage so what you
need to do it's yarn global add exp so
that gonna add the exponents you lie and
foreign NPM it's npm install global
perfect and when it's done now when you
want to start the package are so we do
npx start so now you're gonna make sure
everything is set up so you do what we
do finally and the other one so when
it's done starting reactive package are
so you do almost the same will you do
when you run a react native start or npm
store on the other react native and now
just open another tab and not open with
apps iOS so that going to open us io s
simulator if everything is okay
so that should be good so after that you
can close this and just when I see the
simulator running I just want to be sure
everything is perfect after that we're
gonna update it react navigation so we
already done all these four tiers and
this one too so I'm gonna install react
navigation okay so it looks like that's
gonna work and now I'm gonna start my
back-end to forget my my meetup so just
dismiss area I'm gonna refresh because I
didn't open my server first perfect so
now this is why we got the last time so
for other thing I want to update react
navigation right now we work on version
1.6 I want to go to version 1.7 so in my
Visual Studio code to me it's under
latest version just for be sure so yarn
add react navigation by doing this we're
gonna get the last version
I just cuz this is bad every run so I
want to always get the latest version
the latest like issue resolved and
everything another thing I found to its
we have some lag with like here so
you're gonna see when it's gonna be done
its we area have you as you can see we
have the plus whoo it's really slow to
remove so what I found its if we go to
the own navigator so I'm gonna type Oh
navigator so while we do all the
navigation stuff here you have animation
enable I'm gonna make it false so now if
I make it false
I got a problem what I think I'm gonna
restart it one sec so here by putting
animation fouls we're gonna just don't
get like this small animation from the
transition but at least we don't gonna
get the this UI stuff with the bottom so
now just just refresh your screen
I'm gonna compile everything perfect so
now if I do you see now I have no
animation but these I can't see my plus
plus here this is what I didn't show you
they put the scan QR here so if you're
using an exponent in your cell phone you
can just scan this QR with the exponent
application and that gonna open you a
new mobile perfect so we removed the
animation so that was one of the thing
here after that I want to move to the
front asset so I mean the the the plan
was just to to just make it more cleaner
and so what we're gonna do
it's we're gonna jump on the main GS
here and you see here have everything
have everything you're inside my mains
so what I want to do it's to change it
and put it right inside the part of the
cache phone right there so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna take all my font
right there so I'm gonna copy paste this
one I'm gonna make right there and now
I'm gonna just export finally this one
with on my phone but now as you can see
I need to change on my require right
there so just for be sure so after that
what are we gonna do is we can remove
this one
oops like this and now we just need to
import fun asset so now if everything is
working we're gonna is suppose to don't
get any bug right there and perfect and
out as you can see all my my fun stay
the same so that means we we got to the
we got to what we have before but I
think that just make their life at the
code cleaner we don't get all this
problem with like many link many line of
code here for anything so after that so
we finished the mall I said after that I
want to add a react alignment so I can
close this one don't worry out the link
gonna be in the description so and in
there in me and the same time so if you
remember the last shot we pass it native
base but again I get some weird stuff so
I just find a react native element so
this is the one I'm using always so
that's why I was just more much more
easy for us to for me to just show you
to use this one so really easy to
install and for exponent that's again
much more easy we're gonna just install
the native element in the terminal so
here just take another criminal who is
not open and now do yarn native element
perfect so now it's installed so now I
like this show it's really easy to get
start you don't need to do almost
nothing it's really simple to use and I
think that it's much more easy to use
then the then the that if base one so
that was another plus for me so after
that what I'm gonna do is we're gonna
finally jump on the create meetup but
first thing I want to change the fun of
the top New Yorkers right now we use
native base but I want to remove it so
that's gonna be really easy it's if you
see your native base use the icon MD sir
call from exponent from material design
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna import
from Expo vector icon I'm gonna export
matter heal icon at the top ear in your
Aetna tail I'm going to export touchable
up a CD so not gonna let me have a click
even on my view finally so that's gonna
be we're gonna toggle the opacity with
the so what are we gonna do its ear
inside the right I'm gonna just make
this for now I'm gonna make my touchable
opacity and here I'm gonna make material
icon here we just put the name I'm gonna
put add circle so don't need any more to
put the MD because it's already material
icon after that I'm going to put a size
of 3 D and I'm gonna put a color of
white perfect so now I'm gonna just copy
paste this unpress even inside my touch
opacity now I'm gonna remove it so now
Phillip I miss one F
so now if you see we got this this icon
back but now I want to just get some
some more marching so now what I'm gonna
do it see I'm gonna call an icon ad and
I'm gonna put a margin of left margin
left yeah and I'm gonna put three
percent so now you're inside my
touchable opacity I'm gonna put a style
and I'm gonna put style that icon add
did I make it in the right one if I go
to my own screen style oh that was right
sorry
and now we got we got to the that point
we wore before but now we don't gonna
use anymore the the the native base one
it's not I don't accept that package I
just say I get weird stuff and maybe
it's me I don't really know how to use
it but I think from ID for this app
that's gonna just make sense to jump on
another one and make sure I can show you
some knowledge about what I I know
so now after that we're gonna jump back
to the create meetup screen so now if I
so I'm gonna close some windows perfect
I'm gonna go to my creat meetup screen
so this is what we have before so just
this place every so first thing we're
gonna change this icon you it's from the
the the native base so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna again on import touchable
up i CD I thought I'm gonna import
material icon again from Expo picked off
so matter your icon and now here I'm
gonna just do the same so I'm going to
put touchable up a CD so that I'm gonna
re put my material icon there
I'm gonna put a name of now this one
it's close size of 3d sorry size of 30
after that I'm gonna put back a color of
white perfect so now I'm gonna take this
unpress even I'm gonna make it right
there well now can delete this one and
just return my left eye cut so now if
everything is right we are supposed to
get the same icon but now we have no
margin so we're gonna do the same of
what we did in the last one so first
thing we can remove this one so we don't
use anymore so as you can see my ashlynn
told me I don't use the this package so
you can remove it so now we're gonna
need to create a style folder air then
we're gonna create a creamy top screen
GS after that I'm gonna jump on my my es
style sheet so it's my snippet right
there what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
make icon close so the name of the icon
finally for me and that's going to be a
margin left now of 2% so the same
percentage of the other one so now here
what I just need to do is I'm going to
import style from style tweet meetup
screen and now I'm gonna take this one
and I'm gonna put it right there
style of style that icon close so now
we're gonna get the ex a bit more from
the left perfect after that so now we're
going to start to work on the the the
Queen meetup screen so what are we going
to add so we're going to add here at the
top we're going to add three component
coming from the native element so we're
going to import form label I'm going to
import from import and form and button
sorry but so after that right there what
we going to do it's inside my view I'm
going to
another view we're gonna put Stein after
I'm gonna create another view and inside
this one I'm gonna create another view
to this one we're going to add a storm
level I'm gonna put title just at that
ear what I want it's yeah I'm gonna put
from a totally after that I'm gonna put
my form input like this I'm gonna open
like that and I'm gonna let like this
for now we're gonna talk about it in a
few after this so now I just want you to
see how beautiful all this input just
look at this by default they give us
like this and I really like it I mean it
just i just looked awesome so now what I
want you to do it just to just copy
paste this one so I'm gonna do shift
command D I'm gonna go recopy like this
view but now this one gonna be
description description like that and
this one because I want to add multiple
line I'm gonna just toggle meet in line
with tea mill tea line yeah like that so
now just to be sure
it's firends between its title I can do
this
if I click enter how you do nothing but
description now if I type can I do enter
I can have multiple like perfect so now
we have the tree input so that I want
you to create another view you're gonna
see why in one moment I'm gonna put my
button here you're gonna see how
beautiful this button or so this button
right there what I'm gonna say it's I'm
gonna put titles so this is all you type
what you want to put there I'm gonna say
I'm going to see something like pick a
meetup date perfect and I'm gonna copy
paste again this one and and this one
now I'm gonna have a title of create
meetup now if I show you what we got by
default

create a meet-up don't worry we're gonna
make some design so another thing it's
the lets you to have race that's gonna
work on anywhere so I'm gonna put it
just like the flashy stuff every
integrated app so like the some
animation in the bottom so now we have
the cream meter and we have the date so
now time to put some design so what I'm
gonna do it here I'm gonna create route
style so that's going to be for the the
main element so this one the only thing
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put flex one
and I'm going to put a line item of
center why do Center cuz now what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to cause something
container because I don't want
everything to add all the width so what
I want its to get this one as a flex of
one but I with a width of 90% so now if
I go here I'm gonna put this one with a
style of style that route and now this
one gonna have a style of style that
container so now if i refresh this one
now you see I have more width like I
don't touch the boat screen but at the
end of the screen after that what I'm
gonna do it's I want to have some like
margin between each item so that's why I
put my view so now here what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna create an item key right
there and I'm going to put margin
vertical so vertical mean we're gonna
have the same measure from the top and
the bottom so yeah I'm gonna put 200

meet up right there after that I would
like to add this screen meet up to have
another like another color
that's right now it's pretty weird to
have two green to agree button so I'm
gonna put background color I'm gonna
take my black blue colors so now if I'm
refreshing I'm gonna get a much more
beautiful button color perfect after
that year as you can see this is not the
font I want to have their font so I
wonder have the fun montserrat the one
we use in everything - my button here so
what I'm gonna do it's button here you
can add a fun family and this is easy
like that you just put your phone so I'm
gonna use this one - the other one - and
after that I want to use it to my foam
level like that and I'm gonna use it to
ear so now if i refresh now as you can
see we have another front so I have my
monster rat perfect after that here you
see it's a great I want this little
selection here to be the same red ear so
it's pretty easy to do it's so I'm gonna
do this in the same time so I'm gonna
take you my from input and I'm gonna
make it I cannot do this but we gonna
make it in one time so selection
selection color and I'm gonna put my
color red color and I'm gonna do the
same right there so so now this is all
from your input we're gonna react so now
we have the red here and I can select
and that's going to be real so pretty
pretty easy there perfect so now what I
want its to
when I click area I want to pick up my
date and I want to get pick a meetup
date when the date it's today like now
right now like this time I want the user
to just pick a date and be able to set
it in the future I don't want him to so
you're gonna see on I'm gonna make it
this is maybe like the best way to make
it but it's a pretty easy one so I find
this library react native model the time
picker I'm going to put a link in the
description so the only thing we need to
do it's npm install this one we do yarn
add react native model date/time picker
so it just i think beautiful the 10
picker so the so what they ask you to do
is to add this line of code here
so here oh I can remove my text so we
import the time picker after that the
only thing we need to do now is to take
the time picker go at the bottom and put
it here it's a model so that don't care
about where is so here I'm gonna put
three three props is visible and I'm
gonna say this at this that stay that is
date time picker visible so I'm gonna
create this one in my state so I'm gonna
create a state right there stay there
and I'm gonna put this to be false by
default so now that gonna be stiff also
my state is working I'm supposed to yeah
so now we have two props we need to
confirm so the first other one they ask
us it's on confirm so this is when we
click on confirmation of the day so
we're gonna call this section this that
and
date weekend and I'm gonna create
another one for on console there is that
end date time picker like this so this
one we're gonna create it so I'm gonna
create this one right there and now this
one what we're gonna do
which they pick its ear what are you
gonna make this one gonna take a date
and what we're going to do right now
just for right now we're gonna just this
that set state date because yes six key
value same we just keep one key that's
it I'm gonna create here my function
call with my end all the time picker and
this one take no argument but the thing
you do it's this at set stay and what
are you gonna make its you're gonna make
it is the time picker to be false so
this is the one we're gonna call after
finally we pick up the date so when we
can sell and when we pick up the day so
like this that's perfect so I said that
I want my button so now now I don't see
the day so on when I click here to get
my my date picker to show so the only
thing we need to do it's we're gonna
create a function so here in my pickup
date I'm gonna say unpress even and I'm
gonna call it add is that show date/time
picker he care I'm gonna quit this
function right here at the top and this
one the only thing is gonna make it's
gonna set state so almost the opposite
of the other one set state is the time
picker to be true like this
so now if I show you what that gonna do
if I click oh I get my date but now I
just get the date I want to get our two
cuz I mean it's you don't want to say we
have a meet up tomorrow but which time
so the only thing we need to do this now
we're it's awesome for that you go there
you type mode and we're gonna type date
time date date enter the date in the
time so here if I click now I'm gonna
get today tomorrow actually right with
the time and if I want am perfect now if
I take my date and I confirm nothing I
want like to see the date right there
just to confirm like they use all this
is what you want so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna add and know somebody library
called moment so this is the big library
for all the time managing finally in
JavaScript manipulation of the time so
when it's installed what I'm gonna do so
what I'm gonna do it's here I'm gonna
import moment import moment from moment
here in my state I'm gonna put a date
key right there and I'm gonna see moment
so like that it's like date that now
perfect
so by default when my component mouth
like I'm gonna get this date right there
so after that what I want to do
it's I want to make a function we're
gonna check the title of the button so
I'm gonna call a function here called
check title and this one and it's going
to be a function we're gonna call in the
beginning and I'm gonna say if this that
state that time it's a bigger than
moment now so it's bigger than right now
now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
return we're going to return moment
so we're gonna format from course I'm
gonna return this that stayed that date
so the day in the moment because we're
using to time date I'm gonna do this
structuring here so equal do that stay
so that me now I can just remove my dis
that stick in boat
so now moment I'm going to format it
format and I'm going to put mmm for time
D o in lowercase Y like this H mm in
second ear and I'm gonna put acres I
want to get my AM PM if the date it's
bigger so if like my date from from when
we started when we mount the component
it's bigger than the now right now we're
gonna show this stuff else so don't need
to put a article do we return I'm gonna
say pick meetup date so the one we have
already put here so now I'm gonna change
this title to be this that check title
and I'm gonna call it right there so now
if everything is working so now I get
picking it up day now if I go to
tomorrow I get my dates of March 17 2017
10:30 11:00 p.m. but now if I come back
to today right now I'm gonna get pick a
meetup date so if I google perfect and
so that what I want it I don't want the
user to be able to create a meetup if
the title the description and they pick
up a meet-up
it's not like fulfilled so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna create another
function with the button disabled so I'm
gonna call it check if button submit
disabled so if it's need to be disabled
so this one what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to destructuring
so I'm gonna take the title the
description share and the date coming
from this that stay and yeah so I just
forget to do something we're gonna make
title here and that's gonna be an entity
string by default and description like I
say in the beginning today we're gonna
do this in you react and then SCP Zod
we're gonna put this kind of value we're
gonna put it in redox so everyone can be
happy with what I'm gonna show so that's
going to be the stuff here but I'm
just like forget what I do there for now
because we're gonna just make this state
working before so don't anything that's
going to be really easy to do it's now
it's too I want to be able to change the
title and change the description really
really easy to do here we're a color an
action called change title so I will put
the name change with the name of the
input so ear change that or gonna take a
title as an argument why I do this I can
people put it text but for me because
I'm doing yes six I would want my key to
be the same so I can just do this and
I'm gonna make almost the same for
description change a description here
I'm gonna change that for B description
so now I'm gonna call this unchanged
title ear ear on on change text and I'm
gonna call this change title and now my
value mark form input gonna be dis that
state that title and I'm gonna do the
same here on on change text is that
change description and I'm gonna put
value to be equal to days the
description state that description
perfect so now if I save this I'm going
to refresh my screen now if everything
is working I'm supposed to get my tat on
it perfect perfect
nothing really change for you but trust
me here something really happened so now
just for showing you I'm gonna
console.log my state what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna open my terminal where I
