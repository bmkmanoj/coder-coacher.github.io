you
here
oh thank you are you
so first thing so here finally I'm just
doing some kind of TDD just that's gonna
be for this screen right there
so now I need to get the the amount of
what you're gonna get
I'm gonna make the person to take this
place but I'm gonna get you the amount
of the Laura for each of your friend I'm
gonna almost thing like I need to have
this stuff but first thing I need to do
its take the I need to take the all this
number together first I think so we
talked about six seven eight dot
twenty-three plus 24 plus two thousand
3.4 loss so this is the total I can fix
it no oh yeah my total it should be
three thousand three one seven one
that's 75 okay so this is a total here
so now I need to get how many percent
six hundred seventy eight bucks is
inside that so I think if I remember my
Matt you need to do I think it's
multiple like you multiple in your
number and you divide that I know that
make sense
it's you divide you number in your
multiple
no it's not now
yeah sorry I'm really dumb right now and
I'm dumb and I'm sorry some time shift
gray percent increase equal increase
they were by the original number okey so
that was so funny
so now it's twenty one percent twenty
one percent thirty eight so twenty one
percent twenty eight
so now that should be 34.50 7/3 171
that's 75 multiplied by an unreal equal
0.93 after that 2000 3/3 one say that
one multiplied by one hundred sixty
three sixty three that 16 and none and
now
14:36 so now if I do my math 21:38 plus
63 16 plus 14 36 plus 0.93 ish 100 yeah
so that mass that gonna look something
like that it's just my math is really
bad right now but I'm supposed to get
100 so that's gonna be inspect that to
equal this thing at least for now so
here this thing and I receive type the
equal I'm gonna receive a name who's
gonna be type of string and I'm gonna
also be Sivan that man who's going to be
a type of string and finally a type item
type data will be equal to an array of
item and now here I will just see data
and I'm supposed to return type return
data equal I can just and every I can do
the same for here
well I'm gonna have a name and person
and this is what I'm gonna return return
data
okay so now can return now I know what
I'm gonna do so I need to say let let
are equal only are equal and in theory I
think I can do the like that now this
one yeah it's kind of a reduced function
so first thing I need to get the person
I'm gonna create a function right the
function I mean I can do this right
there so I can just do data that reduce
and now here what I'm gonna reduce our I
think I can do do this with map and I'm
gonna also I can do this with for each
or you can just the are
we're gonna have an item and now a what
I'm gonna do it's I need to also have
each item so each item need to go over
finally that's gonna be reduced I'm
gonna see why because yeah I'm gonna
have the aviary and now we're gonna have
the previews and the Korean yeah I'm
gonna start with the MTR and what I'm
gonna do right there it's I'm gonna see
I'm gonna say Oh previews that push here
I'm gonna have an update one get on the
name who's going to be equal to cure
that name and after that I'm gonna have
the person where the person finally is
going to be equal to mine but first
thing I need to get the total so I think
I can get the total from you to the
total is going to be a string too
so for the test I'm gonna take the same
total I have before this kind of
okay first thing I need to say cons to
toll equal force float total to get that
other number after that what's gonna
happen it's my in my percent is going to
be cool too
but I'm equal to a mond that divided by
total multiple by 100 and now I can
return the R and now you're ready to eat
our previous thing like that now you see
what I got almost what I need is just
this thing you're gonna need to go
inside
to fix I need to get that take this do
to fix and pass to to fix gonna be Tamia
a string and now I get to DA 109 21:46
you know what I think it's that hard
like I mean this thing you work I mean
now that 1.9 so I mean you see I seen
any tween any tweet it's it's seven is
17 you see right there so if I say 21
that 39 plus 1 0 9 plus 63 that's 16
plus 14.26 equal it must make it 21 that
28 plus 1 that 0-9 + 63 that's 16 plus
14.26 yeah yeah
I mean if I say
and I'm gonna keep it like that for now
I'm gonna just change my value here
would be 1.09 why do I miss else
oops equally me up to equal okay
I'm in the total so no time to do some
refactoring so I can have a function get
person we're going to take the total and
also you're gonna take an amount and
this thing when I return a number and
what you're going to return I'm gonna do
the float here parsefloat total and I'm
so I'm gonna do I'm on and now I'm going
to do the same logic
yes MJ you may be asked okay yeah but
why you don't do the to fix it just
because if I want to keep this function
on something else I can just take it
back so here I just need to say like
that's gonna be a string in a string and
now you may be gonna ask yeah but now if
this come as a number so that's a good
one so I need to hear to manager I need
to say first thing I'm gonna make use of
the my inversion where library in volume
you know your what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna sing for you if total is not nil
if total yeah I'm gonna say total is
required and after I'm going to have
another inversion here who's gonna be my
am on what's and and I'm going to see
Emma value is require because now like
what I can maybe say oops
it's this thing can be a string or can
be like that after that I need to do to
its maybe that's gonna came as a number
so what I can do its if so I can manage
that by doing this okay if total
so if my total if typeof total equal
number total work equal total else if
else else that mean it's gonna be a
string for sure because here I can just
best string
yeah but else if I can just check it
type of total equal string I can just
take it and they seek total equal force
flow total like that so you can just see
that's going to be a number for sure so
now I can remove this I'm gonna need to
do the same logic for the a month like
that now I'm gonna need to say here am
on and now I can remove this one keep
forth but now the thing is I'm gonna
need to manage the effect then
possibility okay yeah
else I'm gonna say I'm own equals zero
and I'm gonna do the same for you and
you're gonna see what I mean it's so
here because that mean that can become a
jar of something but now the thing is
this thing here what I'm gonna Paris the
string that may be gonna mean this thing
it's maybe not a number because I can
pass like arrow well something like that
so this thing need to add a value so
what I think I can do is from here what
I can just do from here it's almost the
invariant if if it's not a number I
think I can do this if I remember so if
it's not a number by doing this you
gotta check it from the string
total total value must be something must
be kind of number then I can do this I
can do the same with my one and now I'm
gonna get an error
are you know what this thing parsefloat
if I'm calling if I'm cold
oops if I'm calling force float if I
second
hello equal chords flow oops pours flow
and I CLO hello an equal not a number
you see so parsefloat gonna return me
yeah so that's almost what I need to say
it's here
you
don't kid but you know if subtitle equal
I mean I do what I asked for
hey David oh thank you yeah Peter will
hear that
you see so only thing is I'm using
insulin right now and you see I get this
error so now I just want to know do this
error I mean I mean this I think I like
more to pass it from you and get my
error message from here okay so here if
is NaN total total knee - I'm gonna do
the same for the I'm on this is because
I don't want example if someone take my
cold too
to be able to pass something wrong
because I'm gonna crash my happen I
don't want
okay why are this this good person go
what that's something I use a lot is an
answer I need something to souls okay so
see it's the invert okay and now for
this thing I mean I can just say that no
and maybe add a fine fine solution or
ESL okay
and also this one I don't want to write
tests right now so to do row tests and
simple this
but the tuto is the thing I need to
check I don't gonna get a total I mean I
think I can just do this from here
yeah I think because of the place I'm
gonna have my to talk yeah
okay so dysfunction okay if so so why
dysfunction got a a peers gonna be not
there but for ear I'm putting the value
from here thank you
so
ear not ear well I
thank you this thing you're not going to
need to receive the error of what we
just did
okay
okay
so this one's going to be connect with
pee dogs and it's already I'm gonna need
a select are I'm gonna just create it
right there on now and this select are
okay export cons get P feed that up
equal create selector we're gonna take
my get crypto entity so this value right
there return me the entity and also
you're gonna get the get P person ah

okay and now this one finally I'm gonna
have that I'm gonna have my cryptos or
maybe my entities so I need to remember
that my identities it's a map and I need
to get that as a as an array so I need
to say oops
entities
so I need to do two thing I need to
module an airway
and after that gonna need to address
some of my total
so forgetting the two-tone
forgetting the total I should go here
and say coin that we do sighting
I have already done this thing right now
just something I need to
although this is for the owning
that's for the total I'm on this is what
I've done for the total among all that
but I don't need to do I need to do this
again
so I mean I can really use this selector
from here but this one you're gonna get
the prep skip crypto
no but it's not the same total mama I
mean it's this value right there
yeah
but I don't need to get the total yeah
man I'm gonna need to get the crypto Oh
I need two of the same stuff from Erie
so here I get a total but in same time
that don't make sense because
yeah that makes sense that gonna remove
some part of the because example example
of an asset of five thousand in total so
if I have twenty five thousand divided
by five thousand plus it's 50% and the
other is twenty five thousand but if
this one now become 27,000 yeah but I
don't equal the same the percentage of
the part of you except gonna always stay
the same
yeah sorry I'm really bad in math so
yeah that's true because I mean if
something lose you lose in the you lose
in the in the total if I have 50 percent
example my we lose two hundred so I was
like that I lose two hundred did they
say
so if I use two hundred BDC now I had a
wallet of 4,800 so my BTC it's now 2
divided by that's the thing though I'm
really know if you come you take less
place
oh it is the iPhone simulator from IO
Apple it's the edge of their iOS 11 one
when you install a new version of iOS
now it's this simulator
oh yeah what surprise - when I install
it
I kind of like it and the thing is you
can update the size now like that and
you can also click on each button I like
it and it's good 14 photo for the
showing you up and maybe like I think
maybe you can put that in another color
maybe
yeah me too
so you oh yeah I see I'm gonna play with
you I mean on mobile right now it's 16
alpha 12 must be change for the next
version so you see my point if you have
example 4000 and you have Betty say you
have two thousand in bitty 3 and you
have a theorem in 2002 Betty see now
equal thousand aydindril
so your total equal this so if I see
divided by this thing went opposed by
100 I'm gonna get like 45% oh wow hey
then I didn't know I really I didn't use
a lot of server-side rendering but this
is something I need check now do you see
my my my porn even about about are
getting the percentage I mean I just
because I'm better in math or because
I'm high right now just getting the
percent for the P chart must go with the
percent of the place the total amount of
this coin go for your total amount of
everything so but I cannot say like
Bitcoin it's always 50% of my wallet
because if Bitcoin lose a lot of money
you don't become any more than 50% of
the wall
because if that means that I need to
create a selector we do all this logic
at least it's a selector so I'm okay
with that but calling my function here
because the tickets and sorry about that
I think it's ear distinct fetch the back
at my server for getting the value for
getting there so I'm gonna need to redo
this thing for getting here I'm also I'm
gonna need already forgetting this
photograph
yes and I think it's what I like about
relates if this thing we're under this
thing and every render this thing to so
I had no choice so time to do some
mother really call I think so I'm gonna
just remove that for now and what I'm
gonna do so I have my wallet asset
you're almost copy pace what this thing
have and and I'm gonna need to start
reeling
getting off this thing this thing this
warrior so I'm gonna need many
- yeah
so I should say I data recalled this
thing I can see resting total
total among
oops
yeah I use the polo I did a tutorial
about Apollo yes and III think I like
more Apollo than really relates really
complicated
okay so what I think now
total I'm gonna have the Teramo so no
here I'm gonna see to say PI data equal
get PI percent we're gonna narrate but I
need also a total I'm on to ya
if we're on you down
maybe to the symbol add a string and I'm
gonna need that too because I said well
gotta become the name writing so I'm
gonna keep the name and now
you
well this thing after that
you have access to each transaction and
what I need to do is doing
and
because here right now the way I will
it's like that
9
so I never know and I don't know what is
that so the error is this thing
Krypto
what at just 26 I know but which I
didn't have this problem before
now that must be because inside my asset
and my other ear he get the crypto by
doing
you
now I think
okay yeah but now I need to change my
that was the other thing props viewer
crypto edge
what
okay I see why
hey I have Bitcoin i oughtta neo a Terra
and some list to whiting Oh crypto that
is oh and thank you
thank you totally what happened
thank you even you who save me maybe the
night
okay I'm gonna just remove the app purge
so that's why I'm not persisting total
gang string total game wallet
oh I just have get an ID so corny er I
can make use of coin to reduce a value
where arrogance I think I can say just
for now
Oh BG or maybe just pie a pie item
reduce here I'm gonna get the previews
and the cure one like that but I'm gonna
start with an object this is what I'm
gonna do it's an object so now just to
make sure
who forget to empty object and the fine
yeah I think yeah but now you're what
I'm what I'm gonna do
its previous preview now equal
I think I can do something like that
preview equal ear I was named I'm gonna
stay with the previous name all kerning
and pretty in a month and now be equal
to three news
yeah because the thing is a transaction
so transaction like we see when I have
access to amount of coin so sure the
amount of coin you're not require
multiple by 92 of the price oh yeah
and the part is this thing right there
just forgetting that I'm gonna juice
just for now I don't like it but you I
don't have a choice
that would be much more easier when I'm
gonna use real my thing and I just think
that gonna be that time to use real now
and have a database man now I do it's
too much tragic funny thing
you
Oh
okay
yeah
oh I can undo this
right guy enough
oh you know
and now what I will do its testing I get
5% this thing
okay now we go good because it's it's
pretty easy we have to i-10 but if I say
I'm gonna add another Bitcoin and I said
I'm gonna add one Bitcoin so it was a
21% 78 28% 71 okay so this value here
you just told me then now with this
value what I can do
right now now what you told me it's now
if I get to my well at PI tab this thing
here I can say PI data equal like that
and inside my portfolio pi
inside my portfolio pie I can see that
are equal
this
and now my pie chart can remove that and
receive this every I'm gonna make an
objector but just for now name string
percent swing
so no more state
yeah I mean I can just take this thing
and put it
damn that person ETM about that need to
be number here
just for now
this thing I need to change this thing
think I'm good I go there oh
something happen
Oh
I'm not supposed to be to me to sort the
data I mean this sorting should be done
on my selector thing I can do this
yeah but now I think it's gonna need to
be oops oh not here not here not here
more in my pie this thing here
you up
here there were
when I think for now when I can just see
one sex we elope hello
here's a loofah
say about and you get them back
you see the bad thing happen now so you
see here 20% I'm gonna add another one
it's gonna be easier sorry we paralyze
I'm gonna buy 500 of them 5,000 like it
Sam one sec just before 47 okay in this
thing looks good this thing have
improved but not this one year now if i
refresh you see now is there so that's a
bug
this way you have change this value have
change but not this value 49,000 i boy
28 around 55 this is I've changed that
change but not my this thing this thing
didn't change at all
okay so we're gonna check something
wanted
why until I get control of this thing
No
Oh
get well a total cow pee data is there
with this writer okay so when I go there
and there P data get recalculate right
there get recalculate and it's not
suppose
that's the thing about the selector it's
not supposed to get recalculate and now
I guess we calculate there and there
again
yeah yeah portfolio PI but that's not
the best name I know this is something I
need to be change okay so that just
confirming and I'm gonna need to have my
own
I'm gonna have my own
so get wala turtle cow I'm on he's been
cow after this one no and now I'm gonna
get caught ear get P that get P dat echo
and also get what a turtle a mom I've
been call again but now if I add example
200 no so 55,000 I love that like that
so now I'm supposed to jump to 60 61 I
know if I do but get P get towel okay
you see you see the change right there
the chain has been changed but this
company didn't get the new value but
from what I think is because I pass it
as a state that's the problem because
the state don't get change
that's why because the state get colored
the the first one here so now what I
will do it's not getting that from here
and getting my
that are from here
okay like this and I can remove that I
was liking this
data
okay well first thing do you still work
still work okay but this value here get
call this value but you will add though
okay I think I get it
you
okay so now this one have this four item
I want I'm gonna add something I never I
didn't add and I'm gonna add like -
maybe like 50 and - is right there yeah
I don't think that was this thing I
think the problem was like I mean the
per component it just about the shoe
component of the but the thing it was
about the state like the state gets
filled when they compare and I have
mauled and didn't change there and I
don't use like set State or something
like that so this is what I think and
now bypassing that as a props now he
looks like even though because the props
force the component to be render but now
at least I have seen I have a lot of
error right now I have lot of error
because I mean this type of calling
stuff is really bad here I mean I mean
if you look at what I've done get pie
cow and get pie call it's perfect that's
normal and my pipe that I get called but
this thing I mean it's just too much
queasy
it's not supposed to all compute this
thing here so this is really something I
need to check but that looks like work
yeah
because just for retesting we're gonna
add some I don't know like iota I'm
gonna have a 5000 I ate I like that I'm
gonna save and I'm gonna get my order
right there and this thing I've changed
this thing has change this thing I've
changed too
but as you can see the pie is perfect
the selector is perfect but this isn't
the thing I think this is the thing I
think we select all its if you use your
selector in more than one component the
selector don't gonna catch good so
that's why on some case I'm using the
way we select
example if we check for this one are
using their or a quick cash selector
right there and you put the props coin
ID right there so that's perfect
this is like finally it just cash by
setting a map so key value with the key
become the ID of the coin right there so
the quarter always gonna stay like like
I'll call a like a I'm gonna stay unique
well now the thing it's my wallet here
get cow oops get caught in someplace and
so I should check for this thing so get
call ear here I'm not supposed to have
it here okay I can remove here
I said connected is done this thing is
done I can close this thing after that
ear you get call for this thing here
okay get call for you
and also this thing I'm not supposed to
why at what one set once a wallet I said
so this this screen ears that's supposed
to be render anymore I mean yeah so this
screen it's done
so now it's gonna be really important to
to check this log like why I get this
color here this is I I don't understand
this one I'm not supposed because this
is a lady luding li 0 do maybe not
he suddenly zeroed in so that's not
money gets called ear but now when I
click here you get call again when I get
here you get color again because you
don't understand select area don't
understand what I'm doing right there so
yeah this is something I'm gonna need to
go because I have a to student I'm maybe
gonna come back around the 8 p.m. or if
not I'm gonna do some video too so so I
hope you enjoy I'm gonna push the code
again on the get up I've learned a lot
so so hope you're enjoying then we're
gonna maybe talk later at a good night
of your own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
