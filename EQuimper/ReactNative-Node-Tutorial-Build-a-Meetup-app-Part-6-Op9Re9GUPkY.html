the last one we're gonna start to play a
bit with native bass so for the one who
come from the web native babes it's for
me I think it's like bootstrap for
reality we had a lot of good company so
the plan today is to edit after that
we're gonna jump on the on the create
meetup page so we're gonna just play
with the style so today it's much more
about this style and then in the next
episode we're gonna start to at least be
able to create a new meet up a new meter
and after that in the next one we're
gonna start to make a touched occasion
with Facebook and maybe Google and local
one and I'm gonna show you with firebase
and everything so today
native base really easy to add you do
you click area getting start anything we
need to do it's installed native place
so yarn add native lace again here it's
my back-end you're just running so so we
add native Bay if they have like a
perfect perfect now is working so now
just for this one we're gonna close the
debugger I just want to get faster so
now it what I want to do it's a 1 first
thing to add an icon here why I'm gonna
why I'm gonna click and be able to jump
on my create meetup page so I think it
just it's something we always seen and
I'm sure that can be good for us too so
here what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna jump
on my own screen a job on my own screen
right there so here here all that gonna
work
it's the
in front my navigation option I have my
headers right there and I have access to
make like using like the right or the
left icon and everything but all you
need to make it it's not this way you
need to make it as a function so every
I'm gonna say so I'm gonna just keep
this one here for now and now that's
gonna be a function like this so now
here what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
create this as end up J Const are equal
back on color like this now I can remove
this thing right there
so now just to we're gonna make the
right I can so cause right equal here oh
I'm gonna do this it's so I'm get I get
weird stuff with the bottom of native
base so that's why I need a view right
there first and I'm gonna put button but
now I don't have the bottom I need to
import it so I'm gonna import button
coming from native base after that here
what I'm gonna do it's I want this
button to be transparent and I want to
just want that like right now after that
II I'm gonna install an import icon
coming from react native base and native
place yeah in here I'm gonna put icon
I'm gonna close it and I'm gonna give it
a name so iPhone coming from material
design add circle so don't worry if you
follow the document are gonna show you
how you can get and fine like here at my
button but here so if you click button
you can see each button we can have and
they have the live demo right there but
now my PC is really slow yeah
so we see the bottom and everything and
for the icon like they had a lot of icon
and you can search it by clicking on so
the icon coming from yang let see Victor
icon so you just click right there so
now I'm going to have a circle with a ad
inside that and I'm gonna use style you
know I'm gonna see fun side I'm gonna
make it 30
and I'm gonna use and I'm we're gonna
make color to equal color white color
like this so it because it's a function
now I'm going to return style and I'm
going to be returned right if I do this
and i refresh my screen one sec yeah it
compile again that's why now I'm gonna
close this page and now I get my button
right there with the plus so now I want
this one when that when I click to get a
model coming from the bottom a bit like
Twitter ideal so all you do this it's by
you need first thing to go to where we
put the route so well and we have the
ohm navigator and we have the Navigator
so first thing I'll never get our for
now but I just remove swipe enable to be
found
I don't want people to go to another
route just by clicking it just by
swiping because I think that gave us
some problem when we do this and we get
the end so I don't want to be able to
swipe after that inside my navigator
what I'm gonna do
so here in my screen I'm gonna create
another screen Co cream meter for now
this one I'm going to have only a create
meetup screen this one gonna be a react
component and gonna take view and a text
for now and the only thing you're gonna
do - it's gonna be a component like that

do return text with lol now I need to
import that to my index so if you hope

gonna do is I'm gonna import from my my
screen hold on I'm gonna import create
Meetup so now what I'm gonna do here I'm
gonna say create Meetup and I'm gonna
put my object for the screen screen and
that's gonna be create meetup screen

over there when I put a come over here
I'm gonna open an object and I'm gonna
say mud and I'm gonna put model if I do
this nothing gonna happen right there
