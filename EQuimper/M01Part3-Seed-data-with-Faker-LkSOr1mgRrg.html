milestone so as you know in the last
video we get this graph QL with the
empty string and that was pretty broke
boring so we're gonna add some kind of
spec that I'm on that I'm so pleased to
make life easier for the development so
first thing we're gonna do also its I
want you to CD back inside your main
project where we have the Instagram
folder and just do MV Instagram - server
because we're gonna add also the mobile
app in that same folder so I'm gonna
have the mobile and server so now I can
see the server and I'm back to where we
were before this is just a little setup
again also they get up repos gonna be in
the description so if you want to follow
and all the way I work it's the repos
gonna be by milestone so don't gonna
start at 0 don't let start at 0 we're
going to start at the first milestone in
gonna go further
so now what we're gonna do is we're
gonna make add another library whoo I'm
sure the names gonna make sense for
everyone who came from no GS or other
like door language and this is a shaker
so we're gonna add a figure here and we
want the version 0.9 and also I want it
I want it only when I'm in dev and test
and now we're on mix that yep and again
mix compile
we get all the figures perfect so all
we're gonna work with this scene what
we're gonna first in go inside the seed
repo seed right there and we're gonna do
it finally create fertile so we're going
to delete everything new and we're gonna
add yes the Instagram post and the repo
before it's for working with DB so if
you didn't know you see er they have a
they have a second repo again and this
is what we can do we put out people that
get people that allow you see it's
everything about ecto and you repository
here we're gonna say we want all many
mock photo I'm gonna create a variable
where I'm gonna send mine so I won nine
photo right there and now here I'm gonna
face some cool really quick this thing
right there I list a photo of canal
currently a list of string with our
family
they are follow so I get two free stock
that orgy because they use HTTP and this
is what we need inside sorry on inside
area and say and I just take finally the
image URL so I open this one example and
I cookie to this thing and I cookie
repeat image address by paste example I
wanna have right now
if I open this one
you see I get the photo so this is just
a little photo and I'm gonna paste that
and inside a gift and I'm gonna put the
guest in the description so you can
paste this stuff in here we have ten so
that's why I have this nine stuff right
there you know here we're gonna do a
photo we're gonna say a four and here
I'm gonna add the index four zero to
mock photo so we're gonna create a like
a range air - zero - like mine yeah
right there now here what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna create a photo or era I'm
gonna I'm gonna put my equal and now
here I'm going to put my attribute I
need so I need the attribute color
meaning from my schema right now for the
caption in the image URL
so for the image URL we're gonna make
use of the genome library so you know
that app but then you will find the
element at the given index so here we're
gonna put the photo list so you see the
app need enumerable so the list and you
need an index we're gonna say photo that
yes and we're gonna see the x-48 index
so we're gonna get the image URL for
this element so if this is the row we
gotta get 0 1 2 $2 laughs and after that
we're gonna say caption in our caption
this is where we're gonna make use of
the figure library we're gonna say dot
Lauren - getting some stuff we're gonna
take some Shakespeare what do you think
about that some amlet stuff and now
after that I'm gonna create this stuff
with my photo and I'm gonna make use of
that post that photo that change set to
make sure make sure the ego with what
the schema asked so you're gonna go
right inside this thing here right
inside that chain except and we're gonna
make use of the repo that insert with
the bang because this is what they asked
for a seed you know we are good to go
and now all can we work with this data
here how can we see the stuff
okay I'm gonna close past school because
you're gonna see what I'm gonna run I'm
going to do next act Oh that reset so
they reset the now this we run a
migration and we run the scene
and now you see we get some insert
inside a DB we get the caption and the
other thing we have asked and now if I
open first going up
and I open my Instagram there now if I
open the photo you can see I get 10 item
and I get the image URL of what I've
just shown you in some caption about M
left
so now if you rerun the server and I run
my graph to it again I'm going to
refresh and I'm going to run my graph
view it again boom
now you can see we have the speed that
take also I can maybe help you one point
to inside the DB this is what that take
my Rasengan and that take two minutes
are done to get everything and the air
that was the crew we did that we did
inside but we asked we select the ID the
captioned the image URL also the insert
add and update from finally we select
all from photo this is what we asked so
now we have the photo now why not add
another one resolver to just getting one
single photo with the ID how can we do
this
and this thing gonna be pretty simple
I'm going to create another field called
photo we why are we going to receive a
photo and I'm going to say here we're
gonna need some art and I'm gonna say ID
which is going to be an oatmeal ID and
now here we're going to see resolved
resolved our that pose and I'm gonna say
photo with tweet or email and now I'm
going to go inside my pose with over
right there and I'm gonna do right there
photo but now the thing it's inside my
tribe your man the first one I don't
need yet but the second one it's where
I'm gonna receive my argument and the
third one is the contact but I don't
need that yep
so even though I can say anything about
that as a destructuring way it's just a
pattern matching well we can take the ID
from this this map right there so now
what we can do here it just say okay
Instagram that post and they have all we
did do something for us yet photo and
now we just need to pass the ID right
there so now if i refresh my screen now
I'm gonna get another query I get photo
right there so now if I run photo and I
pass the ID number one nice ID image URL
and caption I get the one I just asked I
asked for the second one I get the ID
number to the host simple I know this is
this is the work absent I've done and
this is the word Phoenix at them and
this is the word it except they're just
they have done a really good stack here
here we're gonna just add another
description get a single photo from is
ID and now here I see no need for
argument so what's gonna happen it's if
I don't put an argument
if I don't put an ID number like that
I'm going to get
like this in argument ID inspect type ID
from nil so with you see we get the
error if I really just say we inspect to
receive an ID so now we put an ID we get
it back so that was what we need to set
up for the annex report just to at least
showing the element react that's it so
in the next video we're going to start
to build the reactive project but first
thing we're going to need to start to
add the react native navigation so the
library building by Wix this one right
there
we act as a negation with native library
so we're gonna set up this thing in the
next video I hope you enjoy and mini one
decrement all you feel about this video
if you feel I go too fast or too slow or
whatever you mean it you have something
to say about this tutorial just let me
know in the comment and I'm gonna be I
try to do my best with this stuff
it's not just for me this thing it's for
everyone it's I want to everyone so hope
you enjoy and we're going to talk
neither a very good not evil bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
