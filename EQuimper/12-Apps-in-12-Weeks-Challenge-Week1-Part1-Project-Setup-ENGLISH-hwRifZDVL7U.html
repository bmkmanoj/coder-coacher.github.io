where I'm good we're gonna build 12 app
in 12 week
yeah that sounds queasy it's a little
challenge I start one month ago why I
build one at each week and I'm sure you
already think about this it's gonna be
small little app and why we did that
it's I've seen playlist on YouTube where
I see someone making 12 up in 12 wheel
like I want but with Ruben well so this
is these guys making the child and he
built twelve little app like Pinterest
clone something like that and I was
thinking about making that on no GS
because I never really see that and so
why did this story on to its first thing
it's every time I find a video or a
tutorial on JavaScript somewhere they
never go to the they never go to a to Z
they just they always stop somewhere
between and I would like to maybe share
some stuff I found and and I think you
can maybe learn with me with that and I
don't think that gonna help myself to
make more app and get a small amount of
time to make it so the first app I've
built it's something like this right
there
a bitly where we passed along link and
they give you a short link and after
that you can pass it like on tweet
something like that where you have like
144 character maximum and you want
always to get a small URL so this is my
version so short neat URL so I can came
here and I'm gonna show you so I'm gonna
post so long link so I'm gonna get a
small version of that and
after that I can take this one and so I
have a copy to clipboard button what I'm
gonna copy this one I'm gonna see that
gonna open my app right there so that's
gonna open my link and other thing so I
put a reset button where I can be set if
you put something crazy you're gonna get
your L not value trade again and after
that you see I have a small loading
right there and now when I click on a
link I get the number the account number
of visit someone get to this one so it's
time to start the code so first thing
you need no GS install I have no 724 so
this is the last version and if you want
to install node just come to know GS org
install node right there so I have the
curve right there you can take the this
other version who is more stable and
after that we're gonna use Express GS
and then we're gonna use Mongoose for
talk with MongoDB
then we're gonna use react for the
front-end yes that may be crazy to use
react but I think people this is what
people want to learn and the jQuery
something like that so and we're gonna
use es6 and we're gonna use import in
the server import/export not like any
other tutorial what is they always say
we're gonna use the s6 but the continue
to use they require so we're gonna use
better for that so first thing we need
to do it's we're gonna in it the the
package Jason so I'm using your now it's
like it's like NPM but for me it's much
more fast it's a NPM module manager so
I'm gonna type your in it - why to get
the yes flag so everything it's yes
first time we're going to install
Express we need yarn at Express so here
in my yarn are add is the same of you if
you do npm install - saved
express when I install Express that I'm
gonna open that on my editor so I'm
using Visual Studio code now it's a
faster for me then add on and I really
like it
build by Microsoft is free so the first
thing I'm gonna create a file called
index is so like we all know we need
inside a server we need to call Express
so we're gonna start with import Express
from Express so that I'm gonna create my
port I'm gonna create my app sorry equal
Express that here like that so now app
it's my Express instance so after that
I'm gonna create my port where I'm gonna
take in precedent and port or tweet as
a-- so here why do this cuz my part when
i'm gonna send that to eric ooh yes
we're gonna put that to evoke ooh when i
use this process environment and that my
Twitter's on but for us inside the div
and we run man we're gonna use the 2000
after that we're gonna just create
around really quick
we're gonna say to the root I'm gonna
use my rack and rails and ear I'm gonna
just raise that Sam
ello so here I'm gonna just send a ello
in my friend and that's so when I'm
gonna eat the root I'm gonna just send a
hello message after that I'm gonna
listen to my port so add that listen I'm
gonna exert to my port and ear I teach
that take a call back with an error if I
have an error I want to return a console
error with my error else I want to use
so here you see a verb active app listen
to with my by tip now I can use this
string interpolation so now I want to
start my server so I'm using the
terminal right inside
these also joke oh if you using a map
you need to do a control and at the top
of your term in the windows I am Not
sure I never reuse a window so sorry but
I think that's going to be maybe like
control - and this thing maybe I'm not
sure so here we're gonna do node index
that GS Oh what happened right there
it's cuz no GS use some es6 features but
they don't use right now the
import/export and this is what we want
but how can we use it we need to
transpire the es6 code to es5 and to be
to be compatible so right now the first
thing we're gonna do is we need to add
some package for make it work and this
is what battle so what is better so
battle yes so better GS it's the
transport the compiler finally we're
going to compile everything from es6 to
s54 work so we're gonna add better CLI
by the register bad polyfill and finally
battle chris es2015 and yes for the one
we didn't know if you you can do this in
one line no need to click enter on every
module so yes so after that we need to
create a Babel or C file so the Bible
say is where the the the server the
script gonna look before they run for C
which battle file we want to get yeah
that'd take just an object so this is
really below play cone here we take
preset and here we need you need double
quotes for that and we're gonna just put
es2015 so now we can start but now on
the thing gonna work what what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna create a folder called
server inside my server I'm gonna just
drag my index GS inside my store
but now nothing gonna change how can I
use better I'm gonna create an index
file right there and in this one what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna import some
babel file for storage so I'm gonna
require so yes this is the treats on in
line where we're gonna use require the
first one we need its we just start you
always need to put me just at the top
after that I'm gonna have require and
we're gonna get polyfill right there and
after that this is where we import your
app right there so we're gonna use the
slash server so we use the server ear if
you didn't know when you have an index
gs5 JavaScript it's smart enough to take
this file inside a folder if you don't
have any pad so I know I can use no
index GS and I'm gonna get at least
sound to port 3000 so now I can go to
port 3000 and you see I get ello right
there so that's it guys for this video
so you're gonna see inside my youtube
channel I'm gonna get to playlist so
like you can maybe see I'm French
natively and so I was thinking about so
I make all my video and tooling so
you're gonna see the English playlist
and if you are French go and see my
French player is going to be maybe much
more easy to get deeply what I try to
say so but for both that going to be the
same amount of material nothing more and
so I hope you enjoyed this clip
subscribe if you like that and share if
you if you want to and don't forget to
like the video if you liked and put some
comment it's my pleasure to answer every
question you have so hope you have a
