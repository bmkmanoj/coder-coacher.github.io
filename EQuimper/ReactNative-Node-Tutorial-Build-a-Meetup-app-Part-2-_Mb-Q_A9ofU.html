continue their research soil or we build
a meet-up clones using OGS as a back-end
and using react native for building them
mobile apps so when we left last time we
build really basic back and sub just for
being start and we did the same with the
mobile app using exponents so today
we're going to just start to make better
progress so we're going to work on the
we're gonna work on the model about the
group yes there's a group going to
create a meter and we're going to add
some to in the backend and we're gonna
play with some stuff and I'm going to
show you some yes success syntax who
make your life much more awesome so hope
you're gonna like it so we're going to
start so as you see as a create a file
ear where this is what we're going to do
for each step the first one we're going
to add the SCM follow one we didn't know
what it is yes it's a tool for elbe you
to add better cone so like they gonna
dig an essay to you when you need
semicolon when you have requires
something but you don't use it when you
create a variable outside of the scope
is everything so first thing a screen
mind
so right there so the only thing we need
to do X to X to Y on AB dash D so for
the NPM that's going to be for the
inside that they're definitely es LEM
config econ per yes I didn't laugh good
name so I just put mine
yes so when it's done perfect now what
we're going to do is we're going to
create a new file right in the root
County FQHC we're going to open bracket
here we're going to add XM and we're
going to put my name in crimper right
now
now first if that's work we're going to
go back here we're going to remove the
as you can see that already work my yes
can ear ad for new line I know this is a
pain to always new line etc so that's
why I'm using a tool called editor
config and my editor configure I have
already some stuff so we're going to
just copy paste this one because I don't
need it I'm going to remove it and now
just copy paste this one so what that do
is attack on take it use for make each
editor of view death in to work with the
same kind of configuration and that do
that automatically so maybe you like to
work with the in dying style of nine
size of four but you think want to work
with a two so that's gonna just change
that for for free so you don't need to
do nothing so if you are like me and you
using Visual Studio code what you're
going to need is edit our country for
working so this one right there is the
same on sublime and this is the same on
atom you just need to ask it is our
country for esam in Visual Studio we
just need yes in right there for Adam
you need winter and winter yes Liam and
I think this is the same for sublime so
so now you're gonna see I'm gonna just
put that and now that treat for me my
new line so as you can see my ESN
working I just put my mouth and missing
semicolon okay
for the one who know more about this
thing I'm using or DMV but I remove some
rule and I put some yes seven rule and
all this kind of stuff so so we're going
to work on that so so we're going to
start working on the models as we need
some stuff we're going to you gonna see
I'm going to change a lot of stuff so
right there we just start that's really
the good way for that so here the meet
up we're going to add one thing so we're
going to add events
date and this one going to be a site of
date that's going to be required true
but not for now we're going to come back
a later after that ear just at the
bottom here when we almost closed the
object we're going to put a coma
here we're going to create a new object
and you're going to add timestamp and
going to put true what that's going to
do that we're going to create for us a
create app and I update app property so
we just make much more easy to work and
put all you ladies need up at the top
etc so perfect after that as you know I
really like to work as a module so we're
going to create a module right there
we're going to create a module called
groups as you see I always put a s here
so I always prefer to realize my
resource like that so we're we're going
to create a model gf we're going to
create a controller that GF we're going
to create an index that GS and we're
going to create a route that GS okay
this is what we need so now we're gonna
talk about the group so they drew
because what I've I put for now the
group gonna need to have a name here
when I put the exclamation that me that
mean this is the require then a
description and we're going to have a
categories categories for now that's
going to be a net recorder but in the
future that's going to be because we
gonna create another model for that and
as you see we can add media so i group
can have some people meter so that's
going to be an area of middle object and
we must be a group for create a meetup
so later we can add user and one user
can be the ending of the group and each
other web but i think from my point of
view everyone in the group can create a
meter and the onion can just judge if
you want to delirious so I'm going to
just put four groups on
right now so we're going to work with
the a good part so then I jump on the
model of the group we're going to import
Mongoose come on here we're going to add
schema schema from Mongoose after that
we're going to create the group keema
equal to a new schema object at the end
I'm going to export default Mongoose
that model
mother and I put group and we're going
to put group schema like that but I want
to ask sometimes they don't some people
don't understand why we put this thing
it's inside Mongoose mode we have an
array of model and this is with the this
name Mongoose know how we can access
this model you can exit and today we're
going to import from Mongoose and then
import from file so you're going to see
what I mean from there here so the group
need a name so we're going to put a name
with the type of string and require true
perfect after that here I'm going to add
two unique we don't want a group called
the bite guys both like two group of the
same name you want only one name for one
group here we're gonna add some kind of
validation inside this model that's
going to be minced length that's it'll
be here you put an aviary the first
argument is the number of character you
want minimum I want five at least
because I think at least I want a group
to have five character long at least I'm
going to put name but b55 character long
director director logo perfect like that
after that we're going to add the hook
that's here we're going to add
description there's going to be a side
of string going to be a side of string
sorry my doggy sorry to be so cyber
string and we're going to almost put
this thing so I'm going to just copy
paste here but then I remove uniquor no
offense to have a uniquely description
now so now I'm going to just put 10
character along minimum and we're going
to put description so here is the error
message coming from MongoDB inside the
controller if the controller don't do
its job
and after that snap setup alright we're
going to just jump on the we're gonna
add the even date
that's going to be a type of date like
that later we're going to add require
true I'm going to add the category Oh
nuts even though sorry
when add category here there's going to
be a type of string we're going to add
the record through here here is that
something we didn't see yet we're going
to add a meet-up that's going to be an
area subject here we're going to use
type of schema type of object ID so what
is that it's if finally Mongoose have
used object ID for make you use of
populate if the method for get all the
info about object but it don't store the
full object as you know a document on me
so you don't want to have like if the
group has 20 meet up you don't want the
group to has all the group all the
meetup stuff so imagine you have 10 meet
up with 20 props and on each they're
going to make a big document so if we
just store the ID finally and do that
for us here we're going to add a real so
we ask need to be the same name of what
you have put here so here it's my meetup
so I'm going to put me up like that
after that when I do the same of what we
did I'm going to add the same thing here
we want to know when the group has been
created etc perfect so now we're going
to jump on the controller here I'm gonna
here I'm going to import group so my
mother coming from my mother right there
here I'm going to export cons create
group that's gonna be anything requests
every function
here we're going to desk truck they read
that body
so equal rate that body so we just need
to know what we need here so name so I'm
going to make that on two line is going
to be better so name description and
here we're going to add the category
perfect so this is when we create and
the the group here we're going to do
some kind of validation really basic so
if no name we're going to return
I read that saddest fond dress for that
process value equal with a JSON object
with an error of a two with a message of
name must be provide so now I'm going to
do an if-else typo name it's not a
string we're gonna treat the same but
must be a string so then we're going to
do another one so don't worry this is
the last one and if name that lamp it's
a smaller than five we're going to put
for whatever the one who know how I do
this I just do comment shift command D
so the copy of my line after that I
click on my ads option on my and that's
I can move my line I'm going to put a
members have five character not okay
so now I'm going to just play with the
description for today so I'm going to
just so here I'm going to ship
everything so when I ship in I screwed
up
I pick everything I'm going to do shift
command D so that copy paste this all
like that now here I'm going to click on
name I'm going to do comment D and now
you can assume that I take everything
now
here I pick everything so now I'm gonna
just put description so now everything
is there
I'm going to just change this fiction
them to be chem I'm going to change the
description to be a big deal like that
and B and now again now you see all you
can always be you can hold really quick
perfect so now here we're going to do
yeah I'm get so that must be too long
yeah too long so I'm going to just like
that like that here we're going to
create cons group you're going to equal
a new group I'm going to put the title
the description just for now this is the
two one we need for require after that
we're going to create a try-catch oh
that's tight try in a cap cap you're
gonna have an error I'm going to copy
this line I'm going to just do a NR 1
create loop here we're going to return a
rear so that means we are successful
sorry that oh yeah we have that status
201 that's Jason error is going to be
solved and grew this is the place where
we're going to use away away that grew
so the group we discrete here that save
will eat the premises like that perfect
so here oops it's not title its name you
see now our ESN make your life so much
easy
perfect so now it's time to fit the
route for that I'm gonna I'm going to
import data from Express after that I'm
going to import everything as a group
controller from my controller file so
I'm gonna create a new route coming from
the rather insert like that say I'm
going to route that post
/ group / new and that's going to be a a
group controller that create view so now
we're going to export default the route
at the end the only thing we need to do
now is go to the index inside the group
we're going to import group route from
the route here I'm going to export group
route like that now inside my module
you'll have the index so if I chose
everything you have index right there
I'm going to do the same as what I've
done with the mean up from the export
group like that so now I can go to my
index and if everything is working I'm
supposed to let's put coma air put and
get my group perfect so I'm going to add
this group I'm going to add this in my
array of route here so everything needs
to be epi now yes and show me have a
narrow if I forget to put an L here so
you just need to understand everything
as API in from after that is going to be
epi - group so now it's time to open
postman one set for a set up so we're
going to create a new well I'm going to
go to the post we're going to jump to
locale o in a local outfit other API
group grow group that new like that
perfect so now if I sense what that
sounds oh I didn't for my server sorry
so now I'm in the meetup knee I'm going
to jump on my CD back here so me the
back end like that I'm going to do yarn
there for the MTN just run NPM run dev
ok so now I can come here and I can send
my name must be provides perfect so we
have the relegation so now I'm going to
click on fix form here and I put name
I'm going to put just g4c must add some
character along surface so there's going
to be Group one
now I'm going to get description must be
provided description I'm going to put
but this I'm going to prove that this is
my description so now I'm gonna Sam Oh
perfect so now you think we create a
group I got my update and create app
coming from my sign stem right there
have my name at my description my ID and
as you see I have a meet up with an NPI
way so now if I open rebel Mongo so
that's going to be the same risk for
this one but I'm going to do show you so
now I'm going to turn it I'm going to
open my meetup me for the chance grew so
inside my group is the same thing so
I've my update add create app name and
the description meet up at 0 elements so
thanks for now now last time I create
inside a control our power Meetup and we
play with and but this is not how we're
going to work we're going to just be
more smart now so we're going to join
inside the same controller group and now
what we going to do because we want the
group to be able to create the middle
not everyone can include me now you need
to be in Telugu so if we're going to do
Khan and create group meetup it'll be
anything request with request and
response here that's going to get a
change we're going to have title and
description so this is coming from the
record body so this is what we need for
creed amino but here we're going to add
the group ID coming from react parents
the parents going to be inside there's
the URL so I'm going to show you after
all you can do this so here what we're
gonna do
it's so fun I'm gonna just copy by you
this once I don't want as
a lot of validation so I'm going to just
put title here then I put title must be
provide after that I think that this one
but if I go there I'm going to put a
minimum so I think a title to me to
other minions so I'm going to put five
the same and site a five director wrong
at least this one now and I'm going to
do the same for my description but I'm
going to put it down so now I'm going to
read jump on my controller so you have
my five but you know just in exchange
cycle so now I can again copy that
chicken and beef I'm going to jump the
ascription I'm going to do this friction
put B B and D and here so the
description here I forget to change name
Fortezza perfect but here it's ten and
here it's perfect
so now know again so just because it's
too long perfect now we're gonna do
something I forget one group ID we want
to group the ID toes if no group ID we
don't do nothing so here we're gonna say
a group ID must be provide here now
we're gonna and we're gonna do the try
catch catch chicken ever and that's
going to be easy again we're gonna take
this one and then I just say a need up
can it be creating
in you now there's going to be a place
something where we gonna call an action
an action we've never really done before
so but first thing we need to create it
so you can I see something I didn't show
you so we're going to take a group
schema so we're going to add so we're
going to add a static function so it's
something it's a function you can put
inside finally the scheme of the group
so it's like fine by ID and delete
that's fine by ID and update actually so
the kind of Mongoose stuff you do with
schema so we're going to add one so
that's going to be easier for us you
just work with so here we're going to
just put statics and then we're going to
call this adult to be add meter they're
going to take up so that's gonna be a
function here we cannot use another
function but we're going to lose their
the this we're going to lose the disk so
I'm going to put Ethan so that's gonna
be making function and air inside my
function I'm going to have an ID and
here I'm going to add argue when I go
okay so here we're going to do current
meetup equal mongoose that model and
here i'm going to ask for my meetup
model so i need to have the same name of
the one i used right there so i just
import my meetup coming from Mongoose
model that's it after that I'm going to
do current group so I want to find my
group that a big there that's fine by ID
with the ID I'm going to provide here
but I'm going to put on that way because
this is a primitive okay so now I'm

going to put group here so MongoDB then
I take the group we have here and you're
going to understand he's going to just
take the ID so I'm going to show you
everything from there so here why we
need to set the group is inside my model
I'm my Meetup
now I'm going to add a group we're going
to be an object of type kima that type
of the site is because we want finally
meet up to add a note author so those
are going to be the group like that and
this and this we're going to put a word
right there perfect
now well I'm going to do if we're gonna
console.log ID and arch so you're going
to see what is that I'm gonna go to my
controller do controller yes when I go
to my group controller here I'm going to
do I'm going to just call finally my
action just went out I'm going to do
group so the instant of my model so my
group right there and then I do group
that add leader I'm going to add the
group ID here I'm going to put an object
within title and the description so now
I'm going to save this one so we're
going to see that all inside my terminal
so now I'm going to jump to my post
mount so I'm going to open post now I'm
going to close rubber one go we don't
need it for now now inside the Google
just create we're gonna take the same ID
copy plays ID I'm going to create a new
route I post route oops I need to first
thing I forget I need to import this one
so I'm gonna here that's going to be
group ID so this is the parents ID I'm
going to add meetups and I'm going to

oh I see I'm going to just do right now
and I'm going to come so long my meet up
with a just put need up and be easier
for you and I'm gonna put another
controller here with so now project is

gonna go back and now in a see now it's
my meet up I just create now I have a
title I have my description but now you
see as the group is all the good object
and this ID is the idea of the meetup
but don't don't be sure the group gonna
be removed
don't add Mongo DB when we can I say
gonna just take the ID that's it so now
we're gonna you know just say finally
what we just done first thing we need to
do it inside the group we're going to
need up so the name of the this one in
we're going to push this is on our way
we're going to push the meet up that's
it after that here I'm going to have
you're going to have a we go then an
equal going to equal like from this that
out so we can add all the premise but
there's going to be a with avoid right
down and then we're going to do group
that safe meet up that's it first
yep that's safe and I'm going to put
group that safe because both is a
premises so we're going to wait for that
and at the end we're going to just
return rhythm
yeah just put some color in here now I'm
going to show you what is that now I'm
going to go there I'm going to do
current result equal a white group meet

results for now okay I'm gonna send that
and now this is what I got I got an
array of two objects the first one going
to be the group the first one going to
be them to the meetup and the second one
it's my group so now we can and
replenish that out this is always the
the same order so and now you see this
is already saving from later we're going
to jump back on the MongoDB and I'm
going to show you so now here what we
can do it discharged the average it is
going to be meetup and here that's going
to be group the first argument we know
it's meetup curl in time my model here
we put meetup safe first
okay so now here you are the easier we
just need to return yes that status 201
with JSON object ever going to be solved
and then we're going to send back the
meetup and a group on all time to really
test my way
so set joining so now I'm gonna sound oh
and will receive back so because of my
postman sometimes you say really think
this is my response I just get so I get
to meet up with title and oh something
bad I don't know I know we'll get all
the groups cuz that mean we have dope
something inside a model I put sites
objectid group four times or just a
little snack
and so this is not supposed to be like
that one step and this is what happened
when we're now if I connect my need of
me I'm going to go to my correction I'm
going to go to my Meetup
no you see only my object ID inside my
group oh I know why girl
so my meetup of the group here good I
will just return back the group but you
see I have my ego objects right there

going to be a good place to do stuff we
did a lot I'm going to push back this
code to get up if you want to follow and
hope you learn something a we see schema

that just keep the object ID of the
group and we can use the property a
later time 74 yes create app update app
after that here I'll show you some kind
of validation really basic validation
