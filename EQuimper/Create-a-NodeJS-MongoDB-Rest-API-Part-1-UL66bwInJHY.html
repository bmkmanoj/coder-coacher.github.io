a new tutorial list so that's going to
be about no GS my plan is to do a recipe
I by using an OG s so so this area here
just to talk about what we're going to
make and what we're going to use
everything so why do I make this
tutorial so I was searching for a long
time to get like my own kind of no GS
butter place and I always feel like
overwhelming when I read all the node.js
boilerplate I found because they asked
so much stuff and for a beginner like I
was not so long ago I didn't feel really
what right using this so finally I
decide to make my own node.js below play
I'm going to put a link inside the
description and that was a really good
experience for learning and I want to
share with you what I learned and
everything and for the one who claimed
from the middle app and building which
react native don't worry I'm going to
make this two story out in tyrella
so I could destroy your until helping
people to make their own recipe I and I
want MIDI I want you to make kids like
maybe your own boiler plate so what I
mean below play is we're gonna just set
up basic stuff and you're going to see
like all the stuff go and after that you
can just reuse it almost get clone your
own repo it just start because we can
have at application and all this kind of
stuff so what are we going to do is
going to just make like a mid jum like
website don't going to be a middleman
code but that's going to be something
looks like medium what I mean by that is
we going to add some a user attached
case and you can create a blog post and
everyone can read the blog post but if
you want to like like the blood pours or
maybe like read a comment nothing like
that going to need to be at escape we're
going to use GWT for this one and we're
going to setup that with passport GS in
with the local strategy after that
users and create a pose can delete it if
its own post and can update it after
that I use or can follow another one so
kind of Twitter in every day
after that you're going to get an
education when the user you're following
that I do when you both after that like
a user can like a pose and user can see
all the pose the like so finally we can
almost like boob marking what you like
after that let's take I want to use it
all so that we're going to use no GS
don't use MongoDB for the database after
that we're going to use es6 es7 feature
and so so the one who came and our
really beginner in javascript maybe you
should read about promises anything i
wait after that because i'm going to use
a lot of easing away I've done gonna use
callback I mean the most I can I don't
like hold back so after that for the
compile we're going to use battle so bad
they're going to take the es6
es7 code and with the help of web pack
version 2 we're going to make it running
on the no GS server so what are we going
to do for the part one we get a set up
set up the tool so finally we're going
to set up edit our confit Express ESPN
better and wet pack 2 so when we finish
this tutorial so this chorus part we're
going to add a simple Express server
running nothing more this is just for
the set up and we had a lot of stuff to
do so so time to start so the first
thing I'm going to show you we're going
to do it's finally create a new folder
so I just read this folder anything is
there oh it almost is they getting now
inside of folder just put a giving I I
want to I don't want to send mine own
module in and I just create this to
bring me so you can create a new folder
after that I'm using yarn you can use
NPM this is almost a sign so I'm going
to do you're in it so I'm going to just
click here and type for each so for
everything at so that I'm going to give
me a package JSON
for the one we don't know whether it's a
tacky Jason it just filed it justified
to manage all the NPM package we're
going to use and that can be used for
adding script and everything so after
that what I want to do is we're going to
start right with experts so I'm going to
add Express
so Express is done so now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to create a folder
called source and I'm going to create an
index the gs5 at the top
what's in here I don't know at the top
I'm going to import Express from Express
yes yes and yes 60s the import here for
the one we know import on work with the
note so we need to use that doll for
that so what we going to do here we're
going to just create a neck and neck
extent of Express I'm going to just do
current cord equal process then envy
that port or mm so finally when we push
to maybe like a Baku something like that
they're going to use this environment
variable so that's why we make it like
that after that really easy AB that
listen we passed the port and we get a
callback of error and air what we can do
is if we have an error I'm going to just
true it else I'm going to console.log
oops let this console learn I'm going to
consular with back here so with back
there I can use string interpolation and
I'm going to say server running on port
so there's going to be three thousand
and because I use back tip I can use
multi-line so I'm going to say and
running on process the end then note e
and V oops
gold can be like that and when I just
say something really simple that
increase it just a little message
formats with you make something great
nothing more perfect now what I'm gonna
do
don't know what happening here oh I know
what because I have something here
running I'm so sorry guys
perfect so now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to run I'm going to cut a
package.json script so I'm going to
subscrip I'm going to sit there
so in development and I want to use node
env to make a never-ending variable
because I know some of you going to use
Windows no DNV is not for free for you
so that's why we're going to add class
and be really simple package to add the
only thing you need to do is add Krusty
in the editor here so air finally we
said we want to use inside development
no do not start with the source folder
inside index now if I run you're in
there oh we're in a spectator can import
yes so this is what happening no don't
understand this line of code now right
now you understand everything else but
you don't import so all can we make it
working we're going to use a tool called
battle so for setting up battle what
we're going to do is we need to install
some package so inside death dependency
we're going to install the other core
the loader yeah it's funny we're gonna
info better preset env babel plugging
transform objective rest spread and i
make a typo this is rest so finally
we're going to add these two things for
babel preset env just a preset will ask
you to just they give you what you need
so before we use like that that we said
yes 2015 that we said react and
everything but now with tidal preset env
we can now set up the bad urges we just
need one thing finally so here inside
the route now we're going to create a
better receive file so this is why we
can essay to battle what we want curly
braket air preset we pass air an array
of another expert bracket air and we're
going to say e and b
for nv1 men and women like that and now
we saw there is a two argument here and
here we're going to set target and we
get ass inside that curly bracket note
so we're going to target node and we
target the curve version of node after
that after the preset here we're going
to add plugins and we're going to add
the plug-in we install so transform
objects rest spread what is this
plugging I want to use the tree dot the
magical tree de the rest and the spread
of aerator that's okay I'll just load it
I mean so here I'm going to use use
built-in like that and we're gonna say
true perfect but now what I need to do
battle just run like that so that's why
we can use battle I mean I can show you
that both way if you want but I'm going
to use webpack too because I love it I
mean I use it on the front end why don't
use it in the back end too
so for web pack the thing we need to add
in fact apparently it's web pack and
after that we're going to need to add
battle core and by the loader why battle
core because if we don't add it that's
going to be a difference like we need
this dependency for running by the
loader that's what I'm going to add
another package website node X sir no
perfect so now everything is set up as
you can see I skip now so I learn from
other tutorial now I skip the
installation I don't want to lose sign
so here now time to create a wet bag
that config the GA so here's the web
pack it's not it's going to be like the
one in the front end but now we need to
use some other stuff so we're at the top
so this is only place where we're going
to need a es5 so node external I'm going
to be equal to require and here I'm
going to add with that node external and
then I'm going to say current path equal
require that and we don't need to
install it this is coming from
this is communing with No
years after that module that export
we're gonna export an object here the
next target
we target note if you target the front
end you're going to do well target note
I said I'm going to external and I'm
going to put an arrow in I'm going to
signal external and this is a function
so that I'm going to in entry so air we
need an entry point here while I'm going
to sit index so here is the name of the
entry I want to give it I'm going to
give it index if I want I can given my
name upon one that's going to be wet web
that going to compile this is the name
here so I'm going to say ticket from the
SRC its receipt index a GS after that
I'm going to out put so what we want to
do as a finally web pack take something
and give you something so this is the
give you Pat I'm going to sitt tap that
join I'm going to see during name so
inside the route and I'm going to say
create at this folder
after that file name lower key so now
this is the page where you say so this
one is the folder where you want it the
tap and the file name is which will find
like what you want wetback to call it
that's going to be easy we gonna sit
inside quote curly bracket name where
this name coming name is the variable of
this thing here so if I say a manual
yeah that's going to be the manual but
now I'm going to index and I'm going to
say bundle the GS but inside my coat
sorry like that so now I'm going to add
an index that bundle that GS after that
leave brewery target so what we target
any I'm gonna sit common GS to this is
what nodejs want basically this is what
no just want the require but we want to
use the import because this looks better
so modules after that here we're going
to set up a set of ribs
so that's going to be an arrow in here
we can add an object in the
the only place where we're going to add
a rule is death so I'm going to I'm
going to see some rejects here and I'm
going to say give me the JavaScript file
we want on your JavaScript file we want
to exclude after that exclusion we going
to exclude sorry for my phone I'm going
to exclude the the node module so no
more pills
so we done one wetback to combine known
modules we don't want that after I'm
going to use some code bad dude or so
this is the package we install so babble
load are gonna find if you have some
battle preset and we have but we set up
that inverter Lucy why I do this because
for me that's look just much more
cleaner I don't want to put that ear I
want to keep it clean as I can perfect
so now we have web backstory so now
inside the package.json we're going to
need to create a new script called death
that build so this bill here was going
to do it's getting there's going to be
web back there w YW because we one way
back to what we want we're back to every
time you see a change to recreate
himself like it's not really feeling
myself sorry that was a bad term I mean
we create finally your app so every time
you're going to make a change what I
going to take it and make it right word
for their own ogia after that now the
day of here we want to run on the battle
for the disk folder gonna came so we are
gonna add on this but remember the name
is this that bundle
what do so now if I run example my yarn
they're doing so now why pack is
watching the file now I get an error did
install this thing so I think I make a
typo
so one second yeah I do transform
without the air so as you can see by a
white bag already
look here but look now oh we had a dis
fuller index book that yes we have all
the wetbacks set up here and after that
mmm Express wetback require all this
number air committing from the note
external so VAWA back arrow cons app
equal and you see this is my code so now
this thing can run so now if I run my
yarn there Oh server running on port
2000 and running on develop development
make something great so now if I go to
local O's local Oh 3000 I guess cannot
get it's normal but now if I do a chain
here example if I can anyone web pack
going to change sorry
wetback gonna compile but we don't like
we don't see the change because we need
something to check for the change and so
for the one who I used no money and no
jet in the pack
you know the package no money are we
going to add no more unknown one gonna
finally watch the change so the only
thing we need to do go to packages and
change node to be no more now so now
malware packs still working but now if I
say yarn there I'm getting make
something new and make something great
now if you example I see something great
oh you see make something great now is
coming with the new change so now I can
say and I get my change perfect come out
which told me to be install so we have
installed xpx press yes better and web
back to now to other tool I really loved
editor concrete you use the sources your
code sample you use a ton
the user blank central again and that
work - with webstorm go to your
extension plug in everything search for
Edie star country so you're going to see
the little mouse right here install this
stuff after that for the one using this
source your code here it is out on state
generator is perfect this is what we
want
why because now what I can do it shift
command T edit our crunch it generated
track on trick bomb what I'm gonna go
editor config right there what this is
five so finally for the one we don't
have the genetic generate don't worry
I'm going to have the repo in the get on
and you can just copy paste this stuff
so here what I do is I say I want the
index type to be spice why do this you
work with a team of five developer and
you don't want people to use tab you
want it to reduce space but they don't
want to change their own editor by using
this nothing need to be changed if you
don't contain going to make it fun for
you
so space in then size of two we want to
trim the trailing whitespace we don't
want the white pipe and we want to
insert a new line at the end perfect so
now this one is working after that what
so I'm going to do is I'm going to close
that I'm not going to close this so now
when I say the example you're gonna see
when I say boom new line coming add some
white space you see a void space now
here if I say no white space this is
what do editor config after that I want
to install PS slim Visual Studio code es
slim book that's it Adam I think any
lint are and linter ESN I'm not sure and
I think of sublime immediately so just
check for what you need to setup that
but trust me you're gonna load it you do
yarn add that DPS limit but you need
some configuration I've made my own and
I love it so I'm going to use it for my
style you can use it it's really easy
and but you can use the origin being
everything I use there are B&amp;amp;B but I
just modify it so es lame
take equal per after that wind it's
installing what I'm going to do now it's
done so what I'm going to do I'm going
to create a dot ESL or C curly bracket X
10 equal per nothing more to do after
that - command key command W to close
every windows and now reopen index Egeus
Oh what is that Oh missing semicolon you
don't want to have a console so what I
say it I with my yes income thing I say
here you have a console log it's just a
warning when you see like that is just a
warning I say maybe you don't want this
example you debug so you don't want the
controller to be stay there here we want
it because we're going to use for the
server but other place you don't want to
have a controller example if you cancel
the password of the user you don't want
that to be run on your server that's why
I'm say oh you miss semicolon if you use
if you chose to do code what you can add
if yes click on save and now if I click
come an F oh so we can come in here I
remove semicolon and remove some
akelanir I get red thing boom boom
save everything coming in from so log
what I do now I don't like that
I say open create a new line at the top
do like this so one exterior is between
two /es Lynn disabled but if you do this
to disable everything so now if I do
this I don't get an error so what you do
is no console so this thing gonna still
work but the console no so nothing has
changed in your bill but then I love it
I love it so much so and nothing you
need to do more so we have setup the
basic tool to get started so I hope you
enjoy let me know in the car in the
comments if you like it I mean for the
one who has already seen my tutorial I
would like to know if you like the new
price I do and if you like me to like
the change like I make so I mean I learn
another youtuber by I know
so you see what I mean I I need to learn
so hope you enjoyed I'm gonna put that
to get up I'm going to put the report
inside the description oh I'm going to
work with the repo I've learned from my
mistake on the other one I'm going to
now make branch so the master gonna
always be in the ladders version but I'm
going to add now a branch called EP zero
one four eight zero zero one so for the
one will come and I want to see what a
10 at the end of this video
just look a p1 that's going to be the
same for two three four five six so
you're going to see at the place of what
