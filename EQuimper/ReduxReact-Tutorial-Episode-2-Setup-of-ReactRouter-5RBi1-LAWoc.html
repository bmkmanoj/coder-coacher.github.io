that story on today we're gonna work on
the reactor outer port yes we have
already set up some stuff but we didn't
really implement the real reactor right
now and I was planning to use material
UI but I get some problem and so sorry
if you have to check for get stuff on
that so what we're gonna use this
somatic UI
I just seen they have male 1 for the
react because before if you was using a
semantic UI you get a jQuery and all
that stuff but now they have made their
own implementation so we're gonna use
this for the project for the CSS
framework so now yesterday I quit you
with this teeny stuff we have me so now
time to add the route so inside your
source folder we're gonna create a route
file in this one we need react like that
we need to think coming from react rota
we need the writer who is the wrapper
for using the route and the route who is
a component rope no yes like that and
this coming from react rather after that
if you remember in the store like right
here we create an history with using say
mystery with stuff coming from react
router
redux we we put two argument inside
browser history coming from react router
and the store the one we just create so
we're gonna use this same history for
the route so import history ok maybe
some people ask why I need bracket and
not like that cause here if you look
again in my store I export currents I
don't export default if you export
default you can use your without bracket
but like all this kind of stuff right
you
they don't export default cuz they have
more than one module inside inside the
same fight
so if we add like that sorry
from redux and from the store like this
now we need to export default so that's
going to be a stateless component like
that and now we pass the router fall
wrapping the route and now we can create
the first row like this the rotor take
eastery products so we're gonna pass the
eastern we just create and inside the
row we always set up attack so you can
have like pose something like that but
here we need two other group so this one
for my project gonna be the layout one
the one wire we pass out the layout
stuff etc so in this one we're going to
pass the only component we have main
right now and this is the app and look
here I can import at like that cuz in my
app I export default this one so this is
something good to know now here inside
my index I don't need anymore my app but
now I need to have my route from route
like this so now I can change my app for
route if you came here and you get
nothing bro
perfect if you aspect with your react
dev tool you came here you can snow you
have a provider with a stateless
component who is my stateless coming
from my role so when you don't give a
name here we are gonna call that
stateless company so like this so we
have a rather history with our context
this route context is right here and you
add a pat so if you look here and my app
add app at location right here so this
is my route moon and inside this one I
have my yellow and I have my image
everything like that so after that your
time to put some stuff so here inside my
source I'm gonna create a folder called
module inside this one I'm going to add
a fuller called
layout so this is everything touched
layout port here I'm going to create a
file called enough bar that GS inside
Molly is
I know this is a lot of code but later
that all gonna make sense here I'm gonna
create an index gs5 so here just for
right now I'm gonna import react you
know I'm gonna create a stateless
component called nav bar here I'm gonna
add a deal with each one the nav bar
like that nothing more inside my index
right here I'm gonna import Magnus bar
from that bar GS right here
remember JavaScript smart enough to
don't you don't need to pass GS here use
JavaScript here I'm gonna export night
nav bar like that
why I do this is because it's much more
easy to just import a directory it don't
care about the name and when you put so
many stuff here like adders a lot of
stuff here and I can just import that so
now I don't need it's just more easy and
more looks better for me this is what I
think so here in my module I'm going to
create an index GS and this one gonna
export everything coming from my layout
folder so look at the magic right here
now inside my @ GS I want to add matanov
so I'm gonna here import like nav bar
from now this is the magic port on your
module I don't need to add layout that
nav bar I don't need that now I can just
import this from module and now I can
add my nav bar right here so look at
that now I have my table all right here
and my hello always look that curl of
this and we can add a fixed direction of
the row oh : like that
okay so now I'm an oddball hello
in my real ear but the the part now when
I talk about the layout it's everything
inside a tag in react is a children so
what the route give you it's example
right here we're gonna create a module
called own oops
another file module sorry guy I'm gonna
create inside my module own folder and
inside this one I'm gonna add our own
view so that can be like your landing
page something like that just for right
now I'm gonna add this with my own view
inside this one H wrong with I'm the
home view right now again I know this is
a lot of coding but make much more sense
when you start to add a lot of stuff Oh
view from on view GS like that we export
like we did good like that and now
inside my module in the XJS now I can
export everything coming from my own
folder now inside my route we're gonna
create another route because I just want
to show you how the children war in
which we act finally here I can import
all view from module no need again to go
to home and on view now I can just stay
with module like that I'm gonna create a
here when you're using react router you
can use something called index route
index row is the finally there the index
when you use this row but for now I'm
gonna just show you this way so yes I'm
gonna use index bones
sorry guys live comb component now it's
the Oh view like that
don't forget to end by indexer so now
you look at this
oh nothing change what happened I have
nothing
why cause my Rutter I have my app like
that
I have mine at bout perfect because this
is inside but the route don't show
nothing cause any we are everything
inside a tag is a children so this is a
children of the app so using that you
can are always destruct so when I'm
going to show you these children is the
same if you do this that perhaps that
children inside the the component but
for me I always destruction now look at
that here I can fast like children's
like this and now look at this
and the own view is right here if you
look again inside your react dev tool
you open you have your app and look I'll
own view because now is the children of
my app file so that's why your app file
can become your layout because now if I
remove this now remove my hello I can
remove now everything here like that I
can remove my style right here no look
at that that can be your layout cuz now
I've mine of all who is always there and
now I have my own view so I think for
tonight that's gonna be good I know I
was talking before was implement and
it's a Qi but like I say earlier I try
this video a first time with material UI
and everything was broken material you
have have something happened today I
don't know why so I'm gonna just teach
myself a bit about some attack you I
have used the real version but now they
have component so please let me know in
common what do you think about this
video if you like just yet like and
maybe subscribe if you like this
so tomorrow we're gonna start to add
some CSS and after that the funny part
gonna start with me dog stand react so
take care guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
