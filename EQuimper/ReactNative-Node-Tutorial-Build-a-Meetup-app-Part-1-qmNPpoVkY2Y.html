small app with reactive so there's going
to be a meter cone so some are working
here and some people can create a meter
someone can join with massification and
all this kind of stuff we're going to
use an OGS as a back-end and for the
mobile app so like I say we're going to
use react native so with the last last
version 0.40 by now and so for the one
who didn't know what is react native
it's a way to build Java scripts with
Java Script mobile app so your code
compiled to Objective C and Java so they
make your app available in iOS and
Android so and that's awesome I mean you
you write react code so JavaScript code
but that give you awesome app in run
natively so this is perfect for us to go
fast we're going to use a tool called
exponent exponent it's - who let you and
do really quickly app with react native
so they have some awesome gear they have
some stuff like map view this is
something we're going to use so we have
the map view coming from the origin
being map we they give you access of the
photo really image feature right there
they have the location video everything
so like in the video in the home video
they talked about exponent it's like
real soul Ruby
so it's like real for react native so
yeah and I really like this too
it's awesome now so now we're going to
start with the backend so first thing we
create empty folder like that that's
increasing small folder what we're going
to create a folder called right now meet
up back in
we're gonna sit inside okay we're going
to open that in your text editor so I'm
using Visual Studio code perfect so
we're going to install some dependency
right now so we first I'm going to do
here on inner so they're going to add
some question and perfect we want the
version zero point zero point zero one
one description no and three point four
fake and so turning so just put your
name perfect perfect the packages and
just create so we can start line up
first thing we're going to use yes yes
2015 and all the latest stuff we're
going to use eating avoid in the server
so what we need to you install right now
we're going to start by installed here
on add better preset es2015 better
priests double register and bad polyfill
perfect just for be sure you see
everything is installed right there
we're going to create an index gs5 in
this one we're going to require the
babbled we just our first after that we
require babel polyfill and finally we're
going to require something we didn't
create right now but there's going to be
inside a server folder that's okay so
we're going to create this server folder
right now and inside this one we're
going to create in this year inside this
one we're going to import Express we're
going to create the app and finally
we're going to listen to a port so we're
going to just start by equator camp
called con port and this one is going to
be this one is going to be equal to the
process and you're on because we're
going to push the server to Eric ooh
so we're going to just set up right now
and that sport or 2,000 sold in local
also is going to be two thousand here
we're going to listen to the fourth
support that take a call back whatever
if we have error we're going to control
error with the Arab L we're going to
just come to load the back tip app
listen to court and now is running so
now if I start my server what I'm going
to get so if I do note in this nothing
can work as what I need a bad dollar EC
so battle Orissa file inside my room for
that so which kind of better I want here
you put precept and here it's really
important to ask the double coat here
I'm going to use I'm going to just close
this one I'm going to use es 2016 when
we just install so now if I'm using this
one against the same cannot find oh I
forget to install it you don't add
Express and now if I'm running
everything is working perfect so this
thing right there is perfect
you can work after that what are we
going to do we're going to use MongoDB
for the database so just install a
mongoose
so we're going to yarn add going to
import mongoose version four point seven
four four one so i'm going to just check
the other version really quick there's
going to be the version four point seven
point seven so inside my server right
there i'm going to create a new folder
called config inside this country i'm
going to create a file called vb idea so
all my database configuration going to
go there so i'm going to import mongoose
from Mongoose who just insult you I'm
going to export default a function
in this one we need some kind of
toughness treaty so what we need to do
first thing is we need to add we're
going to use premises so we need to add
the Promises Promises equal global so
we're going to use the global premises
after that we need to connect so we're
going to Mongoose that connect inside
this one we're going to type the URL for
it
so now just for the local and the
development we're going to just use the
fellows and we're going to use meetup me
so that's going to be the name of that
meetup me just thinking about this one
so one goes that connection so
connection it supremacist who f2 so they
have one so once we're going to use it
for one open once open that take a call
back I'm going to just control log Mongo
DB running here on ever so if we have an
error we have a call back with the error
and we're going to control error the
error perfect now inside my xperia I'm
going to import BB config from my config
baby
and right after app I'm going to fix
database database and here I'm going to
put my BB config like that so now if I'm
running my index I'm going to get one
goes connection that's all different
function what I got oh sorry
and all my MongoDB running but now you
some always using no one in the XDS and
I want to add a good dev server for that
so I'm going to install something called
normal so we're going to install that
inside there's a penalty so the name is
no month so what that let up its morning
going to change something no need to
restart the server the server and I
restore automatically so the only thing
we need to do it's inside my package is
situation here I'm going to create a
screw with a dead inside this one we're
going to just start with node ends Dave
look ma'am
with no one month index that year so now
if I come back here and now I'm running
we are dead you see here perfect so now
if I want to restart you see I just
write our F restart perfect so this fall
is working after that we need some kind
of middle of our show middleware is what
happens between all your server and it's
sometimes some kind of stop we're going
to help your app so here we're going to
ask middleware so here we're going to
install this search so first thing I'm
gonna install so I'm going to open a new
tab I'm going to CD and sit it back in
okay I'm going to yarn ad Morgan
and body or so so body part so what did
that do is they're going to create so we
connect we can send JSON object and get
it inside the require from Express so we
can use reg that body here we're going
to import body for sir from body Porter
we're going to import Morgan from Morgan
here we're going to export default and
ear we're going to have the application
right there
you know CY is one
yeah I'm going to do at the youth body
posture that Jason like I say we're
gonna use Jason at the youth body
posture that URL encode perfect and here
we're going to use Morgan
so Morgan gonna control log all the
giver requests we're going to do here
we're going to pass this perfect so now
inside my app I'm going to import
middleware country from config either
work and here I'm going to create me
middleware right now so just forget that
and here I'm going to do middleware so
this is a function and at the gap but
we're going to just pass the one we
create perfect so now we're going to see
if that works
so first thing we didn't break nothing
oh I see what I miss I forget put extend
and then we're going to press false so
this is the small error we have here I'm
going to kill my console and I'm going
to go to local over 3,000 so if I go
there you see I get fo four so this is
what the Morgan do for perfect so now
what are we gonna do is we're gonna
start to make the resource for the meter
so inside my server I'm going to create
a module folder inside the fold module
folder I'm going to create needle folder
and in this one we're going to create
models that gear so the model I'm going
to be where we declawed compare the
correction of MongoDB because MongoDB
this is not table this is a collection
so yeah we're going to import a mongoose
and schema from mongoose after that
we're going to create me the schema
EEMA equal new key ma right now perfect
and we're gonna just already explore so
that's going to be Mongo Mongoose model
we pass the name we're going to use
Meetup and we're going to pass meetup
schema so the schema here we're going to
pass a title so this is which kind of
key we want inside the collection
remember MongoDB gonna create for us a
JSON object sauce so air inside my title
I'm going to add a type of string and
we're going to require it's true
so that in this one we're going to just
put description just for now so in this
tutorial I just want to show you the
basic stuff in in later video we're
going to setup like comment set up user
attacks creation everything so air
inside description we're going to just
have a type of string and we're gonna
have require two so we want at least to
add some kind of description after that
enzyme I need up I'm going to create not
a folder but a controller so here and
sign my controller I'm going to create
all the the rest API and point not
endpoint but the controller before we
put that inside the endpoint so here I'm
going to import meetups from model from
my model so here you see because I'm
using model module it's much more easy
for me to just like everything is inside
its own folder so it's really easy to
just focus inside one picture so that's
why I really like this one so here we're
going to export can create Meetup
so that's going to take a require and
response because we using body parts are
here we're going to take the title in
the description equal from the body so
here I'm using a disk structuring
yes six feature again here we're going
to create new meetups equal new meetups
so in selector here we're going to put
the title and the description because we
using again es6 no need to pass the
value if the key value is the same here
we're going to so yeah I forget this
we're going to use async async await so
first thing if we want to use it we need
to install a new battle preset so we're
going to yarn and the preset stage zero
so what that gave lost with stage you'll
gonna see it's all the ladder stuff
coming in the jealousy below so here we
see we have the async generator the one
we need so here inside madolora see I'm
gonna add this one stage zero and now
I'm going to just restart my server just
for be sure my double or EC is working
surface so now inside my controller I'm
using async so using I'm going to try
and catch my error so this is all you
then I end the error inside eating away
so yeah I'm going to return every as
that status we're going to equal the
error that studies with a JSON next page
whatever true just an object I mean in a
message call ever with needle this one
out I'm gonna have set more time here
later
yeah what are we going to do with just
returned with that status 201 for
creation JSON object where we're going
to pass meetup as a wake need up a new
meet up that site so I wait it's like
almost like generator in es6 but it's a
new feature so so when you pass as AC
inside one of your function
you use the other workout at weight so
it's just for me just much more better
than using callback or again promises
just much more cleaner so here we know
the meetup Denair so we're going to send
this one when we're going to get the
safe with the premises perfect now time
to create the route here we angle import
router from Express we're going to
import each controller as need up
controller from controller and a we're
going to create current route equal new
router perfect and now we're going to do
route that post / need up and we're
going to pass the need up controller
create need up and don't forget to
export default the wrap perfect and now
inside my media I'm going to create an
index that via inside this one we're
going to import meetup route the one we
just create and I'm going to export
either route why I do this because now
in timeline module I can in with an
index GX I can export everything from my
meetup perfect I know that don't make
sense right now if you don't know what I
try to do but now if I go to my server
right there I can import inside curly
bracket because I'm not exporting by
this one I can export from module you're
going to see I can export meetup route
so now after my middle war I can do app
that use slash epi I can pass my need up
route perfect so now we're going to see
if we break something
no so now time to open a tool called
post now I'm going to try to pose
because now we can create I know we
don't have any server validation we have
nothing this is something I'm going to
create with you in the next episode but
right now just we want to set up
something quickly so here
don't say we're going to create a new
collection how need up me inside this
one we're going to create a new route so
we need to add inside HTTP the local i/o
street are gone for the server api we're
going to go to meetups there's going to
be a post request and now we're going to
inside the body you click here X forms
URL encoding we're going to type title
when I say title 1 and inside
description I'm going to put this is a
description so now if I sum you see I'm
just creating max first meter I'm going
to open Robo Mongo who is a tool for see
what you have inside you MongoDB
database so I'm going to go to meet up
me connection need up and I have my I
just create that I want this is
description with the object ID perfect
I'm going to close the boom and go
inside my postman write that know
everything is working so I'm going to
save this one as a need up so the name
of my resource and creat so the name of
the reaction perfect so now I can we use
this one I want inside my tutorial to
show you later 202's with postman
automatically and you're going to see
all crazy you can do stuff with that
so now perfect we can create meet up
when I just create a new controller
before go we're going inside every area
and pizza we're going to create a new
one forget forget all the meetup we have
so get out get up so that's going to be
another easy thing with react and real
perfect so inside this one now what are
we going to do is we're going to just do
a try so try and a catch so inside my
catch up error and I'm going to just
copy paste this one right now inside
this one we're gonna return rare that
status 200 with a JSON object
we're going to be meetups with us
because we're going to get much more
it's going to be away meet up that's
fine that's great break it right there
like that so now we have we're going to
find all the media we need to pass that
inside your route for air I'm going to
create a new one
yep again go to media but that's going
to be get Almina perfect so this one is
good for now if I go there and I create
a ni due to a gap and I assume I get the
one I just cast perfect so now I can
take this one as a need up get out
inside the same collection so now I
might create and I get out just for the
pleasure will just create three meet up
on Oh perfect so for the back down right
now just for the really small bottom
play we are all set up so long time to
work with react native so with my
back-end we can cause everything perfect
so now if we go back to Internet okay
and now if I go to get exponent inside
get exponent what they give you it you
need to download at XDA so first thing
watch this little video which you want
to know much mobile exponent so the
first thing you need to install the XDA
so you just go there so they have one
for microwave Windows and Linux so you
take care any win so for me I already
install it so what I'm gonna do
it's first I'm going to close this
back-end we don't need any more don't
worry I'm going to put a code to get up
so you're going to you can use it if you
didn't write in same time I'm going to
pass the code in in the description so
then the open exponent
interact phone I'm going to create a new
budget I'm going to call it need up me
mobile I'm gonna go to my made-up meet
right there I'm gonna open I mean I'm
going to create attic blank so I'm not
going to create from the I react native
project Whyalla exponent don't need to
open each code don't need to open
Android studio from me right now I'm
going to just use the Ender is nothing
yours with iOS simulator if you are
Windows you cannot so you're going to
need to you enjoyin yep so now what
we're going to do so this one's going to
be really quick really quick first thing
so that create the project for us
perfect when it's done we can click on
device open iOS simulator
another thing crazy with exponent if you
can publish to them so you don't need to
push that to the store if you want to
test that with your friend something
like that or you can send link with a
phone number and they can just download
perfect so I'm going to go to this
mobile perfect and I'm going to open
that in Visual Studio code
oh yeah so that open for me my debugger
but I don't want the debugger because
I've a lot of CPU running right now
let's stop my debugger
one sec so you see so exponent has their
own loading screen
so what are we going to do then at that
time that running okay so we get the
first one so why you so long it's
because I have my debugger so I accept
it so I can close this window right now
so here we're going to create or
exponent this is what they give you so
as you can see if you're using the
eyeglasses before we don't have iOS and
Android folder we don't need it exponent
take care of everything
so the only thing we need it's here we
have the main so here I can change and
see meetup me are you gonna see I'm
gonna get meetup me right there
so it's live reload so here we're gonna
create a constant folder I'm going to
create a file called if you added here
inside this one we're going to do all
the kind of stretch stuff and with the
back M so right now the only thing I
wanted to fetch all my meetup okay I'm
going to have fetch meetups with a F
it's going to be a function we're going
to return fetch and here I'm going to
pass HTTP local local owed 3000 API
Meetup and we're going to pass at them
because this is what search mean and
this is a response but we want to fart
as this to do so perfect so now inside
my main we're going to use the ducks
later but now just for the set up really
quick I'm going to import from my
constant ETI
I'm going to import my fetch need up
function here here I'm going to add this
as a static default drop inside my
reactor reactor a component so here I'm
going to inside with my sketch method
need up we're going to add this to
evening component in mouth yes you can
use even with yes right there okay I'm
going to create a state where I'm going
to ask loading to be false and meetup to
be an empty air
here when I start I'm going to set safe
to be loading - and I'm gonna pass my
out wait right there so I'm going to do
current data equal I wait because I can
use this because of easing oh wait this
that drops because remember not passes
as a prep let's sketch heat up Thursday
so now my dad I going to be an object so
it's going to be the same object off we
get up in postman so now here's what I
can do is did this at subspace and I'm
going to pass loading to be true to be
false and meet ups to be data that lead
up perfect so now you see nothing gonna
change but now what we can do
we're going to import activity indicator
so this is a some kind of loading screen
I'm going to add right there so if this
that's thing that loading is - I'm going
to return with a view I'm going to
return activity indicator with the side
of large an a I'm gonna pass the same
side for the container so we're going to
get this inside the the medial one so we
don't because it's really fast but now
I'm going to just pass this function
inside as a timeout just for the delay
the past this and I'm gonna pass to
second so now you're gonna see you see
the loading and now we get need up
perfect ml just for finish for today I'm
going to add here these that say that
meet up that map is an area right now
hey I'm gonna do need up or index and a
I'm going to just show inside the text
with a key of index I'm going to show
need up that title so I'm supposed to
get
three line and you see meetup me for
this to the title and now I receive
title 1 title 2 and title 3 who is
coming from my database so I hope you
enjoyed this part 1 of the tutorial I
know inside in the last kind of trailer
I just didn't finish it it just just try
to give you what people want so I see a
lot of subscriber really like model
application with react native so that's
why I'm jumping on that and just follow
what you like guys so if you enjoy it
just click light and I'm going to push
the code to get up I'm going to add the
get up people in the description and if
you have any comments are just add this
just below in the comments so our good
