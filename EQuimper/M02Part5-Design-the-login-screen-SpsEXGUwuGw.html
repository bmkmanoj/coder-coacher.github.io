number five on the shuttle milestone so
the plan of the day is to transform this
screen to discrete so this is what are
we gonna do as you can see some stuff
I've add is I've added these phones I'm
going to show you all two at the front
I know this is not the real fun of
Instagram but this is one I found for
free
Oh almost looks like the same and also
as you can see here we have some
gradient right there and we're going to
make use of a library called react
native variant from existe here so this
is the plan of today so just creating
this page after that the thing we're
gonna do in the next one it just when we
click here we're going to open the SDK
of Facebook so we're gonna start so
we're gonna start right there in the
login screen and what are we going to do
first
it's we gonna just place create the
others first the other is going to be
this thing here
this purple square
so the Eddard I'm gonna tone him you're
going to add a flex of 0.3 and I'm gonna
sit and have a background color just for
now I'm gonna sit for poll okay and I'm
gonna put that right here and I'm gonna
assist I equal style Eddard and inside
that I'm gonna take this again screen
text and I'm gonna change that to be
Instagram now if I say you're gonna see
now we get this in the middle and pretty
weird so follow me follow me do we're
gonna change that by doing another one
here called contain
star that contain we're going to create
their content right there in this one
gonna be blue and I'm gonna take the
full rest of the screen
don't blow blue okay now you may be as a
key now we have some weight problem but
if we don't get nothing here and while
we get the ear the thing why we don't
get nothing here it's because I'm going
to need to put something inside that
example if I put hello
now I'm going to get my blue right there
so for anyone I pen it's this nmn right
now don't stretch and what we can do for
and all that
it's ear
I'm gonna say a a line sell and I'm
gonna SiC stretch and now you should
take it's full space and I'm gonna do
the same for this one right there so now
they're gonna take the foot space you
know so I can remove this one here any
gonna still work perfect so now as you
see now we get this first part and we
have the bottom one so here for the text
is that in the middle so why not putting
that in the reader who's gonna suggest a
file contain and we're going to say also
a line item Center
I'm going to put that inside Rihanna
right in the middle so now we're going
to create an apt name for this text what
we going to see you can have a color or
now I'm going to take my typography
library typo
right inside I have iOS color and I'm
gonna say iOS colors
that's why and I'm going to put that to
these things
like that okay look the same no yeah so
now after that what are we gonna do it
we're gonna put a fun size of 50 and now
we're gonna need to have out we're gonna
need to put the text ear with the right
fun so all we're gonna do this it's
we're gonna go inside google fun and I
found this one you call a lobster and I
know this is not the real one but you
know we're gonna use this one for now
but what are we gonna do it's we're
gonna open visual studio code here and
we're going to create ear a folder
called assets inside this one we're
going to create another folder called
front if you have already follow my
video about oh you can put an add custom
fun in react native that's gonna be the
same thing here so but inside that what
we're gonna do its first thing we're
gonna set the color at the front you get
a kick here to download you're going to
open it in tinder or whatever you are
you have it right there now I'm gonna
open these of you who again and I'm
gonna drag and drop this one right
inside my phone like that okay now what
I'm going to need to manage is I'm gonna
go inside my packages and
here and I'm going to create another
script color and p.m. for reiative link
and I'm gonna put assets with a memory
what I'm gonna see the food or I said
and so when we get around react native
link by doing mobile and reactive link
this thing gonna link gonna link the
asset for us in the iOS project so now
if I open that in Xcode
what we're gonna add now if we can add a
resource folder inside the one where we
have all the icon we're gonna get a
lobster regular so now I want you to
restart your you want photos on Android
because I'm done gonna do this
yet if he's not working just follow my
tutorial I'm gonna put my video inside
the description about all to do this I
think it's the same thing is the same
thing
so now we are here now we have their
fund what we gonna do it's inside the
team we're gonna create a funds that GS
file in this one this is where we're
gonna finally create the variable we're
gonna enter this fun and that's the
export current funds equal here we're
gonna call that lobster so that's gonna
be the key and for the value you just
need to have the same thing and same
naming as this one so what I do is I
click on that I can enter so that open
that I do come and see and that give me
access to this lobster regular after
that I'm gonna go inside my index that
yet in here I'm going to do export
everything from my phone like that
well now what I can do here inside this
one inside my login it's like an import
from my so he
and import punt and now inside that I'm
going to sit here fun family haunts the
lobster and now if I say I get my phone
right there
see what's pretty simple no need to
linger on a thing it's all do by being
active link power after that here I
would like to add the status bar white
status bar here I'm going to put that
right here the top and it's it steadies
bar it's a bar style little I contain
like if I say I'm gonna get max
attitudes about white now okay this is
not the right this is not the right
color
I know we need two other ingredients so
that's why we have this library but
don't fart don't worry I'm gonna put
that in the description
you know this library react linear
gradient is really easy to install so
first thing you do is you need to
finally do npm install via gets a
variant
yarn to linear gradient
I'm gonna run up to that react native
link again now we're gonna see some
successful link for ingredients so you
see andreadd is successful and the iOS
successful inside its code now we're
gonna need to rerun the project because
every time you add an active library you
need to rerun your further to get the
new change inside new simulator
we're gonna wait
take some time
I'm gonna come back when it's done but
now it's done to succeed so know that
should we open the project and we have
it here the thing I've changed because
we need to install that so we're gonna
do we're gonna do li-mei our radium from
linear gradient
and now here what I'm gonna do explain
your opinion that we work it's you ask
you to just give an array of color like
that what I'm gonna do here I'm going to
do current color gradient so that's
going to be agreed and for this screen
and now just follow the one I'm going to
type I've done from search seventy four
three nine eight B to get the first
purple so that's going to be this purple
here
and the second one is going to be this
element purple five six four nine nine P
okay now you we're gonna replace this
view here with the linear radium and now
we're gonna see color and we see color
video like that
now if I save this one and i refresh my
screen now we see we get the gradient
now okay you can also remove this
background color we don't need that
anymore
but now you see the gradient is the top
to the bottom and what we have here is
the left the right all we can manage
that
it's ear what we're gonna do it's now we
have access to two props one called
start
here we're gonna save the ex then I
start at zero point zero and the y then
I start at zero point zero so what we
mean it's turn at the top layer and
start at the bottom layer and we're
gonna say n at the mix of 1.0 and why
don't one point zero like that okay and
now look what's gonna do now that change
the gradient at you from the left to
right except for this gradient and for
the library and it's if now we need to
do some design but what we're going to
do here inside the content we can add
three section as you can see we have the
first section
we're going to have a middle ear
you can have another section here and
this one I see - but it's for
so all we gonna many do that it's we're
gonna create first thing here at section
time and this one gonna have the flex of
one okay
this one also gonna have a justify
contain Center and and a line item
Center in also you're gonna have the
same align itself stretch okay
well now here we're gonna have you
moving up the first section that section
and now for now we're gonna have it
right there in the blue but and now
there's a can gonna take the full screen
we left but we can at least do some
design now and we're gonna do that right
after well now here we going to create
the first input but we're going to say
here
so I'm going to put the input ear and
later we can put that in the component
if you want just for now because it's
going to be more for design because
we're gonna load with Facebook so you
I'm gonna power star the input rapper
I'm gonna call bit I'm gonna tweet this
one this input rapper right there and
also I'm going to import the text input
ear we're gonna see in a moment so here
for the input rapper what I'm gonna do
it I'm going to see gonna have a height
of 45 and you're gonna also add a width
of 90% of its parents so here also we're
going to put a background color
you know pink I'm very fair you get this
size here it's pretty much the size I
want well know what I'm going to do is
I'm going to also say border radius to
get some corner of five so now we're
going to see this little corner ear
after that ear what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna put a border color and now for
this color what I've done is eat for e e
or E or C now if I say we're gonna get
this border color a but we don't see
that there because of the color is too -
it's just order to see with this color
so we're gonna put a background color
now I'm gonna change this one here and
we're gonna say here
F is f 9f9 so now if i refresh we're
gonna get this one right there
not about our color we say okay yeah we
don't see it audience here because we
need to put it back but a width of one
oh no the way it's gonna be just one
like that okay okay I kick nothing
happen then it's still like we're gonna
keep like that for now and what are we
gonna say it's gonna say when we have
that we're gonna have a board margin but
on ten I want nothing
i tender longing so now if I do this
thing time because we're gonna have to
input we get this like that
okay now this is supposed to be a text
input so all can we do this it's we're
gonna put the text input component right
there where I'm going to say placeholder
of email okay and I'm going to do the
same with this one
now you see we get email email watching
this want to be password that's what but
now we need some padding I think you
know what you see because it's too much
in the middle and yeah this is not
really what we want so here what we're
gonna say it's we're going to say first
thing
when I create an input here for this
input
put-put style style of input and we're
gonna save this one gonna take next one
now this input gonna take the full speed
okay now we're gonna say you're reading
Oh 10 so now we get like that nothing
gotta touch until 10 and I think that
what we want so we are going for this
one right there the input take the full
flag so if you want to see gonna take
cut off really going to take everything
but not 10 like that okay so now we're
going to create a button login so we
have the we have this one done we have
this one and now we need to build this
one
so now what we're gonna do okay
it's we can adjust screen finally
another view here at the bottom of this
one but this one now is going to be with
the touchable library happen to the one
we have to create the company where I
work right now so we're gonna do
butterball like that and we're gonna see
this one another feedback of opacity and
this one gonna have a text inside that
of logging right there we have the
butter
and now
we're gonna do a touch of all you we're
gonna add a style of logging BTN power
login button
right there so this legging BTN now
gonna have all this stuff ear or nose so
we're gonna copy and pasting I know it's
not good but we're gonna do for now so
no padding at least we're gonna have no
padding the margin gonna be merging top
now we're going to have a background
color
background-color of 3 1 8 d e e like
that
no border colors no butter whip and just
like this and also this one we're going
to add just a Python thing Center to
Center the text inside is one and any
attend Center oh now we're gonna get the
button like that then I could another
proper here or logging BTN text yeah we
don't really need what I'm gonna do this
text here
here we're going to just say style
oh yeah start that loading you can take
sorry-looking vision text color I always
follow boy yeah okay now we have the
legging know one of your questions ready
it's okay yeah but it looks really lot
like less a pack so I can handle them
it's I think I don't remember what is
the name of that but here you don't need
to RGB but you can do it just adding
like the opacity you want example if I
want to add 40% opacity I can add 40
right there if I do 40 I'm gonna get
this one like that so I'm gonna say 70
for this one right there so now so now
we have the opacity for this button for
now so what we can enter after that it's
we're gonna need to manage this forget
your login details get there yep
get help signing in okay so now what
we're going to do is we're going to
create another view here
below the taxable
in this view we're going to add the text
of for good your
you're logging details
and you know we're gonna say get help
sign me in like that okay Oh like that
so now what are we gonna do is we can
add a style of this view for for good
rapper and now this rapper what we gonna
do is we're gonna juice differently we
are or you want to add a margin at the
top and at the bottom of 10 and after
that we want ya like that not gonna take
some space but now this get help signing
is supposed to be a button so are we
going to end all that it's we going to
cut this thing here
and now right there we're gonna see
touchable you know put this text here
and now here we're gonna put a feedback
of opacity and now if I say try to know
what's gonna happen if I say it I'm
gonna get that the top to the bottom so
now that's what your might forget rapper
I'm gonna need to save Flex direction
Oh ro now you're gonna get that left
right and you see here I've left the
space so that give me this little space
okay so now this is a button so now this
text here I'm going to call that then I
call that Chekhov
hold it
style that BTN text and I'm gonna say
right there
this VPN text finally gonna have ear
color or this color here without a 70
inside code
okay like that now the text is not
perfect this is not what I would like to
so that's why I'm gonna import from my
topography the human library and also
the system for stem way
and all the BTN text here I'm gonna add
at the top of it you man the food no
object and also I'm gonna add the system
way the semi bowl I want it to be semi
bowl like that exists just like this now
we have something but now also this text
I would like to look more like every
year here so what I'm gonna do it's to
this text
I'm gonna call that it takes a foul out
I'm gonna call that fall out here I'll
put that here color and now I'm going to
put some design for this one so they're
call-out gonna have both here the thing
gonna change the color going to be iOS
the colors that need
like that and now we are this this one
right there
okay now we are pretty close to the end
now what we left is this part here this
button section in this one here what
we're going to do for the shown for its
ear what we need to plan now it's we
need to go outside of your section you
see they they contain let they contain
by that section to the section right
there
I'm going to kill another view now this
view then I have a name of all rapper I
didn't own a name I'm going to call that
all rapper because we have the word or
inside that this one this one near the
all rapper what gonna have I'm gonna
have ear here
then I first thing a background color of
real good to see them after that we're
gonna see a width of light is parents or
90% like a I mean this one here
after that I'm gonna save also emerging
vertical of dental top the bottom then
okay now if I say that I'm gonna get
that thing because I have no element
inside that I'm going to start to put
some in a menu I'm going to put a view
another view and another review but
inside this view I'm gonna add a text of
or and allow I'm gonna do my view like
that well I'm getting it I'm getting
read there at the bottom my are right
there well now what I'm gonna do is this
view here I'm going to put them a style
or or divider or the boat so that's
going to be the little divider we have
here
I'm going to create a small divider
and I'm gonna put an ID of one a width
of one of the pixel of is background and
I'm gonna say near attracts of one and I
also gonna say
that's a background color
of black for now okay if I do this and I
save
listen I accept now you don't see them
because now what I'm going to need to
add is to sickbed my our rapper at the
flat direction
of rope now we're gonna remove this yeah
okay well now this is what we got this
is not what we want but this is what we
get for now what are we gonna do with
our wrapper it's now this one I'm going
to also say you see it's that in the
center is it go in the left
Oh what we're gonna say is this one I
want em to Alan himself in the center
but now if every fish I get that here
after that I want a line item center
because now you see the or is that the
bottom I don't want that so I'm gonna
say Center when I get that like this but
now why my our I've no space but if you
should see here we have some space but
now what I'm gonna do it here inside my
view here I'm gonna put a style of our
tech wrapper
I'm going to put that right there
you
because the thing it's remember with
flex one everything take all that speed
so you need tool so here this one gonna
take is Phase II ket and the other is
gonna take every other space you have
here so it's really not about who you
are you will get a say 0.5 to the middle
so the app of the other one and will get
a say also just a file contain center
because I was going to be ideal and a
line I can enter well we want him to
align the center in the middle now if I
do this you see if we get this pipe okay
and now we just need to change the color
so the our divider
the our divider can have the same color
of the border color I put you
we're gonna change that to be deaf here
okay now we get this little gray maybe
it's video for you to see it but it's
little gray okay
after that I'm going to just say here
time that our text
and this one the artex I want em to have
the system
systm way of semi bowl and also I want
em to of the color of iOS color that
gray
well now this tech is going to be great
here okay now you see this one is here
you take a you see the margin here Modi
here so all we can add it here in the
middle it's by creating another view
here called section again style that's
section left here for you
doing a decimal up the other one but no
if I do this now you see now I go at the
top because now here we have the full
section right there so now time to write
this little button and continue with
Facebook so all we're gonna end all that
is gonna be pretty simple its first
thing we're going to create a touchable
it's a button
okay feedback opacity inside that we're
gonna put a text of continue with
Facebook and now we're gonna need some
icon
I've fine then the icon we need it's
gonna be inside their material community
icon from the react method vector icon I
threw you out show you this icon so you
should be able to find it now and I'm
gonna put that here this one we're going
to add a size of three then I have a
name of Facebook box you're gonna have a
color of the blue of the one we have
here we can create variable and use it
everywhere it's gonna be easier but for
now we're gonna go like that
like I say we get an error and the error
is the same as I show you last time but
I'll add that fun the material committee
the ACE package so if you remember all -
and all that if by doing this thing here
I'm gonna again paste that in there come
in the description I really hope they're
gonna fix that when they're gonna fix it
we're gonna update every force I'm gonna
click enter here and just reload now you
see we get continue with Facebook so now
what we need to do is starting this
button right there
we're gonna call that f b bt heavy
logging
BTM or logging Facebook button facebook
login button like that this one first
thing we already know is we need a fixed
direction of row just to get both
element next to each other okay now what
we're going to also do is this one who's
going to put em I off like the other one
also have like 45 now if you
nothing changed but you have a 45 and
now here I'm gonna say a line
item sent are just to align this text
with the country with Facebook okay okay
I'm gonna leave this city it's going to
be a bit better so now I'm gonna text
I'm gonna design the text also or
facebook login button I'm going to say
facebook login button tag I'm going to
see gonna have a color of like I've done
this one
but also I want em to add the human that
care allows the object and system where
that's any board
and now I'm going to see I want this
stuff here to emerging left of 1001 that
takes to get the 10 of this facebook
icon and now I can put that right here
yeah okay actually see I get this like
that but now I would like this text to
be like what I hear at the top here but
all we can do this gonna be pretty
simple it's funny because the section we
say go in the media okay fiction I'm
gonna cut another one if it's called
section button and the only thing I'm
gonna do it's what I want to change from
this one I'm going to just change it
justify content to be at the Plextor you
know they take they're gonna be right
there if you want to add two text
together to start you just wrap this
thing in an array and you sister that
section button like that but on
chrissakes
I'm gonna get that right here okay
perfect so now what we need to left to
do
it's this one right there so what we're
gonna do
it's inside here we're going to add
another view inside this thing of their
section by this one you're going to have
a name or star no add-on rapper
this one here we're going to have an eye
of 50 and you're going to also take the
full width of the parent so that means
the the contain here and they take 100
pixel I wanna do friction
okay so now this one can have also a
border color or the ECC's
well sure I was again it but is e ec ec
ec Panda hold on
and I want that only at the top for
border the width of work
now we're gonna see them right there
maybe for you it's our tour Red Sea
where Iiro okay another thing happening
it's look here my texts to touch this
adder I done don't want that so what I
mean it's I need to just short short a
bit this section would only all the
space of their section button we have
great here we can just hit play on 0.7
so this section gonna take 70% so the
one you're going to take all the other
speed yeah so now we get some speed in
redditor okay now there's no icon
wrapper we need to add here a text of
down and I can sign up like that
okay so now first thing we don't want
the text in the middle justified on same
center a line-item center like that now
we have it like this after that I want
that style of the text area to be like
I've ear so if you remember this style
that fall out but so now we have the
same takes of this one but the thing is
that sign up here is supposed to be
about them so we're going to be the same
as what we've done the other one for
touchable
I'll put the text here if you remember
here you're gonna need to put feedback
of opacity and now for the assign of
text we just say sty
BTN text to get the same with this one
and all see but now what we have to do
it just this no icon wrapper here when I
need to have the Flex direction or row
that's it so now we have what we need we
have the two input when we can type we
have the log inning
we have they get ill sending cause me
with Facebook in blah blah blah again
the codes going to be in the description
order link we need the linear radial and
how to find the font the font I hope you
have enjoyed this little design course
and for those who ask for the kibo we
don't really need because it's at the
top so you see if you want to open a key
ball you do comment
so yeah so we can maybe manage that in
the future the login but at least for
now it's okay so the next one we're
gonna add this famous Facebook SDK well
now when we're gonna click on that
that's gonna open the Facebook
