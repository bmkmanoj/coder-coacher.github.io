you know if you want is that seven what
are we going to do some design with the
mobile side yeah so we can adjourn the
realities part what you think the right
ear is going to be what we're going to
finish but I hope you're going to put
your name and you over there so but this
is what are we going to finish or
finally we can have kind of this design
where that's going to be on the list so
I want to do this right now here we tell
the react navigation and stuff like that
just to focus of all I do my designing I
don't say I'm an expert about that but I
think I can figure out pretty much any
kind of design and stuff like that and
I'm going to just told you some of the
tip I do so time to join off the code so
first thing open your terminal oops
maybe not in the root Jam on the mobile
side like that oak and dealt with yours
and take the time then I use a visual
studio code go back here run ESP start
so for this one you're going to need to
have watch the video number six to have
set up everything about exponent of like
that so what we're gonna do so here we
run Expo when everything is working I'm
going to run ESP iOS to run the iOS
simulator I'm going to work on the
signature of iOS because for me the
Android just take so much CPU and I
don't know why I'm going to make use of
the iOS one so perfect so we're going to
set up some of the stuff so finally
we're gonna have no data is going to be
all take that off for now but we're
going to be good with that I'm going to
put that here I'm going to keep this
warm small like better just to keep in
mind what we're gonna build for that I'm
gonna make here this as me go like that
and I'm gonna up my son sales a bit
because I get asked about that and I'm
gonna do PT perfect so
this is what you're supposed to see yeah
that's crazy we have to build an ass on
that yeah so here what we going to do
it's we going to do we're going to set
up the card so finally what we're going
to first do is we're going to build one
single code at a time so we're going to
create an own screen we're going to be
like all the screen about there so it's
going to be for the react navigation
we're going to call that screen and
route like we did in the in reaction
normally it's and what we're going to do
after that it's we're going to create
we're going to create air from the lake
one single component at the time just
one when the one is done after that you
just copy and pasting and we're going to
use a scroll view for that so we're
gonna jump the code so here as my
simulator right there so first thing I'm
going to run which I'm going to create
here a folder called screen that many
screens will be on that put s here I'm
going to create our own screen so that's
going to be the first screen I'm going
to import reacting the component right
there I'm going to import card company
be sure you have a native here I'm gonna
do what I always do for starting I'm
going to do con root equals Kyle that
view or we can add a view and after that
I'm gonna run here with the component
because we are called home screen in
this one I'm going to run root for now
and that's good of everything wrong
yeah like that sorry this I'm going to
create just one hour one quick equal
type text then you're going to see why
in a moment I'm going to just say T and
I'm going to ello my home screen and now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
jump to my other GS I'm going to replace
welcome here to be home screen because I
want to see this home screen at attack
at one screen SRECs creating that home
screen and I'm going to replace welcome
and I'm going to put home screen so now
if that work I'm supposed to see hello
right there at the top and I see right
there so you maybe don't see it but is
there right there so now what we gonna
do it's first thing I'm going to create
a component I'm going to fit inside a
component folder I'm going to ask
I'll feed cork why created as a
component as a holder because the feed
card is going to be the main component
of the import from this folder but
you're going to have many children over
so what I mean by children is as you can
see in the code here I'm going to add a
header would take the other toe and all
the meta stuff about the user I'm going
to add the content with the tech stuff
and I'm going to have the bottom in here
where it's going to be all about like
the button and Mel about the statistic
about this tweak so here this one's
going to be pretty simple so I'm going
to import only react EMR right there I'm
going to run imports I'll confirm that
if here and after that what I'm going to
do is I'm going to create my function
called cheap card so maybe a bit less
function is going to return a component
here and I'm going to export this Odom
at the bottom or I do this right now is
because I always forget this is yeah
noob so you now after that I can I'm
gonna create the route like I always
call you if I always use the route just
totally need this that's got to be the
top of everything
so the route of this component and I'm
going to just put I think I know it's
going to be mean out of 100 so it's
going to be pixel so 100 pixel I this is
what I want and I'm going to just stick
on out background color and I'm going to
say red I like to work with red it so
much easy and I'm going to say work like
that I'm going to say it's going to came
as one because of ESL I'm going to jump
to my own screen I'm going to import the
free car from the dot slash component
slash guitar oh no oh yeah I remember I
need to go back one more and now I'm
going to put the chit's all right there
I'm going to tell you can remove this
piece and now I can run it so I want to
design this thing perfect we exercise at
Lee now what I'm going to do just for
this one I'm gonna say flex up one of my
room
and I'm going to show you I'm going to
show you something if I sit background
color yes this course is about relative
to a so for the designing poll I want to
give you the most stuff I can know so I
always do I try to share like my kind of
knowledge so I hope that these are going
to love this one if you don't like it I
can put that at one point five and just
go on so here you says put background
color yellow but I don't feel right
because this background color red is
there so we have the red the elements at
the top of it so here now I can click
this I see flex one now what can add
them is now I'm going to take everything
I'm going to take all the space because
I don't have a door parent I don't have
other parent I'm going to take the Flex
one of everything add around me so like
you finally the parents going to be
almost the screen so now I have this so
now if I see justify contain centaur now
look at the what can happen
by doing this like it says a box justify
contain Center mean I want to add it as
a center in my thing it's a y-axis like
from the top to the bottom align ICM in
this direction with color right now it's
going to be from left to right so it's
going to be Center from the left to
right so if I show you a nice example
with of example 50 I'm going to add a
pretty weird rectangle like that now if
I see a line I can Center
you
look here right in the middle this is a
de middle at the top middle ear middle
ear middle ear if not I'm going to mask
your egg native whiner but I mean it's
supposed to be at the center yes right
there so as you can see that line Center
going to Center from the X so from the
left to the right and the justify
contain but the thing is because this is
in flex direction colon because if I
change the sex direction and I put that
as a row like that nothing going to
change for now I'm going to keep it down
but now if I see a line item flex torque
look what's going at them
now the flexor you see now the a line
item the term from the top to the bottom
is not coming anymore from the left to
the right because remember if I do this
here I'll remove that I'm going to get
that right there so you see this is the
row so the rooming now we can add
current from the left to the right and
let's go down from the top to the bottom
and all the justify content as you I'm
sure you know that going to be now the
other way so for any when you do row
it's going to inverse everything this is
really important to know and I want you
to know that because I want you to be
smarter than me so it's gonna be and
this is I mean I just hope so here now
what happened here
oh I'd maybe know why it because you
have a will and I need to change it
perfect so now we're good so as you can
see I like to work with big colors it's
much more easy for a I'm going to click
a whip yagna see it I think 22 we have
percentage so now one of the present
perfect we have it after that I'm going
to say I want to wear them some shadow
colors so I want to have some shadow at
the bottom in everything so I'm going to
show you or you can do shadow color with
with stag governor so I'm gonna special
color I want my shadow color to be equal
to my team colors on my team I have with
the secondary color so don't worry so
maybe you asked what is that this
constant came from here this container
so I'm going to add this one on the
reason why I got that remember this is
what I show you in the last city that
can provide I put the team color right
there remember that now I have my shadow
color but we don't see it first thing
I'm gonna maybe remove the yellow
they're going to be easier but now we
have no shadow because now we just set
this color we don't see like how much we
want so for that we're going to need
shadow offset
so now what I'm going to put is I'm
going to put 2-0 page and toothpick so
by doing this I'm going to have no whip
but I'm gonna have an eye of 2px and
after that I'm going to say shadow radio
and I'm going to sell one to other
videos of - so like Erie's as you can
see I save on everything because I want
you to see the change but right now we
don't have enough and why because after
that I need to have shadow opacity and
I'm going to say for this one zero point
wise thing
and now maybe now I think I'm going to
put that as a white maybe gonna looks
more
now you see
I am sorry if you cannot see cuz of the
screen but I cannot move more so if you
can zoom here but you can sing I'll add
the shadow right there so the shadow
that I make the demarcation for us I'm
going to keep it red for now because
it's going to make my life easier now
add this thing after that what are we
going to do is I'm going to put I'm
going to create another component where
I'm going to put my headers so I want my
headers to take this place here so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to create
another component here called feed card
so what I do is I always keep the first
term and I'm going to say here others
that's yeah so this others here are
going to be pretty simple gonna be like
going to be kind of just a rectangle
with some eliminated so here we can have
the style here after that what I'm going
to do is I'm going to create again my
function feed card headers return now
I'm going to get my route and I'm going
to don't forget to it's called d4 at the
bottom that one root equals that view
like that
and now I'm going to change it so a what
I'm going to send how I know the ID I
want it to be 50 like direction and I'm
going to put broke and why because like
I told you right now we ask from the top
to the bottom this is the direction we
have its color but now what I want it
because if you look here as one thing
here one thing you and have another
component here like add three layers
I like thing about like as a three
rectangle so I have one rectangular here
add another one here and I have another
one ear right there and this rectangle
at two rectangle now I have one written
earlier and so make one here and the
other one is the bottom one right there
so now if we draw near what I'm going to
speak to is I'm going to say a line item
center because on the a line item you're
going to give us from the top to the
bottom as a to be center
not anymore from the left to the right
I'm going to put the root here just for
letting know us with where I am with
that I'm going to put famous background
color yellow and now here I'm going to
take my feedback as you can see what I
always do is I put my library at the top
and I what I do here it's going to be
equal to my library so I always do a
space between mine and other people
library so now
to change my route to be not anymore
sells clothes and now I'm going to take
these three sword hitters and now look
at Adam boom as my header now I have or
need their space at the top this is what
I want so this is our word as my feet
are there is now perfect now I'm going
to just put the size for my my contain
so my content is going to be where we
going to put the text so this one again
what we're going to make use of it of it
it's going to be now this one is going
to be much easy because we're going to
make use of flex so we're going to give
it a click sighs another view yeah I'm
going to select one background color I
think we are time to do some blue
there's going to be much more easy for
us to see I'm going to put a curtain
thing right there now because I put flex
one what happens I take everything out I
take all the sides I can get have some
size area as concise here and take
everything I I don't know how much size
the other one I just take everything
give me some stuff it's a it's you I
take everything I don't take just the
alt I take everything so now we have the
size but now here the contain is
supposed to take some amount of place
here I want to add another one for this
one the button so that's what we're
going to join now we're going to create
another component don't worry they say
the last one for today and I'm going to
call this one feed Cart button you see
um I find a good title so it is going to
be my style and now here what I'm gonna
do if I'm gonna create my my function so
feed card
and I'm going to export the spook feed
cause Barton okay now here what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create my
route famous route and now this well
what I'm going to do is because I know
my size I'm going to say i wanna i of 40
I know I want him to be bigger than 40
I'm going to say item 14 I'm going to
take this one I think which color I can
take I'm going to take things I think
think that's going to get good work
things if I can type it return route
bang now know yeah I'm sure you'll know
it I didn't put it shift command B
should control D for Windows I can take
it
come indeed take Bo boom change it came
here shift command D tax change it fit
call button
so yeah just add a video I put my
shortcuts if you want to know and now
look what at them mmm
so what happening like I told you it's
gonna take all despite so it I take 50
I take 40 and now here when it takes
thing they take 90 because we have 180
so 50-40-90 - so 180 minus 90 is the app
so air now it's going to be what we're
going to put the container which we're
going to put that the the button and the
other one's going to be about taking all
the metadata about the user so what I
think we can do for now is because now
it has pretty lame as a website light as
an application I'm going to just put the
text it would be pretty easy it's going
to be really easy
so what we going to do is right there
what I'm going to make let's not add my
content container I'm going to quit my
text here I'm going to be called contain
card contain equal famous tile that
takes yeah like that bang I'm going to
see I want that to add a font size of 40
so now I'm going to just put that
because I want to to area so I'm going
to delete this one I'm going to be
created
and now what I'm going to do it I'm
going to put this one and now I'm going
to put a variable text where I'm going
to create it right there
why because I'm going to pass this for
your book so why not create it it's
going to be easier for later I'm going
to put here some magic be really like
that boom what I did at type Lauren I
click tab and now I get this or to
complete stuff but man this is not a
tweet it's too long
so what I'm going to do whenever you
move some stuff I can and I think maybe
some more that's better
things that I'm going to pass it and now
inside the beautiful blue color we asked
the text as we want so now do we did
what we want hmm
here oh we have some stuff here you see
I have some padding I'm going to need to
put and I'm going to need to add some
padding to from the top and compelling
too and I need to get to the right to
make sure then we get that and as you
can see I align the text from the left
so we're going to start for this one so
we're going to text-align:left just to
make sure that I'm gonna maybe remove
these books color here this one's going
to be background color I'm going to make
it to be cool to my famous white colors
but I have it in my team up now if I say
so
as my pet perfect now I'm going to add
some here from weight because my dick is
really small so I'm going to add Conn
weight and I'm going to put 500 I do
this
perfect a bit better so now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to just put a
color to for this pack so that's going
to be equal to the cert on Dara colors
may be a bit grayish
yeah like that and I'm going to put some
padding on this container and it's a
padding and the beauty of side component
is I can put all my padding as like I do
with the where I can do it in line so
yeah I'm gonna save 10 P and as we put
20 20 P 10 P and I'm going to see zero
base so what does that mean if top 10
right 20
top ten right 20 button 10 give on the
left
ding yeah so now that this is what I
want mean so now here what happening is
I say yeah I'm going to add maybe some
from the left now you can see I just put
so yeah top right button left so I put
some padding here to make sure them that
don't touch from from from the edge so
now I hope you understand here why you
details because now when I'm going to
pass I'm going to see text I'm going to
delete this one in this thing gonna
still work this is all I like to work so
now I have my beautiful Twitter course
view now it's time to join I think we're
gonna join the others we're gonna make
the user so here you can see have an
container here and there's another one
here and I have another one for the
username so this is so that's going to
be almost like that the most complicated
one Biscay complicated pigtail so what
are we going to do is we're going to
create finally the the the box for get
the two elements open later on I'm going
to work so I'm going to have one box
here and I'm going to have like my two
box here and I'm going to just manage it
to make a way like I'm going to add a
big box here and I'm going to break them
apart I'm going to see that in a second
so I'm going to clean my avatar so I'm
going to see them I'm going to see
avatar container going to be equal to a
style I'm going to put up view click
click one and I think we have a color
yellow so what go with yellow is going
to be red then I'm going to put flex one
but I'm going to show you that we would
here like that ok
that and now if I do this what you think
and at them if I get because as I say
one no yeah you can se that's in a
moment I'm going to show you why so now
I'm here I have my stuff here perfect so
now I've not at all so now I'm going to
I'm going to clean my meta container so
yeah my Vuitton and I want to have my
meta so I'm gonna sit cons made that
container this one here this meta
container now
going to be equal to plus 1/2 and I'm
going to put a background color so now
maybe you asked okay why nothing here it
may be because I need to put something
called aligned cells and I'm going to
put stretch and now look at the data
because by default the flags here
because I have the thing inside we don't
going to take its full place so by
putting the a line cells here like going
to take like the place you can like
you're gonna stretch over so now here we
can manage here so like I told you I
want to cut here there so with my my
mathematics skill I'm gonna say 0.2 is
going to be perfect and yes it's perfect
so this is what we want after inside
this battle here what I'm going to say
I'm going to say a line I am cantar and
justify contain center and why that
because I want one the things going to
be inside I want them to get the center
and this is where we're going to create
the avatar a long time to jump up at all
cones add an hour 30 quote West I and
now something we didn't see image image
yeah like that now we can tie this thing
I'm going to sit at i/o 40 with of 40
border radius because I want that to be
at the circle good tip it by the way 40
divided by the the ALF
going to be 20 but now because I don't
want to always change the size both
because if I want to change the size ear
like example I want to change that to 50
I'm going to need to change that to 25
we're going to do chump stop here we're
going to stick on our our size right now
going to code for e curve avid or radius
going to be to code our our side -
divided by 2
now I'm going to change this 50 and I'm
going to change that to be a variable
Avalos eyes
I'm going to change border-radius could
be equal at all ready so now I can use
it so now you can take this arrow and
I'm going to put that right there a
little container I'm going to put that
here now I I'm not sure but I think
that's gonna crash or nothing you have
nothing because I'm going to put a
picture for that and I'm going to put my
famous picture of my Twitter so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to jump T
Twitter I can go to Chrome I'm going to
go to Twitter so you should do this I
hope I did you a tutor so go there
just take your photo to copy image area
after that you can close it go back here
go to content we export current page add
account for now put your image right
there
close this page
due to your other ear import at the top
from the dot util that content import
straight avatar due to the bottom and
now here put that as a source you are I
know I got a talk that and now if I save
I get my face right there I hope that's
going to be your face I mean yeah I mean
don't take mine
so here and now what I can do I'm going
to remove some color now time to remove
the Hylian see that's going to be good
I'm going to remove this background
color yellow here from the root of the
others and I'm going to remove the red
and now look at this if that work boom
we have that right there but the thing I
think I've done it I don't want I don't
want this to like it too
I don't want that to be at the center
one that would be at the same level so
what I think I need to do is I'm going
to join their and the thing is a line
item as you remember that line item can
turn make me at the center so if I
remove that by the phone going be at the
left I'm going to be at the side here
now what I can do is put a some padding
left and I'm going to put five like that
and now I'm going to get the same size
from here for a fact so this one is done
so here are because it's white on white
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
go to the home screen and I'm going to
change it by going all of this I'm going
to say path to f-22
that's going to be the null
we can see I think yeah hope you enjoyed
this episode
I enjoy making this so this one like
like that yeah so now that make more
sense we have this thing so now time to
do the meta a container air so now we
have done this for now time to do the
other port where are we going to ask the
user full name here and after that we
can add the username with the this time
and we're going to have here that they
add the date so we're going to tell them
the meta a container here and now what
we need to do in inside like the meta
container I tell you it's now we can add
a touch so panini this is always support
that or sorry about that now we have
this thing here now what I want is how
I'm going to support this two thing in
two flex one so we're going to take both
all the same side like that so that's
going to take fifty fifty each and after
that this one we're going to add the
other one with them so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to drum here and I'm
going to say a current meta talk
container here I'm going to say a minute
up container and I'm going to take a sex
of one and I'm going to put a background
color of paint and just for seeing it
I'm going to put a line self stretch I'm
going to put that right inside that's
going to close it
yeah so now I take everything x1 take
everything so just for being sure not
the backup at the background we're going
to see yellow yeah so now I take
everything because it's flex one so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a mess tap button I'm going to
just take all that I'm going to show you
shift command B I don't like type so but
then I'm going to come back for like
that but this one's going to be 0.8
sorry about that
don't go to take the same place and this
one is going to be real like that and
now if I put that right there
now the this one going to take point
eight and the method stop going to take
all the other place cannot have my stuff
so what I can do now is I am going to
create one component commit attack
because they the the detection they're
always almost been the same so Cornett
method text so we about that equals PI
the text and now this one I'm going to
put a font side or fourteen phone weight
of 600 now I'm going to see color or
props prop the theme that the light
great this is another color I've put you
in the storage kit and all the meta text
what I'm going to do
it's that's going to be the text where
we're going to start to put the stuff
for the username and the base so that's
going to be this text and this text is
the same so this is the light gray here
so I'm going to click that because I
with that now I can make use of this dot
it's here inside the method button now I
can still make a button here close
I'm going to put the coordinate X and so
now I'm gonna sit one day ago now I'm
going to say I'm going to look my
wholesome website application now you
see I have one day ago right there and
after that what I can do is I'm going to
invite my meta top container now if I'm
going to have two thing I'm going to
have to text so I'm going to add the
meta tag
this one going to be to my username I'm
going to say put your plea yeah that's
going to be mine like that now the
method takes kinetic here but now
because why because I need to put
another text because the full name is
not the same text bigger it's darker too
so here's I'm going to submit a cool
name
well Tyler text you see I I make it them
verbose like I know there's going to be
text and this program is going to be
like the full name of the user so it's
much more easy for me so on size of 16
some way I'm going to say bold and I'm
gonna say color equal to crops that prop
that theme that secondary and now the
metaphor name is going to be right there
now I'm going to say my own name
and now in the top here when I pen what
did you say what I was to say but I we
are new dog so look here current by
default remember that now what we can do
jump on the top rack a container and now
we're going to change that to make Flex
direction root and all they're going to
take the place like that see now you
take left and right not anymore
top to bottom after that to what I want
to do is I want them to make them at
center now you touch at the top so I'm
going to align items and down
perfect and because I
nobody falls' gonna be that but I'm
gonna say flexor I want them to say why
they all right now but now you may be
yeah yeah man I want some move here like
I mean the touch boat so what you do
it's easy I mean it's so we go to the
mecca text here I'm going to add some
sign in line side I'm going to say
merging left and I'm going to click a
good fight
you see so now we have some space now
what I'm gonna do - it's now the meta
button here that's a turn right there
now what I want to add too is now I want
them to be aligned I am
sex star but now that I'm item flex
start going to stay there here now I
want em to be at the medial so what I'm
going to do jump in and I'm going to put
that
perfect so knowing that the media is on
the top and now we can remove the
awesome color we put now we can check
what we did and boom we did awesome job
and now this is the app right now
nothing big we have some variable at the
top and now we have the method takes in
here but now we can create variable here
because like I told you now I'm going to
need to change all that
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
say one username equal put your username
so I'm going to see without the xk8
right there so I'm going to replace that
to be username I'm going to take that
here and now because all that came from
the front end we're going to ask first
name equal to my first name the last
name equal to my last name and now what
I'm going to do here is I'm going to do
first name Facebook last name
and after that here I'm going to say
currents created at equal one day ago
this is all that going to came from the
back end good because we have done it
and now I'm going to count avatar equal
equals take avatar
like that perfect so now you're going to
be good to set up like I'm going to just
delete that I'm going to put like sanity
I'm going to take all this verse by
doing I'm going to put them here when
I'm going to die structuring this thing
so now we good after that if you want to
change the about our side change then
from them and now that's going to change
the size here but so what I mean
perfect we are almost done now we still
app to do the bottom and and after that
that's gonna they all going to be but a
button like we're not all going to be
able to kick them after that we just
make sure that they take like the Flex
one of each or here we're going to have
a big buck this is what we are in each
of them going to take flex one so we're
going to make sure they are all 23% ish
other set so now we're gonna jump on the
button here so here what we're going to
make use it's a library I've created
with the some of the guys where I'm
working right now it's a library cow
happens touchable so you need to install
that by doing this so a here happen
float touchable is that the Twitter tag
all you can do to put like you know you
call that like you company name in front
of your library so by doing this what is
this touchable so I'm going to see that
at the moment but now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to show you something
crazy Expo it's awesome I always told
you export here had access to this Expo
vector icon so by default expo came with
all this vector icon so this is finally
the vector icon library and now here I
need to search some awesome icon to make
the stuff so first thing I'm going to
search for the bubble so we're going to
make use of this I'm going to make use
so here we have a bubble swiping this
that's going to be a simple line like
cutting going to be this one yes so I
pick this one so this is the one I take
to make this beautiful ear and this is
all you can service research here you
get the name and you're going to see
that in at moment sorry about that I
think I jumped too far but you you get
the point
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going
to create I have my root of my stuff but
I'm what I'm going to do is I'm going to
feel like the button but for now that's
going to be a view so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to fit curve button
button or maybe just button let me
styler to you so now they gonna be
select that one and background color or
sweat now if I do route here let's put
the button here now what can I tell it's
going to be already because take all the
paper now if I put three I have a good
sub down they all gonna stay real
because we have no space what you mean
you see like what happens have three
sides now just for tuning you maybe if I
do merging left of one maybe that can be
able to see it yeah maybe not you get
the point so now have three button so
now what I want inside the bottom two I
want to first thing to make the route be
click Direction row because the button
go from the left to the right but that
after that I want my button to have the
icon plus the text so I'm going to
create the Ted I'm going to say crunk
button text called side that tech here
and now I'm going to put them right
there I'm going to delete one put one
button wanna sit magic ready you ready
some magic with a three take all should
come and be it can copy/paste that like
that I'm going to remember
now all of them asked three so as you
can see here I take now at 92 percent 90
percent and nitrogen yourself so now I'm
going to change the text right now
because I can do this easy games on here
my side yeah look good this is not what
I want what I'm going to do is I'm going
to jump back to my button right here and
I'm going to fit from size of 14 I'm
going to want a phone wait I got a 500
and I'm going to set color of crops spec
team that light gray now if I do this
they all going to be the color I want
and yeah perfect now I want to came with
some icon I'm going to import here from
xqo bekstaarr vector Wow
I don't get that to complete because the
number drill don't see it but we added
by default she want to add the
autocomplete you can just employ so I am
going to import you came here like that
go here copy paste this thing through
there
take you here that's it so that this
that's gonna be there the first layer so
I'm going to join me and I'm going to
sit here simple line icon like that I am
going to sell close this and all you
work with icon by tolling them the name
I'm going to simple but once I step over
like that what's gonna happen now at the
same another ear but now as you can see
we go from the top to the bottom and
this is really small so I'm going to put
all we do the site so what I'm going to
assist I'm going to put this eye here
and because I'm going to put the size
here I'm going to see 20 and I'm going
to put the color and now I'm going to
put I'm going to need to import my
famous colors that then it came from my
util content go there colors you will go
there color that like brick and now if I
do this I get the good side is that
finished by loading
yeah I get the good size now I'm going
to design the button because I can do
this right now add one so I'm going to
say I want that to affect direction of
road I'm going to save on a bridge place
so now you're going to see that perfect
so now I have that like that my plan is
to have this like this we are really far
away from you
so what we can do is I'm going to say a
line item and turns out the going to be
the same and I am from the top to the
bottom so they have the same clay after
that I'm going to sit justify contain
pace around what is that look at that
quite good Apple
boom they take the most space they can
so you know that finish like like ear so
they take like this space ear they
taking idea the same space like they
want to take some space around sing
about this that's a good thing now I'm
going to subside in horizontal so
padding from left padding left and right
on the c2 DPA
and
they get closer and I'm maybe going to
see two
yeah perfect thing we do yeah so now we
have that for now I can put the other
icon so the certain icon here is this
one so if the retweet and I think we can
get this one'll by tacking between and
that's going to be the empty pool one
here take the empty boat copy paste the
name go there a coma and people go there
put empty pole name going to be equal to
v3 and now the color is going to get
some colors so now the sides going to be
the same I don't want to change all them
after that let's see what are we going
to do we're going to create a final
variable so now I have the retreat and
now I just need to take the what is the
last one earth Cramer's earth and I
think I'm going to take again the
entacle one right there I'm going to
take the both ears open agree when it's
not like this one and when it's like
this one so I'm going to take again
those people and I'm going to take earth
outline so what I'm going to do I'm
going to do shift command D change this
one and I'm going to take this one right
there by doing option and down with Max
and now have the earth right there
but now I think it's full but now we're
going to need to make like a volleyball
when we click but now when I click on
come down you don't do the thing why
it's because they are view so what I can
do with with that react I'll comp an
attack and input my touchable right
there now I'm going to wrap my button
I'm going to put the touchable so now
you're going to wrap my touchable ever
so this is the button for the one we
know where a native is a button same
button but now what I can do yeah I'm
going to see the feedbacks and I want
them to add the opacity because I'm bad
that's going to be a string of laxity
so now by doing this I'm going to
refresh and now looks great without them
now I can cook them
see now I can click them so now let's
protect that they become better so now
we're going to put some variable Khan
favorite Khan going to be equal to three
I'm gonna stick Khan yeah this one is
going to be like that Khan's after them
the second is favorite so there's going
to be the way if it's hours are not
going to be false so what I'm going to
do all this number is going to be cool -
pirate calm and now I'm going to make a
kind of kind of I know what the earth is
the earth and then I'm going to make
kind of a book not a billion bytes
ternary operator air what I mean it if
is have a real I want the color to be
real if not I want the color to be color
like me
so now it's not a red coat it like that
if I make it have a real going to be red
so this is react we just do some kind of
boolean and the boolean but ternary so
what do you say if valeria read now
library okay and now what I can create
it so I can icon size and I'm going to
see 20 and I'm going to just say ear
every place I put 20 icon side
just like that perfect so now we've done
this part done it's done we have almost
done the only thing I told you it's
we're gonna like screw you with
everything so what we're going to do is
we're going to just jump back after that
inside the own screen component and
inside this one what we gonna do is
we're going to just create finally the
school view and put the element on it
that's it so from here we're going to
click current list equal style that's
crew view I'm going to put your a school
you like that
the others going to be Delhi as I say
second stroke and do stuff like that or
I can copy-paste this thing like as many
r1 and now what I'm going to do here I'm
going to add some padding top fine I'm
going to need that in the future you
know I can remove the justify contain
because I don't need that anymore
and now if I came with that now this is
all my stuff but no I think I forget
something maybe to put some space
between Pekar because right now they
have no space between them so they are
just like we just touch each other so
all we can do this is by going on Fitz
are and I know when I forget here forget
to put the siding right there I'm going
to put a padding of seven eight you're
going to go everywhere so now I can
remove the zero paste here I'm going to
see why ending that so the seventy going
to pick the wrong thing everything comes
around now I'm going to go to the others
and removing the padding left of the
avatar
so this is what I forget but now I have
no space not done this is not done
almost almost air merging vertical so
mean top and bottom or equal and I'm
going to say how good five now I think
I'm going to good I'm going to be good
and now look at that we have the list
right there for now screw you is when
you're gonna change that don't worry
this is that third photon I mean I think
that was a long video hope you enjoyed
sorry if that was too long just like I
want to done this part of the design
because after that we can give some gap
you work out so the next door is going
to be grass ql cause of this there's
going to be real data coming from the
database will arise just a term because
we're going to use mark so I hope you
