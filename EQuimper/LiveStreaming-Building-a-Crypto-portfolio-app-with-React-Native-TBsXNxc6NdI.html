you can see I just get : that's get
change so you don't get call anymore
from here and the thing I like about
that it's if this thing changed like by
doing the refreshing there's three cows
gonna be we call in from the beginning
of that from here so when I'm gonna get
back to my wallet from here now the
value is going to be perfect now do this
thing can really equal 100 so 45 65 85
and air okay once I just receive an
email so I say 85 90 to 95 yeah must be
close and now if I go there if I go
there but I just wait good I refer these
things it's pretty good I mean the thing
I've done it's here when I kill a
selector I quit that as a function like
that this is what I seen the dogs and
now you will need to clean up a function
make Maps state shrubs like that so this
thing and keep going to finally create
its own function who's gonna finally
keep its own cache so as you can see
it's pretty good I'm gonna just refresh
on tail no just wait this five-minute
caching from radius also what I've done
in the past day it's AB set up my AWS
icon for getting ready to receive the
staging version so if some of you want
to test the Bedouins I'm that's gonna be
out just let me know you can just eat me
on this card if you want to have the
email I mean if you want to just test
the application that
crazy I mean it's it's not like a
start-up it's just my own little
projects so what I can do after that and
I get that game here I'm gonna need to
manage to change again I can do this I
can get the game gonna be pretty simple
I think so
you see don't get me pill that's
perfect is really good for the turf here
just one sec okay you see so the five
minute i refresh my get bullet at
alcohol all get cow so now when I got
back here I get my change from here and
now I have all my my stuff that's
perfect so this thing more like I asked
for now what I'm gonna do is I want to
get my total total amount total percent
change and what I was supposed to get it
total price total amount plus total
price okay so total among my total moon
was just finally
the tournament please equal total tries
cattle price here okay I'm gonna almost
do the same so here that's gonna be left
total among change is gonna be a number
going to be equal to zero and now you're
I'm gonna almost do the same total I
won't change then a plus equal first
float and it is gonna be note that and
it's oh yeah
so here's going to be the person change
now first thing I need to get it I need
to get the total of one coin example
6,000 if I know he lose 7% I remove 7%
from the 6,000 and this is what you have
lost or exam policies where you have win
and also I think I get some weird boy
it's now there's gain here so era will
have gained 54% I think it's true
because neo have win more this is
something you check they get the game
here so each transaction here
not this total price here is the price
of right now okay and I can get cons
total price change we're going to equal
to first float transaction amount of
coin multiple by the price multiple by
the node dot person change divided by
100 I think is that I mean if you have a
thousand and we have wind 4% we are made
folded for
it's not good
reads like this thing I have the sum of
this thing
but there - 120 Wong
a mom of corn fight oh yeah I mean I
think I've read this thing if I don't
like it but here like you have for
Bitcoin
okay overall my transaction that's why
each of them yeah thing is that
yeah I see I'm on of con 5000 I'm enough
corn to wonder myself at 200 somewhere
right there
well I pay 31 but I say I change out 80%
so something is bad is inside my here
I mean I mean it's supposed to go this
way
total price change going to be equal
piece of this thing
6% 6% not 4,000 it's not since my math
must be bad again 686 multiple divided
by 100 six percent six percent 10
percent of oh maybe but the thing is no
Tolin
you
so so now here the doctor is price
change equal the amount of coin
total price change the equal to the
number of the multiple
I don't need to have this here because
this thing is small at one
I need to get all March age how much
each coin remove so how much each
transaction removal most legit it's just
one time
so what I need it to get the percent
change 24 percent the 24 hour okay so
the pride you know it's the inverse is
this percent change they were they were
my price
like that you see 0:59 it is 1/100
because this one is 5% it's 5%
so
you
for my planet to get fifty multiple by
the price get when you get change so for
example it's a thousand oh now it's
equal to I'm gonna suffice or five
thousand together and after after that
what I do is I get my total woods maybe
like six hundred four hundred and I did
and I remove at the 505 but the thing I
don't need to do this because I have the
gain here percent and I'm to them I'm so
down
sorry some email
at the present ear so why not just do
so this person is not good that's why
that's my problem right now that's what
is 52% not making sense
I mean I some each value but it's not
true
and this stuff is going to be pretty
yeah I think what I need to do it's
adding a total of what is the price now
like I have a total of as well as the
price for each coin yesterday and take
the difference between both and get that
as a person
you
you
hey Don yeah the team it's 1:1 a ki t 1
monarchy right there and fun
it's Menlo
92%
don't think so because the pass amount
was this value okay so we're gonna test
it by yourself and 9282 for a three zero
three two four eight three nine zero
okay
sure it's not oh I think it's gonna just
be 84 - my 82 for eight 390 equal it's
me and then Matt screwed on
dick release okay
so total % here it's gonna be called the
decrease so total amount - price - -
pass a month after that you take this
you divide the original number and you
do multiple by 100 by doing this six
point twenty eight percent we're gonna
test it so seven seven three three zero
that 84-82 four eight 3.90 equal okay
and now I need to divide this value by
8208 3.90 and multiple that by 100 and I
get 625 but it's a plus yeah that looks
great this is
and now
this
like that and now my value it's a
tournament chain
no it's not the game the total amount
change finally is the difference between
this boat value here
so this 5000 bucks is the difference in
the past 24 hour
the question is yes it's the past but
not that really rely about you portfolio
but I think if I want to do this I about
the portfolio I'm gonna need to use like
real more certain I like a DB and what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna need to save I
saved that amount right now and what I
do it's then I need to keep track yeah I
mean but for now looks okay then I check
out my phone
okay so I have C two hours I'm going to
show you the tour I just sing it's when
I have no data at all so I - ever right
now the first one is going to be ears
gonna be not a number
for the person change total percent
change here this is what I don't
understand
I mean
Plus too well
by doing this I think that's gonna
remove the another number
zero and zero
zero
if they're 0/0 we'll make the error
right there
okay now this thing looks good now you
see here okay this thing looks pretty
good
what I will do it's maybe if I have
nothing okay what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to search for the right side it's
a narrow empty okay so portfolio PI what
I can do here
it's I have two thing I can do I'm gonna
do a easy one so the certain one is
going to be designed empty pi
I can't it's gonna be
this is an image a boy is the either a
shave
you
maybe read this one
this is what I think ins art that court
order would be
oops
oh yes you can I'm gonna show you what
I've done here one sec take it just here
I don't I don't think I'm gonna need a
new machine but a shy shape and now I
can just say that this is for the state
I'm gonna show you what I've done it's
this thing
it's I create the selector as a function
like that a finale because it's clear as
a function I can use it as a factory by
doing the this kind of function make
state props so by doing this this
function gonna have its own own cache so
if I show you I'm gonna just remove some
console.log like example what I got
just look here first time get wallet
total among its cow that's perfect
when I click here so this color get
color cause of this one now when I'm
gonna get there you got a call again and
he called I get pie but now you see you
don't we get call anymore but now in for
example I opened this one and I say I'm
gonna buy this this thing is the thing I
don't understand why ok but now if I
click on Bitcoin I said bye to Bitcoin
now you see what I got and now you get
recall but now you don't gonna get
recall anymore
oh thank you yeah I mean it's something
they showing the dogs but now this so
now if I add another one we call 500
new 20
now you see the one who have the holding
we see the holding now I just this thing
here I'm gonna need to design this stuff
because I mean I don't want to reuse
this this one here I mean it's already
there so I can maybe show more
information and also one thing I want to
do even let me know what do you think
about that but I want maybe when I click
here and I get to the Bitcoin like page
like that example to be able to click
like I'm maybe gonna put here a little
icon information and you can click here
and you're gonna get information about
the Bitcoin example or like every coin
if I found on the web so I'm gonna get
like a summary of some of the coin and
also the thing I think I'm gonna like
the most
it's example when I'm gonna have my
candle graph oh it's not make yet what I
want to do it's what I'm gonna have a
number of change like example you see a
big a big red candle you can click on it
and I'm gonna show you like if I can
find some information or not like a news
because you know like the Bitcoin always
involve cause of the news so when you
see o wide a Bitcoin lose a thousand
today ear you click there and I can like
link this last to maybe I news I've
start to work on this little but I've
created with golang so so this is going
to be a good learning experience what do
you see now you don't get recall anymore
but now you get recalled ear because I
think that changed some value I know
0:44 oh yeah that's why you get recall
because of this but now if I click again
you see yeah
true and this is good I mean example for
me I want at the end to put like at the
top air like a slider from left to right
like we see on the kind of Twitter or
stuff like that when they want to
suggest you some application and I'm
gonna suggest that the biggest winner of
that the example I was like what do corn
market capsule by doing this you can
just maybe say oh why this one have went
so much and and maybe what I can show it
the slide are well you can see like the
biggest winner the Biggest Loser the
biggest train and that's gonna be a
swipe from left to right here so you see
when you get recompile like example ear
again recompile it's because this value
gets recalled because this value change
the airways who it's cash the same from
here you see it was 149 now now it's to
2019 so by doing this now I can get to
this point but now if I research
everything from right now I will touch
everything
now when I click on one oh it's not
working when I was thinking he was
working for this one you work for this
one
yeah
so what'd you think of this I think I'm
gonna quit for the day I need to wake up
at 4 a.m. tomorrow to one continuous um
client project and I need to go to the
gym before going to the bed oh I think
I've done it's not that much on the UI
stuff it just much more about that the
larger and you see if I click on the LTC
why change again that's maybe why ok I
will fetch everything not everything
it's at this number I click here ye R ok
here it's something that I need to check
again percent change this thing I'm
gonna need to really check
oh thank you have a good night bye
