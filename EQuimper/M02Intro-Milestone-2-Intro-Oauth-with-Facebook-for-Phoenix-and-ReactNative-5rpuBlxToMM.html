number two this is the introduction so
we're gonna talk about what we're gonna
build for this week
thank you all for the TAS coming inside
all the other video and the mice on one
I really appreciate it and let me know
again in the comments all you feel about
all this video and at least there you
learn so in this - sounds gonna be about
the authentication part and I'm planning
to do the OAuth part of that official in
this milestone going back to react
native doing all the stuff after that
adding feature to the application and
maybe come back with the username
password login because I find on the web
so many tutorial with Alexa about
building password an email notification
but I really never find one with the
Facebook but application or Google or
something like that so that's why I'm
gonna do that for now so for today not
today but in this milestone we're gonna
create a route login with Facebook why
use Facebook first thing Instagram means
bit about Facebook and this is the one
is doing inside really Instagram app and
I think Facebook it's pretty like use
and the other really nice is the key to
work with with react native so after
that we're gonna create an icon context
so like we did with photo in the post
context we're going to build another
context called icon it's gonna be
everything about the user and
information and stuff like this
Odessa fication and blah blah blah after
that we get a Facebook I set up a
Facebook application I don't know if you
know that but when you create attach an
application and you want to either out
with this book example you need to
create a an application inside Facebook
where you're gonna have your app ID and
secret and stuff like that so this way
Facebook know we'll do this where they
with their application so that we are
gonna write kind of a service inside the
server where we gonna finally be able to
lock the user and get the user
information we're gonna make use of an a
some library I'm going to show you
after that we're gonna create I'll get a
user unload so when a user but they're
looking if the user don't exist yet
we're gonna create it if he exists we're
gonna log it in we're gonna do the
logging part for the server with GWT I'm
gonna make use of gordium for that I
said that in the front-end we're gonna
add Facebook SDK to react native so this
is a way for you to open a Facebook
application right inside your mobile
phone where you can make the usual
logger just by clicking continue with
their phone so again think about the UX
year the user experience here when the
user click on Facebook blog open
Facebook just click consume that's it
you give what we need you're gonna give
us the user profile user email and stuff
like that and after that we're gonna be
able to log in reiative and say the GWT
token and asing storage before we go do
thing we're gonna make use is the
Facebook e^x for an exam so it's a
Facebook wrapper for the graph QL API
wrapper for LX it look at that
you do Facebook that me and you put your
access token get first name you're gonna
get your first name right there and
that's what I've seen that that was man
that blow mine pain it's squeezing after
that we're gonna make use of the react
native F Facebook SDK so this is the
epic a bill by Facebook team and this is
the share one so you see they have many
command it's always active really easy
to install again it's the only place is
not quite easy just on the enjoyed part
but we're gonna see that and finally the
way that's gonna work it's we're gonna
make use of logging manager and we're
gonna receive after that an access token
and that's it it's gonna be pretty
simple so I hope you have enjoyed a
first milestone how Oh gonna enjoy more
this second milestone and why not start
right now oh if you wanna have a good
week so far and we tell later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
