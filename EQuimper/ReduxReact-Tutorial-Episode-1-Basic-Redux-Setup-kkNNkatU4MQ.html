you're doing well today I want to show
you my way when I do react Redux app so
I just make a little tutorial yes it's
my first month so please don't don't use
me so why I want you to my way it's
because I build everything in module and
for me and for a lot of person I just
show them make much more sense that what
we see everywhere so so here you can see
a basic folder structure so I always
have a Content folder why I put on my
component who can you read be used in
other stuff like a button text field or
something like that after that add a
module folder in this module folder I
have another folder for each feature so
here example add a chat inside the chat
add a component tool door so inside this
one it's all the component who is below
this chat only and you can see our index
file co-workers for me it's much more
easy to just import from the folder then
import and I always add the name in chat
ever you can see in my chat I have a
view of this container rejection reducer
only side this one either index GS ear
the index GS for the module and you're
gonna understand everything later you
just say I just want you to other a
white plan right now inside my redux
folder add the reducer folder because I
always use three main reducer one is out
one is domain and one is UI out is for
user domain all everything about API
fetching and UI it's like a sidebar and
this kind of stuff and you can see I
again use index so yes you can see
either reduced or a reducer a yes in the
redox you can use much more much more
than one time the combined we do sir and
my store in my reduce
holder other route GS file for all the
rooms in an ad GS for the layout why do
this more easy to add a new feature you
just need to add a new folder and his
own view container action reducer after
that is more easy to follow because
everything is inside this unfold or so
in this trail we're gonna use promises
for API featuring and I'm gonna show you
how to debug with the dev tool so what
we're gonna build it's yeah I know it's
a to-do list but make other features
just for add stuff for your learning so
we're gonna have an authentication we're
gonna have categories so it's more like
I wonder release clone app so for the
CSS framework we're gonna use material
you are we're gonna have a feed in user
can like list of Toulouse and for the
backend I'm gonna use Express and build
simple API so now what we're gonna do
today first thing we're gonna install
create react app so what did we do you
just came here to get on Facebook
incubator create react app here you can
see they show you all to install that
just do npm install globally with create
react app after that the only thing you
need to do is create react app and the
name of your app see the inside this one
and npm start that's it no need to set
up web pack anything else so here inside
my i just create a our a new one but i
just cleaned the R in with me that's why
I put that so here first thing we can do
it's in p.m. star I'm gonna see it open
for me my local owed 3000 so if your ear
so everything go well with the
installation after that
I want you to install dev tool so if
you're using Google Chrome I hope so
go in your extension so Chrome Web Store
you can install react so just came here
inside the first one so you you need
this one and you need the redox one just
here so just click install that's
nothing more to do so here first thing
we're gonna install is the redox border
play so come on in the terminal I'm
gonna open another tab so yes I'm using
yarn so you own it's like NPM it's a
package manager but much much more fast
so what all what I do if you continue to
use NPM just do NPM install safe but for
me
yarn only need add so yarn add three
dogs react Redux this is for connect
redux which we act that's it because yes
you can use redox with angular you can
use with ember so they have built a
package for help connect react and redux
so we're gonna install this one we're
gonna need just for this one we're gonna
install this I stirred up so you can see
yarn is really really fast the first
time is is longer because you need to
create a log file so so you can see so
we're gonna install react wrote r2 and
install react router redux
so react Rutter is just a quien rather
and react relative Redux
made just more sense to work with the
state and sign it around and for the the
dev dependencies so in yarn you just do
ad - - the F for you in if you use npm
install you can do in PM install - be
like that
so yarn and they have Redux
ruger so what is ridic schoolgirl
it's just a tool for help debugging he
is save a lot of time you just like put
all your reducer action inside a log so
you can see everything in your console
load so first thing in your source file
so a new source file the first thing
we're gonna do it's between another
folder called widows in this one it's
everything about the minimal below plate
of Redux the store and the reduced or
that's it so inside this one I'm gonna
create a file called store that GS here
we're going to import compose an import
three store and apply middle word need
from widows after that here we're gonna
need because we want plug react router
redux so what you need you need to have
access to the browser is Sarah coming
from react router so we need to import
browser history from react router after
that from react rotor redux we need to
import sing history whipped store from
react router Redux like that here the
last package we just install the logger
so we just import logger from redux
blogger like this
and here we're gonna import route
reducer from reduce or who is a folder
but yes I know we didn't make it right
now but this is just we're gonna make
that right after here what I always do
is I create a an era called middleware
middleware and here I put on my
middleware so logger we need to call him
so that's why we need the pin taxi so
why I do this is because if I want to
add another middleware I just need to
come here and add that right here so
that I create answer who is compose
compose you take apply middleware coming
from redux right here and it take so I'm
gonna use es6 spread operator so I
spread my middleware I rewrite in a time
middle work here it's a line here what
I'm gonna do here it's a line for using
the Redux dev tool you just install with
Google Chrome so what you do so you just
see if you use the extension if you use
the Redux dev tool coming from Google
Chrome so if it detect you're gonna just
start it like that and yeah this one
it's a you don't really need to
understand what happen here I mean yes
you need to understand but this is not
something you're gonna reuse another
place in the project so here after that
we're gonna create the store so here
what I do it's create constant store
will take create store and in this one
you take tweeting you take first thing
you take the reducer you take after that
initial state for an out gonna be an
empty object and you're gonna take ear
of my answer so it's everything about
dev tool and middle
that's it here we're gonna create
accounts history this is what we're
going to use a new yak rudder so for the
one who just use react righto before
it's we just built the eastery but now
we're gonna sing history with react
rotor Redux
in the store so here look at that we
just need browser history and here we
passed the store this one right here
after that we can just export the store
and use it in other files after that
we're gonna create a folder reduce or
reduce our and in my reduced or folder
I'm gonna create index gs5 if you didn't
know that when you if you import only a
fuller JavaScript it's smart enough to
go and take the index GS file so that's
why here I just import the folder so it
came right here here it's a really
really easy one we import combined
reducer
from redux so combined we do so it just
a way to so we sing the name you combine
all the reducer and yeah so i have
nothing more to say
and here we're gonna import this is
coming from react router redox really
reduce or so this is the reduced row of
photo router here we can export default
the combined reducer it take return an
object will add the routing so this is
what react retard Redux asked so you
need to do this and air just for showing
you a router it's only a function will
return data so here i can do this right
here so right now we have set up the
real minimal below plate for redox so
now we can came here in index GS first
thing
I don't need this one your import render
so I used a district so I don't need to
react down here so here is the part
where we connect where we connect via
env dogs together so provider from react
Redux and in the store coming from the
Redux folder and store GS here I can
take my app I put it inside my provider
and now my provider I pass the store the
one I just created so now my app I have
access to the store coming from Redux so
for right now I mean we can delete at
tests GS it's that because I don't like
tests just in this tutorial this is not
the main purpose proposed here I'm gonna
delete the index CSS file here in app GS
we can still use it here
I'm using a lot of functional a function
only component so here right take my app
so here I do another app just to be a
stateless component you have a DF
wherever
hello and area I'm gonna report the
image app logo coming from react Redux
yeah I'm gonna show you what happened
right here now look at that
my Redux dev tool just open it snow is
green so that means all is working you
can see here in my state my rotting so
this is coming from react rotary ducts
and I have my fake one with only an
empty every right now if you have your
reactive tool open if you came here you
can now come here and see you provide a
you provider you store so everything
inside via a redox and your
who has nothing right now and look at
this if i refresh the page you're gonna
see the Luger
so everything you touch the store you
can see the previous state the action
and the next state so for now just
because I like to everything clean I'm
gonna just use inline style where I the
display flex justify contain Center and
you have my a line item Center
so here it's flex box so really basic so
here I can use my style style that rule
but we need to set up a height so just
for right now I gonna be 100 VH so all
the Flex no define oh you need to put
your value inside a code so now you can
see everything is Center and now we can
start in the next episode so I hope you
learn a bit out to just setup you basic
store so if I come back here we just
import the the boilerplate for making
the store really really quick just here
don't remember the logger is the thing
we just see right here in the console so
every time we're gonna touch the store
we're gonna see something coming right
here much more easy to debug after that
we import a root producer whoo yes only
I really so right now we'll combine each
video so and we have only two the one
coming from rocker reducer and the fake
one right now
and my star I create an enhancer we take
with composed take the middleware and
take the dev tool coming from Google
Chrome
after that I create my store and I put
the tree agreement who the store ask is
the reducer the
initial state and after that yes for if
you have an answer middle word all that
stuff so that we create history and we
sync with the store so we take the
browser history coming from react router
and we take the store we just created
right here I said that we can export
this one so we came to the index gs5
where everything is stored and this one
we have a react we have the render with
this drug from react Dom we import the
provider the provider is wet connect
Redux to react we pass at the store and
the store is the one we just create in
the Redux store folder and we have the
app component and we get the element
route by ID for start and this one is
coming here in the index in the public
index GS is this ID right here and the
thing is magical right now
the logo you just sees that is this SVG
and if you want to know why Alou ratite
is because you have the app logo and the
app logo spin keyframe right here so Oh
everything made sense right now so yes
it this is a quick episode just for
setup so I hope you learn a bit and so
if you like this just click like and
subscribe I'm gonna try to push another
episode every day so hope all make sense
so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
