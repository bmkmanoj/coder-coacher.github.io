hello eveyone for number nine time to
connect the back end with the front end
and yeah and see the power of grass URL
and also a polo so before we start I
just want to make sure then when you go
to the repo like you here you see the
matter is always the latest version
stuff like that but even when you
example you you want to see at the some
episode you can just look at this place
and you get a see the code at this point
I just want to make sure everyone on
this on this part so again the repo is
always in the description after that so
this part we're going to need is to
react native debugger so for install
that for the Mac OS you can install that
by doing GRU update and all this kind of
stuff here and for the windows I think
you just need to delete on the release
page so we do to the release and you
download this thing so just follow all
this pattern I'm going to put the link
in the description to why are we going
to need that because it's going to be
easier for us to debug with videos and
all this stuff so the plan of the day is
to take this all my whole life face
there and my tweet to become the tweet
we have saved in the DB so we want to
have all the data coming from this
Apollo curl here from here but before
doing that because I don't want to do
the autopsy ation right now like just
the Parkers I just want you to see the
power of Apollo before that just go to
your server open your server code go
there and comment out this line here
line 15 I would require out on the get
we just remove this one for now because
I don't want to add the GWT token for
now we're going to make that on like to
be two different port so now we are
there so now we need to make a call get
the data and fill this up with the data
so all we can manage that first thing is
we need to create the Curie's and the
so easy I mean this is that I mean I
think is the most easy thing I never
seen you put grass here a layer I'm
going to click a photo psql I'm going to
color another photo to reach three and
in this one I'm going to call get tweet
so that's going to be my Creek I'll get
tweet so my plan finally it just to have
this career right there so what I can do
it look at that
I track everything I take it I import
ear gql from the ground from react
Apollo and now export default dql and
now paste it here this prettier shift we
have the creek that's the thing mo I
mean that just crazy so yeah I mean we
are almost done but I mean the key is
dental now what we need to do is to plug
this thing on this on screen here so are
we going to manage that if we need to
import the graph QL so import from react
Apollo here the graph QL package view
after that you're going to wrap your
grass QL with the on screen like that
and now we need to import the query we
just built so I always put my Curie
upper case I'm going to get tweets Curie
so I know this is a Kree so when I was
going to be a mutation I'm going to say
mutation coming from Gasque ellcrys get
to that we take here and paste it there
if you save now we're going to
thing but we just make the Curie's if
you don't trust me
all we can see that now we're going to
need to do a some change in the package
reason because Expo don't use the same
local O's the same part of the react
native buy this also what you need to do
is create a now you know I'm going to
call something called debug so this big
both scripts going to be to open the air
and debugger debugger yep and we're
going to accept debugger set the what
debugger lock I'm going to ask equal
local ask a part equal 1 9 0 0 1 but I
need to put this inside the code like
that what is this thing so first thing
I'm going to put that in this
description I don't want you to type
that and get the error but this thing is
for opening the debugger in the good
part for make use of the react native
debugger so I'm going to open the NSC
debugger so this is a - we just good and
now the thing I need to run it's right
there in my mobile side so I'm going to
be mobile I'm going to run yawn debug
perfect now I'm point in 1900 1 so now
what I can do it
command D and I can click on debug
remove Gia and now look if you see comes
always here that's perfect that means
that's work now and now if you see
everything is connected and now look
connected to react now we have the react
component and also we have the stay here
cuz off when I was at the straight air
we set up in the store I set up composed
with this tool with without the school
so now if we see the react native the
bugger now we have all the data so this
is everything we added in the front end
now the front and edit just for showing
you right there I'm going to search for
own screen and I'm going to sitt data
here and I'm going to get tweet and now
a 12mm with everything we need so
okbut nixon I'm going to just make that
a bit bigger for you yeah so this line
of code I'm going to put that in the
description just copy and pasting that
so you see just pretty simple what they
do but you need to have the the tool
install so again this that's going to be
inside the description so now what here
I can do first thing I want to show
loading and I also want to ask my pizza
so what I can do is here we're going to
add access so here oh I can show you
that here add that at this after that I
in here I'm going to have the loading
with holes now and when it's load for
the first time is going to be true so
what we can do is first thing we're
going to destructuring the data from the
props also after that what I'm going to
say is I'm going to if data that loading
if data set loading so if loading is
true I'm going to take the activity
indicator communing already from reality
so activity indicator in digit here you
see what I mean sorry with my exam when
I return here the root number the
activity indicator and I'm going to see
size of large one out now if I see look
what gonna tell right there you see the
loading
boom so one that was loading we get the
desktop but again this stuff it's not
the real one because again this is this
stuff here we need to change that
because we want performance reactive as
create flat leaves with so much better
than screws you always use flat list if
this is a lot of stuff you're gonna king
I'm using scroll view like for little
kind of animation and stuff where I need
to have like 2/3 lmn but when I need to
have like many and then I'm gonna maybe
have a thousand tweet here I'm going to
use a fat meal so now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to remove all this stuff
here and I'm going to put my flat views
so that slightly need some element the
first element here we're going to just
put in the content container sky and I'm
going to just align cells to be stretch
because I want to make sure the list
takes the full size of the screen after
that you need the data so the data here
it's going to be that I is just a tener
so you see it just just need to be a an
array of everything so what I can fix
data so they're coming from here now
that get tweak if you don't see why I
came with a get tweak first thing get
sweet you would get the name cover this
thing and if you look and you react
native debugger ready and you type again
on the screen data that gets will become
the array of 12 mmm perfect but now that
don't go to do nothing
another thing I can do to it key
extractor used to extract an unique key
for given an item at the specific index
so that needs to be a unique key and
this is really important so oh I can do
this it's here because I'm going to add
my ITM as an object now what I can say
is I want to be the item that ID because
we're going to get the idea because if
we look at this get tweet we ask for the
ID so now how can I render item so this
play is going to be pretty simple what
I'm going to do is I'm going to call
your a function called render item this
function I'm going to call another
function called render
idea now in what I'm going to do so for
now I'm going to remove the scale I
don't need the state I'm going to render
item here I'm going to district ring the
item because
becoming as an object with the item
inside and now I'm going to call my feet
card I'm going to see here I'm going to
put duct tape so now what you see there
nothing has changed but now if we
calculate the number of a lemon the
number of element is less because this
is all the real number we get from the
back end but why I still see my face
everywhere why'd that because yes I gave
the item to my feet probe I don't use it
at the Trop then I'd be pretty simple
now what we need to do is with you're
gonna jump on the we're gonna jump on
the feet card and the thing with we're
going to need to to to make its use the
variable we have built on top but make
it with the real variable coming from
the desktop just for showing you here
you see the Texas all the things so now
here I'm going to destructuring the tech
if you don't know where I get this text
if you now if you search feed corn like
that and you search one with Gandhi
speakers so feet or now look here my
props now I have all the cops coming in
a well one that was mine and stuff like
that so I'm sorry this is really like
small I cannot I try this morning to
change it but it isn't not working but
now I'd accepted that real thick and now
I can delete this one and now look I'm
going to say and now the text become the
text we have in the back end and if you
look lol three the world - and now this
is the real tech we look at the
graphical that the real one here world
tree in a world - and the real stuff so
now we have dynamic data so now I'm
going to change percent when I change
the top I'm going to change all the
users stuff so if the user came as an
object
so again p-card search fit core
maybe this one will be bigger paternal
add an object whereas my user will have
the avatar first name last name and
username and why I get an object about a
user it's because again and they get
tweet I asked here the object of the
user so now what I can do it's here I'm
going to take the user and I'm going to
send everything about the user here like
that by doing the data use our ear
what's happening to my feet or others
it's not my feet toward others gonna
have access soup so too much talk don't
feed card there now add I have to user
name avatar and stuff like that if I was
saying just use R equal to bracket user
I'm going to need to district during
that from user but now I can add access
to it so now just for showing you now
what I'm going to do I'm going to see
user name first name and last name I'm
going to remove it from here and now if
I save that's going to be you're really
learning the real first thing the real
last name coming from your user from the
tech your deck still mine because I've
Street X but now look Judy fini
Alexandra blah blah blah and now you see
this is the one committing from the user
now I want to add at the avatar and
because my user didn't add an avatar
because we didn't upload image I'm going
to see if I have another Tower I should
add at all as I should pick avatar so
now we're going to get to the point
where now my first one can have my face
but now if we look we have the one
communing from the DB where we get from
random user perfect
we just a good point here now the create
app just remove them when I go to feed
core I'm going to secrete app because I
have access to it I'm going to send that
here by doing this but now in my headers
if I had a create app look what Gennady
if I say
creet app now the creed app going to
came as a string date really bad not
human really really bad before doing
that we have a beautiful package called
date effect F and F it's like women GS
but baller I like it much more I think
smaller and make more sense to to work
with this one pretty simple too to add
and they have a pretty good amount of
function so what we going to do go back
to you freak or edit at the top here
we're going to import this ten in words
to now from date SNA this ten in word to
now like that now we're going to take
this distance to date from now I'm gonna
wrap my create app with that then I'm
going to put I go from here nothing more
to do and now look at gonna tell load
that you are going to be slow right now
because we add a debugger open but it's
going to be pretty fast after that the
not look seven days ago seven days ago
seven days ago so this is a good
beautiful data thing I did we you can
read all of them so now perfect now what
we can do to it to change this value to
the feed car so again in the feet we
have every turn so now I can came here
I'm going to district ring favorites on
I'm going to pass it if I read come
right there and now I'm going to go to
my feet hold button I'm going to take
cover it come from here and I'm going to
move here so now everything going to be
s 0 because we didn't favorite like
nothing else being favorite the I think
maybe some nope nothing has been but now
like I tell you that's the real data so
I think I was a good point for today for
this one video of me now we have this
thing now what I want to do for the
next one its we're going to make use of
the placeholder loading as I show you in
the introduction so this is what we're
going to add for this stuff for the for
the home page and also we're going to
manage the is favorites for see if the
user Atari so these things going to be
relevant traffic that but maybe this
part I'm going to push it further so
because we need to ask the attacks
occasion working first because we're
going to ask as the viewer so I hope you
enjoyed this part again all the district
didn't gonna be in the description I
hope you enjoy please like and wheat out
later have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
