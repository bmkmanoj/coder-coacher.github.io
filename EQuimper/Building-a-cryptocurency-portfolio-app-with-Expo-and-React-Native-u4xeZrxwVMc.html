yes and are you
perfect
oh I'm good - yeah and continuing this
little application I've just set up
radius on the server side make requests
faster and also the API only change the
endpoint after five minutes so this is
just checkup everything looks that is
work now when I refit I fetch the stuff
coming from my latest client now so
yeah as you can see I have my Quinn
market right there now perfect so now my
read is get here oh thank you yeah it's
it's a good thing too for me I mean I'm
learning silver less and also oh really
and with this work in same time I'm
getting that from Quinn Marquette the
API so this one right there yeah Quinn
Marquette this thing here oh yes sorry
Donald yeah it's but I think this video
are getting save on YouTube know that
this video I mean it's not like YouTube
like it's toriel I do with the Twitter
and stuff like that I just I'm working
on a project and it's more like for
streaming for the people who never build
the app until the AppStore gonna see
everything so like yet this thing is
going to be push on the App Store and
I'm gonna set up everything from the
push notification and everything so it's
not real time a sudden you get updated
be five minutes so yeah so as I don't
know what I've done to ear it's I've add
videos on top of everything and I think
I find I have a pretty good setup with
the middleware and everything and now
the app right now looks like that and
now you're refreshing only in five
minutes so you see like now if I have to
change always get the same data because
it's caching in the memcache and now the
infinite load now this total value is
going to be changed but this thing here
or will value so this thing here it's
that will value so now what I'm doing
right now it's I'm getting the stuff era
now I want to pop up least ear with each
crypto and you choose one and the crypto
is gonna be there oh thank you
and I think I'm gonna net to me and do a
theme chooser so inside that setting
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put a
button you're gonna choose between light
or dark team so I'm gonna do this Duty
do these two and yeah so here in the
server what I've done for the read is
pretty simple it's ad set up release me
that wire right there
who's gonna get from the context and for
the services this is a I just checked
like if I have no result from the cache
I do another fetching if yes I'm showing
there is Olaf so and now this is where
I'm working and now I've added this idx
stuff with a tool built by guys from
Facebook team who finally do the if
check everything so this thing right
there and I start to really love this
little tool just a library would check
for the new level so example you put
your function like that and this is what
they do I gave the church for everything
like that
so you don't need to do this plus plus
flow type understand that and I've used
the library in variant so in version
what that do it's if I have nothing here
I'm gonna have example Newell and now
you're gonna see in my app I'm gonna be
see that I read screen we're gonna say H
cannot be new right now so now I'm here
so this is where right now I'm fetching
a new the crypto so I start with someone
who is better than me in really and
stuff like that and you just told me
don't get the cash from your client ear
by using with this I can just add I can
just refresh the same fetching stuff but
now I'm gonna just get the ID in the
name and I'm gonna just show a list of
cryptocurrency I don't need all these
data so when you get a click ear
and fetching so you see the loading and
when you click that here I'm gonna see
the dollies so this is what I'm gonna
build right now here I'm gonna just add
the invariant stuff I think on this one
yeah like I've done on the other ones
I'm gonna say import in volume from in
volume and right there I'm gonna say in
were you on edge
and I'm gonna say edge cannot be nil and
now I can remove my square bracket oh
well yeah sorry maybe I get too fast and
maybe my CPU - it's pretty high right
now
okay another thing too I think that's
gonna be good for you don't know I think
because I've seen you come in and it's
why I know like you build some greatness
stuff - it's this component I've created
right there it's for putting this little
blue thing at the bottom so this stuff
it's because he work on me on Android so
I've done this yesterday so the only
thing you need to call now it's when I
get the tap Bauer you just put the
allied tab focus and you take the
is coming from react navigation oh yeah
thank you yes and this thing it's it's
Adam I don't use a vehicle until they
fix a met ever open I think if I go to
my dear term I'm gonna show you what I
mean I'm doing right there it's oh thank
you awesome right there Oh so the she's
response to me so I'm gonna show you
what I've got with Visual Studio cone
this thing right there ml if you can
look at this thing
look what happened with my MFA yesterday
I was trying to to put a component
inside and I can add the autocomplete
with my tab
never so just cuz of this I mean I mean
I really love Emmet and I really need
that so I'm just waiting to fix it
though so this is the issue right there
yeah so she wanted me to open another
issue so I'm gonna do this tonight
so yeah just Adam I mean it's it's at
Exeter at the end so I mean and this
thing it's nuclide so ever install
nuclide woods goodbye facebook and you
just go really well with flow type and
just for now I'm still having visual
Zuko I just want him to fix a met so now
I'm right there so if I look at my this
one yeah so this is what I need so here
I'm gonna have my item and now I'm gonna
cue here a component here who's gonna be
a crypto I don't really need because
Eric can I can setup that from here I
think so
so now here I'm gonna have one item so
what I'm gonna sit I'm gonna sleep cons
and I'm gonna say I of 50 maybe with 100
pixel and I'm gonna just put just go
there and I'm gonna have my so now I'm
gonna suggest a file contain center and
a line item center and now what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna have a cons crypto
name equals style that text color is
going to be white in here that's gonna
be item that name why I don't get the
autocomplete
no no what
so
yeah oh I can just see in Vorian
so a crypto name is gonna be Titans
gonna have a fixed direction of row and
finally what I want its I just warm
yeah I'm gonna have cons I think I'm
gonna go like I've done in the index I'm
gonna just say and nothing the index
book in the coin why I say coin icon
like that
and this that get image
oh I see the thing yeah I think I'm
gonna just create
maybe not I can just do this right there
so it's Quinn market get image
like that and now here what I'm gonna do
is I need to have Quinn icon
I mean I don't know if I'm gonna create
a component on me for this thing
okay so now like that if if I suspect I
round the thing it's
can you still hear me looks like the
other loading in my screen
can you sit Urmi what I'm gonna do
it's here I think is gonna be better if
oh hey oh you are you
okay yeah it looks like the video looks
slow a bit No
I think I'm gonna take this one outside
now in what I'm gonna do
it's now
I'm gonna call that coin I think like
I've done on the other one
and now here I'm gonna have a coin I
know it's gonna be an object I'm gonna
just see that ear
so if I do this well the thing it
I can just pass the variable bottom of
this one yeah I think that can be better
away and now this one I'm gonna just
receive the fragment of the other one
well now you're gonna still work like I
have one but the thing is I want this
one to be a bit smaller of what he used
as the like I've done the air so I'm
gonna need like the graph QL like you
see your fqe defragment container so
this is what I want to do to redo right
there so I'm gonna juice export the full
right there I'm gonna say function you
know see what I mean by that it's so I'm
gonna quit a franc man it's gonna be
better for this one I'm going to call
that so you give it the name you have
like crypto item and I want the name and
the crypto idea I don't need nothing
else here so that's gonna be my fragment
here so I'm gonna save so that's gonna
generate a fragment and now I can keep
this name I can go right inside my right
there and now I can say crypto item coin
like that and now by doing this so
that's gonna be my fragment so my friend
man just gonna say to graph QL get this
value 2 so by doing that the dot ear
it's like we do with an object and now
what I can do here by doing this it's
now I can have the type of this so by
doing import type from my generate
folder crypto item coin I'm gonna say
crypto I think win add coin and I'm
gonna say coin it's Quinn
so now by doing this now my Quinn get
the autocomplete like the flow type so
now if you get there the thing I've
changed still working but now I have my
friend man who's get from the bottom and
now you just make my this one smaller
sorry example if I want in this one to
receive another data I can ask it and if
you ask why my all my generate get
generate is because I have this file
here already open
whoo it's relay compiled and everything
so if you see this is what we need give
us to us
so if you see Apollo vs. wheeler this is
what did friends is really gonna all
look like you need to do this in the
runtime and as you can see I have my
name and add the crypto ID so this is
the Frank man and if you look at the
query right there
you're gonna use my Frank man I've use
to make the Curie so now I have this
stuff and all this thing it check it be
inside my data and all my crypto stuff
here so now I have my stuff here so
looks okay but now the thing is I want
to have the infinite scrolling and I've
already done that in this one so what
I've done in this one was this thing on
n which I'm gonna show you so I'm gonna
just put this on any each and I'll put
it I'm gonna put it here so air is get
some value and the page size would stand
by default and now what i can just do
it's here at the end of my on and reach
equal days that on and reach by doing
this now i'm gonna add an infinite
scrolling and i'm gonna click here i'm
gonna go there and now I'm gonna just
scroll and now looks I've every crystal
know anything it's zero so you see here
I have a one problem you see the thing
here it's because I think I'm gonna need
to add a padding-bottom to my list so I
have my list here my flat list and I say
I think I need to say like patting
button and I can maybe say like nothing
like 50 maybe so the size of ones I'm
not even sure so here it's more like a
testing so now I'm gonna click here I'm
gonna go there and now
I'm gonna go to the bottom and now you
see I see 50 was the size of one item I
get this size right there
dude that make sense a bit of what I've
done
yeah so what's pretty good this is
really what I want like that so now what
I want it's the user click on one item
so now what I need to do it's my crypto
item now is gonna be a touchable opacity
stuff opacity maybe not here but here
it's a text but here it's gonna be a
touchable opacity here I'm gonna have a
on select press function who's gonna get
call here on pressed it's gonna be
called by unselect press and yeah I'm
gonna say unselect press it's a function
and now I'm gonna need to go to my
function here where I say in this one
why I call my crypto i10 and I'm gonna
create it right there I'm gonna say what
I'm gonna say it's first thing I'm gonna
have a state where I'm gonna say
selected crypto and by default is gonna
be new so I'm gonna create a type of
state like that and I'm gonna pass the
value right there after that what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna say on select
crypto press
and now what I've done with my really on
the other one I've see I was really
tight coming from my type okay so this
is what I forget it's here that's gonna
came from my
that
hmm I've read an article on medium this
week about the arrow function I think
and that was by what was his name
I was like react I roll kancho yes six
yeah so that was this article by a curry
house and I'm not alone to have liked it
you just say oh you did
it's a user unclick this that delete
user so that these become the context of
this one oh yeah I'm shelf yeah I'm
using with this because the API I'm
working with this one right there I've
read at the bottom of the page right
there is a first thing please let me
request to no more than 10 by minute and
you see em 20 update every five minutes
so what I decide to do it's when I fetch
I'm gonna in my server side I do a
memory cache of the 100 the big Queen
I'm I'm getting and now that's why I
like when I do my fetching so you see
here like right now if I'm researching
again I get my memory cache and not
another server one and not this if you
are yeah okay cuz now so we suggest that
ID so you see what it's done so here you
pass the ID was gonna be not the ID but
a name it's gonna be a type of string
and now here this thing you get that so
here I can say this that's at state and
I can say selected crypto going to be
cool to the name and now what I can do
it's right there where I get my item and
now I can say on so on select I think
what I'm sorry press equal this that on
select press crypto like that so we're
gonna get my name cuz of the object ear
if I understand and if this thing I pen
oh sorry sorry my dog
so after this thing I pen what I want
it's your Abba callback method where I
can call this that uncle's button press
like that so I'm gonna close the model I
my salad kryptos gonna work
oops I've closed my debugger so maybe
not need the debugger what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna use the alert and I'm gonna
see right there
oh thank you you sure yes Donnell it's
something like that I've seen on some
other project from someone else and I
just think it that's a good idea I don't
think they created for that well now
when I click here and I click on one of
the Bitcoin nothing I bet
you
I think maybe miss
oops that's why
hello - any really crap don't know why
buddy crash
yeah yeah
oh yeah my tray load fling is there yeah
I'm gonna check yes I'm gonna check once
like I just want to finish this thing
and time choose this that proves I don't
click this up of the user ID
but the thing about this it's something
gonna need to have like youto item em
you're gonna need to be a class
oh yeah I can may be buying it right
there
so I make it trash again what what I did
wrong
I think I'm gonna need to open the
debugger now
it's pretty sure if I do this select
crypt over here this press this function
here when I pass it
oh man this app is really slow on debug
mode now I click here now if I click
name it's Bitcoin name it set around
name is Bitcoin cash this thing it's
working right now but the thing is okay
so now what I think is make this thing
you
I'm pretty sure I was a cold but you can
pass a callback and I know it works
it will where I put in the world here Oh
okey I see no oh boy
what did I've just done Oh err it's
where I want to add the selected
selected crypto who's gonna be nobody
phone right now this one's going to be
everything I have right there
I'm gonna pass it right there
like that
like this
but now I get it from
mmm it'll oil
10:04
oh I don't need I can just call right
there yeah don't need to go to time this
no it will take name perfect now
so now my thinking it's I should put not
the ID but the name cause I can put the
name I think it's gonna be better
let me know well I mean I need the name
it's awesome
you
like this thing yeah so no I can change
it choose by choose crypto and now what
I would like it's here the title right
now yeah so I'm gonna say that STR who's
gonna be a type of string and what I'm
gonna say it's yeah I'm gonna say STR
equal this thing else STR cool kind
no I cannot I don't need to see that
because here what I can say now it's
more like so it's title you can I see
what I mean it's you can just return
right there
choose a crypto and your consist I'll
color I'm gonna say color the library
and now in this one
now I can remove that title here this
way
like that and now what is this thing
why get far away it's because I think
already have Psalms so I know I don't
need this adding here because I think
I've put the padding on the item wrapper
no I don't think no why no no no it
looks like a word Bitcoin - Monero
yeah so this way so after I choose now
I'm going to change this value
yeah that's where I can take the prize
yeah really really that's where so
selected crypto
yeah yeah real idea
okay so now that's gonna be this thing
we're gonna do here I'm gonna add that
price USD and now what I'm gonna do its
ear I'm gonna just say pass the coin
here and now in my function on my model
here I'm gonna have it yeah I'm gonna
return the coin I don't have it
like that no and that's gonna be a coin
corner who's gonna be top corner eternal
coin and now this one's gonna be called
selected crypto I don't need that
anymore so yeah I'm done gonna have I
can't I don't even have a state can
remove the state and now what I can do
it's now air he's done is gonna be
stayed dot name like that
so everything still work King so now
here that's going to be a coin there's
going to be a type of coin and now era
is going to be coin like that
I'll still work perfect this is what we
want now what is my error alert is
definite never use I'm gonna remove yeah
so no error if you have some question I
mean you can you can ask and I'm gonna
just check the Trello thing right now it
looks like a channel to lose still work
it just maybe it's perfect no too late
okay so hey Surya Donal I put the Trello
private now it should work so this thing
it's pretty done get images done fine
color ting it's done now we all wanna
what I would like to have it says setup
we do sir for saving data and set up
Redux purchase so now
yes so now have this and now what what
that let me to do that's maybe the
question you asked it's because if you
look here I want to get the price at USD
so what I can do it's the price here is
this is gonna be filled by the value I'm
gonna get from here so now what I can
say it
yeah value color get price USD yet price
maybe and now this one's gonna say if if
this that's take that selected crypto
with snail return the value of zero
that's zero zero
yeah and Alice I'm gonna just return it
this that's stay that selected crypto
dot price USD like that and now the
value of my input right there Oh have I
I don't need I don't really need to I
think I can just put that now I can say
value equal to this that stay that
selected to toda price USD
I think that yeah that's the thing so
I'm gonna just go with my way here
nice nice nice
whoo I'm gonna just shut down the stream
for a minute so the stream
okay let me know if you get the stream
back
perfect so long
so yeah this idea
okay so what I want yeah but actually
I'm gonna put that at the bottom this
thing I think I'm gonna put that after
the date like here you're gonna see why
I mean that it's because what I want
it's I want to let the user choose on
many coin day off so now here that's
gonna be the tattle among t that's gonna
be the turtle I'm on pay in dollars like
that and now what I want
here's gonna be a string
really
so now by doing this you can ASSU what I
mean it's now in my state I'm gonna have
total amount of crypto by default is
gonna be 0 a total amount of cube toes
gonna be 0 and also after town I'm out
of dollar hey it's gonna be 0 - but
maybe 0 that 0 yeah I think it's little
better so now I'm gonna add value called
get total among pay who this function
was gonna do it's gonna be returned
finally the so first thing if this that
stay that's selected crypto I'm gonna
return still continue to return yeah but
I'm saving it so I can say that's what
this thing is gonna always return the
same so now what I can say it's your
total amount pay you're gonna be caught
today's that stay that total I'm on the
log of 3
well now yeah perfect this one I don't
want to be able to change but now when
I'm gonna change the value of ear a nice
example this thing is gonna take the
price USD so yeah so
right thing you can put disabled not
quite sure
no it's not the good one and disabled
think it's maybe idiot I'll edit table
true I think that's gonna go with that
no I'm not supposed to be able to
deceive these that get disabled total
input
let's suppose I think to call this
function here
yeah I'm not slow editable
not sure but I think what I'm gonna do
now it's cause I mean I don't want you
to be able to eat it here
yeah
you
oops I did it wrong
yeah I'm gonna just keep it
perfect I cannot we cannot perfect
perfect no it's more oh thank you though
I really appreciate and hope you can
have a good night we talk later
oh yeah I'm quite down
don't worry you need to check because
that's gonna so now here I think this is
what I'm gonna do
so now thing is that about the price USD
and I need to have a value we're saying
fries
because I want to let the user say if
you're gonna change the price your Prezi
was the get price
this thing like that because I want to
let the user change the price or I'm
gonna have on on price change
I mean that price here as Deaver just
cried as Presley just be maybe that
Dawn's gonna be was deep in the future
so now
I think this way
so now I click here I get Bitcoin I get
four now I can see here hey I want to
get seventy six like that now I pay my
Bitcoin nine nine like that yeah I think
it's better quite what do you think
about that I son I think that's a good
feature because the thing is I don't
know if you know like a bit about crypto
but like I can maybe paid a Bitcoin on
my from my friend and maybe it's gonna
charge less or maybe you're gonna pay
that on another exchange we're gonna
charge more so I'm gonna add the price
it by default and you can choose and so
now my editable is that thing I need to
make it work now also this thing
now is editable and this is not what I
want
why he did this year and the thing is I
think if I go there and I try to now I
don't need it
so it's
you
okay now I cannot know I can't like it
so that was different
okay like that so not at Alamo so I
don't think I need this twice change on
total Quinn change now what I'm gonna do
here
I
you
no I don't think I'm gonna go this way
cause here what I'm gonna say
okay so now I'm gonna have this value
that's what fellow fry
oh really I've already
not a number
yeah maybe we'll be better if I do it so
it's a number
you
hey then how are you
this type is incompatible with number
so to fix Oh
that's returning a string that's why
like that no this time it's think about
the bullwhip number
one two okay so this thing is going to
be a strong
yeah that's why good thing even yeah
I've added a reducer today on the server
side too because the endpoint only
change every five minutes so now like
it's always the same value for the first
four five minutes I've set up all the
stuff about with this and it looks like
oops looks like my radius work you see I
get the cone market zero and I'd only be
fetching right now so it's my reduce
stuff and I've set up all that in my API
by doing this Quinn Marquette services
right now which wit is where I create my
middleware a of radius and I've set up
that on my graph QL right there
Oh perfect yeah and I push the code on
the get up so if you want to see
so now example I pick up Bitcoin and I
say 112 and I pick up Bitcoin cash yeah
perfect
and I restart total I'm on pain and now
I think I maybe just in the butt of a
button ear and I'm gonna need to other
death date picker here so here I'm gonna
need a bottom who's gonna be cons put on
submit
there are I of 50 it's gonna have a
width of 80% it's going to be online
self so it's going to be a line self on
the center of East Iran also I'm gonna
set up a border border radio sighting
like 14 and also is gonna have
background color of primary I'm gonna
set up a justified contain center for
the text inside that
ah
10 it's not 20 and the thing is 80% is
to be so we're gonna go with 70 and the
radius I'm gonna say 20
yeah that's true that's true but I mean
it's inside the ear I mean it's ears so
yeah
I may be gonna put to run button one
with an X inside that and one with a
cement good idea
so what do you mean by that the initial
yeah but the thing it's here when you
click here I want to like when you
submit that's gonna create and push to
your wallet right there
I'm gonna try with the two bottom like I
think maybe but so the bottom rapper
gonna go there
