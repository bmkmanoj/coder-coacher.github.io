introduction about my next tutorial I'm
gonna build here on YouTube first thing
I want to thank you everyone move it's
already subscribe to my channel that
means a lot for me and this is why I
want to give another tutorial so for
this tutorial again it's gonna be one
where we're gonna use your Viet 'native
but I want to change a bit like the tech
we're gonna use and now that's gonna be
with kind of a new language we don't
sell a lot here on YouTube it's a
lecturer and we're gonna make use of is
awesome framework called Phoenix so what
we're gonna build again because you know
I like to do a clone of application
because I don't want to lose time about
like thinking about a new feature I can
build for an app so I just want to do
like clone so I I just think encoding so
so we're gonna build an Instagram clone
and I think we're gonna learn a lot of
good thing with this tutorial also I've
learned a lot just by doing this
tutorial because I'm kind of new newbie
to honor
elixir so the feature we're going to
build its kind of what Instagram is it's
we're gonna be still photo feed first so
a user can add all the photo in from a
game and he can like a photo so I think
stem can like the photo you can also
come in the photo also it can take a
photo so we're gonna learn how to take a
photo with react native also and also we
can align all we can push this photo to
the server side
after that we're gonna make use of the
transportation system with Facebook so I
thought efficient in the application so
we don't gonna have a email or password
we just want to use kind of a
certification and we're gonna make use
of the GWT so something I didn't say
we're gonna make use of graph QL too and
I hope that this thing you're gonna like
it because I love it so much
after that we can add a chat system
between users so I have one on one chap
so just a simple chat system where each
user can chat with someone else and yeah
like a place where you have all these
friend and you can search which for
anyone today and kind of I mean the real
Instagram and also we can add a
following system right there so yeah so
we can add friend in the application
also I think of maybe adding following
system about tagging but this is
something we're gonna do do too and also
we're gonna surely have a search at the
end but this thing is gonna be kind of a
homework at the end for everyone and
we're gonna see how we can build that
and also a really important this is not
a fun Instagram app but just enough to
learn a good amount of thing because I
get a lot of comments a lot all the time
on YouTube like can you add this can you
add that can you add this and sometimes
just when I build a stuff it just
because I want to give you that
knowledge but sometime I don't want to
go too much further because I mean I
don't want to put like a 20 hour video
on stuff so you see what I mean so this
is a feature we're gonna build so the
attack we're gonna use react native for
the mobile framework after that for the
backend Fremont we're gonna use Phoenix
so we can check here so react native
even if you are on my channel you can
know where we activate something I use a
lot it's a way to build iOS and Android
app and we in react also that's been
built by a Facebook
can and you can see here they you in
some time use it so it's a good idea I
think to build with this after that
we're going to make use of graphic UL
and Apollo graph QL so that's gonna be
the technology beginner using the
front-end to make the true with the
graph QL so for the role for the one who
don't know after well that's maybe not
the good tutorial for you to to learn
gradual I will go on that tutorial of
gradual first and after that I will jump
on this one after that we're gonna make
use of elixir this are some language I
mean one of the language right now I've
I love it so much I mean it's syntax and
everything makes sense after that we're
gonna make use of the Phoenix framework
and for those who asked yes we're gonna
make use of the version 1.3 so for those
who know a Phoenix a lot they know that
in version 1.3 we change kind of we
change the architecture and this is what
we're gonna use after that for the graph
QL part in the backend so for the elixir
we're gonna make use of the app science
library so this is the this is like the
one we're gonna do the implementation of
the fe q add inside the elixir language
and it go really well with phoenix again
pretty good job here
the database we're gonna make use of
parse grass I don't want to change like
the standard database we use when we use
Phoenix also here as you can tell right
Apollo and yes we're gonna use a new
version because as you know in the past
week we get the version 2 of Apollo in
that change a lot of the change a lot of
all we use the library so this is the
tech we're gonna use
so what you need to before taking this
course or tutorial if you like it more
you need to have a good knowledge of
relative this course is not about
getting deep on something it's a ball
because I mean so if I talk bad but what
I mean it I see a lot of person who
struggle to just start walking out on a
project then tying off no like oh I know
this I know that I know this I know that
but they don't really know all to make
that on context and build something so
this is just a ton of this application
so tutorial it's just we go on the code
we build the feature we want to build
with like their Instagram Chrome so
we're going to make use of the same kind
of design and stuff like that and we
don't lose time on all which kind of
feature can do we just make a lose time
of all the abilities feature in right
away after that we jump on the coast
after that we need to know you need to
know a bit about elixir it's not
dialects or beginner course where I'm
gonna teach you our function work also
all pattern matching work and stuff like
that in order to use recursion stuff
like this and so I mean take some course
on a lecture first before I go going
there because I think it's going to be
pretty hard for you to catch up on this
tutorial after that you need to have a
basic knowledge of your cool so the only
thing I ask you about learning about the
odd co-pilots you need to know what is a
resolver what it's a schema and what is
a mutation and also what is a
subscription if you know this thing and
also why we use ref you are you're good
to go
for the graft report and I want you I'll
at least we have touch Postgres don't
like I mean I don't want to talk about
like what is a joint table and stuff
like this so I mean just know a bit out
buzz beer so this is not a big earnest
beginner of course
so are we gonna oh I'm gonna record this
tutorial
first thing they're the some of the
video is already record so that's going
to be kind of easy but I want to tell
you like all the strategy gonna work
first thing we're gonna use kind of a
TVI brush approach for a good portion of
the tutorial so for the room we don't
know what is TDD that means test-driving
development so that mean like you do the
test before you build something and you
make your test crash and you build your
thing until your test is good so this
thing's gonna be pretty good to do on
the server side way because I mean in
the front end it's kind of it's not that
much easy which we hang that cheap and
stuff like that so the tutorial is going
to be divided in many part and each part
gonna have at least three to five video
it may may be more and they're gonna be
divided by user story or feature if you
like more so each part again it looks
like this example for to video one we're
gonna add the photo feed description so
I'm gonna talk about okay so what we
need to do when we do the photo feed
stuff also what is the user story etc
after that we're gonna write wrote some
back and test so because we do TDD so
we're gonna just write the test and make
it crashed so the next video after that
we're gonna write the code to make it
work so we have an affinity video number
two when I crash and we're gonna finish
the number three with the video to
working now
after that we're going to pass the video
for designing the mobile site about this
feature so if we do the photo feed we
get a design the photo feed in a front
end so like the each card with the photo
in the scroll view etc and with just
mock-up data and finally in the last
video of this part example that's gonna
be about putting the graph QL so putting
finally the back end and the mobile side
to talk each other and to let the mobile
part to show the real data so we're
gonna just change what we work for a
real data my plan when I'm gonna start
to push the video it's going to be to
add that new user story or feature each
week so one way that's going to be photo
feed
Sargon weeks gonna be about the liking
system so go after that you see like
there's gonna be the following each
other where if I feel then their video
go pretty good so I mean I see you like
it a lot and then you want it much more
I can maybe push video much more faster
you just I try to just I mean I want you
to have to get time to learn other stuff
before coming back on this tutorial
so the soil is not really yet I've done
I'm gonna see 75% of the tutorial so I
think it's gonna start to come on you
told me this mid-december maybe earlier
maybe a bit later but I'm gonna try my
best to do this this tutorial is not
like the other one I've built it's gonna
add a bit more structure so as you can
see now I have a good introduction idea
and I mean I hope you could make some
fun like I have with this kind of
technology and for those who came from
no GS and just want to play with Phoenix
and they they just want to see how
that's gonna looks like trust me when
I'm gonna finish this course with you
and this thing I mean I don't want to
jump back on load years after that
trainings just make so much sense and
that's why I really want to give some
knowledge and stuff like that to other
people because I just think this
framework and go really really well in
the future and this is for the modern
web and this is what they say right
there this is a web framework we don't
compromise the speed in the mid May
meeting the ability and you see what I
mean and this is built for the new web
so you're gonna love it trust me I hope
you enjoy please let me know on the
comments feel about this next course
again I want to thank you everyone who
has already subscribed to my channel
that make a lot of I mean that much when
myself a lot so that's why I want to
push a new word tutorial and put time
for you hope you enjoy and we're gonna
talk it or have a good Thanksgiving a
what bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
