milestone for the new project we're
gonna build together so this is the
project I talk about in this number
about building an Instagram clone by
using react native react native as the
mobile frame or and Aleksei plus Phoenix
with graph QL to make the server-side so
wow you excited
sorry about the late video so what are
we gonna do so I like I told you last
time I'm gonna separate everything in
kind of milestone so for the first week
yes this week is gonna be pretty slow
but you're gonna feel then it's not
because I want it to be slow it's
because we have so much to do to like
installing stuff what I mean by that
it's first thing we're gonna set up
react native plus finish so just set up
both project after that we need to set
up the app sign with the graph QL layer
for the server graph your library and
after that we're gonna also need to set
up react native navigation so for those
who just have done react navigation by
using the GS library react navigation
this is something you're never gonna
maybe see its react native navigation
which the net subversion and this one I
kind of really like it really good
performance but this thing it's a
natural library so we're gonna need to
work with Xcode in Android studio to
make it work so this is what we're gonna
do also this week after that the plan of
the week or so it's to getting a list of
photo so finally when we're gonna finish
the week so it's gonna be a pretty
simple way we can do a get request like
that from to the server well we can get
the image URL the ID and the caption for
the photo nothing crazy
here and you see it's the one coming
from the data server we're here we see
the number the time it take inside a DB
etc so it's the the request we just done
and also we want to show this kind of
stuff so showing earlier so you
it's not quite like the best design
course don't worry I mean it's more like
how to put everything together but I
mean it's Instagram don't so and as you
can see this is the one communing from
the back end so example if I show you
here and I go with this thing you're
gonna see then if i refresh I'm gonna
refresh from the back here so this is
what we we're gonna build for a week
nothing more we don't put the icon here
in the bar but as you can see this is
react native navigation so I kind of
really like this performance for that
tab and we can research more and we're
gonna do pagination at the end of the
week so we this is the plan for this
week for just leading us building this
place and after that we can add the user
as the photo and also next week we can
like and we can do so many stuff here so
I hope you enjoy you're gonna enjoy this
week and we're gonna start right now and
by good the first video I go back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
