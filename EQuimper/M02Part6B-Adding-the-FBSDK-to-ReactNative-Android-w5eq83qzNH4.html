number six for the Android user where
we're going to install the Facebook SDK
on the Android version so for those who
didn't follow the other video just to
look Ollie was working its first thing
you're gonna need to do and p.m.
installed inside your mobile version so
yarn advocate Facebook SDK after that
what you need to do is doing unite net
save a link react native Facebook is the
key if you don't that now we're gonna be
at the same point so now inside
integrate studio we're going to need to
do to add in some code and following
that we have this getting started with
Android studio and this Facebook is the
key so now we are more than twenty nine
so we're gonna do above so here add this
variable blah blah blah here on your
finale your main application so this is
what we're gonna do so first thing we're
going to do it's going to enjoy it to do
open up here and go in Java main
application and now here we're gonna add
some import the import we're going to
need gonna be this to ear so call back
manager from Facebook and also we get
save Android SDK Facebook is the key
package okay after that what are we
going to need to do its create here a
private private study call back manager
and we're gonna call that for call back
and either and that's gonna be equal to
call back manage are the factory that
create we don't get able to complete
because you're going to see we have some
weight problem so that what are we going
to need to add here it's going to be a
collected static call back manager
so your callback manager like that you
call a function get told get call back
manager so it's finally just a guitar
here so are we gonna just return the EM
call that manager like that okay so now
here the only thing we left to add it's
doing here a new new line new yes be
Facebook package finally and we pass
also the callback manager on it
in it okay after that what we're going
to need to do is doing inside the main
activity and ID show right there
we need to juice and activity we just
need here to add this hope
Simon activity here just put that right
there and now we're going to need to
have them - I think Pam I'm going to
number two
know so I'm going to just import from
here
right you do this one okay just to get
the intern right there okay so now we
have that now what we're going to need
to do it's after that like they say
we're going to need to run to follow
finally in the getting start for the
further anyway this decay so finally
we're gonna go inside your string xml so
go inside
where's value string xml and right now
we need to print a new string organize a
string we're going to put that a name
and the name we're gonna get to this one
it's gonna be equal to this Facebook app
IV this one it will have a very occupy D
right there inside you in cyclin instead
clone on Facebook okay so get here
that's going to be that's going to copy
for you and paste that right inside this
string value right there
drink that after that what I asked to do
is go inside Android manifest so inside
you manifest in you in manifest and now
right there they asked to add permission
internet we don't need we have it by
default after that we're going to need
to add this this metadata okay right so
what I'm going to put that right here
right after this activity make sure this
is inside the application okay like that
so now the string Facebook SDK you're
going to equal the value of y we just
add put okay and now what also we're
gonna need is gonna be what we have here
if you need to be able to sharing link
image or video Facebook they'll let me
do that in the future so we're gonna
paste that right area but now you're
just see if your app ID is one two three
four
add that right there and after that so
here just copy paste again you go your
app ID and paste that right here okay
okay now we are really close so now if I
try to run that now we're gonna get a
lot of breakup and thing like that okay
I'm gonna kick okay
now you're gonna say I'm gonna get I
always this kind of error here I'm gonna
always kind of crash and yeah so what
are we going to need
it's we're gonna go inside the budget
app so this is what the version of
Facebook SDK I think we get some problem
and what if we need finally it's inside
your module app we're going to change
the version here of the compiler is the
key to be 26 and we're going to do the
same in the Facebook SDK see it's
already 26 okay after that what we also
need to do it's we're going to need to
add and like another kind of version
here for the photo Android is the key
from undoing the version gonna be not
for plus but 28-0 like that okay now
we're going to try it again
run
and now we're gonna get somewhere
program with this app compact right
there where they see finale we're going
to just add to be an Avenue positive in
sync project right there
so now
the thing should be able to run
I've done some injury development but
I'm not the best one so maybe this is
another deception just told me in the
command if you find then like it's the
perfect it's gonna run I'm gonna do I'm
gonna come back when it's gonna be
finish the build is done so now I'm
gonna try to run the app on my simulator
instead kit so now I'm going to run on
isolator
and now we're going to get some error
cannot read property and
okay so we get some error --air get
fouled back and not fine method get well
by manager look sad don't maybe some
type over here okay so finally here
we're gonna just see what this I mean
just copy page this public manager then
they could be pleased that I so yeah so
I think I've made a typo sorry about
that
and for the one at the top why not use
it actually created with the uppercase C
and this is and I think we're gonna get
out of complete now yeah clear like that
okay
well now if I run I think that's gonna
work
you
you
you
and the sea silver on we have no air our
looks good
it's always a stress stressful when we
we weighed that and don't know if we're
gonna get a break something like that
now take a moment
looks that ear bindle and oh yeah
they're okay now if you didn't have
followed all the way tutorial what I've
done it's inside the login screen
I'd add the logging manager from
Facebook we exit Facebook SDK and also
I've add on logging press even will get
called inside this touch about here so
inside you touch a ball wrap they're
continuing with Facebook you need to add
on press on the link FB cracks and this
is what you do an asynchronous call
while you do the our logging manager
talking with mid permission okay now if
I click on that this is a woman of true
you know we get here the project okay we
get the project here but this is not
like what you're supposed to do from
make it run what you need to do also
it's here inside there they're getting
start like they want you to add a
development key so what you what you
need to do finally it's to run like this
come in here inside you and the red
folder okay and that's gonna give you
that gonna give you Ashley and this
one's gonna be the one you're going to
use to make the app running ok so inside
Mac you go and say you're in the oil and
you just run them back yeah this coming
I know they're gonna give you action you
give it a password and the best part
robo you can build one you take your ash
version here and now what you need to do
is doing inside you're in cyclone and
you add a new platform in the relative
and now here inside your Kiev you play
this one you can enter and after that
you should be good yes so now you click
on save change
and now it should work I think me I've
worked because you have just keep in
mind this key but you you you should run
here and say like you are not logged a
table but now that should work so no if
you refresh your screen with double are
consumed with Facebook and now this is
supposed to run and this is supposed to
be able to work sure this is what you
have done you have put your edge and now
everything should be work if you need to
see there could I have you don't get up
but don't forget to input a liking
manager being at say Facebook SDK and
just doing this on a logging press and
you should be able to run and that's it
so in the next one nouns going to be
time to use the tool can and log with
the service we have built in the first
part of this milestone so I hope you
enjoy all that again Norman don't forget
to see in the description for all the
links are here so we're gonna talk later
