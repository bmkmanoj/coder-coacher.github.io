part 22 so in this video what are we
gonna do it's first thing we're gonna
fix when you tell bug I just see just by
recording the next video and also we're
gonna check about using fragment and you
gotta see how awesome is that
so first thing we're gonna jump on the
fix-it fix the bug so first thing the
bug is if I add here a tweet and I click
tweet I'm gonna get this kind of error
here as you know it's because update
query and stuff like that gonna have
some error one of the first thing it's
inside a new tweet screen here on the
optimistic response we're going to need
to add s favorite default so it's
already for it just been created
and also what we're going to do it's
inside a quit treat we need the ACE
cover it back so if we do this
now if I had a tween hello well and I
tweet now I'm gonna get missing feel is
separate blah blah it's because inside
my subscription because you know like I
get my my data coming in from the
subscription I need to add this thing to
is far away so if we should be good with
just this thing now but this kind of
stuff is going to be removed cause at
the fragment you gotta love it like that
now you see it now it worked perfect so
Frank Mannie
so yeah I'm gonna put this thing in the
in the description but fragment is a
piece of code you really need to
understand to make your code easier to
work with
well ql sorry and and this thing it
about thing about fragment as almost
like a component for your query so what
i mean by that it's as you see here in
the example you have credit fragment
called import who's gonna be on the
person type who's going to add first
name and last name so it when they get
the person they're gonna always need to
have example first name and last name so
what they're gonna do is they're gonna
spread inside the query name port plus
add at all so if you understand this
power don't happen it's this screen now
gonna receive first name last name and
also at that hour don't you see so you
can be used on fragment blah blah blah
and this is what we're gonna do so all
we can do this it's all as you can see
here we have this thing here takes ID
created by allah and we have the same
here and also we have the same here and
we have the same here so now what we can
do
it's going into my feet card and i'm
gonna create my fragment right inside my
feet car because remember this fit car
is the component we're gonna receive
data so i think it's a good place to put
the fragment because now you can say to
your component this is the kind of crops
i need so when i
when I fetch always take what I need so
I mean by that is the feed Pro is that
thing will make the get tweeted bla bla
happening because we need that for for
showing ear but the tin yet if I put
that in this feed power component and I
make it as a as a fragment for him by
doing this what's gonna happen it's
example if I want to add example a title
I want to weigh AB maybe I don't know
like like I don't want anymore my
username I can't remove the username
from my fragment so you're gonna see
right there so what are we gonna do so
it's gonna be pretty simple what we're
gonna do is we're gonna go there at the
bottom and I'm gonna cut any of my
components or feet car and after that
I'm gonna say frag man like that and I'm
gonna create an object I'm gonna SiC
tweak so that's going to be inside a
tweet object and now I'm gonna take gql
and into a DQ ELCA meaning from react
Apollo
now what I'm gonna do it's here fine and
I'm gonna create fragment
speed car on three so this is a Frank
man we called fit car on the tweet type
and now look what I can do I can just go
to my example get tweet
and take all this stuff here because I
need this thing on a record I have ear
but by putting that here now we know
this component this is the value they
need from the graph QL son I can save
now nothing gonna change because I mean
we didn't do nothing
but how can we fix it fix that here in
this skull this is the get to it so at
the first here so now what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna import my feed car cut
meaning from my component folder free
car and pick car and now look what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna remove everything
from here so now if I do this that's
gonna trash I mean we don't have the
value blah blah blah so now how can we
do this it's by putting right there so
before the tech tip finishing I'm gonna
do a dollar sign curly bracket because
always remember this is back tip so we
can put variable now I'm going to say
feed card the fragment the two per tweet
so that's going to be
this tweet here and now if i do this now
i can do dot dot c car so you're gonna
take the variable we have right there
can i if i say
maybe things still work now but you see
all this get me now it just really
simple so now we can do the same with
get user tweet so now I can I'm gonna
copy paste this one I'm gonna go to get
user to e so I mean this this one here
I'm gonna paste this one
after I'm gonna remove all this thing
I'm gonna say dollar sign feed car that
flag man that cui and I can say that the
free car
and now if I do this
you
everything should be
as well before I think it just cleaner
like I don't know why my computer is
really slow right now
okay good there you see everything still
working so now by doing this inside a
component like that we know then when I
work here in my component sorry I need
all this stuff I know that if I go there
I can create a Frank man so eight this
component need that so this is a way for
you to egg and capsule your props to
your component and just saying this
component always gonna need this kind of
value so now you can do the same for all
this stuff here because this is the same
value again so now what you can do you
just do the same thing for the three
three
the same
go there see fit car that fragment the
tweet and now
like that
and we've got we can also do this in
Queen Anne
you
you
and now the beauty of this thing it's if
we need something else so example if I
need to add something like example my I
want to remove the abbot or something
like that now what can I do
it's I don't need to go over each of my
requests from error example now what I
can do you just go to my feet car and
remove my Abbot out from here so you see
this is like so you just create finally
I like a variable of what you need so
that let you read we use them we reuse
your your crew finally but now if I do
this we're going to test them so I'm
going to create a new
you see to work now so
but now the code is just cleaner if I
want to remove stuff I can remove it in
one place so I hope you enjoyed this
little video it's it's pretty quick well
just to talk about fragment gonna be
really important for you to read this
thing makes so much sense and also you
can check like it if you click here you
can check there example of Apollo inside
they get on react yet application right
there on github this is by clicking on
some of the link right there so I hope
you enjoyed this little video and we're
gonna talk it out have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
