consume this tutorial so what we're
going to do today is to plug finally the
Facebook plugging in the mobile and like
showing what the token gonna do and but
the first thing we're going to do is
update exponent or exponent game version
16 why I want you to do the the new
update is because you're going to use
the new flat list in some other it isn't
so it's really easy to update like I
always with exponent so the first thing
we need to do is to change inside the X
Jason the SDK version to be 16 so we go
to add jasa we change it to 16 perfect
after that we copy face this react
native version and we change it inside
the package Jason so we're going to
change this one we're going to take this
one after that change exponent to be
version 16 with the carrots at the top
16 so I'm going to do this like that so
that change react to be 16 point 16
alpha so this is where we get like some
reacts fiber stuff so the new version of
react and this is perfect after that
because we're going to break something
in react navigation we need to change
this one to be version 8 now what we
need to do is entire trip now we're
going to do our M or F no more Joe so
we're going to believe the new module
and we're going to delete your not
perfect so now we're going to run yarn
another thing to you should do I don't
going to need to do right now so I'm
gonna do a yarn but for you you shall
yarn globe also update globally your ex
to be version 40 so for me I have
already done so now we can avoid a lot
of time does now every I get the big
change on react so now what we can do
it's create the
application inside the facebook for
developer so the first thing we need to
do is go to my app add a new app that it
display name so we gonna call it meetup
me like that I'm going to choose
entering terminal and i'm going to
create click create app ID after that i
need to type this thing so oh this is
yep yep so now we're going to wait we're
going to create a new a tidy perfect
here at the top we see that I deep click
here to copy it and go inside you cast
an ear create a new file called FB comfy
here we're going to do export default so
I'm going to close this thing here I'm
go to export defo something I 10 with my
visual studio okay like that after that
so we have the app ID we're gonna need
that after this now if we go to explode
at i/o in the documentation if you go to
the Facebook right there we'll show you
what you need to do and the tangy dsq to
do it inside the setting ear you click
Add platform you click iOS first and you
paid this thing inside bundle ID after
that you take this right there so this
is the key ash for android so ad
platform android you add this key ash
right there but as you do save change
perfect after that we're going to go to
app review and air we're going to tell
girl make me a link meetup me mr. Blake
yeah so that's going to let people to
logging which you add a lot
so like a no-no like if you use your
cell phone and don't just use a
simulator that's going to be a good
thing here to make it live or in
development perfect here I forget to do
one thing it's yeah that's fun now so
here what we're going to do is I'm going
to rerun X start so we get some good
change like the flat list going to
remove the list view and let us stop
going to change so this video my plan so
if I show you the ring me i right update
exponent yes Chris facebook app update
the global so we do and now we're going
to make your login success and change
them design in the sign up now my plan
is to start to make more video each week
like maybe three about the meetup and
one about like everything else in
programming so we're going to start to
get much more video if you subscribe so
we gotta just what again that always
take time because you need to compile
yeah so here we were always the first
compile always when you run the start
take time but after that we're good to
go we get at me alone but now here is
because we just like change all the
exponents the in change the SDK so
so it's working perfect hey I'm going to
run x ì óù s to open it in iOS so
that looks good here if you for me
because I did it but here you're going
to get like some kind of you application
in you signatories up today so you need
to delete it first and after that you
rerun iOS because you're going to see
another change i'm going to show you

about this about I want the mobile at
least to get the facebook token that's
it next video we're going to finish the
backend for the google and the front end
for google and after that we're going to
push together on the server so the
education part going to be done so

equal to 30 and color to be equal to Y
so like that
and I'm going to do the same for
Facebook's space say book now that don't
gonna look like what we want so your
first thing inside the button right
there we're going to change it to be
fixed direction to be real so we want
inside row and not anymore in color yeah
I mean I the inverse yeah so road make
it like that after that here i'm going
to change it to be spaced around so
we're going to each thing going to pay
you take space like that after that I'm
going to change your text for connect
