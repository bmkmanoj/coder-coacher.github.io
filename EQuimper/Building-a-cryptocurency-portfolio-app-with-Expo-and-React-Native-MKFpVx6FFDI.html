you
Oh
lol oh how are you
lol oh yes you I mean they were wearing
I'm gonna put my
I'm good I'm good I'm a bit tired when
I'm good
yeah this project it's so yeah I've
stopped the other one just because I
have no idea about the feature but this
one happy I have an ID it's I want to
make my portfolio for my own
cryptocurrency
stuff so just to keep track of what I
have
this one's going to be quick and I'm
gonna finish it because I want to add
this in the store
hey Cory are you
this is real or it's glue Bonilla my
islem don't care don't understand what I
got with my de vere so I just say so for
the one who don't know like crypto
currencies like Bitcoin and stuff like
that so I just want to keep track of
what I'll I'm gonna use some markets and
yeah I was doing this in the web but the
thing it's this is something I want to
have in my pocket so I'm gonna write
yeah I do this in the mobile and maybe
I'm gonna do this in the weather that
and I'm gonna just make it like a pretty
simple it's gonna be just a lot of API
call so it's gonna be good for me to
just relearn how to work with the REST
API or just for fun I mean and I'm just
trimming that because maybe when I get
stuck here for someone else you can
learn from my mistake so now I just want
to set up redux dev tool so your redux
the tool extension because I want to use
my the one I have ears I need to plug
that so now I can run neon debug if I
want to debug I'm gonna debug with the
reactances the barrier and what I need
to do for setting and it's gonna be on
Expo so everyone can play with that
almost every night when I'm gonna push
it and if you have some idea about
feature will be nice to to nowhere
tomorrow I'm gonna record some of the
last video for the Twitter clone and I
need to so the story is done then I do
the navigation really quick good thing
to have your app on github you can just
copy paste a lot of code yeah so I'm
gonna have tabs navigation plus a stack
ones so here I'm gonna say I'm gonna
start with the own second time screen
it's going to be home screen I'm gonna
import this one right now
or that
looks like my don't want to autocomplete
like that like that like that and I'm
gonna just put some option really quick
everything I copied from my other video
so I'm gonna just remove that for now
out of 50 I think it can be good maybe
no padding I just copy space what I have
from the Twitter stuff so maybe not this
one
my pen with this one it's I want to push
it to the store with a quick input
notification so for the one who work
with the expo you're gonna see all to do
a notification this is something I don't
do a lot and I want to see it and like
that this is what I've done here
Oh so I've put enough in here I'm gonna
say knives like them
but no worries okay I have the
homescreen perfect so what I'm gonna do
so I'm going to install two Axios and
I'm gonna create a youth subfolder where
I'm gonna have my epi the GS inside this
one I'm gonna have my all my red color
and what I'm gonna use as it the EPI I'm
gonna use this thing here for starts so
if we see here this is what is gonna
looks like as a result but it's just
crazy to send like that so I think I'm
gonna send like 100 maybe yeah so here
that's gonna be everything I'm gonna get
so a good idea about what we have here
right now is I'm gonna just because we
talked about this right now I'm gonna
just take this one and I'm gonna create
my folder called types for my flow types
I'm gonna see Dada
the GS here I'm gonna setup flow and I'm
gonna say export type Quinn market Quinn
market cap that are equal I'm gonna
paste all what these and me
and now we know this thing is going to
be a string string string number no that
was a string so they are whole string
whoa
you need be fun to work with the
horrible yeah but this one okay here for
the one who don't know what I'm doing
right now its flow type so he gonna type
everything so if you came from like a
Java stuff Java background or something
like that you know like everything get
type so know what I'm gonna use the cone
market cap data as a type I'm gonna
gather all the autocomplete is gonna
really help me to go really faster so
here now I can import Axios from exhales
and now what I'm gonna do it's I'm gonna
create an API call coin market epi it's
gonna be a class what I'm gonna add a
constructor and a I'm gonna this that
base URL for this one's gonna be equal
to I think we're gonna go with this
thing here yeah but not the just of you
want after that here what I'm going to
say it's I'm gonna have an async cow
it's gonna be get out I'm gonna keep it
really simple and right inside this one
I'm going to have a limit value who's
going to be equal to a string oh maybe
just a number and now what I'm gonna do
its ear I'm gonna do a Ritter sorry
return Axios that get where a I'm gonna
do back tips I'm gonna do like that this
that base URL and I'm gonna sis with the
t'car limit and I'm gonna put the limit
right there
but now what I'm gonna say it's limit
it's gonna be equal at 100 oh I'm doing
this again it's gonna be koala 100 if I
don't put nothing and now yeah I'm gonna
just create an instance about Quinn
Marquette I think I'm going to put a Big
M
one more character equal new Quinn
Marquette epi like that I'm gonna just
set up an editor config just because I
want to have my my if I go there and I
save supposed to work editor config
insert new ya don't know what I've been
here why when I save I don't know boost
by the next line but it's okay what I'm
gonna do here I should have done this
inside a component like that first thing
I just want to see if this one's gonna
work
and now what I'm gonna do it's gonna
create some action
you
me and the name it's not
because III know I'm gonna I'm gonna
need to have multiple epi because this
one don't give me everything a but so
give me an idea
what I can do I'm thinking about it do
if I'm gonna use normal user yeah so
what I'm going to do it yeah I'm gonna
create a entities that yeah just for now
at least I'm gonna get here I'm gonna
import from my youth seal folder API I'm
gonna import the Quinn market yeah and
I'm gonna say here export before the
function was good export function get
out
oil market
okay and this one's going to be a tongue
function
I'm gonna open my debugger from now and
what I'm gonna do is this action going
to get called in my own screen
hope that gonna work
aks are you yeah oh yeah you like it
a flirty oh no poor without nothing just
plain stuff yeah I'll work nice and I
want to use to leti it's a library where
you can do animation with the I don't
know which kind of stuff coming from
Adobe but I'm gonna maybe do like I'm
gonna maybe do like the Bitcoin I'm
gonna take the Bitcoin I'm gonna cut it
in four part and I'm gonna just make
like as my loading stuff oh thank you
thank you hi I'm good okay yes I'm good
yeah for the Twitter stuff I'm gonna
slowly finish that tomorrow after
tomorrow I have like two are two video
and I'm I'm checking to for adding a
notification with ufq or something like
I don't even know right now so I'm gonna
need to search so here we have
everything you have the a theorem we
pull okay so I'm gonna tell you a bit
more about my stuff so what I'm gonna do
do here it's I'm gonna just change this
one to be ten for now because 100 is too
crazy so when my user gonna start for
the first time in the app is gonna see
every Quinn possible but you can add
some of the coin and say which prize you
get paid for this time so so example if
I say a I just bought right now I don't
know like two Bitcoin so I'm gonna take
the price of the bitcoin right now so
four thousand four seven eight and I'm
gonna do multiple by two and I'm going
to save it all the T all these guys have
played and you're gonna just follow the
price so if that came to 4,500 you're
gonna see Danny I've went like 22 bucks
by Quinn so so you're just forgetting
track oh thank you Jeff
thank you thank you yeah the Twitter
comb was like a really quick project I
did that like a you know we can and I
say man the Apollo it's too much awesome
and I need to show that to other people
and that's why I I showed this thing I
hope you have enjoy it yeah it's fun
like I've worked with graph QL for
almost like a dream on and I almost
forget how to do the rest stuff but
perfect so now you have my quarter what
I'm gonna do right now is I'm gonna
create a component folder like I do with
the Twitter clone I'm gonna create a
loading loading component and this one
is going to be like that with our one
I'm gonna just import react from react
I'm gonna import the activity indicator
after that I'm gonna export default a
function call loading with this one's
gonna get two arguments gonna get a
color who's gonna be a string equal to I
don't know like for now just real it's
gonna be really bad size was gonna be an
again a string but I'm gonna just put it
like as yeah yeah I'm gonna make it as a
props I'm gonna say color is gonna be a
string and I'm gonna say size can be
large or small and here I'm gonna see
color but if I'm gonna see real really
bad but and size but if I'm gonna say
large and I'm gonna destructuring that
to a small and props now I'm gonna
return think I'm gonna take yeah I think
it's better for me if I take the view
here
I think I'm gonna go with style
component do someone else do some
cryptocurrency stuff here
it's gonna be bad what I'm gonna do but
yeah okay so now I'm action I'm gonna
create a reduce all right now called
entity this one I'm gonna kill initial
initial state equal to coins it's gonna
be an empty object by default
we
no I don't make sense if I for now I'm
gonna go like that
I don't know how I'm gonna manage this
we need
what
gonna be better what I'm gonna do but
for now if
yeah by default
did that work
thank you
don't gonna be this slow start so what I
need to I need key aspect are so this is
going to be the ID
my render row here I'm gonna go here in
here I'm gonna return coin coming
what'd I do wrong
so if everything is work I'm supposed to
see nothing
hurry yeah it's finally a portfolio for
my own queen like my Bitcoin and my a
theorem just to keep track of how much I
have so this way I don't need to search
everywhere and I'm gonna have one place
something like black folio if you know
what happened here now what'd I do wrong
okay so
whoa
work
why I never see this render room
why are you
oh my goodness oh my god
what I don't know I have my item a
passive I have something here
my case tractor dude in
like a something is really wrong right
now something is really wrong right now
under item this that render item I go
there with my item app inside I just
want to console or the object and I got
nothing
and do what they asked to do and flatly
as from react Nazif go to my route for
simply did that I disciplinary if you
want to use something else like a limit
of always use the underlying visual
virtualize this
dick
if someone's never just let me know I
mean there is a prom render writer flat
list from react native flatly yes he
instructor
oh my girl you see yeah
teddy baby yeah now it work
perfect
I don't know I don't want to like that
so I'm gonna stick data equal I am
so this way I can see your data and
called Quinn market data and now here I
can
let's go Flo organized a name
Malou nice colors
but I don't think I need to return the
company yeah so no idea so you see all
the design it's awesome it is
No
what
okay so
okay
sometimes with a video call start to
piss me off a bit
not video of you
need a little gray so a good website for
finding color I have color and if you
didn't know are called colors this
website so this is - website you should
check if you search for getting some
colors or this one and this one the
first one here I really love it it's
because you can click on the star
generator and what you do finally it's
when you search for a color Italia like
don't know like an example if I love
this one and I love you know like this
one like this one like this one and like
this one now when I click I just change
I think I really like this gray but this
is really too much don't need this one
this one's going to be for the up and
down so
don't know if
I think this one I'm gonna keep it
because I'm gonna give me everything in
the volume in the price
I want to have the icon
well it's not a yachtie are you
mainly these things
I know that can work
Oh
and that's
you
I cannot type anymore Visual Studio code
really started pissing
it's crazy how much who got trim take
