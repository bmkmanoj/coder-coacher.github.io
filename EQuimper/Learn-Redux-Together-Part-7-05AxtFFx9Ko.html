around 4,000 units coaching in Astoria
and again we still last time I did
complete to do in the action this is
completely false re so I'm sure you get
this one if you follow so now if I click
enter I get my to do success and now if
i refresh my server I get the tuna Falls
perfect now I want now I want to delete
it to do now that delete it's just
working and tried the reducer but it's
almost not working right now because we
have we have a change everything first
thing we're gonna do here we're going to
create the async delete to do let's take
an ID and here we're going to add a
try-catch here we're going to have the
current going to avoid axial that delete
this that's that but we need put back
tip we're going to put that inside so we
string interpolation like that and we're
going to put slash on those caller-id
like that
and finally we're going to just return
the premises finally here we're going to
true the error so we create the side
there so area now we need to delete it
to do so here we're going to create two
thing again success and error so Billy
to do now is going to be anything
dispatch here now what we going to do
now this one going to be a bit a bit
order because we want us to make it
optimistic but we don't create like
either that was easily treated to do
before we push so but now all we can get
it by getting the to do from the data
first so if we have an error we push
that the to do inside of average finally
because when are we going to deal a we
get a deal if we remove it right now and
when we have an error we will be put it
inside the DB inside that the the
reducer so that's why we can you get a
get it lets you use on a test in your
syrup so here what I'm going to do it's
a I'm going to want to do I'm going to
be equal to get state dot yes say let's
to do that data and the data and now
error that's going to be to we can use
fine or whatever but now I'm going to
use filter just for now to do with the
to do that ID equal ID and I'm going to
return the first one because there's
going to be an array like that after
that here what I'm going to do is I'm
going to dispatch I'm going to dispatch
here my type of delete to do and I'm
going to return assign their ID on the
DD to do so I'm going to have a
try-catch here my troika is going to be
avoid to do epi that delete it to do put
the ID return if we have a know where
we're going to return it we need to do
success nothing not to do in the error
now we're going to need to return this
patch with a type of delete to do error
the error and also the to do right ear
so now inside my reduce are what I'm
going to do I'm going to import Italy we
need to do error they need to do success
now inside the DB to do here what I'm
going to do it first thing they delete
to do it's good this is what we want but
now the filter going to be inside filter
that data like that so that air we're
going to have a case really to do
success then I just return the state but
nothing more to do for this one but here
okay really to do error you need to do
error what we're going to need to do
it's now the thing is we need to to we
need to reboot back the to do and so
what we're going to do here is we're
going to return that state that that
state error I'm going to be equal to
action that error but here what we're
going to show to and need to do it data
now going to be quote to dot the take
that data and now I'm going to put my
action that to do so it's almost like
the add yes it's not the best one
because here we need to we put back
where we are inside an array so we
should index finally index and
everything but I mean it's that you just
have to do list but like what I told it
good thing would be to find the index of
the of the item take a remember index
and just put it back what you are so now
I get V T ie ever not
but nah I need to change the thing is
because now my function my function
inside my app and they'll delete take an
IV and this that press the delete ID
called ear so what I can do here
it's right there I can on this count
I'm going to call my endo and the baby
but now I'm going to remove the is
underscore and I'm going to say this I'm
going to say this that and I'll delete
I'm going to put the to do that ID and
now inside my to do I'm going to add
this function and they'll delete and I'm
going to say on click on delete like
that so now if everything is working if
I click delete me on ello now I get
Tillich to do success and I get my
everything but now why I get the loading
sorry maybe to do I know why cuz there
you got that that state data going to be
equal to take that data add up I get
people because I why we get the new
thing is the session that's not there so
now if I remove this one example I'm
going to delete now you remove and if i
refresh my screen add only three items
so now we make the delete right inside
the DD so this is what we need like what
we want and if we add an error actually
this one
if I click lol and I believe this one we
came back you see we remove it but it
came back so when I restart so now the
thing we need to do is to complete it to
do so inside the to do API here complete
to do I'm gonna get the ID and I'm gonna
and I'm going to just I'm going to just
a completely - and so the ID and I need
to know like if it's going to be true or
false so that's going to be my reduce
our because this is only an epi but what
I'm going to do is I'm going to just
promote with this because yeah all
everything I've done with you and the
passages was all life cutting so I'm
going to just play with it because I
don't like to want to break everything
but I need you see everything here what
we do everything so I hope you enjoy and
we're going to talk in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
