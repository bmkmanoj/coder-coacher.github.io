seen my AWS key so I just change it and
delete my user was a new mistake
-
are you today
Oh
going to
I just curl as high as I go I just
really just a simple project and
building for myself just for learning
I'm gonna add the react wheeler because
I want to learn this stuff I've used a
graph QL but I want to use with relay
object
I'm gonna use serverless to something I
never used before I just set up server
let's really quick so really quick and
I've put the server last I think I can
delete this thing and that's really
quick and just just some technology I
never use on one of my project and I
need to learn relief for next client so
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna jump
back off what I've done yesterday and
I'm gonna go to my CC type and data so
this is everything when Marquette give
me I'm gonna fill ID who's gonna be a
type of new graph QL and Anil yeah all
my videos gonna be say V I think it'd
take like 2 or 3 hours after my live
streaming but each video gets saved the
first part was yesterday so you can see
it then
so they all gonna be like that so what
I'm gonna do
don't really like this kind of name I'm
gonna take these two one so now on my
channel
you
a buyback what do you mean I'm sorry I'm
not the best in English but do that
means so here as you can see so finally
what I'm gonna do it yesterday what I've
done it's it's I've set up my like my
mobile but finally I have with one of my
nucleons gonna came maybe in the next
month we're gonna use the real life and
several a so I was like why not build
the project I was starting to build and
make it with technology I never used
before like a server less so the
framework who use AWS and the function
and also really vascular because in the
past the graph QL I was using its Apollo
I loved as Paulo and oh thank you I
really appreciate so here as you can see
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make
an epi call to this URL I've done
yesterday and I'm gonna just wrap this
with graph - well I know it's overkill I
mean it's I'm gonna use that you know if
you like big company use but you're just
for learning and I just think if I can
stream all my errors someone else gonna
learn from my mistake so looks pretty
good the only thing I don't like so it
did first name as you can see this is
what I mean
it's it did okay yeah as you can see
this is what I am oh thank you
yeah it's something I want to take my
AWS certification that's a really good
thing I just in here like I can surprise
us deep why this one's gonna have a type
of new graph QL non-nil and that's gonna
be apply here I did a mistake it's doing
like that and now as you can second
Crete bezel we're here I'm gonna see hey
I am and that's gonna item that price
USD so like you see here so as you can
see now I can do the same with other one
so this one's going to be price be TC
after that we have 24 volume USD so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say volume USD
24-hour yeah now I think I like it much
more than the one they create so I'm
gonna use again that this is a string
and the resolves gonna be equal to this
and I think is gonna be better if I tap
it after that market cap USD
alveoli build supplying I'm gonna put it
because it's graph QL so if my friend
didn't want it I'm gonna take it I'm
gonna just take whatever I can take in
so this is available supply after that
we talked about total supply and I'm
gonna sit at all supply so that we have
person change one hour so person change
one hour so that's gonna be person
change 24 hour person change seven-day
and last update while I do this it's
because I don't like to work with snake
case
and now what I'm gonna do
I think if I put my
yes I'm gonna change again my credential
what the heck is going on I'm gonna take
it they're like sorry and experiential
is always coming
oh my god CEO I'm new
perfect change
still work perfect still work
this thing is done this thing is done
it might be the query
get all the cryptos along my I'm gonna
create my my career boat
if I see all graph QL award
and that subscription
so this thing here
understand modafinil and the backend for
I just don't know if I need to do some
connection or something like that which
we like because this is something I've
seen but because as you can see here if
I search for connection like you need to
search connection arms definition and
from arrow to do connection
see know so get you are shown the
database get use on Oh
so for me I don't need to have this kind
of connection this is what I think so
what I can do it just create like my
fill put my type of crypto pie we don't
need any argument maybe yes but not
right now
yeah maybe some ours I say which one's
gonna be linear and that's gonna be type
of I knew it is gonna be type of graphic
you will string your eyes on a number
for a for now if I do this I should be
number it's the end I think in number
you feel in put int so this is gonna be
my argument and after eyes this is what
you need you resolve where here what you
can have is gonna be any single one and
inside this one the first argument is
that I run I don't add this but I after
I have my orgs and one of my ours going
to be limited
I'm gonna send that to new Neil I'm
gonna send least always like yeah like
100 so in air that's gonna be warrior
finally I'll do my fetch request and now
where this is where I don't think I need
eating because here what I can do is
return fetch and Eric and fetch and
that's gonna be Quinn market-based epi
please URL ticker
okay so now this feels gonna go to my
crypto type who's gonna make that for me
so after that what I can do it just put
that inside my index of my Curie's so I
see here cryptos forgetting the Kryptos
maybe because I think I'm gonna need
more than one kryptos on market because
I'm yeah and I'm gonna say
I'm gonna just secret though for now
okay so now I'm gonna have my end lower
so here it's the place where oh I'm
gonna set up that with ya but I mean
inside my scheme I'm gonna sign index of
GS I said I'm gonna import from graph
game a schema where I can after I import
my keys from my career
all the credit and are even contacts and
call back
thing if I search for
schema
requesting
Oh
so the first argument is gonna be Curie
-
and after that nil McGee I see like that
yeah that's a good fight
so now I'm gonna
mmm
yeah I don't think that's gonna work
why though
I'm gonna have a Trello - for this
application and this so I've just set up
basic stuff I'm gonna put the link in in
the description I just add it
I want to make it work
you
studies gonna work looks like gonna work
I don't know if I can do this
I see I see you need to do this and that
so what I've done with that self stuff
here
II just you see self custom and Lord at
there so this is this custom and old 0yc
and they'll enlarge so now I can remove
this one so I'm learning in same time as
usual
I don't understand this terror scheme Oh
curry must be object type but get Curie
Oh
I did export new
oh did I make a typo right there like I
forget to I forget to make it with an
object I'm Marshall world
cannot kill a class as a function
really what happen again I have that
name type art
so I'll enero right there
Oh need to be the same name as here
oh boy we're doing this
like you create a type of fuse on fields
I don't see why I should
know what I'm gonna try something
you
no you don't gonna work or anything
yeah
he maybe worked as eating
schema new graph QL schema
try to find one of my project and I try
to find what I've done wrong you mean
inside here
I mean if
here I know I don't need
results
you see something else I know
I don't know I'm really closed it's just
something it's
oh
you see the error
so I'm more close now
feel type must be a fool
well no you think it's this one make
there is the same thing I know I don't
need the
Creed a crypto that shield
must be up to it
period a crypto
Oh
think I'm gonna stop at an item and I
get stuck so much and not that art I
mean it's pretty simple it just the
setup of server less stuff I don't know
why I got this thing so I think I'm
gonna stop for tonight I'm gonna came
