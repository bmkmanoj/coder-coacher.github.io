number five of this Instagram tutorial
so here in the right this is where we
are right now so the iOS user add a bit
more than the anyway Jews are and why
it's because we need to kind of icon to
make the tab working with react native
navigation and in same time the iOS
Donovan so this is what we're gonna do
today first thing it's really I mean
it's not that hard but we have some code
bill to make it work with react native
navigations with the vector icon so I'm
gonna make use of the reactive vector
icon right there this library would
pretty awesome they had a lot of stuff
for us I mean they have if you hear it's
their dark so you can find a doctor by
clicking here and not the dog but this
is every finally every icon they have so
example we're gonna need the omen if I
search for home I'm gonna get at the
home we're gonna make use this one right
there so yeah pretty awesome and this is
what we're gonna do so first thing we
need to do is we need to install in this
library so I'm going to take this thing
and I'm gonna go to my project make sure
you have also the project store and run
yarn add and reactive vector icon you
know take not that long
perfect and after that we're gonna run
the command react native link so the
link gonna do for us dealing the linking
between the native code so now in Xcode
we're gonna have a new folder called
resource we're inside this one we're
going to add all the TTFN of the icon so
the Interpol
ever icon and everything so we are good
here what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just
restore the project for the iOS because
every time you add a native library you
need to restart the native editor or the
native build so finally I'm just rerun
Xcode so don't worry and well we're
gonna go it's we don't need to do that
much to in any way you can s it's pretty
simple to have yet we're gonna have yet
sorry about the time I cannot surely be
good so now you say yes you say that's
gonna take some work to make it work
this is not what I mean by that here is
the easy part the other part it about
react netsim navigation it's built
before the app came to you like your
screen ish so what happened it's you
need to have that icon running first to
be there so now we have a project
perfect any run so iOS we are good in
Android studio yeah
Android studio F create an asset folder
here with the fund and now what we need
to do also it's going to my build.gradle
project here and now here now what we're
going to do is we need to paste from the
interior we need to paste this thing
here compile project creates a vector
icon right there below and they have it
in the setting they have add the
reactive vector icons of this part we
don't really need but and now here what
we need to also do it's inside this
inside this one we have at this thing
perfect and in the main application
right there we're gonna need to add this
import error we're gonna add this import
right there and now finally you just
uncomment they have done this for us in
in granite so navigation so just like
that so I'm gonna save and now I'm gonna
rerun from here you can run from
whatever you want but and I'm gonna just
make sure enjoyed walk to so you see you
just finally follow this part you don't
need to do this to ear and this money
just about the build.gradle and main
application sorry
we should be good afternoon I've done
like a five test before so and that's
why I say click try again it just I get
this waiting to win and we're gonna
still have this blank page don't worry
about that but we're gonna remove this
so we're gonna go in resource to joke on
you know it's time to write some code to
make it work so we have the navier--
and a lab is where everything start and
that's gonna be the good place here to
get the icon for the project because
first thing we need to add the icon here
and if I add the icon air from react
native vector icon it's not gonna work I
need to put some code to make it run
first so what I'm gonna do
it's I'm gonna create inside the SRC
folder a folder called youth 0 so we're
gonna put all the util thing we need in
that but also we're gonna put team and I
think icon can be kind of a team so I'm
gonna create an icon that GS inside the
team I don't know what this yes then
after the dribble know what I think that
my best bet should be to just reopen
them sorry about this you see you get
queasy hey so now inside here what we're
gonna need to do is we're gonna first
thing we're gonna import react from
react and we're going to also import a
of the icon we're gonna need and for now
just for the two screen we need the ohm
with the Interpol ear and we need the
search and that's gonna be the searches
we're gonna make use of the ion icon so
what we need to do here it's sing import
in people from that Interpol and we're
gonna say import
Nikon from Victoria Khan ah yo Mike I
think this is a knife a yawn icon and
yes okay you what we're gonna ask that
need to do its we gonna create a
variable we're gonna beat the size of of
whatever we want like the icon we want
for the project so the size of the icon
in the tab bar so now here what are we
gonna say it's I'm gonna just sing
another thing to I need also from
reactive I'm gonna need the platform and
also the pixel ratio and now here I'm
gonna do some code but I'm gonna we just
say finally if it's there they're false
and that platform that OS it's equal to
Andrea we're gonna make use of the pixel
ratio that get itself a layout size and
I'm gonna put 25 yes I'm gonna say 25
also you don't really need to understand
what happen in this line of code just
like it just saying finally if the Platt
like we need to add the icon at 25 and
with the dev like it the platform
indirection era we gonna need to get in
from the pixel reso because you don't
get pretty well so after that here what
I'm gonna do now this code I'm gonna
play a pace that in a gear
and I'm gonna just copy-paste this line
here and this gives you just definitely
replace like if we on like active big
small and very big like reacting
activity vector like reactive navigation
when you're gonna click on item I'm
gonna click on active and stuff like
this and this is the thing we're gonna
need to replace and after that here
we're gonna create an object icon where
I'm gonna say own home for what home
because my first one
it's called own this one here and here
what we need to do it's putting an arrow
and we're gonna sing I've a concise so
the variable we just put here and we're
gonna say after that from where in
people and here I'm gonna say iOS search
and why it's because the search I get
that from here this one right there
iOS search and this is from IO and icon
so we need to do the same thing oops and
like that you know ya know it's gonna be
pretty weird but you're gonna make sense
after that after that we're gonna agree
like an icon map who's gonna be an empty
object and after that I'm gonna say I'm
gonna create a premises call icons load
who's gonna be a new premises would this
one gonna take result and we jack and
this one we're gonna run a promises that
owl we're gonna take an array but the
array we're gonna get that from the
object that keys so we're gonna create
an aviary from the object that keys from
icon so you're gonna take home and IO IO
s search and you're gonna create an
array so if you don't know what object
is gonna looks like and it looks like
this I'm gonna make an array with the
keys and with this stuff here what are
we gonna need to do it's after that
we're gonna do map and we have icon name
and now here we're gonna just see
current provider equal I can't and I'm
gonna say I can't name and I'm gonna say
one so you're gonna take this one 0 and
1 so we take the index number 1
so that year I'm gonna say are just like
that and after that you know what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to say return
provider that get image source icon name
that replays and now I'm gonna place my
replace to fix pattern with an empty
empty string and I'm gonna say take that
from the name icon name icon name and
I'm gonna see 0 forgetting this nav icon
size right there yeah it's pretty
strange but and I don't think the I
didn't create within this code I just
changed some stuff but I got this third
is called just by going inside the
issues of a lot of things so I'm not
that smart to be this kind of protest
and of code here but so here we have
done and now after that here inside the
premises we're gonna have that then yeah
then and now here what I'm gonna do is
we're gonna add all the code we just did
all the icon and now we say object that
key we pass back this icon and we do a
voyage or finally we say icon name and
index and we say icons map and we put
the icon name equal to the SOC my data
source
/i for the index and finally inside this
we can say reserved true to say this is
done and we're gonna finally export
current export icons map and icons know
yeah I know Lori you don't need to write
all these codes gonna be inside a guest
just copy in paste or just follow me if
you want this called it not supposed to
make a lot of sense this is not what's
gonna make you the best reactively
over-ear after that here I'm gonna
create inside my team and index a GS and
I'm gonna export everything from the
file icon if I can type perfect now what
we need to do is we're gonna go inside
the nav why everything gonna start and
now right there below that I'm gonna
import from you'd SEAL team now I'm
gonna import my icons long map load in
my icons map now icons load
it's a premesis so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna load every icon with a
premises and we're gonna see where it's
resolved now in it my app and what we
need to do now it's here I'm gonna say
icon it's going to be equal to my icons
map and now remember icons map it's now
an object with the key so icons own and
I'm gonna do the same with the exploring
I'm gonna say icons map and I'm gonna
sit here
I always search like that and now if
everything is working and you got a
crash I'm gonna run I'm gonna run again
because you have crash me fall to
succeed I'm gonna rerun so don't worry
I'm gonna do that thing with anywhere
and now I'm get a problem I mean I know
what and this program we got yes while
resolving module a the ace package by
the layer we get a program and I know
that's why I keep this ear open same
problem scroll down we see this error
from this guy I say finally just to
remove this package picture so what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to paste this
thing right inside
my mobile and I'm gonna pace this line
of coal also in the description and now
if we refresh now we have it you see
right there we have the two icon lot of
job for almost nothing but we need to do
this now for the indo-aryan we're going
to rerun the in drill because then read
right now it almost like crash or is not
even in your weaknesses so I cannot do
the common em or the error for
refreshing so I need to wait and now is
it gonna work em boom now you see it
worked right there and I cannot really
like the older individual I Q don't have
like because we have the label so we put
the label right there that's why the
inner edge so the label also so we have
feed and explore in here the same so you
see pretty nice we have done quite a lot
I mean this code you're like like what
happened now it's with this code we just
don't hear the only time we're gonna
make use of this code here it's when we
need to have that like here in the tab
bar for all door vector icon we can use
it like normally but here you know what
what I will do a new place it's I will
just paste that in a guess or keep track
of my guess and copy and paste that on
your project you see it's yes it's a bit
strange but after it's done we get
pretty nice like you're gonna like a
react native weeks from weeks and the
navigation so I hope you enjoy and we're
gonna talk in the next video where it's
time to design the first Instagram
component is gonna be the photo car and
because we want to fetch whatever we
have done in there and first three
episodes so hope you like a review right
now and we get a talk later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
