about flow I get I get some question
about some of my live streaming where I
was using fluent some people was asking
what is flow why use it and stuff like
that so we're thinking about just making
a little video about that and why I'm
loving it and now I cannot almost
without it so so what is flow flow it's
a library created by the Facebook or
instils stuff so again a project for
from Facebook and so it's a static type
a type checker for JavaScript so what
mean static type it's it's a type
checker finally for your JavaScript so
what it's type it's like checking your
object checking your area checking your
number and stuff like that if you came
from like a Java background or other
language like maybe googling or
something like that why you need to type
all your stuff that you're going to be
home with follow type so the flow is
gonna be almost looks like types cube
type C is another psych type checker but
the thing it's I think for me I'm loving
more flow because it's more easy to set
up and I mean it go really well with
react so for starting with flow you
we're gonna just check the try and try
so I don't know why the try get to this
point I think just because I've tried to
do some setup let's go okay so what's
that we're gonna see some stuff about
flow so that's going to be the same tax
about flow it's really important to
understand this thing flow go over your
JavaScript you don't change it then ask
it go over if you don't flow something
you JavaScript code gonna still work you
don't gonna bring that thing flow is
just just a type checker is just a
development tool it's for you and your
team why I'm livin flow it's because I
write a lot of code some time on some
project and I want to change some stuff
but flow can really I'll meet you down
tree a new problem what I mean by that
it's example you whenever I'll work with
you are you follow over
that you did everything you want with
the array it was good someone came to
your project change the salary to be an
object or change it to be an example and
a number you know everything is breaking
why it's because I mean for each example
for each method it's a prototype of the
average donor it's not a prototype of a
string or a number so that's why and
flow is going to be a tool for you to
really help you a new development
process it's almost like es thing with a
linter check we're going to check your
semicolon stuff and example your fatale
errors stuff like that but flows going
to be really helpful for you with all
your code example here we see our flow
work it's a function I'm gonna just make
it simple so this is a function normal
first thing we add at the top flow
really important this way we told you
last year we're gonna use flow after
that here this is a function
yeah what I want it's maybe I want to
console learn any I'm gonna control up
my food I'm gonna say hello it's gonna
work I mean I don't think we can see
console.log but you see what I mean you
work now here I can say the plan you're
gonna still work I think if I say to in
here froggen out the stem then that
cannot work because in the end cannot
define on a number you see so who can we
help you with this thing so all we can
set up that it's example we know this
full stop going to always add a string
here I'm going to always return a string
so if X equal a string and we return a
string if I want to return an object I
can say right there but this thing it's
a string like that so it's gonna be
always a string so I pack on food and I
pass hello
I'm gonna have no problem but now if I
pass 3a it's it's supposed to be a
string and you pass a number something
it's wrong with that I mean it's you
know it's close you see it there's going
to be a string
so this is really helpful for that if I
say that's gonna be a number down this
thing gonna be except the thing is we
cannot return a number so here I can
maybe say hello now it's gonna work so I
will stool you to do some tests on this
try editor and just see out floor work
so there it's
flowed at work but now I'll come can we
set up that inside a text editor so I'm
going to open visual studio code on one
of my project and I'm going to show you
you need one thing to install its flow
flow language support blah blah blah
donating you need flow type so this is
how you can setup that with Visual
Studio code but for this tutorial I'm
going to use atom data for using atom ID
in a new package Facebook and Adam have
create so Adam IDM so this thing right
there the new thing if you use a dumb
idea like me you're going to need the
better version of atom and also ID flow
type if you don't use atom ID a new
setup just use this slab flip-flop ID
nothing more after that you're gonna
need to create a new project where they
need some library
we're gonna need babel CLI Babel plugin
transform flow type stripe why these two
library is because flow we're gonna put
code over you your code so example if I
go there and I create my function called
foo x return X and here I see foo with
hello like that and now error I see X
it's a number example something like
that and now i go there and i run my
index that yes i'm gonna get an error
say a it's a new aspect ik token like I
told you flow we're gonna add some stuff
on top of JavaScript but this stuff it's
not JavaScript so that's why when you're
gonna set up your Bible or C you need to
put to put this plugin transfer flow
type start and after that when you're
gonna run your project the thing you're
gonna need it's to run that we'd better
not index that yes so make sure you have
better see a light for having this
better though after that install flow
beyond by doing to all what I show it's
inside the app so
bein like that so flow bin it's going to
be the way to set up flow so what I
always do it's a I see flow in it and
after that you just say so I'm gonna
just really dad you're gonna see how
that work now if I say yarn flow going
to create for me this flow config file
with nothing after I change that to be
flow check so now by doing a yarn flow
I'm gonna check my error like you see on
the Facebook stuff but now you may be
sick yeah but here you see X and a
number yeah but I need to toe flow first
by doing this now by doing that I'm
gonna receive an arrow right there by my
exit I will say hey here it's not
supposed to work why because it you see
we inspect a type of number but you add
a strength so that's why flow can be
really awesome and so we're gonna just
do a simple project nothing crazy
we're gonna just see all for work so
with flow we have array like that where
we can put example an object or you can
create your object right there also we
have number yeah it's training we have
any women any we have date and we have I
think I do that I say number know okay
and you can create a type almost like we
do on go line I see that on going to so
yeah I'm gonna create a type of user
with a name who's gonna be a string I'm
gonna add a country who's gonna be a
string it's gonna have age it's gonna be
a number so now here I just created an
object called user a type user sorry I'm
gonna see kirn's God who is gonna be a
type of fuse are gonna be an object just
by doing this and I say I'm gonna get
tree error right there a age country
name or not in this subject why the type
here say a this type going to always
have a name but I always have a country
I'm gonna always have a 8ya but maybe I
don't want to put nothing on this user
what I'm gonna say it's if you put their
here that here and that here now all
gonna work
why so here is the syntax when you want
to say this type can be undefined under
five meanings dumb going to be there but
another thing gonna be we see is this
thing like that now you're gonna see
prepare the age not fun so what mean
this thing here mean that's going to be
a number who can be new label so what I
mean by that I can say age no any gonna
work
and now if I say H is gonna be three
you're gonna still work my know if I say
he's gonna hello
now I'm gonna add an error because age
is supposed to be a number so you see
now all flow can really help all you
code by providing error right inside my
development processing I don't need to
run my code to see error flow it's
awesome for that and I really love it on
big project so I can pin my object I'm
gonna see Bob country I'm gonna say USA
and I'm gonna say yeah the name of Bob
perfect like that well now when I'm
gonna I'm gonna add all auto complete
you see here I get Bob dot H bloodline
name and all the value what you can do
with an object so now I can say Bob dot
name dot ah
now with order to complete come inning
because now flow gonna really help you
to autocomplete if you came again from a
background of Java or go line something
like that we have so many autocomplete
it's not like because I mean it's easy
for this language rabbit of the plate
because they know which type something
is gonna be but in JavaScript because we
use then and make time typing with what
I mean by that is we can have an a
string variable who is going to be a
string somewhere it's gonna be a number
somewhere but now with flow you just
make sure now I can see example and then
you're gonna work and but now if I say
for each with a metal for an array I'm
gonna resume an area because for each
it's not a prototype of the string see
so now what I'm gonna do to its I'm
going to create another type called user
who's going to be an array of user like
that
I'm going to say that currents Bob - or
so I'm gonna just finally copy that
I'm gonna say Bob - I'm gonna say close
this thing and let's see current use are
equal and now we have Bob 1 and Bob -
and now if I see that Bob 1 dot but now
if I see use our da so it's an array so
here we can add for each I can see use
our and now look what the underpin
because flow on the stand user is that
so now I can pin this thing in see now I
know
okay so this is user to know I can see
user that H I can control ugh this thing
if I want any going downward so make
sure you have the command start with
better note in this that yet go to you
comment and say yarn start three three
have no err because I get that from here
so I'm going to deal in my opinion now
what I'm gonna say it's example here you
can maybe say how I can say that here we
want to get the length
of the name well I'm gonna say name can
be Neil and I'm gonna say your bottom
one's going to be though
now if here I want to see console.log
use our the name Lent
now where am I to complete Don King if
you get that ask you a question and
that's going to be surely because land
cannot be accessible on a possibility in
dual value so I will have burned because
look here what can happen if I start
man floats awesome
you just sick man I don't need to run my
cocoon and lose this to salon of my
prisoner slide so now what you can do
for for making sure that's gonna work
we're gonna see if use are that name
it's not know
like that now I can take it and put it
right there and now if I go to my I turn
and I run it
now you work so you see the power of
real-time mode can save your life
it's just crazy I don't need to run my
code I can just keep on my IDE might
exit or whatever or you call you and
code and code and Conan give the project
give what the client asks it should I
write and have less board so when
someone change here and then say country
here
I mean someone came here I'm gonna see
country it's gonna be a number arrow
what is that you see that around it's
gonna save your life I'm gonna show you
on one of my projects or the project I'm
working right now on the live coding
it's a cryptocurrency mobile app what
I'm gonna show you that it's all that
can be really awesome to work with
example VI can be dots and stuff like
that so our work in its I create a type
folder where I'm gonna put the type yes
you can add many file with the type what
why is because this way you have first
thing you can modular you stuff in other
things it's gonna be easier to work with
so you just need to put the name export
so here I'm gonna see a data type of
holding data export this type so you see
your app price total pretty string blah
blah blah so this thing what I do is
when I work at the front end example and
I get something from the back end I'm
gonna take the console log of the value
I'm gonna get from the back end and I'm
gonna paste it there and I'm gonna just
change all the value one by one and this
one I'm gonna make sure that I'm gonna
always have the thing the back ends
almost send me so I'm gonna know it's an
area that I create an action file for my
Redux action where I can import my
holding data remember
here you need to put tight because
that's going to be a type so you say
import type to the bracket and you
import your stuff
after that I can clean my action and I
can see example this action and new ting
action we're gonna add a type of this
thing and now example if I change I'm
gonna show you you wanna see if I change
this section right there and I change oh
I can show
I'm not holding data we'll see first
thing we have always autocomplete I'm
gonna say coin and now I'm action what
I'm doing here it's a thing you're gonna
see this thing means or example you want
to create a name who's gonna be type of
string or a number now if I do this I
can say 3
but you see quark now it's just
yesterday and we just go crazy about
that but now you see I can see tree and
I also can say hello that mean or where
I create a an action who's gonna calm
action and I thought that when I go to
my reduce are like but if I go to my
reduce or call cryptos III import my
action I just show you right there
well I got on Mike Shanin who's going to
be smart enough to see action that type
and you're gonna get the case of where
Iowa up and now I'm gonna have the
autocomplete on my action I'm gonna say
ah that's wired up Heidi you see so not
that good and just help you all your
process and the awesome thing to it
that's gonna work with a component if
you see here I'm gonna create a type of
props and a type of state almost like
you did with peptide but now you can put
that right there
so now is ne'er it's a boolean because
right there so now if I change that to
be extreme I'm gonna get an error
because this thing a return a boolean so
all your code that I just become more
heartbreaking stuff like that so I just
hope you enjoyed this little pizza
I mean I was just doing this for fun and
just I want to help you guys like I was
held by someone else and stuff like that
so I think it's good to just put it
there for helping people we want to
start with this technology but just get
over one with all the documentation I'm
the I guess of documentation so that's
why I'm doing video oh I watch with you
so I hope you enjoy it and we're gonna
talk to the other good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
