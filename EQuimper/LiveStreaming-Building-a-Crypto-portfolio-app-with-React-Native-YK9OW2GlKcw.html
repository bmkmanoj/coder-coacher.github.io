lol Oh so for the one who followed this
live streaming from the beginning would
have ad in the past day because I have
code it's a very select library and also
add ad immutable GS library to what I've
used we select it's because I want to
make sure then then I'm gonna catch and
memorize my value so I don't need to
always like you're videoing the logic
about not eligible but I don't want my
code to need to work when they they can
just like get the same data as before so
example if I show you the border I'm
going to show you what I mean by that
it's if I show you the debugger you're
gonna see some get holding and and stuff
like that get old doing and all this
value so each each cell we're gonna add
the get holding get total get amount
change so get holding is this thing here
get total is this thing here and after
that get among change is this thing here
and as you can see this all the the
color I need to like all the value I
need to parse and make them like walk
the way I want in my app but now if I go
here and I come back in here I don't
even need to recall again this value so
I have memorize my value so that's what
we said like it's really awesome but as
you can see I'm not using we select I
using we we select so what is this
library it's because we select the thing
that's the word its if you want to make
it work with like a list of like many
component you need to like a create a
function make state and make maps that
you props and I think it's ours like I
mean the whole to always do this kind of
stuff so someone had almost like for
this librarian make it better so this is
where I quit a cache selector finally
the only thing it change with the reset
egg is this thing you war finally you
need to call your function right there
already and you just say like a key to
carry the value so here I just pass the
coin so like I told you to as
the results immutable so what is video
experts estimate a ball so I've changed
Riddick Cruces and what I've done it's
I've put my initial state with now a map
so now if you see in my debugger and I
open you now you can see now my state
now it's a map where I have many entries
and now by doing this so I just want to
make sure everything is gonna stay
meat-a-ball what I've done to its I've
create all my videos are now our record
like that and now the way I've managed
it it's now as you can see - it's I've
created my video star and now each K is
gonna call another function like that so
by doing this I just think is gonna be
easier to scale because I don't get I
get this nice apps which statement we're
gonna have a lot of stuff so I'm gonna
do the same ear for this logic here so
it's going to be really quick so I'm
gonna call that just check our deal and
you will see era total team you know
what I'm getting the stain in the action
and this function here finally gonna
take this all this logic from here and
that's it so now what I'm gonna do it's
from ear no anything I need to do it's
return to Gold team I'm gonna pass the
state in the action
nothing more and now because flow type
it's really also flow type is really
also actually is the front whenever you
so I don't need the action what I want
to say it's float eyes be awesome so
when I pass action here you know then
when he came here you're gonna take my
action from my action in arms from you
because remember my action are this type
of thing now when I see the same here
for toggle search bar way I just need a
stick to and I'm gonna just take this
logic and now I'm gonna just return here
so the straight bar where I pass the
stick
okay just clean it like that I just
think that make Michael keener what do
you think about that you can just let me
know in the comments I just think we
make the code smarter for the one we
never really use me table yes I mean
this will you just make sure that
everything it's immutable in your app so
like the value don't change it's always
a new value and I just like it I was
doing this before like if you follow
some of my video I always do like China
you know like the dog stay blah blah
blah but the thing it's witty me table
you make it and that will be more
performant with big collection and now
what I've done here it's funny this is
the way you need to get data from an
object now it's you need to call the
like the like kind of value here so when
I say stake that get is search bar show
that's gonna go there because I'll work
in the table it's be I'm using map and
map so on that it's like a key and a
value so this is our mat mat years so
this is a map like yeah so when you say
get get the key I'm and I'm gonna get a
value finally and now here as you can
see when I want to toggle the search for
any it's what I do it's like whatever
our variable here we're gonna be true or
false by doing the the difference of
what it was here so it's pause now this
thing gonna be true and now this is all
you can change the screen immutable is
by doing steak that set and you pass the
new value from here now by calling down
so it's a sticker like that so this is
what I've done in the past and also I am
NOT the value then now you can add you
Bitcoin holding and stuff like that but
I'm maybe gonna use real for this now
what I want to show you is you remember
what the recent like I'd just show you
it's now when I click here you see I
0.18 percent better $96 look at that if
I click here now that I've changed that
no that didn't change yet because it's
five minutes I'm gonna wait or maybe I
can click here yeah you see now I change
so you see now I recalculate my stuff
here they reselect just told me that I
recalculate so now it's zero zero one
now if I come back look here I get zero
zero one so it changed this is real a
button this value didn't change because
now if I click on you look well
now I get fouls no that was zero 17 and
not 0 13 oh no this is what I've done
and also I had the way you can have you
Odin and you holding here so now you can
see like example someone have 13 Bitcoin
right now you have the 53 thousand bucks
and now in the past hour you get an
updating of 5 yet finally plus $5 in 38
because you get zero point zero one
dollar person this is what I've done and
also if I want to update every day I'm
gonna just do this and now I'm gonna
recalculate everything and you see so
the thing about we select you you need
to think about its resetting never going
to recalculate himself is the parent
object never gonna update so it's really
good for performance so now this is what
I add so now you can really add value
example here I'm gonna see except I'm
gonna say I'm gonna add maybe like every
Pope so I'm gonna take repo I'm gonna
say boy I don't know like 20 people like
that sorry it's really so because of the
debugger I'm gonna click sim and now
what happened now it's now if I get back
here now after the repo so 2d repo if
you vote equals $5 847 and in the past
our people get one cent better let's
just follow the pattern I'm gonna just
remove the debugger right now because
you really make my app really slow so
this is the app right now and I think
the performance is really good with
wheelie right now pretty awesome I kind
of like it with the pagination container
I really start to understand video and
we make my life so much easier with all
your fetching now this is what I've done
with the my wallet so as you know you
know what I've done to its ear you can
see here it's the like the value of the
team you can also refer to this thing
here you're gonna have like a graph I'm
gonna change it for in the future for
for sure and I'm gonna change all this
stuff don't worry about that but now
what I've done it's my wallet here so
here you're gonna see all your value
yeah I think I'm gonna just maybe put
some value like no value no I said
something like that when you don't have
an asset and I'm gonna almost have the
same cell for here just to keep track of
what you have so that you can have the
total dollar who's going to be the total
of all your amount of that all you Arman
of asset you are and you again in the
past hour etc well I think too it's
maybe like if you click on it
gonna be 25 or if you kid again there's
gonna be seven day or something like
that or maybe I'm gonna maybe just put
some against some kind of button here
and now when you click here this is
where you get your wallet with your
stuff like that so I think that just
make the wallet a bit better so you're
gonna get all your stuff because in the
past I was thinking about making that in
the screwing but now I think is going to
make more sense this way
so yeah so this is what I've done in the
past weekend I didn't even stream
because I didn't have a really good
internet and the and also so I think
I've put some to do I remove the Tim
provider
after that check warning with animation
yeah okay yeah use for matter yeah this
is the thing to watch I've created I
create a format number library it's like
inside my app friendly where Irfan any
what I've done its I just have some
function we're gonna have reformat the
number you know I've put dozen space so
this doesn't space I don't take all the
credit
I search this thing on Stack Overflow
this thing what II do oh thank you even
and hello how are you
so this stuff some space here what I do
finally it just put a specific thousand
so it's it easier to read so if you go
there you see 65 billion 186 million or
so it's much more easy to read so this
is what I've green here this doesn't
states so this is the value here what
I've put here it's because you know like
this was do code are really smart to
example if you use this function and you
say it starts on space and I just do
this now you can see my comment I just
put here so return a number for giving
space blah blah example so you can put
an example that's going to be this value
so it's video or someone you want to use
many library like many function in
Europe after that as you know in very on
it's there then if I don't have any
value I'm gonna get an error we say
value is required so that's gonna be the
red screen after that I have created
this function where I need to write some
test where this function finally gonna
just finally change the value to make it
a number and money what I mean by money
just you're gonna just finally give to
to this small after the verbal
the the her name 2d small as you see
like now a change here at 0 0 1 5 2 D 8
now I click here you didn't get changed
ya get change point 23 and now you see
point 23 so this is the beauty of really
oh I'm good to even thank you to us and
now this function is the to money and
this function is money talent or what
you do is finally take the to money in a
detergent space for this kind of stuff
here and also I'd write some test for
this so I write this with Jess where I
just some kind of kind of little
function finally really good to just
write your test for your own project I
think so here I can just say your test
and then we gonna run all my tests and
I'm gonna just check everything is still
work and you see we think they were to
have 10 tests if you I want to see the
coverage I think I can say I just get
the coverage and I'm gonna get here not
a lot but you see then I can have kind
of this kind of stuff done and I have my
value add this thing down on my wall ok
so one thing I need to write test the
two morning but I think at two money
I've write test so I can remove my to do
here I think that to money it's pretty
simple to test I mean I just put some
value and I just say this is kind of
stuff I need to return maybe like I can
just enter an hour I don't want so I'm
gonna just say test tell the - watch I
don't need to be set in and I'm gonna
just say - money what I want is I want
to inspect if I call this function which
I don't know like at this value that 89
like that and the value should be equal
to 290 I think so but I'm gonna make it
crash first I'm gonna say 99 I'm gonna
make it first
yeah it's 90 so I text looks good
always remember for your test first
perfect so I have this thing done I'm
gonna need to create a selector
forget my total dollar or so but I'm
gonna need to do yes I'm gonna just
click back here so what I need to do
it's not inside my state I need to get
all my crypto in my entities as you can
see how all my TT so this is all my
translation I've met some people in
Bitcoin and this is on my transaction
now what I'm gonna need to do is to
reduce everything from here so take all
my stuff and just some this thing here
so this is what I'm gonna do I think so
so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
create some selector I'm gonna just call
that well I think I'm gonna maybe change
the name for that in the future when I
just take the same import this kind of
stuff and also money thousand I'm gonna
need all this stuff okay so here what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create a
selector I'm gonna just check back Oh
any okay yeah this function get a set
entities
okay yeah I'm gonna say get kryptos
entities finally that's gonna be only
this thing I don't need the props can
make it pretty simple okay
okay
and I'm gonna have a card called wallet
total imma get all that on about this
thing's gonna be a quid selector Creed
character and in the function I'm gonna
say yet crypto entities now this won't
find any words gonna do here I'm gonna
add entities that's going to be on my
entity so just for testing this thing
okay entities I'm gonna say entities
just for testing this thing perfect
I'm gonna take my function I take my
function I'm gonna go to my wallet
screen okay perfect I'm gonna connect
here I'm gonna say I don't know like it
well total amount I'm gonna just
definitely this function oh I'm going to
need to import it today I called really
really bad don't know what I happen okay
I'm gonna get this thing now what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna get this now if I
click here what thing happen what I was
inspecting it's when I click here I will
I've seen my entities function calling
this thing here so my entities even not
work this is what what that mean I think
so are maybe say return 0 I know why
it's because you ready to put state and
I need to our team and our can do this
and now I'm gonna say that I think
that's a bee was all right that didn't
get cold
No
man weather why is this arrow well thing
get bullet total I pass it the street so
I get coal here it seems to work I mean
it's my what an asset I know that's
going to be the posh you know what I'm
sure it's because I didn't get cow it's
Sookie just gonna need video soon
you
pretty sure the other screen I didn't
use it anymore that's the thing that's
why I'm sure yeah you see I get my
entities right there yeah my identities
i we see we get a yellow one and the
entity so first thing I'm gonna maybe
just remove this console.log II get
queasy so get there get to building get
to tow and get a much change we can have
a refresh Onegin entities so perfect so
many entities it's a map I'm gonna have
entries on it
finally my Bitcoin who it's another map
with this map we don't have another
foreign trees because this one I have
much more but the IATA here I have only
one entry okay so that's pretty good
right now this is a really good point
and now sorry if I'm really bad imitable
I mean I've started work with amitabh
OGS this weekend so sometime it's pretty
hard for me to get a word
you
not reduce here I'm gonna need map so
it's almost like the plains I'll ask you
from what I've seen so now here I can
seek coin and I'm gonna just print a
Bitcoin I'm gonna I can remove this
thing so now if I do this we should
supposed to see week 1 yeah it's another
map ok so pretty good now we get every
coin so all that's gonna work so now I
need to think about I'm gonna add
Bitcoin ooh this one's gonna have a map
of main thing so we can have mini map
there's going to be the same for library
so what I need for is its to loop over
each one of them each one of the coins
here this is a map or I should do a
reducing sign of the reduce
lapin videos or to reduce because I mean
if I do one map I can say total amount
by default so that's gonna be a number
and by default gonna be 0 and now what I
can do here I think it's doing coin that
we do here what I'm gonna have each
transaction but it's a reduce I think
it's better we do and I'm gonna do this
in two I'm gonna have your a transaction
and what I'm gonna do for nearly its I'm
gonna just say total amount equal equal
plus equal to 4 then you do a plus the
value of the transaction that get and
now as you can see that's going to be
get and then 3 is gonna have an object
and that's gonna be price total pay no
price bad coin like a yeah I need to get
the total of these two thing amount of
coin and price bike one multiple by each
so I need to get here I'm gonna say
turns total price equal transaction that
get thing its amount of coin here but
I'm gonna need to first thing course
float this thing
why float is because they can have a
it's a very small multiple by parsefloat
in a I'm gonna see transaction that yet
and now I'm gonna so it sorry twice bad
Queen
not really bad this is not
cannot use the bat price back coin here
why is because this is the thing you put
and not this value because you see
iodides 52 bucks or I paid her out of 52
bucks but now I attach 56 bucks got 56
and see right there so it's really not
the same price come on we'll need you
get my value but now what do I'm gonna
do just to make sure then that can be
where I'm gonna see like each one it's
50 bucks that's it
and I'm gonna set it up right like that
and I'm gonna just set the N here you
just return Toto and finally here I can
just current tutto equal this thing's
gonna be a number and now you just
finally return toto
so now if this thing can work what we're
supposed to see it's gonna be the total
who don't gonna make any sense
but we're gonna refer this thing and
we're gonna get an error
and no need to call the get do this is
an app I think I can get from immutable
immutable I can get his map is is a
value map no I know I overkill this
project but you know it's for me to
learn in table
is here is is immutable
well just check you
map is not a B that can work map is
false this is a vicar
you transaction screen a new map
okay that's the thing why everything's
great I think
that's a point where everything gray I
think that's really the point it's not
I'm passing this action coin it's not a
map so it's going to be the object
see the thing that's why that's why you
know what I'm sure that's boring because
I was sure that I did something good
here
oh
then I create I'm gonna say I'm gonna
buy some Bitcoin cash I'm gonna sell boy
- so and I'm gonna send arm and that's
the thing and I'm so bad with immutable
that's crazy
so
for my transaction here it's an object
okay I'm following here the thing its
ear my well app and then I can just say
these things should be coin engine table
you know I'm gonna see Qin Qiu okay here
you see I have get my map true coin is
immutable you the thing it's in why
don't have access to the is is immutable
there is just brand-new
hey ro I mean I'm not sure about Windows
I never ever windows in my live almost I
think I have used a Windows like 10
years ago
I just think genymotion you need to make
sure then you have your abs set up
let me check a bit on the web sorry
about that I never windows so do you
talk about the debugger of react native
or the reactor 2 debugger they're like
the electron s
and I'm gonna keep this way for now I
may be I'm gonna need to so familiar
that's gonna just follow it this year we
don't have to get now I can do the this
rule and I can have to do make sure the
transaction it's a map
maybe I can just take this thing and put
it to on my crypto here yeah so now I'm
gonna just check from my if I go to my
wallet and I search for my wallet my
wallet should I have a total amount with
some math yeah why do you think become a
map I mean why is flow times
Oh
yeah I can maybe say tuto supposed to go
there like a total what you know what I
think I'm gonna just take this thing
so time only
okay yeah the total 17,000 do that was
do that make sense that's the thing I
mean I don't that don't make any sense
oh yeah that connects make sense because
I see if we think worth 50 bucks so if I
had 13 21 13 - 13 13 plus 9 it's 22 plus
13 is 52 just ran without 350 - 350 -
not the PI about 50 17 6 617 yeah that
makes sense
perfect thing it's now this number here
but now this thing
Donna said
think you should have supposed to us
total amount boom that's it remove that
for now so here what I'm going to need
to to its get prize for each coin at
this moment that's the thing now it's my
it's cursive really but I like it but
I'm not that good with it
yes all this video are always saved by
YouTube I don't do nothing I've seen
that the first time I have done it so I
think take it like a 1-hour to be
processed at the end so it should be
there at midnight when I'm gonna finish
her around 10:30
perfect yet I hope you can learn a bit
like a helping a lot in this in this
live streaming this thing right now is
just I know how to do this if I was
using just plain videos what I think
it's about Villa it's I need to get the
cash value I need to get the cash value
of the price right right now right there
finally I really need to get the cash
like I have no choice right now
we did get cash from Korea like will
Apollo Apollo I know how to do this but
the thing is fetching that I are a
client Katrina key
oh yeah for a personal project
but I need to get my cash
Kushina graph
oh yeah yeah I think we are native is
built for this kind of project like
where you just read like JSON data and
you have a list of stuff like Twitter
our Instagram and stuff like this
relayed that score that gets toward that
us so if I'd look to my wheeler
I think I've create a store get cash
right there then I'll just check if this
thing can work
yes graph drill is kind of easy it's
with Apollo relates can aboard Apollo
wall graph curl is pretty easy
yet stored Elliman
oh boy ah everything right there but man
sure that don't make any sense
oh yeah I've quit my cash finally take
yeah I think it's 30 minutes 30 so 1,000
so 300 minutes so 200 minutes well it's
four four five our new
no I have my cash so I'm gonna get my
cash respond okay so this is what I have
right here operation name variable if
Kure cash blah blah blah okay so from
what I've seen right now is I'm gonna
need to save the crypto ID I think did I
I need to see the crypto ID okay so this
is I think I'm gonna do right now what
I'm gonna save what I'm gonna see my
thumb right there I'm gonna get action
that coin okay so my action that's coin
so inside a quick toast here I'm gonna I
miss something and this is my holding
data okay so I'm gonna first thing
change my data so for my holding data
I'm gonna see oh I've already the ID but
what is the ID the ID is this thing
Bitcoin okay I'm gonna say crypto ID
this is gonna be a string but now I'm
going to change this ID ear to B string
to but and then you're going to be a
string thing it's now oh my crypto gonna
work now it's what I'm gonna add a coin
here I'm gonna say that crypto ID and
now also I mean I'm gonna need to change
a lot of while I've done that I think in
not my order selector
I mean this one I can keep the ID I'm
gonna be unique
maybe now we're gonna face
okay so now when I'm going to add
another thing I'm gonna say I'm gonna
add some light coin I buy 50 then I add
this now I'm gonna have undefined
add the name name ID okay toy DS not
pass here yep
why did I miss my stuff in my reduce or
it's going to be crypto idea I mean it's
this crypto ID right there it's because
when I add
okay surely be there on submit click on
scorn right there you see right now yeah
that would be ID now I'm gonna have
crypto ID was gonna be selected crypto
that crypto ID but the selected crypto
ID it's not there so where there's my
selected crypto cane so select that
crypto so that people's gonna be a coin
and my coin I get my coin coming from my
model I think in my model the ID year
it is what I need to pass the idea if I
pass the IDM when I need to run my relay
watch so now should be good on this
thing here now I have it now here I get
any that's the thing okay I get some any
value so now should go change that into
my data for your essence a ID now know
by doing this what I get as I need to
think it's gonna be crypto ID crypto ID
is gonna be any - price back coin is
gonna be any so crypto ID is gonna be
any should be good now so now if i
refresh this thing and I go there and I
see now which one I don't have boy maybe
I'm gonna say me a boy if five I send up
now I'm gonna get crypto entity's name
with the price P blah blah blah and I
have my ID right there so this is the
important part for for really
my little rigged-up gonna work you know
why because the thing is the prize I'm
gonna get there the person I'm gonna get
there you need to follow the real prize
of the like of the thing right but the
thing is I don't fetch the one on the
road by default at the beginning other
touch nation so I'm gonna need to manage
that too
have maybe one other ID it's this wallet
gonna have its own Curie for like will
really Curie who's going to fetch like I
have done with my ad corn model I can no
like this thing I've done right there
when I click here and I can choose a
crypto but this thing as you can see
here I fetching I'm fetching like the
one on the other I could to right there
okay but I don't know if you see what
I'm gonna do it's finally this page

stuff maybe person changed 7 day and
percent change 24 hour and that's gonna
be only what I'm gonna need right there

right there
why not others
so wallet errors well at time would take
one asset so this one's gonna be the one
where I need to do with really okay so
what I'm gonna use for really it's gonna
be the fragment container so I'm not
quite experienced too much with really
so I always need to check that what I've
done as you see man look at all the
stuff you need to do so you need to have
a crib renderer and I'm gonna just open
my own screen on on my other screen
frenemy
oh yeah row row row
sorry if I don't told you name really
right I'm French on my accent sometime
it's really
Hey I don't know I mean it's my personal
project so we good I try to go too fast
as I can so I just need affirming
container on you
so yeah what I can say so all you work
with really friendly it's you I'm gonna
save this one so what I'm gonna do it's
you you need to import from a relay so
react really I think it's frag it's
really act really oh yeah I really
runtime react really so it's gonna be
create container what is for mangled on
are
so rasoi
hey hey
yeah thank you
don't know why I don't have anymore my
autocomplete from this or Sudoku I need
to do this after that here what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna see cons well I'm
not even in the good screen what had I
said I need to go here I'm gonna say
count well as set clinic 10 equal this
thing
now here what I can say it's cons frag
man container equal create friend and
container where you pass your screen
like that after that from my life
remember it's you put your graph you
well yeah you have QL right there and
now what do you say
almost like this is same one year so
this Fryman right there but this one
that need to have the same name as you
screen
here I need that and I'm gonna need a
price USD and maybe the crypto ID like
that I need every damn so I don't even
need this this connection in writing I
mean I don't need that I don't need this
thing like that and now I can export
default I'm gonna need to import my
career-ender were coming from really you
too
create when there are we're gonna take
my fragment container frag man container
and now here what I need to pass to it's
only the Curie so this is what I need to
pass once as that inside an object and I
need no param Singh funny no I don't
need nothing here and I say whether I
said truly same here and this thing need
to be the same name here so now we're
gonna check if that work so something
you don't gonna wait
I do feel add-on type viewer I'm gonna
need this connection I think so so I'm
gonna need to have this connection right
there
oh man I'm gonna I don't gonna
complicate myself what I'm gonna do I
use the script over here and now
it's like a war now
oops something went wrong
you
you know on our work thing is I don't
think I needed to add this thing now see
III don't need this thing my crew get
killed from here this thing 20 I mean I
get my renderer from here I don't think
I'm gonna eat this thing yeah that's
what I was thinking just we call you
yeah looks like Warner so now I'm gonna
get all my stuff but now what I want to
show you it's now what I've come I can
get from here and that's not what I can
get from here it's now I can call on my
get that all I'm out here I can call my
props too and here I can just call my
props from here so what why I'm doing
this it's not what I can do it's so
funny what would that mean it's my
selector of my wallet here this one
you're gonna have access to the props
too so what I can say it's maybe saying
like cons get kryptos get Kryptos
I'm going to suggest crypto and you're
going to see what I mean it's now here
I'm gonna have the props
and what I'm gonna do sits we turn their
name their props I just because I want
to go fast here and now that your butt
ear here so yeah I'm gonna have kryptos
get toes created toes
now I can just log we yeah and I'm
making an application light yeah oh yeah
we'll be near yay Carlos the dog always
always like that I have a small little
dog and you know small little dogs
always always make this oh now if I do
this what I mean it's now if I'm
fetching here I should see my tiptoes do
we work oh my girl look at this and now
I get my viewer in my crypto and my edge
where I get all my time with the node
with the null in the price boom boom
boom right there so now I can say get
crypto so that's gonna be from viewer
and this is a viewer kryptos edge view
are Kryptos and now you see so what I'm
gonna sit I'm gonna get get crypto price
look at that I'm gonna say get crypto
okay okay yeah yet you told that edge
edge like that and now if I'm refreshing
my screen now look what good Apple
I get my arrow right there okay
okay you see now the thing so now what I
can do man that's gonna be so bad I
think in in performance but I have no
choice at all on Aria I'm gonna say
current price equal kryptos creep toes
that's fine so that's given be an array
sorry I'm gonna do that fine
I'm gonna have an item and what I'm
gonna do is I tend that cursor equal my
transaction that crypto that ID so
that's gonna be the same no that's don't
gonna be
okay I know it was gonna be item that
node dot ID equal this thing and what I
want give me back the price USD okay so
now we're gonna just check price if my
could go well price equal price come
alright error I can refresh and now if
you work
nope crypto ID already I did you know
why it's me because the I did change ear
I get this thing so I'm gonna check for
the name people like one - name okay
check in the state crypto entity name ID
q3 I know why it's because this one
don't don't have an ID so what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna just purge my gonna
purge my thing here
you
they use require homescreen crying I
should have money thousand I think not
there it's gonna be all yeah it's gonna
be there
this thing is good it's not the thing
the things gonna be in my selector on my
coin on my crypto why so many thousand
here
I have no audience I'm supposed to
return nil for my wallet that GS 29:29
total I'm on here I'm gonna just say you
know zero
okay
now I'm gonna add one I'm gonna say boy
1 Bitcoin
fries on the phone
okay you know I think that's gonna work
so what that means--it's now I have
three thousand nine two thousand yeah
you see that the price oh no I'm gonna
say I'm gonna boy summit a room right
there I'm gonna say I'm gonna buy 28 mm
okay I'm gonna save it and now you see I
get nine thousand because 28 mm give me
five hundred five thousand bucks I'm
gonna just need to check that when the
values gonna change and now I just think
I get some weird thing it's descriptive
stuff here don't really know why is get
called this selector you get wallet
right there I think get called because
they crypto get we involve every time
you go to another maybe I can check for
that this thing that I really need to be
checked for performance after that you
know what I can maybe check it's this
thing here what I can maybe return it's
gonna be
when they saying I don't even need to
return the thing I mean I think okay so
now you see so I have the price right
there yeah I need
so now we're gonna check 9800 box right
there 40% I'm gonna need to wait five
minutes change because I have a radius
cashing work for five minutes after that
what I like about that it's now I can
change this thing after that and use the
real value you are
really really bad what I've done for my
but I mean if you know about JavaScript
you know then if I use fine like I do
here at least I'm gonna stop so all fine
work it's a looping over you will ml and
at that time you find something
stuff so at least if I have 100 LM n I'm
gonna always have 100 mm so and that I
don't think that's gonna be and oh you
say that like yeah all all n plus-1
something like that because my loop it's
not complete
just if example it's the 100 like it's
the last item you're gonna go over that
100 but you start at the time you start
right when we find it so I'm gonna just
keep track of this thing gonna take a
picture I'm gonna go to my take my
picture for a steak
so that was a pride
and that was other prize
okay
now if I click on one I just remove the
debugger for now wait five minutes it's
long I just want to see then if
this.value ear update deck my wallets
gonna update you guys what I mean it's
long
also yeah I would like to have my
percent with to number at the end so
this is something I'm gonna need to do
so the planets this very will change
when I'm gonna apply this and these two
were you gonna change not the other one
you gotta work so here what I'm waiting
it's 14 change right there arrow bye
have a good night
I hope you enjoy it
yeah okay you see that tree I'm gonna go
back dot three change one dollar change
so the price Air has changed and now if
I click to my wallet so I'm supposed to
have lost four bucks from here boom oh
man
work and now you see so now if I update
everything now that is required how much
when GS to 44th
42 to 44 42 inside Queen GS oh I go to
44 selector get a man change so you see
here so that's the thing here we'll get
a problem and crypto that GS 57 so that
wouldn't be the same so get among change
right there
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just
go to my format monetizing right there
Quinn GS 244
so
okay I see something it's here I'm gonna
need to have the math.abs now should be
good maybe on everything
okay I'm gonna check something here if
math.abs person change equal zero
eternal you know I think gonna work
so I mean math.abs it's if if it's minus
zero zeros gonna work on both so that
means I think is this thing it's pretty
strange where I get percentage change
here at zero maybe before I was like
that for air I should keep track of this
so yeah I mean by doing this I think I'm
gonna be good so I hope you enjoyed this
