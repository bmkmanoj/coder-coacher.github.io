three for the random adults together so
today we're going to complete it to do
delete the to do and delete all to do so
don't lose time we're gonna start right
now
so when we finished last time we add
this thing we can create it to do we
have the to do showing this with that
state it is that prop that to do and we
map over here but now we want to
complete so first thing we need to do is
to let the user our computer to do so
inside the app I'm going to just put
input of type check box box and I'm
going to add no name no ID but there's
going to be the value of complete
because we're going to be structuring
the complete right there so now if I do
if I show you that we're going to add
now if I click enter I get my to do like
this so each to do I'll is input and the
input but here if I click I think really
change like we don't go go the redox so
we won't struggle this so this is what
we're going to do first thing here I'm
going to export I'm going to do church
or maybe complete to do so we're going
to compute a to do so that's gonna be a
function complete to do the first thing
we need to ask yourself if all can we
make easy for us to computer to do we
need to have something unique to make a
shirt that's going to be dis to do we
want to complete so again think about it
what we have unique the last time right
this the ID so we're going to pass an ID
right there yeah I'm going to return the
object like are always with a complete
to do and I'm going to pass the ID so
now I'm going to add access the ID by
doing action that ID and time I reduce R
I'm going to import the complete to do
in here I'm going to create my new case
oops
call complete to do an air that's going
to be I'm going to return and now I need
to think about our can I make it in the
table so we want to be done on one two
like change this array we want to give
us a new array so a way we can do this
is by doing map so if we can do return
state so the state is an array that map
and we can add some item or we can call
this to do here what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to assume when we map to do it one
so it's one object so what I'm going to
say if to do that ID equal the action
that IDs of the ID we passed from Vidocq
I'm gonna so here I'm gonna so this is a
ternary so if it's true
we gonna right there
return an object what I'm going to do to
do so we keep what the to-do app so you
had a technic complete we want a text an
idea we don't want to change it a I'm
going to see complete gonna be equal to
the opposite of the to do that complete
so the object we have but we want to
give the opposite so what I mean it's a
boolean so true false false true and L
I'm gonna return every item like that so
if I run a format with prettier I get
this way and bit better so now here I
map over all my to do it has to do equal
that if the ID of the to do equal the
action that ID and changing the complete
to be true or false and else I return
a.b to do so enzyme action and my
computer do so now I need to pass my
action so here at the top I'm going to
pass my complete to do from the action
to do I'm going to pass it put it right
there to give it in the props just to be
sure item you do so item oops I was to
do sorry
so now because I put the complete to do
now I have access to this function right
here inside my props so now I just need
to create a function I'm going to create
a function called and complete we're
going to take an ID and finally gonna
this that proves that complete to do and
going to pass the ID so here is that the
input I'm going to do an unchanged this
that and the complete but I want to pass
my ID on the pass ID so you want to call
the function right here and now I'm
going to pass the ID coming here so now
if I do this and I should a console I'm
going to create a new and well I'm going
to create another one voila so now if I
click on mobile I'm gonna get complete
to do I pass the ID and now my to do
next step my array now add access to
complete it now it's true
so if you seen the reductive tool to do
first one complete false sudden one is
true I'll click on the first one air now
the first one going to be true and
because it's opposed it I can uncomment
this thing perfect so now we have a way
to complete it to do now if we see in
the action we want to delete that to do
so again air inside import I'm going to
have a button error say delete me just
be sure and that's about the visa I
think that's going to go there so if I
say hello okay
then link me perfect so now I want to
delete it to do all gonna are we going
to do this in a create an action here or
ECT they leg it to do button export
function delete to do again like
complete we want to get an ID that's it
we decided that's going to be easy for
us to know which one we want to delete
we return the same it's no more you
that's going to look the same but this
way it's easy it's per function so we
cannot make a lot of logic here you can
but it's not the best thing to do here
I'm going to have a case they need to do
an ad here really easy to do with
JavaScript we return a state we have a
new array when we do we turn the filter
it Emmanuel right
we're going to return this to do with
the to do it's not what we're going to
return the to do that ID is equal to the
action that I did we pass so finally we
return a V to do which is not equal to
the action that's ID so air you're going
to add this delete to do function and
pass the VD to do right here we're going
to copy paste this sign on also we do we
select shift command D in the Mac shift
control V in the window I think and I'll
delete as an ID and now I'm going to
call his that Club that delete to do so
that I'm going to take this function I'm
going to do on click I'm going to the
same of what I've done to the other one
but now I'm going to have the ID like
that I'm going to just format okay so
now if I do this and I say L oh well Wow
now if I click on delete example I want
to delete the world I'm gonna get now I
get my well remove hello and really
perfect so we have everything we need
now to start off I can check I can
delete cetera but now I want to delete a
B to do so what I'm going to do is yeah
I'm going to put an H R I'm going to put
a D or first a link at Rick a line I'm
going to put an H R I'm going to reboot
a break line and I'm going to put a
button say delete all complete we want
to delete every complete one so again
this is the beauty of real assets now
it's so much easy to add a new feature
delete how to do you need our complete
to do it better
a big function name like that is much
more easy to read export function delete
export function delete our complete to
do this functions take no argument
because we have already what we need in
the reducer so here I'm going to return
a type of delete all complete to do and
that's nothing more to do right the
reducer now I'm going to import the
delete I'll complete to do I'm going to
create a new case and not this one going
to be much more easy than this one
almost the thing say that filter but now
we return to do with the to do that's
complete so we return the to do that
complete it's true like that we return
today the one who is not complete the
always false
so here when I import delete all to do
I'll complete to do I'm going to pass it
right there ya go top and delete all
complete this one take nothing so hopes
take a single thing but we take a
function alga this that proves that
delete out adapt and now this one going
to be easy on click this is the M Delta
V all complete method because we don't
pass an argument we don't need to have
the color function right there so now
what I'm going to show you
hello well me Wow like that now if I
click did it I'll complete the thing a
test but the videos are get it but
nothing attend because we have no
complete I'm going to complete hello I'm
going to complete me exactly did all
complete that's it
we just keep the wormwood or complete it
true a completed salt so I yeah so I
there's going to be this for this part
so in the next part we're going to start
to jump on making this same stuff with
this but in Ajax requests because this
is a question I get a lot it it's easy
to make it locally inside the data like
that but after that when it's time to
make some network requests that start to
be are so I hope you enjoy click the
like button if you liked it subscribe to
wander notification and when the next
video Kay and I hope you enjoy we see in
the next it is up bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
