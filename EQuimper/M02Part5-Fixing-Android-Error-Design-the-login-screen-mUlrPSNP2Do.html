and has gonna be just about fixing some
Android problem we're gonna get so
because we have make a new kind of main
application in the Java stuff when we do
react Nets of length you don't gonna get
yo library like link get link really
good so what are you gonna do it's
you're gonna need to manage it yourself
so if you open Android studio and you
open inside the Instagram clone main
activity we're gonna finally add a new
package here like we done with the
vector icon pack it so if you go inside
the react native linear area
they ask you to import this library
right there so you go inside Android
studio you put your library right here
your linear gradient you put a comma
here and here you see you in your
ingredient and that's it after that you
rerun you project you find new device
I've done nothing more than just
starting the project and that give me
that so I'm gonna SC gonna take a moment
now it's gonna work but now so you see
the gradient work everything work but
now what happen you see here first thing
we have some underline here and I really
don't like it so what are we gonna do is
we're gonna go inside the login page and
inside the text input so inside the text
input here and here what we're gonna do
is we're gonna add underline color and
Orion and we're gonna say trend it's
real like that so I'm gonna close that
and I'm gonna rerun double kicker so you
see now it's almost like that I always
version on if I type I get nothing okay
all can I manage that it's because the
text input by default have some padding
so what are we gonna do is we're gonna
go inside input and we're gonna sit
padding and we're gonna see 0 by
refreshing again now we get the email
and now when you type you'll get your
element right at the good place so
that's it for this little video that was
just for the Android user oh they're
gonna fix your problem again the codes
gonna be on github I hope you enjoyed
this one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
