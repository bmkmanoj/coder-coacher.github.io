a many well how are you
hey Julian are you hello from Quebec
yeah
yeah I have a big accent I know
yeah so this is what I'm gonna do
it's here
yeah I've look at a chart this is the
one I using the web but not for the if I
want to use it in the mobile I'm gonna
make a need to use a webview and this is
not what I really want I want to keep it
nets if so but yes I think you I know I
told it's awesome
so I finished by set up the relay took
me a while and now you can see like the
new design I hope you enjoy like the new
design with the coloring and stuff like
that so now it's blog with my server
server less back in right there and now
as you can see like all the colors and
everything and plus I put pagination so
if you have an infinite scroll know what
I'm looking it's well I want its ear
what I'm gonna click on one of the coin
I maybe gonna take this third of the
screen where I'm gonna show you part for
your portion of the Bitcoin if you have
one in your portfolio's example if you
have a to any Bitcoin in it and the 20
but like five bitcoins and it's like
eighty percent of your portfolio you're
gonna see that right there inside a P
chart and after that at the bottom ear I
think I'm gonna show the high graph but
this kind of that I don't have right now
so I think what I can do it's adding
maybe the scrolling left and the right
of the value who get the most here I
need to check here and also I've put the
Refresh or if you do this that refresh
and I've put your little light bar will
show like where that you and this plus
here is gonna be for adding a coin in
your pot for you so when you just do a
transaction so you're gonna click here
it's gonna pop up the model and you're
gonna see which token you have boy for
all money and stuff like that
so what I'm gonna do tonight
and here for the data the holding its on
many of this coin you are so as you can
see this is all the same value for now
the total amount of dollar that gives
you so if you have 20 and that cost is
22 I'm gonna show like I'm gonna show
that the value our foreign debt for fond
wealth for 40 and our example if you
lost - points 57 percent I'm gonna
remove that from the value of fewer I'm
using really because my next client
gonna use below and I want to know
really before I get to its project I
never used really before so that's why
I'm on this thing right now start to
have a lot of navigation - and I'll just
start so and here I've quit as I light
tab component so this is the thing will
give you this highlight because by
default the highlight don't work I mean
iOS you just work on Android so this
thing it just take the choose value
committing from the navigation so right
there example and when it's its focus I
just add a border radius a border button
width will get the width of this value
right there nothing too much crazy so
what I'm gonna work do I'm gonna work on
the plus and the model I'm gonna work on
the page when you click example on a
detail of the Bitcoin
yeah I click on maybe I can do this the
absolute icon detail screen
maybe I can do the wallet to will be
better I think I did a while before I do
the adding
Oh
yeah I cannot pop up in the mobile hmm
because it's a part of my tab right
there I click inside that I want to pop
up under the model mmm baby maybe maybe
I don't the wallet I don't want that
that's sorry Wally minister as well
screen
hello ABC yeah it's in reality you
yeah finally I'm gonna need that I've
seen on why
oh thank you even I really appreciate
hope you learn a bit so anyone I think
it's I don't like to having like many
singing screen because I can like the
water so what that mean it's here I had
access to like 100 and cone right now
and while that's going to be the one you
are so maybe I can say I have some
Bitcoin but here I can show Bitcoin here
in the list like I've seen here but what
I can do - it's to square each side or
like one square and the square is going
to be about the value and when you click
on them you're gonna have more
information about your stuff but the
thing is if I do this I need to redo a
design for this kind of core but here
you can see if you are viewing
have anything that's our
I've already in the car so I can maybe
put the car
oh I'm gonna do this
I'm gonna sink this value in my reducer
when I click on them like XA
yeah
affecting the floss the model and I save
the video to my wallet
yeah finally I'm gonna do that
sorry I think that's going to be better
for me for now because I don't get have
value to show for the other one so yes
maybe not just because I need to have my
index address right there now for now
because I want to be faster I'm gonna
just take this thing I'm gonna remove
I'm gonna say crying
wallet today I'm gonna go there I'm
going to go back to my navigation I'm
gonna shift come in the ear and I'm
gonna do command D to get my ad Queen
wallet at coin oh it's not a wallet
screen
and now
all these things gonna work so if he's
working now if I click on my plus button
then I see the model pop up
yeah
not really do it Adar mode
oh that was mud maybe why
in here I'm gonna look at one of my
client coders right I think I'd put a
way to remove the navbar think so this
is what I've done I've removed the
navbar
oh I've done it and that with our clone
I think to Twitter clone
oh yeah but the thing is this one was
easier because it was a nut insert a tab
bar like that
if you don't work as a model I don't
gonna come to get my stuff I'm gonna
just keep it like that I think it's
maybe like that
ya know so I'm gonna don't complicate
myself I'm gonna just remove that and
that's going to be a print screen
okay so I'm gonna add a holding so I'm
gonna do this I think I'm gonna so what
I need I need some kind of value I need
it's like it's like a curb price curve
price right there also I'm gonna need to
check selects like which kind of value
you're gonna have to so what I can do
it's maybe here that so what I'm gonna
do first sorry what I'm gonna do first
it's I'm gonna say the initial of this
word don't gonna refresh it back to the
other one I'm gonna start on my ad coin
yeah it's not like it that was not like
yeah I know what do you mean is just
what I won't like it's like the model
coming from the ground but doesn't
happen because I have my rod in my tab
so maybe I'm gonna do this after but now
I because I just want to have like a
little MVP so you're what I'm gonna say
it so I'm gonna have an ID of maybe like
50 in a width of one of the person and
background colors then I go to my coin
oh okay it's not the second instant a
good bag of color yeah this is this one
you have that
on the latest thing it's gonna be a
input so they're gonna be important so
what I'm gonna do it's what I would call
rapper
Oh
something like that
Simon's five sorry I've just stopped in
French five it's not that much I'm gonna
go with the ten and what I'm gonna do
good son
flex one
maybe more likely what I'm gonna do
it's also
keyboard type new Rico
but maybe need some I don't want to have
my my card you don't need anymore in
this one
oh no we don't need any modeling item
because it's it's flex direction : so
perfect also what I can do is I want to
dismiss my keyboard keyboard from
reality and I want to dismiss it by
singing on outside press or it's going
to be a cow it's going to finally just
say keyboard that this miss like that
and this one's going to be on that on
press and now what I'm gonna what I'm
gonna need to do it's this thing is
going to need to be a touchable without
feedback
so I think this thing's gonna be so if
he's work now if I click outside of my
outside of my keyboard I'm gonna close
it
really Oh
oh yeah then I love star companion I
love it a lot yeah it looks nicer I
think it just looks like a little
component a child why are you from yeah
I know that depend I'm in for me just
the job it's keep coming I mean it's
I've seen a lot of draw the ear in
Quebec so maybe sure this is I know they
had a lot of job in Iraq myself in the
West Coast in the US but I'm from Quebec
Canada so although job I got army more
well now if I click here and I entire
price and I click outside close it
perfect so now that so now I have my
crypto here when I click here add and
holding lol so the cryptocurrency now
what I need to do it's this
cryptocurrency stuff I have the price
USD I need to set total
and also so I need a total and he died
maybe gonna need that date boy and by
default
hmm so that's get done is gonna be an
input I don't think so
so for long I just take the title hello
well here and I'm gonna see the note
except tender 7 2007
oh yeah the tough Java yeah it's well I
think if if I was in your situation I
would maybe check for like for me
example for working in mobile I ate like
working with Android Java but I've
started to work a bit with Caitlin and I
really love it I mean it's like Swift
version of Java
so now when I'm gonna kick on this
cryptocurrency ear I need to pop up a
model and this one's gonna have a list
of crypto
yeah
yes have some
I'm gonna do something like
so even you're coming from Montreal so
you speak French oh maybe not
Oh No think the route I will put here
and now here I will have created my
model rapper but I don't
you
I forget to import the model
good a string
this thing should be below
Oh transparent sorry
oh yeah Charles for me other one year
experience and cold so it's it's not
about I mean we're native is pretty
young too so if you work with your Agnes
of I think you have almost the same
amount of time sometimes the more
experienced Dale is working
but I don't think you need the
background-color the one who need the
background color is this one and I ate
sometimes prettier when you get to this
point so something I've started we do a
lot it's all my URI trainer I do this in
anyway Ike
now what I'm gonna do it's fruit first
thing I'm gonna add that inked up then
this way I don't go and touch this thing
after that I'm gonna go to expediter
Hector icon I'm gonna search for the
close icon
this one here
kind of like this one we have like scan
of stuff so I'm gonna go with material
icon here
what I'm going to do is I'm gonna sue
now I then I have nothing I always do
everything from scratch it's maybe not
the best one but yeah it's what I always
do
the thing I got your month
okay maybe enough padding at the top but
here now it's supposed to close I know
okay so we have some
crappity not fun in crypto oops
yeah me too
I've tried a lot of them like the one
who is really popular I don't remember
the name I think it snow flake or
something like that and it just like too
much stuff I like when it's cleaner
there is that prof that Odin close
button boom I'm gonna need to do an
arrow here I think yeah cuz I'm gonna
cook I need to be buying it I think I'm
gonna get add an arrow now
yeah
so now I can call
kind of yeah this is what I want
you know I'm gonna have a word say I
choose your crypto oh is there what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna say about the
rapper padding-top maybe not padding but
emerging top it's gonna be cool too so
if this thing it's 5% I'm gonna say 10%
margin and this one I'm gonna gonna take
this thing and you're gonna go here I'm
gonna have my title right there
the title you are gonna have a fun size
of maybe eating with a fun weight of 60
also a lying self center
now you may be asked why I put this one
as a component so first thing it's this
kind of stuff I like to make it like at
the top of mine and what I'm gonna do is
this one's gonna be plug with the same
URL color I do for the home screen so
this only really cow so this one right
there where I get all my corn the thing
is I want to have all the name of each
coin Mar Jing oops not opes the only
thing I don't know which will a react
will I get - shell element did you have
user even and I really
through crypto so you told me this
margin-top air it's 10% I don't think so
thinking in rescue well
oops sorry
so this is the rapper here with the
problem right now because if you look
here I say 10% but I'm sure the rapper
so we're gonna test it background color
of yellow I'm quite sure you don't take
all the space so that's why when I say
10% don't take the 10% of the screen
because this one don't take the 100% of
this screen because contain rapper as
you can see ear it's inside the rapper
so if rapper don't take the place you've
never gonna take 10% of the real screen
so we're gonna see if M wrong or not and
I'm pretty wrong 10% 5% is that
but we have cure it's very common for
the result of insecurity overlap over
over you response caffeine restriction
there's an icon for this over like a
crazy and dissing query caching AK graph
using the gashel although we though we
use this cash let's look at two
operation within the care that a
response its receive will be really nice
it would be easy
okay so 20% is perfect to choose your
could talk one so now here I'm gonna
have a list of all the crypto so there's
going to be only the name in the center
and
if I show you so I can just fish my card
yeah yeah but this one's gonna have
access to my coin yeah so now I'm gonna
need to have a phat list
you
thing it's I don't need to research
because I'm gonna have it from the
beginning so now I really need to see
reading from the cache
if I were like that was in my network
either I need to cash comfy right there
yeah I think the cash config
okay
yep see some things so ear inside wheel
a thing you have real a hurry
response cache it
right there you see right there so now
what I can do
yeah I'm gonna create my cash I'm gonna
second guess quo 30 TTL so the day and
I'm gonna say yeah 5 oops sorry 60,000
so this is just 4 times so here I will
be 5 will be here that will be a 60
minutes so 5 hour - configure and now
here I will sing
thing it's this workers Aires show
that
yeah I forget to do something I need to
go to my mobile in here
really
cause here I'm gonna have cash
everything so when I came here
hello my girl
yeah yeah so that came from react so you
know it should be maybe nothing nigger
in the store
really can respond cash
is weasel action response if operation
so if my operation it's a Curie I want
to be terminal but if it's a mutation
I'm gonna just delete all my stuff so I
can just use my cash and see that clear
like that in this way now I can write
there it's like my den here I'm gonna
need to check if this is a cash are are
accurate so first thing I'm gonna check
if my if ever some error think I didn't
say yeah I'm gonna just return a new era
where I'm gonna use that whereas the
error and because this thing it's gonna
be an hour worry I'm gonna see that
message right there after that if is
Curie so my variable I have put right
there and I'm gonna say set my cash with
the operation name and my variable and
also my Riyas right there and it alls
I'm gonna return yeah but I will have
done this in here more here then here
I'm gonna have rather Jason now Eric and
just returned yes now what is my oops
so now here something I miss coming from
if
I think that's gonna be a good word so I
said on my cache do the app still work
start to understand a bit more I'll
really work now I mean to me all the
weekend and me all the weekend to just
figure out how to do the query but now
you start to really make more sense well
the new what I've done right and the
fine is not a constrictor a very new
wheel a run-time really query response
cache oh I think I know why I need to go
and show you that inside their Lib and
real a GUI response cache
I'm gonna work yeah good so now when I'm
gonna go there at the beginning of the
app this kind of value is gonna be cash
so now when I'm gonna go here and I'm
gonna cook click here now I can just
show the name but now I need to access
it right there so that's the point where
I'm gonna be a bit confused
you know and I'm sure I'm gonna have
some era with the flow yeah I think I'm
gonna declare module react
no it's really run time lead delay carry
response Kasia and I'm gonna do the
cloud this is
do some of you have some questions
so now if I want to kill my cash this Y
can just call this one I'm gonna clear
it from outside
now the thing is if I get too
oh yeah even yeah it's always saving I
think it save like two three-hour after
I've been done YouTube process all the
video after I finish but yes all the
video I've been safe I think you about
that too I really appreciate the only
thing you know I'm still confused it's
here I'm gonna have my care and so I
just need to be put back my career but
that's all it's all a bit like Apollo
when you can get back fetching stuff
this is the thing until we have German
Apollo and now I just like try to our
worries send them back if this gonna be
like Apollo but here it's a thing I have
Creed this weekend so if you want to see
what I've done it's Iraq really really
out of your own man so I think too much
queasy
it's just what we really need to create
the network you have critter even a
matter - so I'm by using the library
even a matter after that screen and you
I really under man right there and after
that I quit I render internal we're
gonna get a component and some
configuration and now I'm the
structuring some value coming from there
configuration where I'm gonna add the
class have a component called feeling
rapper so this stuff is just a component
finally who is used to fail in content
after loading so whenever loading after
that I'm gonna have some animation where
I'm gonna just pass the value from 0 to
1 and the value it's the opacity right
there so this is just I think it's maybe
work right now I think if I maybe not
this one I'm gonna maybe need to change
that to my own page but finally just
like some kind of opacity just changing
it just that don't get stuck like we've
seen I think if we want to see that I'm
gonna go to my navigation and I'm gonna
just search for initial and this thing
here I'm gonna remove it so you're gonna
see here
so what I mean by that and I've put that
200 me a minute my mighty second and
here as you can say I say Usenet to
driver so I'm gonna use the natural ARF
it's it's possible so it's gonna be
better but remember you see like I have
some kind of fading stuff so maybe like
if you want to see better I'm gonna put
that big mm so that's gonna take two
full second because always remember in
JavaScript we always work with me Sarah
you see like it's the feeling so I think
300 was too fast but 500 I think it's
gonna be pretty awesome too yeah just
don't get like as like I finished my
loading and I stopped don't so here
after that my really render a wrapper so
this one what I'm gonna add down here
inside my state I see which param I'm
gonna get and I also saved a million for
a man who came from here so this way my
component you're gonna keep the real and
render and I said I've no hour after
that inside my Cumberland did mal I
checked for the emitter and I check if
take my a matter I've cued right there
and I've put an emetic all about the
change in value and I checked the
environment change after that when I
receive props I just checked if finally
the params it's like they don't look the
same so this way I can change my set
state so this way I don't gonna always
week out the component so the component
gonna just change when I have some value
changing so and after that inside man on
now I remove my a Matar after that here
if I get an error so this is coming from
react 16 really important to know that
now I think distinct component did catch
it's a it's a lifecycle we're gonna get
car when you get an error
so here when I get an error I just said
the state error true after that I have
some variable here by default and this
one if you don't know what mean any just
like
Roth IRA just say this thing can be
anything that your function we're gonna
remove the error and now here it's the
important part it's when I'm gonna
render a well I check its if have an
error I'm gonna render filler which and
there's something as I can show you blah
blah blah after that when I have nowhere
to get my props I get a time out about
show lending time out so the shoe
loading time out is this thing when I'm
gonna refresh you're gonna see like the
red thing in the middle I think it's
become blue now yeah you see after that
if I've error I'm gonna show them
t-state view where I'm gonna say oops
something went wrong so this is a
component I've create right there we'll
finally just take a title and a subtitle
and I think we see you after that make
you render oh it's the first part of
your really stuff and now a what I do
it's I have my Curie and I so admire and
none coming from the top my render with
this variable right there have my
variable coming from my parent from the
bestest a and now the the force I say
that that force fetch that's that yeah
get my route for like the rendering
wrapper and after I have my Creed
bandura will get call right now we get
call inside my app right there
so when you I'm gonna wrap my up
navigation and my add navigation gonna
receive where is my I have my app here
we take the provider what just put the
render on
oh yeah right there sorry and I've put
my creative and there are it's a
function I've put now when I create
right there at the bottom so we all do
that pagination container so this way
this is the thingy where I get the
infinite loading just App Engine ation
container so this is a container who can
fetch more than just what you received
from the beginning so now here have real
data in the right ear this thing in the
price and the name and the icon it's
real data
the thing is the middle isn't the right
thing but this is something I'm gonna
change after getting the desapear
working that was pretty good for me to
juice coming back with this thing
sometimes it's good to just really watch
your code and just understand whatever
you what you've done I'm gonna run
prettier because start to be bad it's
perfect and after that what I'm gonna do
it's now this one here need to have
access to the cache but I think I'm
gonna stop for that for tonight maybe
gonna rest go and play some better
she'll or something like that so if some
of you play better fill one up on ps4 my
name is you want to play some game I'm
not that good I mean I have bought a
game like as a week ago or two so I
think I've set up some good Nellie
that's a given just a I think I know
what that means just I don't want to get
stuck for like five hour on the caching
stuff
you
those area I think I understand what
that mean I mean you mean looks like you
get that from dick you call that from
graph QL that yeah but react we lay
maybe is the only thing I'm gonna do for
the final its react we lay the library
they must have no it's not yeah
and this you have Q&amp;amp;U
yeah I really love this awesome people
sometimes you find really good thing
what for you're really example
yeah yeah I'm gonna go think I'm gonna
just read I'm gonna just read all this
stuff tonight and figure out and if I
find a solution I'm gonna show you that
tomorrow yeah so have a good night
everyone
I hope you enjoy this video and that's
gonna be save on my channel so you can
watch it again have a good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
