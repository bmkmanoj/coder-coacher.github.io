about user authentication so this series
gonna be about creating a full flow of
the user education system and that's
going to use the technology of no GS
MongoDB and yeah so why doing this
tutorial it's because I found a lot of
tutorial where like I did - it's where I
show the we just are in the logging but
I don't show how to send a email
confirmation and I don't show to all to
do a forget password and I think if you
create your own user identification
system you have no choice than having a
forget password and also a confirmation
email so this is what we're gonna do in
this little series so this series it's
not about creating a full application
it's going to be about creating the user
education eti so the first part is going
to be creating the basic user we just
start logging after that we're gonna go
more in deep with the forget password
confirm email and after that we're gonna
just test that with a simple friend and
application would just finally sign up
and logging that's it
and we're gonna check the email we're
gonna receive chatter rap so this
tutorial what you need before going in
this tutorial is going to be to have
installed OGS and also MongoDB if you
are on Mac I really encourage you to
install everything with homebrew we're
gonna save your life so much it's going
to be easy for you to update everything
in Windows I never other windows that
cannot really help you with that but
make sure that you install this bolting
and all in remember also to have your
MongoDB always running in the background
for all this tutorial so this is what
we're gonna do in this part so the first
part so this part right there is going
to be the setup of the server side
project nothing crazy yes set a Babel
and stuff like that after that we're
gonna start to do the register we just
saw we're gonna do the register
with two part we're gonna do the first
part with like no ashing password so
just a plain string in the DB and after
that we're gonna do with the ashes
password and also I'm gonna just show
you like kind of my way of module
everything it's not I mean it's not
really to be prediction I mean I am not
even sure if this can be prediction I
mean this is your choice I mean I just
show you some code and you go you do
whatever you want I just try to give you
some of my knowledge I find about doing
this stuff because like I told you it I
get some I didn't find kind of this
tutorial on the web who can really help
you to do this forget password thing in
OGS so for we gonna go through our and
we're gonna start with the episode 0
where we're gonna do the setup hope
you're gonna enjoy this series I'm gonna
try to push the more video I can in a
night the small week this week so I can
push the more video I can sorry for the
other tutorial I'm gonna try to do more
