part of this second milestone so what
we're gonna do for this one it's gonna
be about finishing the other application
with Facebook and be able finally to
create a user with finally what we have
and finally also make a distribution
work in the application we have started
to build so in the past episode as you
remember remember what we have done is
the fact that now we can push a token
would when it came from the front end to
the back end we're gonna finally get the
user that are we gonna need to save in
the database example is username avatar
and s username but first name last name
avatar and anything like that if also
going further we're gonna just set up
like that there the first layer of the
FATA fication for us and we're gonna
make use for the for that with the GWT
education stem so for those we don't
know which library can use to make that
we're gonna make use of our Guardian so
what you're not gonna be the library for
helping us to manage the GWT attach
occasion in the application thing about
Gordian a bit like in no GS like a
passport or something like that so we're
gonna start right now sorry about that
it just I don't know I just get like a
really cool really quick so now inside
you mix yes II it's s-sorry we're gonna
add the Gordian version one right now so
version one you know what we're gonna
run its a mix that yet and mix compiled
to compile a project together to
complete of this new library came okay
perfect
first thing I also want to say it okay
what I'm gonna do as a code of all this
project it's surely not the best one
okay
I don't feel really comfortable with
everything about elixir yep in Phoenix
and all this stuff
not like example I do with no GS but I
think I have just this kind of knowledge
just like like this small amount of no
learn who I can maybe help other people
to start to getting love with elixir and
start to see like why I really think in
the future it extra gonna really start
to be big in Phoenix it's an awesome
tool to make it easier and why I was
using Raphael also in this project it's
I think the transition from the one who
follow me from like almost a year now
it's it's easier to go I would react to
an example because we don't gonna get
lost too much because I feel then the G
is on par with Phoenix whereas not that
easy as the graphical version how does
that make sense so all we're gonna work
its first thing we're gonna create the
kind of thing about lat like a services
or just a module about the Gordian for
us so what are we gonna do is the inside
this Instagram where we're gonna create
another folder called out for a data
fication when I create a new file called
door Ian that yes
and in this one going to be a module
Instagram where the out and dot Gordian
so we're gonna create finally yo you
gotta infinitely use the version of
accordion the library you have done but
you're gonna make it like the way you
want to and earlier like almost we did
with Facebook here we're gonna say use
Gordian and here you see an OTP ooh
TP app and then we're gonna put in step
gram so the name of your application if
you don't know the name of your
application in your config right now you
should have your name right there or
inside your mix yes you should have the
name of your application
there so this is the name of Europe also
so we're gonna just follow the the
Whittier vendor that I sing the talk
here inside your configuration add this
kind of stuff so this is what I forget
so that's what it's a really good we get
to do it here before we go too much
further so what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to create here my configuration so
here I'm gonna see configure Gordian
just to follow the pattern they have do
so it's the way you're going to
configure finally it's the width and
gordium gonna say okay we need example a
secret like we do with all-time with GWT
and what you're gonna find it GWT
secretly gonna go there from himself you
don't need to told him to go and take
this one here so we see config we say I
said that new name of your application
next diagram after that I'm gonna say
take my Goergen version from Instagram
where that out the Gordian the one we
just create we're gonna see see the
issue our issue is the name of your
application finally or whatever you want
to call that Instagram after that I'm
gonna say verify issuer so what that
mean it if we have to DWT inside the GWT
example I mean inside you GWT you gonna
have your payload and stuff like that
and you can add also the issuer so it's
going to be like the name of your app so
what I mean it example if to GWT gonna
be almost the same one gonna pass and
one not the one gonna pass is the one
who eats below this company so this
issuer so that's what after that you
know you need to pass this secret key so
that's going to be the secret key of GWT
if you know in ojs I always do things
like that like not the best practice but
what you can do with Phoenix it's you
can run mixed Phoenix Gen secret and
look what they give you
you give you right there a really good
token to place here to be the secret you
can put there okay here we have put the
config and now we're gonna come back to
what we have started with their guardian
so now what we need to do is create
finally to function one's going to be a
way for you to get finally the user from
like I finally get the data the user
from what you not what you claim but get
the user coming in from the payload of
the G ability you got so the way we're
going to handle death its we're gonna
create two function I'm gonna call one
get death subject yeah for token and I'm
gonna have another one here death
resource from flames all this stuff I
told you here it's like subject for
token level that you can use here like
you can read all the stuff here we just
I try to just do my best
you don't need you at least you can get
something running here so so they get so
Jeff for token if you look here I think
they're gonna show you you like to get
the research in the claim so what that
mean is the resourcing about the wizard
as the payload as what you're gonna
receive and when you put something like
that with the underscore that mean if
you do this like that and you don't use
this variable elixir in the compiler
right there I'm gonna tell you a claim
it's there but not use but if you put an
underscore didn't gonna check this thing
here oh you can just do what I do a lot
but at least it's easier to like remove
that if you want to make use of it here
I'm gonna just say so and I'm gonna just
say to string so this is a function in
elixir resource that ID so my resource
gonna be a payload okay and I want to
get finally can I have called just that
ID but I want to get what I'm gonna take
to find my users inside my database or
something like that so I need the ID so
I'm gonna say just to string research ID
because I mean
the resource ear I'm gonna be this like
can be used this way and then we're
gonna just return a tuple with the okay
and sub ear the resource here what's
good I receive you're going to receive
back to your claim right there so like
they show your ear you will come up for
e so the claim that sugar can be found
in the sub key blah blah blah so you see
here the way they under that this is the
end of this it's they're gonna have like
they get the ID finally ear coming in
from the sub like they're gonna we're
gonna send him here so so finally it's
almost like a copy and paste encoding
you just see you need to have that for
your application so here we need to have
your resource we're gonna get my
Instagram that icon so this is now the
thing about the application we yeah it's
where we get the user who all we get
that and we're gonna say ID what I mean
it's now we're gonna send back okay in
the resource going to be the user who's
going to be in save in the GWT so think
about that like yeah you're gonna need
to have maybe access to like the idea of
the use or something like that when you
create a pose or thing like this but you
need to have this like user stuff coming
in like example if you want to save the
username when you create a post or thing
like that it's gonna be really painful
if you need to always like do a fine by
yourself like a fine user by ID on every
request here you're gonna add this
information on your request by decoding
the GWT so here is the only thing we
need for the application here the
Instagram get user we have created its
we don't even need to create that was
build by the generator of Phoenix so
here we have done the the Guardian port
so this Goergen part is going to be here
to help us to manage attacked efficient
like with the application like at the
attacks occasion layer so the one will
say a you you can came here you
but now how can we finally make sure
then we can have access to the to the
defendant finally that the user so all
can we give the user GWT and how can we
check the GWT and all can we get the
user in the context as you know in graph
QL you have all always treating in the
resolver
yes treating you have ear like coming in
from the parent your all the arguments
and now area get the context nothing has
changed graph QL is still we have QA AB
sign I've done a really good job to keep
the library like simple as the
JavaScript version is so this is what
we're gonna do so what are we going to
do is we're gonna create a new resolve
are here and this one is going to be
called account that e^x and this one's
going to be all the result function
about like the account about like
logging and thing like that so we're
going to do def module that Instagram
where that resolver that account here
after that what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to create a function called log in
right there this function again going to
receive three argument like that but one
of them here like this it's gonna be the
to the toucan
we're going to send when from the front
end so when I mean it's going to be the
token we pass a lot in the last episode
I know we pass in the terminal but the
token is going to be the token coming
from Facebook
now another stuff like we gonna do it's
not yet done because I mean I I do
backside I do back in back sign I mean
which we do a what we supposed to finish
to come back to the bi and maybe this is
not the best one but I think yes yeah I
think I'm gonna keep it like that
there's gonna be me make more sense what
I want to put it's a provider so provide
arms going to be example right now we're
gonna just do the log in with Facebook
but maybe if you want to add Google in
local like notification you can like
here I have a provider call example
Facebook and we see when it's Facebook
we do this when it's Google we do that
when it's local we do this so it's going
to be easier for us to work with that so
now what here what we can do is we can
do a case think man where we say provide
our do so we see when the provider going
to be equal to Facebook don't worry I'm
going to show you all I've created here
this atom here when I'm gonna get that
what I'm gonna do it I'm gonna call a
function right there who my plan here is
to return okay and the user coming in
from finally the the my education
Instagram that and now here I would
create something called authentication
the login so this is my plan or ear this
one I'm gonna just put token and I would
put Facebook like that so this is my
plan is to be able to get an oak in a
user coming in from from like a module
attached fication where I'm going to add
a function logging and in this function
the only thing you're gonna need to pass
it's gonna be the token in which
provider so we're gonna create this this
one right now so all we're gonna do this
in the inside Instagram where so you can
follow the ow
ego Instagram where it's a Graham where
so now we need to create a new module
right there
it's not a food or it's another module
authentication the e^x so now in this
one def module Instagram where that
authentication like that
now in this one what we're going to need
to do its we're going to import what we
have done inside the last EP that we can
have their flogging here so now remember
what we just sent we send a token in
Facebook so here we can have token and
we're gonna have ear like a Facebook why
I'll do this this way it's because
example if we get logging with token and
Google we can do this this way to
function this is one of the beauty of
the pattern matching if you know here we
gonna say attribute here token and now
you're gonna say I'm gonna make use of
the the type function because now what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna call my
function Instagram where that o out I
just create out that Facebook and I'm
gonna say get info so I'm gonna just
take this token here and pass him to
this Instagram get info right there Oh
what you can do if you don't like to do
this this way you can do this one and
just putting the token right there so
now attribute here going to be the
result of what I've got right there the
normalized functions or either this user
right here okay and now what I'm gonna
do
so now I'm gonna be I'm gonna load no
ear all I have build up it I was okay
this logging function I don't want to
create a sign up I want to create one
function who's gonna be smart and off to
sorry
create a user or return a user back what
I mean by that it's the user don't exist
create the user and return it if he
exists return the user that's it
but how can I search this so again I was
thinking about you need to think like
this way before you
like you kind of feature it's okay right
now I'm gonna log with Facebook that
said okay but at the end of this
tutorial I want also to blog with
locally no code and I was okay I need to
make sure that my function gonna be easy
to not not scaling but what I mean needs
by I want to make my function easy to to
make it work with other other stuff for
example here and a dirt provider I'm
gonna be passed like a Google or
education or anything like that
so I was thinking okay how can I do this
and also oh can I find my user because
the thing it's if example you log with
Facebook you're the first time so I save
you email so you email wise ello
gmail.com and now finally you will deal
ugh of the application and you come back
to me after and you say okay I'm going
back but I don't know if I was coming
with Facebook so what I'm gonna make I
do it's now example I'm gonna log with
my email or thing like that so now you
need to think about um can I manage this
I mean how can I do this it's yeah so
again I don't see my my way it's perfect
so don't judge me please so what I've
done I decide to do it's at the side to
create finally a search parent while you
justify any that's going to be the
search here I'm gonna make use for
getting my user for saying if the user
exists or not and that's going to be a
map I'm gonna say Facebook ID and I'm
going to equal to the attribute I'm
gonna go out so the object here you but
here dot Facebook ID right there like
that and I'm gonna say also I want to
check to make sure then the email match
the attribute the email do
life security like I know the Facebook
ID gonna still the Facebook ID but the
thing you like I told you it's you don't
want to make sure then maybe the emails
gonna match with it so maybe I've create
an account with just an email and I'm
pretty sure then if I have an email ello
gmail.com nobody can nobody else can add
this email so you see what I mean
and now the last thing is I'm gonna
create this function right now Instagram
where the icon Instagram sorry the icon
so inside my logic and I'm gonna create
a function called get user or create
what I'm gonna create a user or getting
a user and I'm gonna passing the
attribute and after that the search
power but we don't have create this
function and also now another thing it
before we get out of this five because
we don't need any more its I'm going to
show you another tips you can hear Ali
ass to Ali as a module name to make it
easier to work with I mean to make it
like you have less thing like you're
gonna think about that I almost like you
not destructuring or can I say that it's
like to shortcut your module I mean what
I'm gonna do it's your example I'm gonna
Elias Instagram all out
so what by doing this I can keep do the
last name I can do this like that so now
I can just use alt Facebook get info and
you see it's it's a bit smaller and I
mean it just if you use it you just need
this more now maybe yes okay yeah now
why you don't go like that and here put
Facebook it's because remember Facebook
exists globally example if I remove that
you see this is the Facebook of what we
have installed and I don't want to just
yes I know I'm gonna stay here and but I
don't want to mess up with that and I
keep it this way and now you can do the
same with this icon get user create you
can juice ideas this one right there and
I was gonna just make it a bit smaller
let's go
yes Instagram Erie where okay so now we
have here the Instagram login so we have
done the looking trust me we don't get a
really need to come back here but now
this function it's not create so why not
I was able to John and I cannot dream
anymore
perfect so and now go inside icon why
are we gonna finally create this
function get user our create account I'm
going to create that right there at the
top make with a function yeah
user or create this function remember
you get the attribute and you get the
search parent now what we're gonna do is
we're gonna do a case thing man what
we're gonna do a report that get by
right here you can say get a user so you
see he has a user so that's why you just
see user here so get a user with is
search parent so I was okay you can send
like a list of search param all you can
do this with what you have done already
in maps you can make use of the map so
all the function for working with map
dot two lists so you can be near two
lists convert map to a list with like
you see like this way right there and
now you know what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna pass that search program and now
we're it's a case statement so what we
can do it when it's near so that mean
yeah you don't exist so we're gonna
create the user we're gonna call that
function right there we need only the
attribute so we're gonna say great user
attribute if we have a user cute if
user know that mean the user exists and
now we have it ear we don't need to do
anything anymore we can just return a
tuple with okay and use our that's it
nothing more to do here
so attribute such program we try to get
a user with any search parent we give
him we need to match for each of them
you cannot just match the Facebook ID in
on that click man you see what I mean
now if we have nothing so Neil Neil mean
nothing here like Neil's we're gonna say
Twitter user because it don't exist else
we had a user why not return it okay so
know what we have done we have done the
fact that now I can inside my resolve
are be able to load from to Facebook
getting my user back but for that first
thing I need to call its to call the
function attached Keisha logging right
there this attach equation again gonna
get a token from the front end in the
Facebook provider so that told him he
gonna log with Facebook we get the
attribute coming in from the API call go
to Facebook a graph API I mean we're
gonna get your email id avatar and stuff
like that after that I say do this user
is this or not right there if II don't
exist I'm gonna create a user else I
return the user and now okay so now even
the resolve are you see I'm sure you are
because you're more wake up than me I'm
sure your lie there and you say okay you
get the login here you get the user but
no why what we do and why you talk about
GWT now we don't talk anymore about GWT
and blab a black okay so now what we're
gonna do it's first thing I'm gonna
again Ali ask some stuff so I'm gonna
address this one I can remove it
Instagram well now what I'm gonna do
it's now I'm gonna return another
couple but this one it's this to purl
right cool ensign this one we received
three lemon right there
while you receive finally the token and
also the claim but what we need us gonna
be only the two counts are we gonna say
okay tokay and this one I'll just go we
don't need this one and now I'm gonna
need that from my so I'm gonna what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna show you another way
it's here what you can do it's put that
in Creole bracket and just see you suck
on one like that so I'm gonna add yes
and Instagram at education and also out
so now I can see out dot and you know
what I'm gonna just run mix compiled
just to make it run see okay so now I
can do out dot guardian for the function
we create that did the death that
function we create but for coming from
the garden we have encode in sign and
this one you're gonna need to receive
the user like that and now here what are
we going to return back to the front end
it's gonna be okay and a map here we're
gonna say token to okay so this is what
always returned to AB sign that we need
to return okay and now here we need to
return whatever we want to return
finally and now this tool can it's not
this one like the you're gonna be like
thinking about I don't even know oh I
can say that but it's not any more than
some variable you're gonna become like
that okay coming in from this Guardian
stuff build by your own GWT okay
so now we have the resolver I know it's
a lot but and now we have the resolve
our so now first thing we're gonna add
this resolver we don't need any I mean
you already get all the resolver but
what are we gonna do it we're gonna
create a mutation now I'm going to
create it right there and mutation see
your way of Curie now we're gonna do
mutation and we write in this one what
are we gonna do is we're gonna say we're
gonna put a description I'm going to say
log in as a user so I'm going to learn
as a user and I'm gonna see feel logging
sounds I'm gonna call my mutation
function logging I'm gonna say what are
we going to return it's gonna be for now
and that's for now I'm gonna do this
really quick it's going to be easy we're
going to return something we're gonna
call a user session and I'm gonna do so
now like here you see we create like a
type object so photoblog right now we
just need to create this user sessions
and and all we're gonna do this it's we
gonna just finally add that to the icon
type we're gonna create it right there
inside that like we did with the post
type so we're gonna say icon types that
x def module i'm gonna see more and more
the code with like same one more again i
came the schema the account types here
we do like we done in the post one we're
gonna use the app sign notation like
that and now in this one we're gonna say
object use our session and the thing
we're gonna return is going to be fun
out just a feel or when I'd call it a
token and that's gonna be an O'Neill
string so that mean we're gonna always
returning something and now this tool
can if you follow me it's gonna read
this token right there we return
so now this chemo right there what do we
say it's okay when you're gonna log
you're gonna receive an object where
you're gonna add that token so because
now we can talk in English in JavaScript
because now is the front end we're gonna
see what we needs on our agreement is
going to be the token in the token is
going to be a string and also this stuff
we don't gonna say it's gonna be not nil
because maybe the user in the future
gonna log with an an email if you want
to meet what I try to told you it's I
try to prepare you to thing always in
your lap like in maybe but you can maybe
add in the future anything like that and
also after that what are we gonna say is
we're gonna create an R another argument
it's gonna be provider and this one it's
gonna be tied off provider
okay where this provider came I mean
it's where this King and I this is a
good question and that gonna came from
you that's gonna be an enum for those
who don't know what is that you know
anything about any know me it's like not
like example if I say you can only say
red blue and green to choose as a color
so I'm not gonna make sure then you
cannot say like pink or something like
that because I mean if you see that's
gonna be a string that can be any string
but if you say I want to be a string but
I also want to be like that this is this
is a finally or you can do this and now
here you see provider an enum provider
in here you just need to put value so
you can put Facebook and example in the
future we're gonna see email value
Google or something like that see
but now right now Facebook that's it
okay and now what we miss here is going
to be the result word to call this
lagging function so now what we're gonna
do it's resolved
we love our that icon dot logging and we
pass the treat argument here we have a
lot okay now why not try it and see if
that's going to surely crash
you see Bucky type must exist if we
friends user section is not defined in
your schema mmm what I've done wrong you
see my user session is there but the
thing it's you look here what we have
forget inside the the for the all the
resolver for the not resolvable all for
the time committing from the poles we
have same port type post post ID to get
the photo and now the user section don't
exist yet you see like you don't get
caught with that account so you need to
do the same so shift command d4 here
anomalous a icon type and now we should
be good okay app is running Huggies a
good sign now I'm gonna refresh my
graphic you okay and now I'm gonna open
my doubts
oh mutation perfect and now I have the
login login take a provider who can just
be Facebook for now take a token and it
take in return you at user session okay
so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
take like my token so you can do this
yourself also to get and take your token
I show you in the last dessert just
because I don't want to open that and
I'm not the best one to do like put that
as a secret all my other stuff you see
what I mean
so now are we gonna test that it's by
like running that with your
a token so we're gonna say mutation log
game provider I'm gonna say I'm gonna
just put Sammy nuts in Cologne but : and
look I'm gonna get here right there
