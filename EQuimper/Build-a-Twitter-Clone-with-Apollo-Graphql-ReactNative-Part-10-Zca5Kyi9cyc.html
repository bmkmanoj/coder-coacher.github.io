today we're going to be started part
number 10 so it's time to do the
ratification so this is always finish
the last part so we just finally fetch
everything coming in from the back end
that was what we did with the stab
working here and cuts like that so today
what we're going to do is we're going to
finish with this to design and next
video we're going to make logic for this
design working with Apollo so in the
next video you're going to see how you
can like save the token of the GWT and
make your the users dialogue and make
rescue will use GWT by default when you
do a request to the back end but before
doing this we need to do the baby step
of the application and one of the baby
steps going to be to add some basic kind
of design and function so I get question
about why I'm using we dark on this app
and this is what I'm going to show you
it's first thing I'm living with us I
mean with us it's really powerful I know
now with Apollo we don't really need any
more Redux for everything about the ETI
cow and fetching but I think Redux has
its place for managing the application
straight whoo
don't be late about the domain stage so
I mean the API states or what I talked
about that it's example if I want to
manage my user and stuff like that I'm
going to need that example in the future
we're going to add the user a Patou at
the top right right there and we there's
going to be a good thing too obviously
and to plug that with Vedic navigation
also I'm going to make use of that to
make sure that my user is a patek aid at
the own stuff and I'm going to show you
some other tip we can do with that but
reader is going to be really a small
part of the application but I really
think this is something we can use
another thing I can me does it
it's I mean I know it's hard to
understand but when you get it it's
pretty simple and this is just really
awesome because at the end we does it
just plain JavaScript it just plain like
minding of function stuff like that so
this is what we're going to do so first
thing what I'm going to do is I'm going
to clean another screen I'm going to
call that a decade screen just for now
I'm going to make you the Phi component
like that and I'm going to just make use
of the component tile like I always do
and I'm going to create my route like
always I'm going to just make a variable
T just to be the text for now because
I'm too lazy to type the full word and
I'm going to create the authenticator
decayed screen just for finally I give
us maybe a subscription spin going to be
better well I don't like a topic a
certification the adaptation and now a
what we're going to do is just return
route and just put that text and say a
third creation screen just like that now
the thing it how can I get the string
like before showing this because I don't
want to show this part I'm going to just
remove the debug because I think that'd
make my app really slow okay so now the
thing is we are we are there so that's
going to be a place where we can plug
videos what I'm going to do is I'm going
to create reducer I'm going to call this
reducer user inside this reduce I'm
going to create an initial stage so if
you have to some of my other video this
is all I like to work and what I'm going
to do in this one's going to be pretty
simple because I don't want a lot but
I'm going to put it I'm going to put a
so 10 to be no I'm going to put is a
tactic a to be found and I'm going to
put in so to be new so the token is
going to be the jealousy to look at is
the tactically that would for me to get
a boolean and know if the user is logged
or not and infos going to be new because
there's going to be an object when he
still you can put an empty object if you
like more but I think new let's make
more sense better to see like
is knowing cool like that after that I'm
going to create my videos are where I'm
going to put the state initial stage by
default and I'm going to just return the
state like that for now so good having
access to the video side I need to
import it inside my combine video right
there like that and now if I rerun the
debug and I check in my state I'm going
to have a user by default with false
perfect I'm going to shut down the debug
again so now what I'm going to do is
right there inside the navigation I'm
going to go to the top I'm going to
import uh top Oh complication screen
from the screen adaptation and now here
I'm going to plug at the bottom my user
coming in from nicely that user and now
this is a really easy one we're going to
see if this that drops the user that is
Satsuki so if it's not out of the case
return the authentication screen so if
everything is working now we are
supposed to see the authentication
screen perfect so now we don't let
access the usual with not authenticate
to anything in the application and this
is what we want perfect so now time to
check a bit so first thing that's the
page we need to write in this page what
we're going to do finally this is just a
blank page like a blank color not adding
color or you see that like a full color
here and we can add to button one it
gets start to make the app signup and
one it's already at an action and make
to the login oh I can't have make use of
navigation areas like to navigation in
my app and doing stuff like that but I'm
going to show you another way and I know
that going to be really feel like not a
good transition so this may be something
we can add in the future because at the
end of this tutorial I'm going to plan
to just do like small little video where
I'm going to show like oh this is all
you can add
I guess swiping LM an ear and I'm going
to make use of this one sometime so here
we are done with the navigation for now
time to work with some of the design
we're going to be pretty simple here so
what we're going to do is inside the
root right there we're going to select
one Winx a background color and we're
going to use the prop skin
so don't the ring knife game is color
secondary like that and now if I say if
we are getting the full dark colors
after that one I want it I want to have
my button here get start so this button
here I need to have it right there and
forgetting that what I think it's pretty
much easy to do it's making use of some
absolute position so if you know CSS you
know then if you want to use
position:absolute you need to add a
relative container to make use to tow
the position:absolute white to go
through fast if five percent from the
top that going to do five percent from
the param who have the position relative
so by doing this now what I'm going to
do first thing I'm going to import my
touchable component because now what I
can do I'm gonna sit button login with
the style we're going to wrap the
touchable button here I can put basic
attribute because I don't want to type
it in my in my air props I'm going to
opacity so on the feedback to be opacity
and now I can start to design this thing
so I'm going to put an eye of 75 I'm
gonna put a width of one Chesky and I'm
going to put a background color you know
I like to work with really big color so
I'm going to put the button looking like
that and I'm going to make use of my
text right here now if I save that
that's going to be bad but at least
we're gonna get the point so now we are
there I think we can already do really
weak justify contain center align I
centaur why that because now the text is
going to be right in the center of the
butter perfect this is whatever you want
after that what I want is now I can make
use of the position:absolute and now I'm
going to give you a value for the top so
that's top I wanted to get 30% from the
top so if I just do this now you're
going to see I'm gonna get it right
there but now what I can do - in seconds
a give me coconut rice in the package
right like that I want it to be the
right first thing I don't want it to be
at the left
perfect reality at the left so I think
if we look at the preview looks pretty
much at the same position now we need to
add some bottle radio so you just in the
left side oh we can do this with the
negative by doing border top left videos
and I'm going to say 20 I'm gonna say
border button left video I'm going to
say 20 by doing this now I get my radius
right there so now I can already put the
color so because my name is really red
I'm going to put color I can finish it
perhaps.perhaps the team that primary
because the twitter colors so now we
have the blue now what I can do is I'm
going to make change of the text I'm
going to call this thing button text I'm
going to go there and I'm going to make
this one to be white so I'm going to
make you go smack Kim again because if I
want to change my white one day let it
just change it in one place after that
I'm going to add a font weight because I
want my text to be bigger so I'm going
to say bold and I think it's the H key
and font size 20 is going to be good so
now I can take my button test and put it
right there so no yeah but now we're
going to say I think I see that in
uppercase get no get score it like that
perfect now is already start to look
what is suppose but you see here as some
kind of shadows so all we can add the
shadow if we need four elements for that
always remember that we need for animal
shadow pasady opacity I'm going to 0.4
shadow radius I'm gonna say 5 sort of
the reduce of the shadow is a shadow of
so we're going to fake 0 from the eye
and sort from the width and shadow color
I want it to be dark so just by doing
this look at what we get right now we
get the same button now one thing we can
really do really easy really really is
to put the text of the hopes to put the
text at the bottom so I'm going to make
use of this sorry how I'm gonna make
that if I'm going to create finally
another container who's going to be
positioned absolute from the bottom and
this way is going to always you get them
on other screen because remember Frank
books make use make their like a
responsive design for the folder mobile
for example if I make use of iPhone 7
plus the design going to follow but if
you always make use of the eyes and with
with number that's going to that don't
gonna follow so a what I'm going to do
I'm going to create a button text
container and I'm gonna say I want that
to be a view and I'm going to position
absolute like I just told you and why
because I want it to be at the bottom 0
I'm going to say left 0 and write 0 fog
like that you gotta touch the full style
so we're going to add the fluid and I
want it to other I'd of 200 just for
showing you I'm going to put a
background color Azrael and I'm going to
put it right there so now if I say
there's going to be right there you're
going to take this space now what I want
inside that if I know I want my text to
get the center in the same from a line
item to get the center and now I can
create my button because remember I need
to click on this fact that need to be a
button so I'm going to style that
go attribute I'm going to say feedback
opacity and now I can put the design and
now what I'm going to do right there is
I'm going to suggest a file contain
Center because I want the button to be
justify counting Center and a line item
Center I don't put background color
because if you see here we just attack
so I'm gonna let the tech app size so
I'm gonna say button button button text
or I think I'm going to change this one
to B button logging text like that so
this one's going to be button text I'm
really bad with names re like that this
one's going to be a text and now this
one I'm going to just copy and paste
this color why I'm going to just finally
copy paste order but we need to change
some of it here the font weight I want
it to be 400 and font size 16 so now I
can put my button right inside the
button contain button button text
container button and button text and now
I can say what is the term already have
an icon all ready have Nikon and now
I've written right where I want like
that perfect and now I don't want it to
be real
another thing we can just we can add it
now if you see here I type and maybe I
have a big finger and you see the
opacity that if I click we see the
opacity but the opacity just really
touch what we are if I click here at
that thing all we can add like kind of
an extra color on that to make is before
between your line my example if we can
add it flop right there
if let's take an object where we can say
like top 20 button 20 right 20 and left
20 so that mean add 20 from each of the
five ear and now if you see if I click
here I'm good but now you see if I still
click here it's good good and good and
now it's stopping so if you see that
make all this thing so now if I click
here this word - so this is what do the
it slow give you finally a way to make
it easier to click because it's a thing
at all
I get a lot from clientÃ­s hey your
button it's good but I mean when I click
it it go really really bad so now what
we can do it's when I click that I want
to manage this like Kenneth navigation
writing from the screen so what I can do
from here is I'm gonna say here I'm
going to put a sign I'm going to say
show sign up and I'm going to see false
by default it gonna be pretty easy what
we gonna do so you need to create search
take another component so I'm going to
create a signup form the GS
so each form gonna have its component so
again I'm going to just make use of what
I always you just for create a component
really quick because I want to show you
I'm going to just copy paste this turn
I'm going to get the top of this page
I'm going to import my sign up front but
now that's going to be from component
and sign up form what I'm going to do
this is because here I can say I guess
if there's that take the show sign up
front if it's true I want to return the
route with my sign up front right and
track like that now I need to show our
way to make it so example if I make it
true now we're going to see the final
form but and why I'm using the route
it's just because I want to add the same
background color and because again I'm
too lazy to write it so now what we can
do we need to pick when I click the
button I need I need to change that so
I'm going to get a function right there
call the show sign up
oh so sign up press yeah I think it's a
pretty good name and I'm gonna sit this
one I wanted to change the sex tape if I
can type sorry
show sign up to be true knock well just
like just by clicking that I can do this
on our can two people this time and I'm
gonna click on yeah maybe not yeah
so I'm gonna change when we does name
here because I seen an area I think
button logging but this thing is button
sign up so what I can do is I'm going to
select everything with command D
converter super button sign up by doing
this and I can change this thing
doing button login and now I'm gonna go
here dad
sorry about that it just cuz I just want
to know which button is that now if I
click I'm good you sleep if I click no
animation but at least we get to the
point where we want to get so if I
create now that set cells become true
and this is the thing so we did one of
the thing now the other thing I want to
do from here if now I want to add a back
button so if you see in the this one as
a back button here so I'm going to
create this one right now because it's
going to be really this right signup
form will go there we're going to need
to import an icon coming from a school
again let the real icon because where I
get the arrow so this is coming from
Expo the toe okay yeah
and now what I'm going to do its normal
route here I'm gonna just what I'm going
to do here is I'm going to just make it
like working with the Flex wanted a
monkey and make it position:relative I
got now
what I can do is I'm going to create my
back button at the top so oh I'm gonna
do this is I'm going to create so I need
my touchable again you see why I like
this touchable component we just create
at the shop I work for it because man I
don't like to import touchable opacity
every time or such about feedback and
stuff like that and like I mean I don't
know why but I think it just so much
simpler doing this like you came here
you see like back button I get it from
my style I wrap my touchable I can just
put a tribunal and just a give me back a
feedback opacity but the thing about
that if this is an injury that's going
to be the end your neck see click so
that's what I like I don't need to do
like if it's Android give me that no by
default we get this so if you don't want
that I think you need to reset before
salt and regular opacity now so yes I I
don't really try to sell you that but I
think you see the point now what I'm
going to do is this button I want my
stuff inside to be at the center so
again a lot of kind of boilerplate code
after that this button can add a
position:absolute to we're gonna sit
back on color red for now coloring that
back down real I'm going to say I want
it to get a top layer I'm gonna say 5%
and to be at the lab 5% by doing this
whenever you move that OCD I'm gonna put
ducks and I'm gonna say love just like
that just for singing that work I like
it here I get my load right there you
should because I don't get a eyes and a
whip finally the block just take the
space that's it so what we can do from
here it's going to be really easy its we
just need to go here in change that to
be the material icon material icon
and here what we can say is color I'm
going to say I'm going to input my color
from my constant I'm going to give me my
color Y and I'm going to say size to be
30 and the name is I wrote back so now
if I save that and I remove the red now
I get it it's right there perfect this
is the size I want and now what I can do
is I need to go back when I click here
so now the thing is okay oh can you do
this because now we don't have access
for navigation so what I want finally is
that one when I click back to just
report everything to false and we can
ask other item here we can add shoulders
include ear so what we can do is I'm
going to create a variable here called
current initially and I'm going to say
my initial stage going to be this thing
I'm going to remove this state I'm going
to say it's equal to initial state like
that and I'm going to say yeah function
call on back button create or just on
back press maybe on back press and just
finally set the state to be
well to initial script like that now I
need to pass down this process I'm going
to fast though
yes I'm going to come back press there's
on back press and now in my signup form
in my back button I can click on press
this the crops that on back quick like
that and now if I do this I could get
star you see we come back because then
you shall still become like that once
before so that's perfect I mean yes it's
not navigation stuff but at least we get
something really quick thing in MVP we
want to finish that the quicker as we
want as we can perfect so now this stuff
is done so now we want to design here so
what I can do is I'm going to put true
here so I don't need to click every time
so now what we need to do here is going
to be to put the input so I'm going to
close just this one okay what okay so
now we need input here so we get a
design one input so by using the text
input and just add a button here so what
oh I can I think I'm going to do this is
by making a wrapper we're going to take
that and you're going to put everything
in the middle and I'm going to take
after that a button here who's going to
add some margin from the top and going
to add a width from here so as you can
see so we finally we do the wrapper the
rule going to say take the wrapper the
middle and that's so we gotta create
this wrapper current wrapper equal style
that view
and I'm going to say a line sales
stretch a line item center because I
want this stuff to be at the center I
want this thing for this if I contain
Center like that
I want that while a width of 90% because
like you see it don't touch the other
side like I told you going to be at the
middle but I mean just to be extra I'm
going to put a width of that I'm going
to just like like this and I'm going to
see a I of 100% so you're going to take
the place you can now if I put my a
rapper rat right inside my my stuff
right there if I put them a background
color real see now we take everything
but at 90% so what we need to do here
because we don't our instant Arabic I
can just get on i-10 sontar justify
contain center so what i standing here
is my rapper cuz i think this thing here
something pretty weird what I think my
rapper should have been in the middle of
everything so what I've missed here on
my width of 90% artists feel
and for sure I will last thing a line
item should I stand or this thing now
you see like I mean I'm debugging right
now I don't going to cut that I mean I
just good for everyone so so here maybe
if you've seen that faster than me what
I did wrong I think I'm going to live
with that for now I'm going to make the
button at the the button at the bottom
and I'm going to just finally check
after that I'm going to see the button
button confirm equals 5 touchable that
attribute I'm going to 2nd feedback
opacity this is the one I use almost
always by default this one's going to be
really easy so I'm going to make use of
the same way I use the button again at
times I'm going to make it a
position:absolute again I'm going to
give me that from the Burnham 15% from
the bottom and I want that to be a
weight of 70% of the screen I want the
eye to be 50 it's almost like always by
default oh I put my button ID of 50
background color give me the color of
Twitter so primary I'm going to sub
border radius of 10 like that and I'm
going to say justify contain center and
a line item center so if I put the
button right there
9012 button text we got it I mean I know
it's a pain to always design but I mean
we need to do this if don't if we don't
we're gonna make it I don't do the work
on an empty blank page I like one
everything looks pretty so I don't know
why but this is ohan I am maybe like and
I I did everything in front of you
because this is good for you and this is
good for
some time designing it's a skill you
need always practice so now inside my
button a which tests I put I think that
was sign up sign up so now I button
right in the middle okay maybe don't
watch because position okay okay it may
be no one
so we are I ate when something don't
looks pretty but I mean I'm gonna leave
with that is this button I think just so
I'm going to just remove the rest for
now just and I'm gonna just add some
shadow on this button so what I'm going
to add is shadow color black shadow
reduce 0.2 shadow Oh set I'm gonna see
you P to Pig and I'm gonna say finale I
can shadow shadow reduce 5 and it's
funny shadow opacity it's gonna be the
zero point ago
perfect and now I'm going to just add
something I didn't add before it's
innovation 2 because this is Ont ready
work so in the certification screen in
my button sign up I'm going to add
elevation - so this is what anyway need
for the shadow palette so now I think we
are pretty good with the bottom that
looks what we need now we need the input
I'm going to work with the input it's we
need to design the input I mean the D
the input where it finally an input now
it's become a container where I'm going
to put a border bottom white and I'm
going to add the text input in the
middle of the app so I need to create
this thing and this is almost like the
lightest component because we're going
to make use of this one a lot okay I'm
going to say import wrapper it's going
to be a style that view I'm going to say
eyes of 50 and a width of pd % of is
container background car
r-right I'm going to put this input I'm
going to put that in my wrapper going to
be there for you to see it so what I
think I'm going to do is I'm gonna make
something think if I do that I really
really strange and I really don't know
where I miss something
put this wrapper
you
pretty really really weird so now if I
put that with the 400% yeah we're going
to go with that and now I'm going to
manage that and I'm going to just
finally 90% it's 5% from each side I'm
going to see 70% we're gonna get the
same way perfect this is all we're gonna
work for this one
sorry about that we are programmer we
need to we need some time to do final
way work everyone I can visit determine
English here now we need the border
button I'm going to add a body butter
with you know it's hard to see but now
if I put that to be yeah I'm going to
just ring the background color now
you're going to see we can add a border
button but it's going to be black so we
need you can change this thing to butter
bottom colors and I'm going to again use
of the white oh no that was the library
dick yeah that was the library in the
one yes perfect
but this wait it's 2 X naught 1 come on
gonna put a background color again but
I'm gonna put a little color like pink
yeah now we see so now all we need to
work with it
it's first thing when I just put a Mario
game vertical so I want each input to
have this some space begin because what
you call a scene angle F for input so
they're gonna be like that now I need to
put the text inside that so I'm going to
create an input
put and now I can do some stuff I'm
going to remove like that and I'm going
to remove this color so that I can put
the input right inside mine I'm going to
say import wrapper like that input and
now for single input I'm going to put a
placeholder and I think the first one is
full name full name you see now is right
there so this is a text input you take
this place here so first thing what we
can say if I want the text and code to
other eye of 3d so my full text my full
input wrapper is 50 but I want my text
to be 30 so my ID I mean after that I
want it to take the full width so we're
going to take all the size of everything
because now if I start so if I close
this now I take all video solar side so
I don't even need this thing but now if
I put that out of 30 now is only be
there but why I wanted to get the bottom
so I can do this it's here I can just
sit justify contain flex and by doing
this my text input not going to become
at the bottom right there yeah perfect
this is what we want and now what we can
do now it's maybe I do my design is
going mean I think it's perfect so what
I'm going to do here is that I can
change the color of the text we write
because when I when I type it's black
like that so now when I type it's white
and now I can do attribute here one of
the attribute I'm gonna add is place
holder text color who's going to be
equal to the color light gray so I want
my place holder to have the color right
degree so you see now it's right gray so
the same gray of this thing now we're at
what I can add here its selection colors
so the selection color is this blue
thing here alright for you to see
yeah but I mean it's this blue ear so in
what you can do its selection color and
now the thing is we don't have access to
this inside and red so important pattern
in in when we can do its platform that
Oh f equal I owe a so if this is an
iPhone stuff like that here what we're
going to do is we're going to just say
color that why are on the finds of this
way we have nothing now if I save this
little blue thing so I put Y but I want
that to be primary so Prime I don't even
remember which color I quote I think
primary gonna make more sense yeah
that's gonna be the loop of Twitter but
I am you see now when I select a text is
the same blue and with some opacity by
default after that now when I take you
see I get here the autocorrect I don't
want that no but you see I don't have
any more the auto cover I don't want
this thing and now I don't want to be
auto capitalized because maybe like your
thing I'm gonna yeah I'm gonna make this
thing yeah sorry I don't know what I put
AutoCAD yeah like that so now we are the
filling so now we're going to just
create other input then it's going to be
pretty
e18 so the fun
one's going to be about the email I
think email password and username
perfect the designer looks right so now
you see I came here and I want my
keyboard to close so I can do this it's
really easy if I'm going to go to my
route I'm going to change my route to be
as touchable because I need to be a
button and I need to have access not a
button but I need to add access to touch
even I'm going to sing on because I want
no feedback and what I'm going to do is
inside the egg 'native I can import
keyboard now I'm going to sit here on
outside press I'm going to just call
keyboard that dismiss like that and now
on my button I'm going to unpress this
is the outside press and now you're
going to see when I'm going to click
outside of the text input that close the
keyboard magical like this so now we are
a good point right now but I think we
need to do now is just to get the text
and that's going to be almost done and
we need to just do some little change on
my input so example for the full name
I'm going to say cap or to capitalize
also capitalized and I'm going to say
with the word so this way you're going
to see why this way I can say my name
please and then go back because remember
full name I'm always free leather upper
case after that the email one we're
going to say give me because right now
you see this is a keyboard by default so
if I click on the email like that but I
would like to other the email action or
you say that like the a so all you can
say is keyboard
type going to be equal to email address
on this one she not access to this thing
and this is what my I want to my user so
we change like that
after that the password I don't want to
be able to see the password so we're
gonna say a picture text entry so
another platform when I type like that
and that's going to be data and now the
thing I think it ought to capitalize
here I'm going to say none because maybe
your username you don't want it to add
to capitalize later perfect no I'm there
I just want to get this thing in my
state so I'm going to just debug remote
sorry for the long video I just want to
finish this in the quicker need so this
way after that we can we can jump
another thing so now the only thing is
the signup form I want to have the state
of my input right there so we're going
to just create a function and that's
going to be the last thing for today so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a function forget my text so what
I'm going to do in my state I'm going to
say cool name you call an empty string
email equal an empty string password
equal an empty string and user name
equal an empty string after that what
I'm going to do is I'm going to call a
function called on change text and this
one going to receive the text and also
the side so they're going to be type
email or stuff like that why because
this way I can do this that's a fake and
I can say type like that and text so
this way I can just create one function
and that's going to be smart in this way
with curly bracket square bracket type
become a variable so now on each input I
just need to do one thing and that's
going to be about unchanged text so this
is billion react native and now right
there I can see I'm going to have the
text I'm going to see this that
change text put the text and now this
one is full name going to copy paste
this thing then s email password and
username like that and now just by doing
this look at the magic could use them by
search for signup form we have the state
now in look for nine email password
username perfect this is what we want so
this is one of the thing we need last
little thing is this button right now
it's able to be clicked I don't want to
be able to click when everything it's
not surely like field so all week and
that is like I don't want to do a lot of
validation I just want to say like if
this thing if I don't have already input
I want to disable that so by default in
my in my touchable I can figure this a
ball and now you see I cannot click I
try to click and not so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to get a function
like that and this function I don't
gonna need to bind this thing because
I'm going to call it writing the
function I'm going to say here full name
email password and user name I'm going
to give this structuring that from this
side and I'm going to if no cool name
Oh
no email or no pass one hour nope
username returned to l2 turncoat why I
do this now because I can just came here
see disabled gonna be equal to do that
check disabled and I'm gonna call it
something like that so now I cannot
click I'm going to add just some item
and now I think click that's it yes
video sorry about that it just like we
need to do some stuff now here we're
going to need to do the mutation and
make the API call the graph QL call to
the server we're going to need to to
creat the login form but I think we can
just go with the signup form for now and
because I don't want you to get take a
stuck on the attached station so I hope
you enjoy so now just for showing you
what we did if we go back to our
education screen and I will put dyke'
the show forms in its now you click here
and you can come back working for your
booting we check oh I know what I know
why it's because I'm going to need to
put in this here why need to do that is
because my my rules become at the bottom
of the other one so now if I do this
know what what I think my button back
need to well the index the index this is
what happens when you work with absolute
position yeah and now you work and just
for adding that quick really quick
because it's video to type 20 20 20 20
