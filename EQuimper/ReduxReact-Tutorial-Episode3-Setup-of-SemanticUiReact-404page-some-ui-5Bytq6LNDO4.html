tutorial so yesterday I left you with
just this random string how that so now
we're gonna start to put some UI like I
say in my past video I get some problem
with material UI so we're gonna use the
new react somatic you are so right now
we're gonna set up everything the only
thing we need to do its install somatic
UI react right here so here we can just
for me sure like the yarn add a somatic
you I react only that after that we need
to add the CDN for the CSS so remember
inside public
we have index and here we can pass the
link for the CSS we gonna just wait for
the somatic you are finish I don't know
what happened
really slow yeah so today what we gonna
do it's we're gonna set up somatic UI
like what we just did we're gonna set up
the navbar so there you I I'm gonna set
up a 404 page and we're gonna set up
just the UI for the form sign up and
logging because tomorrow my plan is to
work with Redux form and show you all to
connect everything so first thing now
inside my module add a layout rat you so
now I can start to build my nav ball
with the react somatic so here we're
gonna import menu from somatic you I via
here now I'm gonna remove everything and
I'm gonna put my menu right here
everything I should just show you first
thing it's I don't like Queen nothing
it's just I follow the menu pattern
right here you can see everything is
really good documentation so here I'm
gonna pass so here in my menu I'm gonna
add a menu with
at that menu so this is what they asked
so the men you have some pain with Adam
with that sometimes so in here I'm gonna
add another menu inside this one I'm
gonna have my name of the my app so my
full feature list like this and inside
this one right now
I just want you to see so here need to
be item like that so I did look at this
so now we have the nav bar I was
thinking about using their logo react
prefer us I don't know if it's okay but
I think so so this is the logo they just
gave you when we start with the is
reduced stuff so here I'm gonna just
make some good indentation but I image
here my source I'm gonna add just the
logo and logo right here after that if
you remember in your app CSS they have
puts on keyframe and all that stuff so I
don't really new want to change stuff
here so I'm going to create a GS inside
my layout folder like that inside this
one I'm gonna pass my keyframe oops in
the GS sorry CSS CSS like that and after
that inside my app now I have the logo
right here so here I'm gonna change that
there is and I'm gonna change the name
so I'm gonna follow the pattern the name
of the component like that here in my
navbar I'm going to import my style and
now in class name a I'm gonna have my
nav bow that logo so look at this stuff
right here we just need to remove the
ight that's it
so look this my forfeiture list with
everything of react and with the
keyframe make it rotate so now in the
nav bar we're gonna add some link so
here I'm gonna add another
menu and this menu to have that menu the
menu so by default the out push to the
left so air I'm gonna just put a
position position and air that's gonna
be right here this is what I told my
atom just break air so here I'm gonna
add a menu and air that's gonna be sign
sign up and I'm gonna have another one
look King this one need to be item oh
because I have something complete my tag
so I get some so item and air it's item
two so now when everything is done when
we say if we can see now sign up and
logging right here but nothing crazy
right now so for now we're gonna left
the nutball with this we're gonna just
go because I want to show you all we're
gonna use the active rail and all that
stuff so here I'm gonna just set up the
the page for the signup page so here I'm
gonna create a new file my module I'm
going to create a out module out folder
I'm going to add a sign up folder in
here I'm gonna have a sign up that GS
right here for now I'm going to just
import react I'm gonna create a
stateless component like that and I'm
gonna put each one sign up like this I'm
gonna do the same folder game looking
folder looking the GS import yeah and
here my login in air my h1 logging now
if you remember oh I import my stuff
inside out I'm gonna do a Index GS we're
gonna import logging from logging plugin
import sign not from sign up sign up and
ear I'm gonna export both logging and
sign up yes this is a lot of pain but at
the end we will speed because ear I'm
can just export this and now in my row
right here I can use my logging and my
sign up coming from the same module
that's just awesome here I'm gonna have
a row with a path logging and the
component gonna be my logging one I'm
going to clean another one I'm gonna
change this for sign up and this for
sign up to for the component so now if I
came back to here and I go to login I
can say I get logging if I go to sign up
I got sign up but now we need to do
something with this Navajo and I think I
found so react router give us give us
browser history
that let us push to another route I know
people some people use Ling and all that
stuff but I don't use really link
because I don't want to like change
all-time CSS and all that stuff so I use
browser history right now
now in my mode menu item I'm gonna add
unclick wherever
so I call my action and we can see I
have this over here I'm gonna count
brother sorry that push and area I'm
gonna push all this is sign up so I push
to sign up I'm gonna do the same stuff
for my logging one and you did you see
something happen again but this one
gonna be logging so you know what I do
it just because I use theta component I
want to so this arrow function just bind
for you so now look at that now I can go
to logging sign up link sign up but I
want to come back to own when I click
here so just
could be again this one to this one
again I am and this one I'm gonna remove
so now I build my flow so I have my own
page and logging sign up on view but now
I want to see my active active link so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go to add
GS so first thing I'm gonna show you how
I find this it's I go when I a spec with
the reaction dev tool if I expect so if
you go to react dev tool and I go to my
app remember my app it's my route of my
route just for showing you here app is
right here so this one get past some
props and in this presentation and you
look at the location of the page right
now so look at that now it's pet name if
I go to logging now it's logging and if
I go to sign up its I know we can use
this one so all we do that
if we go to my app GS here now I have
location as a prop remember your ID
structure I don't need to use this that
prop the location so here inside my nav
I'm gonna drill a path who is the
location so I passed my location props
to my navbar so nothing really crazy
here it's just when you react so here
when I go to my navbar now look at that
at the Hat now and my path as the props
coming from app so here are my logging
everything change right here so now I
can use this one in my navbar so in my
mind of bomb now I'm gonna distract my
path so the known into cow this that
props that that Papp so what I'm gonna
do
right now it's I'm gonna make active all
my route with my nav out so we can shoot
the user which
so if you go here you can see they have
sorry they told us when I look at some
of this here you can see their exit item
so you can use something like that like
active when I could see if like this so
I'm gonna use this one right here I'm
going to show you but I came here and I
want this one to be active so this menu
item to be active again when Pat it's
equal to sign up just need to match this
one I'm gonna do the same for my login
one again I some problem sorry you're a
vlogging so now look at the magic now so
when I'm the root I have nothing but if
I click to sign up something wrong at
then just once it so I have my path once
I go I just try to find why I miss my
stuff so err have on my active one so my
navbar I have a pap and I have a technic
oh I know now it's because on my app
here I just passed location but this is
location that that name I want it's
going to be much more easy so I can
destroy again so if you look at this now
I'm unloading look at this now is active
now is active sign up active logging so
remember what I pen it's inside my app
you can see here I passed location
allocation is an object so I want that
name so sorry for this mistake so era
I'm gonna just pass some prop type just
for B I don't want to pass a misspelled
prep time later so prepare it just for
told you to another DEATH which kind of
perhaps is supposed to give so here I'm
gonna do prep time so we need to do this
for two props here children and location
so children it's something really you we
have like not a lot so in this one
that's going to be a prop types that
element I find this in some some ducks
so here my element in ear require
because we need that here I'm gonna have
location remember what I just told
occasion now it's an object so object
that is require record mean if I don't
have it I'm gonna have a real error so
now when you want to see if you prop
type is good you just came here and you
look if you have some error so here I'm
gonna just remove this because I don't
need this one and I don't need this one
so you can say have no error in my
console just for showing you what I can
do
it's like we're gonna just create
another prop type cowl like yeah I don't
know something like that and I say prop
that is require look at what I append if
I do this and I don't pass a props I get
I don't know is required but I don't
have this value so it's then define so
this is just for told to the other death
something wrong here just something
really easy so now this one is good but
we have some props to inside the nav bar
so we're gonna do this so yeah I'm gonna
dis track again prep time because if I
don't do this I'm gonna need to do react
that prop type I just am really really
lazy guys so do this kind of stuff err
err a pest pad but now my tab if we look
to the navbar sorry guys I put a lot of
time for basic stuff but I want people
to really understand so in my pad its
prop type that string and that very is
required to so now when I look I don't
have any error so now we can continue
later so I was thinking about making a
funny 404 because right now what happen
it's if I change this for this kind of
the URL look at what happen I just get
nothing
and it's a blank page and I get did not
match any route so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go to route here I'm gonna go
outside of the path component because if
I'm inside my component remember this
component now is a layout so I'm gonna
have a nav bar I don't want them to have
a nav bar so I'm gonna create a route if
you want to whether for for just do this
so this X Tareq's I think is the name in
English is the one for any route I pass
in pack we don't match knitting here and
then component may be something I call
page 404 the page for for gonna come
from module like that and I'm gonna
create that in my layout I'm gonna
create a page for 4GS and like that but
now I don't need to I just need to
import my page from here so I can page
for for and now page for for like this
here simple react SL if you want to see
what I use for my snippet I just build
my own package for this I'm just the
kind of person where I don't find
something I just do it so we dog snippet
here in the atom it just so you're gonna
see my face really easy to find its
react redox right here so if you follow
right here I've put every kind of so if
I do come like ear
I use my SL so it's stateless component
so if I'm gonna just right now for for
like that so now look what happened now
when I hit this page I get a 404 every
other route boo don't match I get a 4
for that just easy so now I look for
some stuff for that so I'm gonna just
make a funny photo for so I'm gonna
create an idea here and I'm gonna import
an image
from internet so I find this one right
here copy image address this one and
that's going to be a foe for so just
forcing that work so I look for the
copyright this one is good so just first
see if word no didn't work this one so
this one sorry I didn't really try guys
III found another one
so here it's like any I was try to find
some funny for for so I think for now I
can just we're gonna just make a a
regular h1 for for page not fun for for
again sorry guys
live streaming root ear gonna be I'm
gonna use flex and bucks so here I just
make my display I use flexbox I justify
contain it's gonna be spaced around
because area I'm gonna add another item
yeah I'm gonna add a link item I'm gonna
be Center and here I'm gonna pass the
it--of this I do I want that to be
eighty of the vertical vertical but the
viewer the view Horizonte yeah I'm gonna
use flex direction because I don't want
the thing to be in a row so like one ear
and one ear I want one and one so here
that gonna be column and ear I'm gonna
import button from somatic and ear I'm
gonna just pass my button right here and
come back oh and this one I'm gonna have
the style so now my style I passed this
object so I need to be styled and that
route so this is a really easy object so
if we look here what I got now I get
page nut phone come back down but I want
when I click here to come back home we
easy we just do what we already did and
part browser history from react router
and we're gonna use it in my button like
unclick and I'm gonna bind this and
browser is to read that push and I push
to the root because I want them to come
back home and look at this come back
home so now someone go here get a 4/4
and now they come back home so for this
part is done so if we look bad at what I
want to show we get nav bar and the for
for now it's time to do a form so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create the
signup song and I'm gonna just wait for
this after so if I go to my sign up here
I'm gonna import multiple stuff coming
from somatic UI so I'm gonna import
button
oops I'm gonna import a checkbox I'm
gonna import form and a grid from
somatic you are react here I'm gonna use
grid so all the word it's symmetric you
I'll use a 16 layout grim so you can see
everything it's there I just don't
in invade involves something so I just
really use the basic so here I'm gonna
have a grid here I'm gonna use the
center it props so when I look back at
what that mean it's a grid can add its
current area so it's just more easy to
work yeah I'm gonna put some style
because yes I tried this before
yeah I'm gonna have a root so every time
I create inline style every outside
wrapper it's the root for me just a
pattern and follow and because I use
inline style I don't care about the name
here I'm gonna just pass it 5 percent
and I'm gonna use this style because I
don't want to be close to the nav war so
that going to be style that route like
so now yeah I'm gonna add another grill
but this one if you know and like
bootstrap and all that stuff they're
gonna all make sense so here I'm gonna
add : like this so I need that ear and
here I'm gonna add a width of this is
the width of like a mini column we are
we want so I want six so sorry again for
this one like that so I'm gonna create a
form like this and ear so it's like the
HTML form you just so we just open a
form here I'm gonna use a form again but
this one's gonna be a field
so each fill in your form need this one
here I'm gonna add a level no HTML just
laddle and you're gonna be email in here
I'm gonna have an input type email and
I'm gonna don't don't pass name right
now nothing here just a placeholder and
that's gonna be an email here like that
we're gonna copy this one one two
because I want to add a password so the
type going to be password because I
don't want to show my password password
here and we're going to become trimmed
password and here that's going to be
password and confirm password here like
that after that I'm gonna add another
from Phil but this one gonna be a this
one gonna be on the a check box coming
from you so I'm gonna just take this one
the check box like there I'm gonna add a
ladle my laddo gonna be a I agree to the
terms and condition I find this in every
other side so I just want to looks cool
so I do this right there so now that
button here with the type of submit
oops don't work with that type submit'
and area I'm gonna just sign up so if we
find what I are Wong what I have right
now
nothing happened yeah cuz we are in the
rooftop but if I go to the sign up look
at this email so here I can click email
here it's password type password and now
I have a checkbox I really like the
design of somatic react that's just
awesome
and I'm gonna just left you right here
for all the UI stuff I don't want to
work with the logging stuff cuz we all
gonna make that tomorrow but here I just
want you know I'm using m8 I don't know
if some people know mmm
but Emma make me I can sit here and tab
I use that a lot in index in HTML but in
react this is like you need to add
something other so I just want to show
you so like you can do a lie here so you
will Li have one file item so I can do
something like that but any react it's
not working out of the box so the first
thing you need is to go to your package
here you need to install some something
called email when you install that you
go to your key map I'm gonna pass that
inside the inside the description but if
you want to add a map you need this sign
of code red a new key map season that's
everything I don't worry after that so I
hope you learn something and today so
for now I think the only thing I need to
do now it's to change my own view so um
when I just change your awesome app in
progress
