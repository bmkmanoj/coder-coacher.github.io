tutorial where we build a meetup app
using a react native and no GS so to do
what we're gonna do its first thing
we're gonna just change some stuff we
did in the last video it just some error
I had done and we're just gonna add some
comment in the backend and after that
we're gonna jump on the front-end and
just start to at least see some of the
native port yeah I know we don't see a
lot of magnetic power right now but you
know when you build a full app like this
where a full stack app we need to take
each part so I like to have some kind of
feature in the backend before jumping in
the front end so it's time to germinate
so once I sorry
I don't want to have so we're gonna jump
on the model file so here what I've done
for now it's I just open right inside my
directories where I have my back end in
my mobile that's gonna be easier for you
to just follow so now open my model file
inside my group now some stuff we're
gonna change its ear we're gonna we can
add some come in just for
lpu when you build your other app yeah
I'm gonna just do a create add meet and
meet up and and yeah to the meetup every
in the group perfect so here it's what
we did in the last video it's the fact
that a group can create a meetup here
we're gonna just change some stuff here
first thing it's a what I've done it's I
find my group by ID and here I just take
this group and I add it to my meter and
I think we can just change that and get
better stuff here so what we're gonna do
its first thing I'm gonna put this meet
up at the top here so like that so I'm
gonna take here here the group I'm gonna
just pass it the ID we pass inside the
param so if you remember inside the
controller here I passing the group ID
coming from my rec time I'm ready there
so like that so the group gonna have an
ID because you know MongoDB only need
objectid right there so here what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna do I'm gonna add
some cumin for you again so I'm gonna
say we add the group ID to the meetup
group element finally this is the author
of that meter so later if you want to
build your own project but he's gonna
get some idea about that so here I'm
gonna do this so here after that inside
the group now we don't gonna just find
by ID we're gonna find by ID and update
so what do you find by idea that dates
that do what you say
it's that gonna find by ID and like an
update with the push we're gonna do here
we see we push but I don't want to do
this line here I can just do here and I
can open my curly bracket there and I
can do push so push it's a method inside
a MongoDB who let you push any man
inside an area so here what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna count my meetup who is
right there and now I'm gonna put my
feet up that ID so the idea I'm gonna
just create right there so now I can
remove this line so here for the command
I'm gonna add a we find the group with
the ID provide in the URL and we push
the media ID media ID in the media
element like that so now because I'm
doing this now I don't need anymore this
promise that I'll what I'm gonna do it's
here I'm gonna do a I'm gonna return an
object that I'm gonna return an object
and area I'm gonna return a meetup
meetup and here I'm gonna make my await
because here I've already get my
premises done so a I'm gonna just avoid
my I'm gonna just avoid my meetup site
that's it
let's see now we didn't save the meetup
right now and now here what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna return the group that's a
because here when we find BIID the that
all with the LVDS thing for us so now
because this is done now we can jump in
the controller because we need to change
some stuff in the bottom here in the
controller you know what we do its first
thing I'm gonna add some stuff it's here
we use an air a air but now it's an
object so now I'm gonna do this truck
inside an object like that
and now that should be good with that
it's a nothing mode to change it just
now remember we return as an object so
now I'm gonna just open postman and just
be sure everything is working so I'm
gonna show you I have saved each of my
tests inside his own folder so right
there so now I'm gonna just do a group
and here I'm gonna do group I'm gonna
just I'm gonna open my rebel Mongo for
take an idea of my group you're gonna
have done a lot of tests me I'm gonna go
to example my collection my group I'm
gonna take a group - I'm gonna take is
ID so I'm gonna just do and copy value
so now here I can just jump inside there
and I want to get my group here that's
gonna go to just remove my dear now I
can go to meet up so I can create a new
middle so here inside my body I'm gonna
say meter this is meter and this is
perfect for the description and now I'm
gonna just send them oh I didn't stop my
server I'm gonna go to my back-end so
need a back-end right there I'm gonna do
you're there for running inside there
when he's done now I can send this one
right there so cannot post API group
what I've done wrong here I'm gonna go
to my route and I'm gonna say group ID
meetups
oops Oh need oh it's new sorry I forget
to put new ear know if I send that title
must be provide so here its title and
now add my video and now you see what
that give me back I have my meetup
object who had a group ID in there and
this is the meetup ID and my group so I
returned my group I have the ID of the
the meetup I've created so now just for
be sure you have my on my element and
now here inside my meetup I have the
last one I just created with an object
ID so that looks good for the change
here what we done and just for be sure
so here I have I'm gonna do so you have
my meetup my description my group ID six
and my group ID is 6 and here I'm
element 27 so the last 127 yeah perfect
so that work perfect for that so now
it's good we gay wiki get each we can
create a group and we can have we can
create a meetup for a group now I'm
gonna just add another function call
currents get group meetup so we want to
get all the meet up of a group so now
here I'm gonna do a sing request hey I'm
gonna take my group ID coming from my
parents like we did before I'm gonna do
some kind of validation so if no group
ID I'm gonna return I read that stereos
for and will with a JSON object with
error of error of thumbs and with a
message say you need to provide group ID
perfect here yes thing as for a
semicolon perfect here now what I'm
gonna do it yeah I'm going to search for
see
if group exists yes we get the idea of
the group so now time to search for it
so yeah I'm gonna do a construe equal I
wait I wait the group that's fine by ID
with the group ID provide so here we're
gonna call the premises but now what
we're gonna do here is we're gonna say
if no group so no group have this idea
we're gonna return
I realize that serious phone drill with
a JSON object error of true sorry here
it's 2 2 here and here now we're gonna
say I'm as a message group not exist
perfect so err we try to find a group
with ID if no group we send this one now
here we're gonna do a try-catch you
remember I really like to build my bad
thing first so we read the series I'm
gonna put phone where that ji-sun yeah
I'm gonna put error of true and I'm
gonna send back a message say Kenda hook
cannot fetch me do perfect here I'm
gonna return yes that serious Chandra so
now if everything is working good what
we want it's we and we're gonna want a
JSON object why I so I'm gonna just make
this kind of invitation because they're
gonna be easier for you to see I'm gonna
say error of fouls and now what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna return my meetups
and now I need to import my meet up at
the top so I'm need to import this model
right there
but for doing this I'm gonna go to my
index gs5 here I'm gonna do the same of
what I've done for my route so I'm gonna
import I like to put that at the top so
import meetup so I give the signal of my
mother from my model here and now here
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create a
new line and now I'm gonna put my feet
up right
don't forget the Coomer you see oh yes
lien it's awesome for that
so now inside my controller here I can
import me to get import media inside
curly bracket because we get the export
as a object like that so now from my
middle ear so from my meetup folder so
now what I'm gonna do right there I'm
gonna see a weight meter that's fine
with that group have the same the same
group ID and if we have that now I want
to populate yeah I'm gonna populate it
with a group so I want to populate group
so what I mean for that it's inside my
model I have a group here so I want to
populate that so what that mean is that
gonna for us that gonna add all the
property of the object so they're gonna
search for us inside the module database
but I only want the name in the front
end nothing more so now I can do this I
can do like that so now what let us to
do its screen and you're out I'm gonna
do here shift command D so that gonna
create for me and you just copy paste
the same line here but now I'm gonna
just do meetup and here I'm gonna change
that forget meetup perfect so now when
this is done I'm gonna say I'm gonna
create a new route here I'm gonna say if
TTP you meet up oh it's EPA groups now I
need some ID so I'm gonna take back my
idea of my one of my group I'm gonna put
it right there
and I'm gonna just do meetups and I'm
gonna sell perfect so this is all the
meter below my group but if you see
inside each meter have a group with with
the object inside so it's a group object
with the name we just told inside the
controller right there when we say
populate so you see just for showing you
I'm gonna remove that I'm gonna save and
now if I run in back if I run in back I
just get a group ID nothing more but now
if I if I want you to show with my
popular
I'm gonna save again we're gonna wait
perfect is running back and now if I
send him back now I get my group name so
this is what we want
what do you can do to with postman in
here I'm gonna save as I'm gonna send
that a group get out Meetup and I'm
gonna save that to my meetup me
collection so now I can just rerun it so
I can came back and we want my Meetup
perfect so oh that makes sense in the
backend I think we should be good to go
and jump inside the front end at least
forget the only thing I want to do in
this video is just get something done in
the front in the front end so get
something to show so now what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna close postman because I
have a lot of CPU and not right now I
think I'm gonna be good with that so I'm
gonna open exponent now what I didn't
show you it's we need to update exponent
so exponent now it's now it's version 14
and we are in version 13 so if you just
you just need to follow me that it's
gonna be really easy so here I have
search and I've seen it's not available
right there so this is what I will like
about exponents so they create a medium
post here and they just show you
everything they change and just what we
need to do first so the first thing we
need to do for change from version 13 we
go to the X that JSON and we take the a
new changer is the key version 4 to 14
so right there
we say so this is good for this one then
I told everything here I'm going to
close the back end perfect after that
they ask you to go to your package JSON
and change
react native version so now you go there
you go to your package.json and now you
see the react native version is 13 now
you remove that and you save the new one
they just give you after that you'll be
sure react at the version 15 point 4
perfect and now just change exponent 4
be 14 right there so when this one is
done now we can there go so open your
terminal go to you a front-end so mobile
and now do RM RF no modules we need to
delete the node module folder perfect
when it's done now run again yarn so
what I do it would you just clean each
everything inside a new module and we
just recompile back the exponent version
so all the I've done some change don't
don't worry I'm going to send that
inside the the readme you're gonna see
everything the leaves change perfect
when is good now inside my exponent I'm
going to click on my meetup mobile
my app so just wait this is that time
the JavaScript start to compile perfect
so now when everything gonna be loading
you're gonna see the device here gonna
be yeah like that so now we're gonna
open in iOS so I'm gonna just close my
row boom on go perfect so now we are
supposed to get what we finish the last
time
so you see everything compiled so this
is a always long the first time but
after that it's a we good to go
so this is what we finished last time
now we see I have some other one this is
the one I've create perfect so first
thing we're gonna do if you've seen my
video about Visual Studio code I show
you how to use a detail confit it's a
thing I'm gonna show you inside I'm
gonna pass it at the top so you can see
the video if you want so I'm gonna show
you how you can add editor config for
you so here I'm gonna just generate
editor config so for us that gonna put
eater config here I'm gonna just put
trueir and I want that to just be inside
my friend because I already want in my
back end so that gonna just give me my
indentation so now I think should be
better if I open my only my treinen so I
don't need to see my back and the folder
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna close this
window so I've just opened my mobile
here now I'm gonna import my ES slim
configuration I have create the only
thing you need to do it's installed
inside your depe dev dependencies so
yeah I'm gonna do yarn out there it's es
lean config equal purse so this is the
same one we use in the back end the only
thing you need to do go to you route
route create a folder file called yes
Liam and now here you just extend and
you're gonna put equal per so the name
of the extension so now if everything is
supposed to be good if I remove
something oh yeah I see it
so now you see missing semicolon perfect
so we finish with that last time with a
really small amount of code area in the
front end and that gave us this famous
awesome Facebook ad right there so here
what we're gonna do now it's we gonna
change a lot of stuff first thing it's
here I'm gonna change my API this is the
first part we're gonna do so what I'm
gonna do is we're gonna create a class
you're gonna see why in the future but
now just follow with me you're gonna see
why here I'm gonna install axles I don't
want to use fetch I don't want to always
start to JSON each address
you're on add axial axial is gonna
already pass for us it's like fetch it's
almost like fetch everything so but the
thing is they give us Jason for free and
gonna see why I do this
yeah I'm gonna export import axles from
Axios perfect so now here what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna do Axios that def to
show that they're false that base URL so
if you can give a base rail to Axios
yeah I'm gonna do HTTP so the name of
the local Oh so local Oh Oh 3,000 and
I'm gonna put a P I like that so now I
have my base for XO so each route now I
can just do slash post slash meet-ups
something like that and all the stuff
here it's already fulfilled after that
I'm gonna do fake group ID so err what
we want it's the group ID of the group
so we're gonna fake the fact then we are
this group right now so just copy paste
this line and take it right there
perfect so now when this is done now
we're going to create a class so can I
use es6 class so we're going to create a
meetup class and at the end we're going
to export it like that so we're gonna
create a class for each kind of resource
in the API so here I'm gonna do a
constructor con should turn like this
and I'm gonna do this that group ID it's
equal to fake group ID just for now
because it remember just a straight way
right now and I'm gonna do this that
that equal group so group like yes I
need a slash here go that another sign
this that group ID whoops that's why you
need to be back step so you see oh yes
then it's it's awesome for that group
and ear it's ID hey I'm gonna sit
meetups so this part gonna be at the end
of this thing right there so now here
I'm gonna create a function call it with
sing fetch group meet up so this one
what we're going to do is we're gonna
take the data so that so axles give us a
response object and we can distract the
data coming from so yeah I'm gonna do a
wait Axios that get there's that perfect
and now here I'm gonna just return that
at meetups because I want only the
meetup so the data ear it's coming from
I'm gonna open my sorry
sorry I'm gonna open my back end like
that I'm gonna open my back end so at
least I can show you some code and the
meetup gonna came from right there so
now when this is done so this is the API
now when this is done we're gonna jump
and we're gonna create a ear inside my
custom some colors I just want to show
you a way to get everything really easy
with reactive so here I'm gonna export
each of my color so you just give name
so what I do is I always put color at
the end so I'm gonna say black for now
black color and I'm gonna be white color
you guys see why in one moment that's
going to be with extent stylesheet with
that awesome package perfect so now we
have the color inside my constant so
that means nothing gonna change in this
file and I have my AP I've done for my
meetup group perfect so now what we're
gonna do it's we gonna jump inside the
main that GS so here inside my min that
yes this is where everything started so
we're gonna change a lot of stuff right
there so here the best way to do we're
gonna just remove everything so we're
gonna remove everything there so we're
gonna just create a keep that class
that's it we're going to remove the
style no need anymore
so here no need anymore activity because
we're going to create
nobody in any more texts nothing here so
we can delete the react native perfect
and now we're gonna just remove that for
now we start almost from scratch
here what we're gonna do oops okay it's
one on it you know what we're gonna do
here we're gonna import so I need first
thing to install it so we're gonna yarn
add react native extend Stan stylesheet
so what I do it's that like the words
say that gonna extend the stylesheet
inside yeah
so what that do it's cuz really react
native you can only use flexbox and this
kind of stuff and I want to use some
kind of variable some kind of with extra
Iraq because another designer I told you
right now I'm not the designer so you're
gonna see and why I use it perfect so
now when this is done the only thing we
need to do there after that is import es
style sheet coming from my react native
style sheet here and now we need to
import the color file we create inside
the constant color why we do this cuz
we're we're gonna do es tile that build
so build all treats style shape we pass
it variable so now we're gonna pass a
variable color so now we can access each
of the color we talked imported it
inside a size sheet coming for me a
style sheet perfect so now after that
we're gonna add some we're gonna add
some state here the state here gonna be
for now not state sorry and what we
gonna do a need for this right now
it's we're gonna just render and we're
going to return home screen so that's
going to be a component we're gonna
create right after so on screen first
thing we're gonna need to create it so
inside my root folder I'm gonna create a
source folder inside the source folder
now I'm gonna create a screen folder so
for each screen I'm going
is on folder so now if we do this now we
are supposed to get this problem yeah
perfect
that makes it so now inside my screen
now I'm gonna create a home screen so
for that home screen that's it
inside my screen now I'm gonna just
create right now at index that GS so
inside my screen right there
and now I'm gonna export everything
coming from my own you're gonna see why
it just will make your life much more
easy when you import something now here
I'm going to create two folder one it's
called style one gonna be skull it's
called component with a s because most
more than one copied on one file called
index that GS and look I'm in screen
home just to be sure and now I'm gonna
create own screen that GS inside my
index that G is it gonna be an easy one
I'm gonna just import Oh screen from
home screen and then I'm gonna export it
like that so this is the thing we're
gonna import ear after that inside my
own screen now we're gonna add some
style and just follow me guess that's
gonna be almost just styles so I don't
want to put a lot of time here so here
I'm gonna import react component cuz
there's going to be a class component
I'm gonna import my view and my text
coming from react native after that a
I'm gonna import my need of epi
so the one we create from my current
stance so you need to do three times dot
and now I'm inside my epi if you want to
know which package do this I have a
video for you I'm gonna add this in the
description and in the video right now
it's about my visual studio code setup
here now after that I'm gonna import
style from Stein and now here I'm gonna
put home screen yes I know we didn't
create it this is what we're gonna do
right now it's go inside your start and
create a home screen that GS why do this
I want to remove H style and put it as a
style 5 Friday like we did with CSS
here right now I'm gonna create don't
have a snippet for this I'm gonna create
so I'm gonna import stylesheet es style
sheet from your native extent style
sheet I'm going to create a current
style with es style sheet create and I'm
gonna have nice that ear so the only
thing here I'm gonna do for just right
now it's going to be easy one I'm gonna
put a root object I'm gonna put Flex one
so flex one we take all the screens
after that I'm going to do a justified
Giusti by contain off center and now
we're gonna put some background color
background color and I'm gonna put three
eight four two five nine so this is a
color we see it's like a Doric ish gray
so what we're gonna do it's why I pad I
want I don't want to like all old colum
my color so now I'm gonna go back to my
constant color here and I'm gonna create
a black black blue color something like
that and now I'm gonna pass it right
there so now I can use this color just
by doing dollar sign and the name of my
variable that's why I love it
perfect so now I think no I'm done gonna
get it so cuz Annie
now here to import own screen from my
screen folder here so now if i refresh
so now nothing happened because now I
have nothing ear
so now I'm gonna do a component class
I'm gonna do on the screen right there
and now here I'm gonna just put a view
with a text say home screen and then I'm
gonna put style of style and the one we
just create route perfect and you see we
get the background color we just put so
I hope you follow that she's done right
now you just I mean we
the style coming from this type folder
so we're gonna have a folder with the
same name so and we know it's D is CSS
because if we don't do this and you get
like 2200 line of code of style and you
add this at the bottom of this you're
gonna get like a 5 of 7 on the red line
of coding this is not what we want
perfect so now I hope here that makes
sense so now here we're gonna create a
the instance of the class here so meetup
API equal new media PP I like this and
now we want to fetch the data so I'm
gonna do static just for now default
props so default props on we're gonna
pass the food press right there phone
like this I'm going to just put my
meetup API so now I can use it as guess
that crap that anything I want with here
inside my state now I'm gonna do to type
loading to be false I'm gonna put
meetups to be an empty area it's almost
like we did before and I'm gonna call
anything component in mouth and now so
when you use component in mal you can
use set state so that's why I using this
one in that will mouth oh yeah I'm gonna
do this that set state so when we start
this component we're gonna have a
loading of true after that we're going
to get the meter coming from the class
we create so this that perhaps that
meetup that another name of fetch just
for be sure I'm gonna take a look of it
so it's fetch group meetup like like
this so now what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to just add this that set state of
loading to befoul so when we get
something so here we have something and
now I'm gonna pass meet up like this so
now if i refresh now i suppose to get
inside my back-end I receive my yet and
is working it's 200 so now we have the
meter inside the state but we need to
show it
but now we need to have some kind of
floating because now we have a loading
tool and it's not all we don't always
see something here because so we're
gonna create a loading screen company
gonna be really easy so inside my source
folder now I'm gonna create a comment
folder I use come in because this is the
component I use everywhere so component
folder inside a folder it's the
component on need for this one and sorry
and comments it's the one I use
everywhere yeah I'm gonna put a loading
screen that GS in this one import we act
import from reignited activity activity
indicator and view after that I'm going
to import style from style and the name
of the component so loading screen we're
gonna create it here I'm gonna do state
less component so I'm gonna say loading
screen the only thing we're gonna have
it's a view with a sty so each time I
create the first time it's a route their
name its route and now here I'm gonna
pass my activity indicator I'm gonna
close it and I'm gonna say size of large
so I want it a large one for effect so
now I need to create my style folder and
I need to create my loading screen file
so now inside my loading screen fine I'm
gonna import again my stylesheet
yes style sheet and now I'm going to
quit root and an easy one Affleck's off
one at justify contain center so here I
want everything to be at the center so
the only thing you need to do it's item
center to so display it's almost like we
do in the web when you see display flex
that's it so flex one take everything so
now you just need to create index that
GS file inside the comments and now
import your loading screen from loading
screen and now your exported loading
screen why we do this because now I can
go to my home screen I can do
import from my command folder now I can
just import right there and you're gonna
see the auto complete loading screen so
now here what I can do it if this that
state that loading so if this if this is
in a building so if it's true we're
gonna return using screen
so now you've done gonna see it maybe no
but now if here I put if here I put a
set timeout I'm gonna just fake some
kind of delay just for showing you so
yeah I'm gonna just do a set timeout and
I'm gonna serve cold here like that and
you know I'm gonna pass it like a two
thousand so two seconds so now you're
gonna see what I've done
you see boom but don't need that for now
so now here have my own screen I'm gonna
pass it inside another view this is the
thing with the flexbox you need to work
with box so I'm gonna here it's on my
box and I want to box one gonna be the
top container and the second one gonna
be the bottom container so here I'm
gonna add a style of top container and
this one going to add a style of bottom
container here what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna import at least I'm gonna create
and that's for no because I'm gonna show
you this time so now do go back just go
to the home screen style and now here
we're gonna do top container I'm going
to seek flecks of one I'm gonna say
justify contain center and I'm gonna say
adding item center and now here I'm
gonna do bottom container and I'm gonna
see only a flex of 0.8 now it's really
hard for you to
what I'm gonna do so I'm gonna say here
a background color of red and here I'm
gonna set background color of the blue
so what I do it's there's the top good I
make a mistake on color I think I can I
miss something a ling center a link item
okay I'm not gonna see so this is flex
one so it's flex 0.8 so it's 80% of this
one so this one it's 50% of the screen
but now is more because now you take the
to the the the point two of this one so
now after that you're inside my own
screen add a component folder inside
this one I'm gonna create my media list
that GS again I know it's a lot of
boilerplate but follow me you're gonna
see why I like that so now create a
style component style folder inside
component and create an index that GS
file inside index that GS file the only
thing we're gonna do right now it's
already import my meetups list from my
Meetup please I'm gonna export it like
we always do just much more easy for me
to just import it so now what I can do
it's coming here I can import it right
there from my component I can say might
meet up list and now I'm gonna pass my
meetup at least right there this list
gonna have access to my Meetup so easy
music meet up so we call a proper come
meet up we're gonna pass it this is that
say that meetups that's it so now inside
my meetup this what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna import react so that's going to be
a stateless component with a view text

the blue and the red for now so you get
the ID but my meetup is there perfect so
now in this one I'm gonna add a style
cow sty that contain container and this
one I'm gonna have my scroll view much
cooler I want this to be horizontal so I
want to swipe from left to right
I'm using scroll view now but in the
future we'll use this view because it's
much more performance
here now I'm gonna do meet up that map

this one is the index in there I'm gonna
do a view I'm gonna add a key to be a

style of meet up chord so now we have
the big mean up so now we're gonna

be easier for you to follow your way I'm
gonna add a style of style of meetup

card and I'm gonna add I of two hundred
and I say with 175 and I'm gonna put
marching are we don't Oh of 1.5% in a
background color just one out of a seven
three eight five nine so it now we get a
good idea of their card you see the only
thing I did I put a width some margin
horizontal with the more doing B to
right and left and a background color so
that I'm gonna do a bad admit up card
top container I'm gonna see flecks of
one and I'm gonna give it a position of
relative after that I'm gonna do a
meet-up card title and this one I'm
gonna just add a position:absolute the
color of white color and a top of 2% and
a left of 2.5% so now if I show you we
get the meet up right there perfect so
now this is what we got with all the CSS
with the end so I know it's not done and
don't worry with that so you
we're gonna add some style because now
what we have style it's like the we we
put so for the meetup type container and
right there where we have the meetup car
title here so this is the place where we
just get the this stuff here but now I'm
gonna just blast my title container here
so right there so my title contender I'm
gonna put before because it's before my
car so title container I'm gonna just
make it as a flex of 0.1 and area I'm
gonna just make it as a as a with some
padding so padding re is on towel
I'm gonna put it 2.5% and I'm gonna do
the same but for the vertical one word
Tico like that so now when I'm doing
this you see I get some stuff here so I
need to put a flex two to my contains on
my content container so here I'm gonna
do contain container I'm gonna put a
flex of 100 X of 1 so if I do this now
we should have a better sizing now I'm
gonna change my my title who is right
there we say my window I'm gonna change
that to be a color of white color so
dollar sign white color for calling the
variable and then I'm gonna just pass a
font size of 25 don't worry we don't

and I'm gonna copy paste all my foot
perfect just to be sure now inside my
phone I'm supposed to have my four front
