part number 13 so what are we going to
build that is going to be a designing
stuff and other navigation so what we're
going to do is we're going to add here
the little icon so the little pencil
here for the icon and after that when we
going to click that that's going to open
the model right there it is going to
give us the place what we're going to do
the tweet so here that's going to be
just adders where we're going to go to
editors but a model where we're going to
create the own others where the tweet
here is going to be the button when we
submit and if we can see the number of
character the people is writing and so
this way we're going to disable the
tweet if after 140 and not disabled but
make it work and don't go over 140 so
this is what we're going to do today so
first stuff is we're going to create the
other ear so we're going to do a DB step
so if we go in find navigation file this
is where we're going to add this this
button so what we want is finally we
just run inside the on screen we want to
add this this icon so what we're going
to do finally it we're gonna first thing
we need to have another screen first and
also after that inside the own ear where
we add the adder layer we're going to
put a derive so what I'm going to do is
we're going to change a bit what we did
in the last it is a so what I mean by
that is here the add our Avatar we have
some design here and this design can
have been done the inside its own file
so what I mean by that is we gonna just
make for any a component with smart so
we're going to create so we're going to
create a button others you can that's
what I mean it's because what I mean by
that it here we have the ad I have a
town where we have the butter we create
a button and it's design it and we have
it pretty like girl we don't want to
recompete the code i'ma leave the cutter
I want you to be a little cutter I don't
need to repeat yourself so what are we
going to do it's finally we're going to
take out this button right there we're
going to go there and we're going to
paste it here so what are we going to do
here after that it's we're going to
import yak only we're going to import
style component from react native and
we're going to import a searchable
library from a pencil searchable now you
know with with that we're going to
create a function called button add R
and this one's going to ask three props
we're going to destructuring them one of
them are going to be side
one of the novitiate one and what I've
done going to be unpressed
so I'm going to put the one you're
supposed to know right now if the we're
going to put the button the first one's
going to be a student so what is that
children it should really is always what
you put inside another component so
example my button air the children of my
button is going to be loading so the
children component and the children
perhaps becomes a component you add
inside perfect
the unpress going to be the function on
Korea so now we can just add on press
here
and also here I just see we have when
it's disabled so when it's disabled
we're going to say this a well visible
so now what is this side so going to be
pretty easy to understand it we have two
sides you can add button air or a button
air so side left side right so you see
you can understand right there I'm going
to say merging right and I'm going to
see if my props
come that side
equal equal right
I'm gonna say give me 16 hours ero and
finally I'm going to copy paste that I'm
going to remove margin yes I'm going to
dismiss it here I'm going to see if this
is less the other side so now I can pass
the side by doing this so now for
sisters gonna wear it I'm going to tick
the button other ear I'm going to import
it right there
now I'm going to replace my button here
and my button here and I'm going to just
put side
so it's up $10 now
side less now if I do there
rebuilding
really long alone
do be like crown
so I make oh I make a typo with
margin-left
now till work perfect so now we can
clean the other avatar so now we can
keep the other episode by cleaning that
we don't need that anymore can remove
the searchable library here so now we
good we did the button left perfect so
now another button let the button add
ours so now what we can do it's finally
done inside the app and now we're going
to put the button here so we're going to
jump back on the navigation we're going
to ear import I can shift them and de or
shift control D for you
if you use Windows and do button headers
and now what I'm going to do I'm going
to jump on the phone inside the admin
now and I'm going to save other write
equal component called button add our
write this one all I'm going to do is
I'm going to subside off right now I
need to put the icon here and because I
do
I done my search get on it we need its
center line icon air inside the export
vector icons
and just add there right there so now
we're going to have the icon the only
thing we need to do is see the color
we're going to use the color that
primary so the blue color of Twitter
we're going to set size of 20 and we're
going to name a pencil remember or I did
the search that was by doing inside the
export vector icon file and now if you
see we get the button so now this button
going to both added the same kind of the
merging from both sides so this one has
the 15 year and this one has 15 year so
that's perfect and plus we give access
to the if slope who give us the 20 each
side
so we see here I don't copy page this
act not copy page but I don't compute
the same code we keep the coat dry this
is really important here so now what are
we going to do so now I want to open
this model by clicking error first thing
it's better to create the screen so
we're going to say new tweet three
that yeah and now just forgetting start
I'm going to just go to my floor I'm
going to copy/paste this thing then go
to my retweet and I'm going to just
change this one by doing command D so
that select both name and now I'm going
to just say that here and put that here
just for make me and make something
really quick now I'm going to jump back
on my navigation I'm going to do shift
command D ear you just copy paste the
same line at the bottom and I'm going to
say by doing come in this new tweet
screen
and now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create finally another net
another set net Gator right here before
this one but if it comes new tweet model
equal tax that Gator
yeah this one now inside this one I'm
going to say it's better if I go the
other way yet I'm going to say new tweet
so that's going to be the name of the
screen I'm going to say screen equal to
new tweet screen and now I'm going to
keep it like that and now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to jump after that
inside my own app now and I'm going to
say right there you pleased with the
string equal to this new tween models
now I need to drill this thing I mean
right now if we don't present a simple
now and we can do it here inside the
admin navigator we get a destructuring
in navigation perhaps we get by default
because we are like we are inside that
navigator and I'm going to Center my
button and er I'm going to say on press
function where there's going to be an
arrow function because we need to call
that by clicking and I said I'm going to
fix navigation that navigate and now we
just need to put the name of this screen
Newsweek by doing this now if everything
is working if I click here that's going
to open my new HP
Oh what did you know what I want to me
what just happening
our struggle so much with these things
so that's why I want you to see where I
get start so here first thing it so that
yummy so this is a navigator so we have
a sign navigator in fact another set
navigator so because of this we become
with two others so one of the thing we
can do for that here go there and we get
an ADD finally one of looking at our
anything I'm gonna stay right there I'm
going to add our mode and I'm going to
say no and none we're going to just
remove the others for if I do this I
don't have any mode others so that's
perfect we did want one eternity
but now this is not visioning for Taiwan
and how we can manage that is first
thing is by designing this component
we're going to design the component I'm
going to check after what we can do
so what we're going to do now is we're
going to jump on the new tweet component
and we're going to create the designing
stuff of the add our end up data but of
the screen so what we're going to do is
we're going to go inside menu to each
screen and we're going to finally get
the stuff so first thing is the route
the route we're going to change that a
bit we're going to just say so they're
gonna see a view but now we're going to
put a background colors equals the props
that Prop that team number props that
team and we're going to say what I want
the background to be what
so that what I want it to be sex one I
want to take the foot space and I want
also to align all my time in the center
remember a line item in this was going
to be left to the right so now if I
click on this thing we just get that and
you see now is get to the left to the
right so now you have a beautiful wide
screen but with nothing inside that so
now if you check out the designing
so we don't get a care about this thing
right now
but we're going to just manage this like
input wrapper and stuff like that so
here what I want finally to do is to get
like a rapper ear where I can get all my
stuff here but I don't want to take the
full width I want to add some padding
from the left and the right so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take this
through I'm gonna create a wrapper
component we're going to be friendly
another view and in this one what I'm
going to do is I'm going to say I of 80%
I'm going to give me a width of 90% I'm
going to size this one from each side
moves don't going to AB the rapper I'm
going to padding the 5
I'm going to keep it like that and I'm
going to just wrap my tweet tip right
there
and for seeing the cup for singing that
I'm going to sit back on color of red
I did wrong a nickel on knuckle on
now you see we get the wrapper like this
is what I say it's now we get ninety
ninety percent we have five percent from
each side we don't going to add the
wrapper so this is one good thing right
now so now it's time to build the input
we're going to put in like that because
yes that's going to be an input we take
almost all the space so the input is
going to be pretty much the whole amount
of stuff so for now I'm going to maybe
put a less color some things going to be
a bit less flashy I'm going to seeker
input equal time that text input like
that so now I want to have my input I'm
going to supply this one I want him to
have the either 40 percent of experiment
and I want to have the width of 100%
again anything finally 90 percent of all
the screen also what I want is I want to
add a font size of 60 at 18 so that's
going to be the front side of the
twitter under user type here and we are
going to add the colors for the text
color and we're going to just put the
secondary color just keep it keep the
thing constant so now I'm going to take
this input and I'm going to make it here
like that now I'm going to save and now
what I'm going to go now I have my input
now I don't see nothing but my input is
right there as you can see this is my
input who is there so now we're going to
add some attribute and we can do this
really easy by doing that inside style
component right there like adding that
attribute and add this thing here first
thing is I want that to be moved to line
because right now I tap everything in
all in the same line so all I can do
this just by saying we'll see line true
so as you know I really like to show you
everything about the coat off now if I
type in a cantar I can go look line so
now you see this is the maximum I
why because I see 40% of the parent so
this is 100% of the fire ram 50% gonna
be there and the 10% less gave us the
four equal perfect so we don't going to
go more down than this perfect but now
what I also want is I want to add a
maximum because I don't want to be able
to type more than 150 K 140 character so
if I add 140 and I click I'm going to
type and what I'm going to get 140 now
you see a tight but nothing happens I
can remove and I can tap again but I
cannot type more perfect so we have one
thing though this is good this is a
really cool feature we can do after that
I want to change the selection color so
for doing this I'm going to need to
import my color for your ball coming in
from my youth seal folder consent now
what I'm going to see it right there and
I also don't any one other thing because
we cannot add a selection color like
that with injury so we need to have the
platform here here what I'm going to do
but I'm going to say selection color
equal is finally flat on that OS equal I
owe s I want the color to be color that
primary like that
life idea now
this color as you can see is the Twitter
color blue now I think it's time to ring
the pink
I want to let them to my user from now
if I type perfect now another thing I
want to if I want to add a placeholder I
want the user know where to add ear so
I'm going to signal there like that and
I'm going to say like what Twitter say
so if it's a web we need to escape this
one what's happening maybe now it's wet
Eponine
as I do this boom we get this one here
that's we have the thing we want right
there so now if you check it some more
yeah it's pretty much the same thing
here is here yep along we have the West
happening stuff we have the text input
we can you but I can type in my text and
then when I select it is the beautiful
blue I want and I want to let the first
letter uppercase and I want also let the
autocorrection so if I say hello
well like that you know well
see what I mean
No well yeah now I can do like that I
to keep that from my user
perfect we did one of the thing we need
to do second thing is I want that to be
focused at the beginning because I need
to have the keyboard open when I go to
the screen because right now if I do
this this is what I found
keyboard you can write when I click so
then that's so easy you go there AB
follow focus and we see true when the
component mouth we're going to purchase
this one and now if I click boom that's
it now yes as a little bone here what
just happening here it's because when I
go back the keyboard go down after we
finally remove it from what we can do
it's taking the keyboard
I'm not sure if I can do this in the
will mouth will unmount like an keyboard
that dismiss
just for thing is that you're going to
work I go there Mexico now you see hmm
what a pen yes the thing is the windmill
become a change before the react
navigation it came after the Vietnam
given back so we're going to need to
manage that after like I say baby step I
just see that just for that you know
this is normal if you don't know how to
open a keyboard here you just do command
key but I open the keyboard or you can
just click here and you see keyboard you
say connect our keyboard toggle so 41
perfect so now we did one thing
and this one right now we can already do
some reject and just add the state of
text and we can see value equal to this
that say that text and say 'are the
unchanged function we're going to create
we're going to unchanged there and this
unchanged check is going to be really a
simple function like we already did
we're going to take the texture and
we're going to do that sets a key value
listen we can keep it like that
perfect
so much this one yeah so now what we
need to build so we have that and we
need to finish with that so I think now
it's time to do the little tweet button
at the bottom all we can do this by
creating a tweet button some panel is
going to be a side of searchable
where I'm going to need to in forget
you
and this one we can already add some
attribute because we need that with my
library touchable layer we need to add
feedback and I'm going to say of the
city and now we are here
also I'm going to add another it's love
because like I say we need to manage the
one with a finger so we don't want them
to click like 20 times so stop 20 left
20 right 20 and maybe button 20 yeah
we're going to take 20 space more than
the face it a background color is going
to be an easy one we're going to add the
frogs that came that cavalry or the
color of Twitter also after that we need
to have just see slide something we need
to have the text right in the center so
this is the thing you're supposed to
know at this point I want to add a width
of PD and I also want to have an ID of
40 so I'm going to do this and I'm going
to take this sweet button I'm going to
put that right there inside my reversal
but now I need to put the some Texans
like that I'm going to take on three
button text equals style that text and
I'm going to take color equal to my
props
why
let's say they found side of 60 and I'm
going to put sweet button text right
there
and I'm going to say tweet
like that
you
now if you check
okay so first thing is that on the right
side and second thing it's not this
border-radius ears so I need to put
somebody radios so we're going to
support our radios of 20 so that's going
to make it a bit circle
now we need to manage a position because
now it's in the left and this is the
right and we know this function can
always say there and we always want them
to be a little bit at the top ear for
what we can do
it added at the position absolute
you
if we do this we need to put a
position:relative on the wrapper
so now if I suppose you should absolute
the thing that happened it's now we're
going to get over
great typo
if I do this now I'm going to get that
over everything because now it gets at
the top left always when you get that
from his parents so now we can say if I
want women to edit the stuff of 60% from
the top and I also want them to be right
zero
so this new keyboard 0 by doing this
what's gonna pair is I'm going to be at
a 60% from the term and when I see right
0 if you remember the rapper
- remember the rapper remove 5% from the
right and the left so you see I touch
zero from the right and I am a 60% from
the top and the top I mean from air or
you see so right there we get something
pretty good so now what we left to do is
the text length here before doing that
we're going to create another component
I'm going to call that I'm going to call
that the excellent length equal side at
six
and this one
have a fun size
of eating
and also as a color equal the famous
blue color we use from the beginning
primary colors and I'm relativistic slim
but I'll make it right down let's not
inside the tweet button sorry ah here
and I'm going to do one party
okay again this is the same thing the
same thing attends that yet but now we
need to change the position so if I see
absolute I want you to understand when
you we see absolute now we get a get at
the top left of is parent so by doing
this we get a text air so now while we
can manage from this one it's now we
know this one is sub 60% and I want them
to be a little tougher this one's I'm
going to produce 5% I'm going to be a
get going to be 16 percent top from this
one and I'm going to sell on to be at
the right
5% I'm going to see why by doing this
I get here right there Wi-Fi percentage
just because if not I'm going to be
right at this point I just want them to
be a little bit better position so now I
want this case to change with the length
of this disc so here this text we write
for what we can do to it easy we can say
right there or maybe not right there but
I'm going to say I mean a critic yet
function here called get text them
who is going to be a function so finally
what we're going to return here is we're
going to return 140
so this is the the lamp and - let's say
that's it so what we can do right there
is take this that text nice
I'm going to do to the understory
because I always put on the skull when
I'm inside my classroom this is my
function so now by doing this now you
get I get 140 and now if I type I get
not a number because this let's say that
text go is the length risk but I append
it to try to minus a number from a
string so now if I size
what and now we get not on number
you
for again
but we get not among ball no I did
something I need to crowd it but I guess
I don't
you
one poke one I'm going to do it England
comes along I take the land and see what
happens I'm going to open my debugger
you
you
now I get zero
so looks like oh I know unchanged too
much web maybe unchanged tech sorry
that's why
you see that's why we need debug
sometime
now if I remove that
ah no you see they get a pen and now we
go down because now it's laggy because
we have the text input would take
another table but they've all got too
much performance so now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to go there I'm gonna
start start and now you see you go down
and follow the length of the user icon
a5 ty boom now I cannot do any more
stuff okay
hello we did that it's a really good
thing we did right now
now what we can manage is the SR now so
now we need to figure out are we going
to manage this thing so it's going to be
pretty easy because we don't complete
them to do anything here but what we're
going to do is go back to the navigation
file and what we're going to add is we
can add some value inside the navigation
option of the tweet model right there so
the first thing we're gonna say here
it's ringing at the navigation option
your function like that and this one
will get the other left you know six
other editor simply by doing this now so
we're going to go one at a time by doing
this now you see what happen it's now
that go over the last one
this person when you back
you see what happened
or the other one Sonali what I can see -
I'm going to say otherwise
because I want to put the X I'm going to
pick button others and now I'm going to
make use of email icon
because I want this little X here
go there I'm gonna see evil icon
open any other color of color that's
primary size we're going to 25 because
they are hazel icon are really small and
we gotta close by doing this now
we get eared there
on what at 10:00 I all forget to put the
side side up right so that's why we
don't have margin
oops so now we get that but now I want
when I click here to get back so what we
can do is add the navigation scrubs here
and now the second year and now Dewey
unpress even
or we're going to call an error function
and I'm going to navigation
addition that coat back and we pack mule
make sure we close the model not near in
sadhana and a single business
so now if I do this I can open that and
I can close it but now look what that
he borrows a star so what we can do is
just add a QT bracket here
at the year
can do it's called a keyboarding
distance before what's inside era in
time react Nexus keyboard now what I can
do right
here it's solving the keyboard the
business right before now you're going
to see what happen I do this
open my keyboard open an ultra soldier
what do you think about that from good I
hope you learn a bit because I mean I
don't a lot I'm doing this business part
and I really want you to be you know now
how to work with this thing so now what
we're going to do in the DEXA teaser is
because we have done this is we're going
to just make use of create a tweet when
I click the tweet' I want to make sure
we can create the tweet and I want when
I create the tweet the tweet up I write
became right there right I start at the
top by doing optimistic see why because
if you don't do it a few mystic avoid
pretty easy local laws to get like this
less than 100 millisecond render but the
thing is in real world one you're going
to push to maybe something like a Roku
and you don't want to pay for your
server a lot that's going to take maybe
a lot of some time so we're going to
make this upstairs in EQI so I hope you
enjoy so please subscribe if you didn't
like and let me know in the comment or
you feel about this episode and I hope
you can add a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
