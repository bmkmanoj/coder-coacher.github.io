number 4 for this first milestone I hope
you enjoy the first three part we just
did so today the plan is to initialize
the react native application and then
styling the wicks react native
navigation library so we're gonna make
use of the netsim library for this
tutorial and not just the react
navigation which GS library for the
navigation so and you're gonna see it's
pretty I mean if you never play with
native linking before yeah that's gonna
be maybe something new for you so first
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna init
a project which we active so we're gonna
do react native in it and we're gonna
see Instagram clone right there and
we're gonna click enter I'm gonna come
back after it's done
for everything it's done I forget to say
to make sure you do this on the root of
your project so make sure you have the
server you are not in the server this is
what I mean by that and so I just
installed react native so I think we're
gonna make use of the version 52
something I didn't say it's you need to
have reg native installed locally inside
you on NPM being like where you run all
your global come in and so so after we
this is done again stake and root tea
victory and we're gonna do MV Instagram
clone to be inside the mobile folder so
this way we're gonna add they're in me
the mobile in the server right there
after that we're gonna do a Sydney
mobile and then we're gonna run yarn
start to make sure everything is working
so for this tutorial I want the Android
people to follow what I'm gonna do
because we're gonna do a bit more setup
than just the iOS installation so this
tutorial is going to be about the iOS
installation plus creating the first
screen and I'm gonna do add another
video is going to be really really like
small and that's gonna be about the
Android installation but the code about
the screen is gonna be the same so you
can follow this part or coming back here
after the any weight is been done so now
we have stored the project so now I'm
going to open another terminal
and I'm going to run react native run
iOS
so that should open air inside my
simulator and Instagram clone
application right there where I'm gonna
see the brand-new application like yeah
really really with nothing almost so
this thing's gonna run you take a quite
a long time when you start for the first
time time you compiling everything so
don't worry about this thing
in the meantime what we can do is I'm
going to open that in this all Sudoku
and I'm gonna make sure
work compiling we compiled everything so
now you in the meantime we're gonna
check the fuller structure we have
almost nothing to do yet so we have the
it's the brand-new application so for
those who have just done application
with the xpac will react app react
native app Android and iOS
polar I think they are hidden but we
don't gonna really touch it
some of Android yes but not really i OS
because when we're going to touch our us
we're going to open Xcode Prada
so you should be able to run and so
after that we're gonna just installing
the woods laboratory for the navigation
so that's gonna be this one a react
native navigation why I make use of this
applicator and not the react navigation
here it's not because I don't blame a
react navigation or nothing like that it
just I think we everyone do a tutorial
it's with navigation from this one reg
navigation because it's really easy to
set up and I think it's it's awesome I
mean the beauty of fusing a JavaScript
navigation here is gonna gonna let you
more customizable the code you can do
what I mean by that it's you can really
make it easy to in the debugger just
open so that mean it's good to run I
read about this so now you see here you
compile nowaday we have put some color
up kind of really like you really and
now you're gonna run yeah perfect now
I'm gonna just remove the debugger I'm
gonna stay back here so yeah so really
navigational some for when you want to
customize in everything you go really
well
don't worry if this is slow inside your
simulator when you build it kind of
really become really really faster but
for this tutorial we're gonna make you
that they reacted and it's an aviation
build by the team of wits so it's 100%
that save navigation and I kind of
really like
yet I mean it's just it's pretty weird
about their institution and at the
installation that all we initialize
their screen so what are we gonna do
it's we gonna installing the library so
first thing I'm gonna just go to their
get them so which issue right there and
as they say here they say to do the
installation writing the AC right there
okay yeah
inside installation iOS we run this
command yarn adrià Mnet's navigation
lattice so we're gonna run this one
right there so make sure you are in
mobile page this comment right there and
click on top so now we're going to
install the latest version of the
reactants in navigation library this one
don't gonna take too much time and this
is done after that so you see it's like
really really easy to follow after that
they say in Xcode so first thing we're
gonna open it's called oh can we do this
it just by running the command iOS open
iOS that Instagram clone that Xcode
project like that so that's going to
open its code for us
you
okay
and now they say in Xcode in the project
navigator left pan
right-click on the library add five
project name and add the react Nets gate
native navigation is called project and
here they put some screenshot you can
check for that if you want so here in
the library right-click I try to
Instagram Chrome after that make sure
you go to the folder right there so the
mobile click on the module react net
same navigation click on iOS and click
on react native navigation Xcode project
click Add so you should see right there
the project first step is done in Xcode
in project navigator left pan click on
your project tab then click on your
target row on the project and target
list so finally what we do is we're
gonna click right there we're gonna go
inside the build phase we open the link
binary and yet manner in section ad lib
reactive navigation so right there what
are we gonna do is we're going to click
on the plus right there and we're gonna
make use of the
react native
we are native navigation we are supposed
to see it
once
one thing I know I can do by doing here
engine so I can drop this thing right
there so I as you can see like if it's
not oh I know I sorry I make a mistake
you see I just make a mistake don't do
this click on Instagram clone here click
on build face click on link binary sorry
I made a big mistake we see you're
supposed to situate in item so that was
one thing I I didn't want to say but
it's pretty weird idea in that now we
can click on the plus and now we're
gonna have the react nets in navigation
right there now it's been at sorry about
that so you see what not to do I hope
you learn so make sure Instagram Chrome
build face link binary after that in
Xcode babbler you go to your dual
setting so click on do setting and now
search for other search tap
and our search pad and now right there
we're gonna add we you're gonna add this
code right there so just copy paste this
code don't worry I'm gonna put a link in
the comment and right there double click
here click on the plus base this thing
and after that it's not done because
here they say make sure on the right to
mark this new pad to be recursive so
click here click on recursive that's it
so now you should receive something like
that so now after that we need to go to
the app delegate M so appdelegate.m and
all right there we're going to need to
change some of the code so what I'm
gonna do it's yeah I'm gonna make it a
bit bigger okay and now like they say
they I put every friends right there and
this is what we're we're gonna need to
do some change about
the code we need for to it to to make it
when he is going to start when we we saw
the project so first thing we're gonna
make to am it's gonna be so you see we
have to add the leg gate bundle URL and
provider and in here they say don't miss
the next time it's important so we need
to put this line right there
copy paste this line and just put this I
like to put it right there I'm gonna
save after that important umbrella this
it's pretty awesome like you can read
this stuff if you get stuck somewhere
and after that what we gonna do it's now
we're going to take this line of code if
dab debug and we're going to just paste
this stuff right here after this though
here I'm gonna just take it the one
comment I know as you can see they put
index right there so it's because
they're gonna search the index that GS
file we have right there if you find the
other version they have you're gonna
have index that iOS right there but we
don't need them so we're gonna just make
use of this version like this indexed
after that we they say don't mix this is
all we bootstrap so finally we're gonna
copy paste this stuff
right there and right after this one
we're gonna paste this line of code and
after they say remove this part so
remove all the earth sweetie reducer
laughs and yes Oh finally remove
everything until the yes so remove all
the stuff it's like that yes and we can
also remove the GS code here like that
and now just be true I'm gonna choose
back my simulator and now we're gonna
test it so as you can see they say now
it's time to just test it so we're gonna
just click run
we're going to see if we're gonna get
some error
are you going to take some time
I'm going to pause the video and I'm
going to come back after so now
everything I've been done it looks like
we get no error but now hmm what happen
and now this is a really good question
and this is because finally we have here
I think this is the arrow right there
but it's talking about
phanie all that work it's we don't have
any place where the applications start
so it's not like a react net that's it
react navigations over here they all
look the same where I'll start in the GS
and go in the screen that's here they
need to go natively so you need to
adjust or the screen so this is what are
we gonna do so here is the part where
the Android users are I want you to came
back after you have done the in your
installation so what we gonna do is
we're gonna go back in visuals vehicle
and now we're gonna code so all we're
gonna plan this stuff so the way that
work with with reignites allocution it's
we need to first thing as in screen and
we just start there then before using
this so first thing we're gonna do it's
inside the mobile we're gonna create a
new folder called SOC so this is
everywhere we if the place where are we
gonna put all the code inside we show
you see I'm gonna create a file called
nav that yes this one's going to be
where we're gonna finally start the
navigation but first for call that we're
going to need to have some screen so why
not create a screen folder inside the
screen folder what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to create a file or folder called
feeds screen
and in this one I'm gonna create a file
called indexes as you know because we
have ended yes that gonna let us
importing feed screen from screen slash
feed screen we don't gonna need to say
slash indict let you guess and why I do
this is because when we have component
we just below this one we can put that
inside this folder and not inside a
computer and folder we're gonna quit
later so inside it's one what we're
gonna do it's I'm gonna start with a
component really simple when I'm gonna
improve the view the text from react
native and I'm gonna create a class
who's going to be free screen now one of
your question before I go too too too
far it's okay
what is all this nipple you just done
and this is a package of career if you
go in the extension and you type react
I'm gonna be write an equal par react
native react crater so this one it's all
my snippet as you can see they are all
there so I'm going to type them because
I'm gonna go faster but if you don't
like it just pause the video and type
what we miss ear what you missed here
so now here I'm gonna just put a view
you with a text and inside this text I'm
going to just type the name of the sorry
new keyboard screen like that
so now we just create the awesome
Instagram app we are done now I'm giving
right there inside the screen we're
going to create a file called index IDs
so make sure then not inside the field
again inside the screen and now inside
this one what are we going to do is
we're gonna import from react native
navigation I'm gonna import navigation
also I'm gonna import my feet screen
from feed screen like that I don't need
to see index @ GS yeah yeah just keep it
small enough to click it now here what
I'm gonna do so I'm gonna create a
function called register screen oops
sorry
and this function here gonna be a
function where are we gonna run the
navigation that will just start
component so this is our we're gonna be
just a component and now here we're
gonna create the name of the screen and
a convention I think it's to put the
name of the application like that thing
like this
and synced up in the name of your screen
so I'm gonna say feed screen I've
changed my font size here so I hope you
like that gonna be helpful for the one
who had say that in the comment if not I
can update that for like 16 or 17 but 17
can medium maximum oh I'm gonna be able
to go so and now here we just need one
thing and then here that's gonna be an
arrow function a natural function and
now here we put their component fits me
nothing more like that so now what we're
gonna do is we're going to after that
jump inside the mad five we just create
so come in here or you can click right
there and now we're gonna import again
navigation from react native navigation
and also after that we're gonna import
from the screen we don't need
see index because again it's an index we
just start a screen like that first
thing we're going to do is we're going
to call this function we're going to
invoke that function right there after
that here I'm gonna export default add
class math and not a component class we
don't need a component here
after that what I'm going to do is I'm
going to just create a constructor so
that's gonna be a function was going to
be called when we're gonna in it the
class and I'm gonna call a function here
called in yet and I'm gonna call this
function right when we construct the
class and in what we need to do it's
calling the navigation with the way
we're going to create the navigator the
navigation which time so so if you look
here inside the level API they add the
start tab based app or start single app
screen app we're gonna start it with
this one the start based app so I don't
invent that in you have everything here
in the ducts and they are pretty good
so navigation that start tab base we
would take it's a function take an
object aerial as an argument and we're
gonna say tabs here we take an array of
object right here we can put a lab load
the library is going to be what we have
here inside the tab at the bottom so
yeah I'm going to say for now feed so
that we need to see the screen and now
here we see Instagram clone the feed
screen as you see is the same name as
put here then I've put here inside my
screen right there so make sure you type
it good so I'm going to just copy paste
this one and you're gonna say I'm gonna
find another we're gonna make it much
more easier perfect and after that I'm
gonna just put a title so the title is
going to be what we're gonna see here
inside the nav bar and I'm gonna say
Instagram like that
oh how can I call this classical because
if i refresh I have nothing again so now
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go inside
my AB the GS so if you want you can
click right there at the GS nothing time
my tab that you're sorry it's inside my
index that yes we don't even need that
anymore so we can delete that but now
here what I'm going to do is I'm going
to remove everything come in a or
control a or whatever you have remove
everything now we're going to import nav
from the SRC now and now right I'm going
to see cons app equal new map and now if
i refresh
and all your work just by refreshing so
you see we have create right there
the first navigation and now here you
see we don't have the ladder because I
forget to put the L if I save and I
retract my screen now I get that but now
you see I need to always be fretting I
don't like that command D in the screen
and click in add enable live reload so
now if I say paradise I remove the s and
I say you're gonna refresh for me
perfect now a defeat pretty boring what
we can do for now
we're gonna just do command C on the
feed screen do command V in the screen
so I'm gonna get another feed screen
right there
I'm gonna click enter and I'm gonna say
Explorer screen because I'm too much
easy we're gonna change this do command
D what control D I think and say
Explorer screen so we selection
everything after that go inside yo we
can call this one we can call this one
go inside your screen inside the index
screen do can comment on ship command D
if you can if you not copy and paste
command D Explorer screen copy paste
Explorer screen come in the ear for
copying the line the line command D
command D command V for pasting and now
we don't have it because we forget to
put that inside the nav so now what we
can do its selection in this object
shift command D or copy and paste this
stuff right there after that
tapping explorer we can paste command v
because we didn't change it we didn't
page copy something else and now here
we're gonna just explore again now if I
save I'm gonna get my expo ear so now I
have this two screen right there so that
was it
this is the installation or reignites of
navigation in iOS I hope you enjoy and
so the next video if you are done the
iOS you don't even need to listen this
one's going to be about the integral and
if you came for any whale again you
should check the next video before come
here so I hope you enjoyed this video
and we canít ow
in a moment have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
