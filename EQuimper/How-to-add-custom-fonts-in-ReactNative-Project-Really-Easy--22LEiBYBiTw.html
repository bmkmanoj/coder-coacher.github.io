to be about how to set up some custom
phone in your application using the
react native CLI so I mean will Expo or
credibly on native app is gonna be
pretty straightforward but sometimes I
get some question about doing this for
the react native CLI so the one you
start by doing react native in it in the
name of your application so this is what
we're gonna do tonight is going to be
pretty straightforward and kind of easy
I mean like five line of code that's so
I just set up a new project so like I
just show you I did react native in it
the name of the applications are call
just that my phone and I run the
application on iOS by doing react native
run iOS after that I open my signature
right there so now what are we gonna do
for start it how can we set up fun so
what we gonna do is we're gonna create a
folder so it's a brand new and if you
don't understand and if I can add that
Jason indicated yes it just because of
the react native 29 it's this way now
you don't have any more index and do it
and in this I us so we're going to
create a folder called assets and I'm
gonna create inside that I follow our
called fonts inside this one I'm gonna
put some basic phone because like we
don't like this funny you just don't
look good enough so I'm gonna go there
and on the Google phone found that
Google calm and I'm gonna search for
maybe like months e-wrap so I want to
add this one so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna click on select this one I'm gonna
open this thing by clicking on the black
tab and I'm gonna click on download
right there after that I'm going to show
in finder I'm going to open it
and I'm gonna take my this is almost
this is all the file we have so I'm
going to just delete this one now what
I'm gonna do I'm gonna go on mine folder
of my application so the one way out
everything and I'm gonna do open dot so
add my folder right there I'm going to
open a set and fun and now what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna open my month see
red right there and I'm going to do
cannon8 to take everything command C and
command V to paste everything there I'm
going to choose this one and now if you
see there I can click on run and I'm
gonna get all the fun right there
perfect so long we we did one thing we
put the fun on the application but now
the application don't know how we can
use it so this is what we're gonna do
and by doing this we're going to just
add some line here right inside the
package that Jason so I'm gonna say our
NPM for react native finally is the
thing when creating a tip run the link
and I'm gonna say accept
so the name of finally this is Excel in
there I just need to put the folder for
me wire that gonna came so I'm gonna say
I set that front that's nothing more to
do now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
go back to my I turn and I'm gonna need
to run react native linked so by doing
this now that's gonna create a group
resource it's a Xcode project and I'll
that's gonna do also the same for
Android I'm gonna show you at the end of
this episode and you read you walk to so
now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open
I oh is that Xcode project and I'm going
to show you in Xcode what that what this
command app done for us
so Xcode right there I've created a
resource folder and I put all the fun we
just put right there nothing more but
now what I need to do because we have
touched the native parts we're gonna run
react native run iOS again to let the
application know then we did some native
change so this is almost always the same
when it will work with react native and
you link a native library you need
always to run this come in so now you
see your nothing has changed because I
didn't told my application to use it so
now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go to
I'm gonna create a photo code I'll show
you see example we create a beer project
I'm gonna have a user folder and inside
this one I'm gonna maybe have like x1
that GS so we're I'm gonna have all my
phone I'm gonna say I have a variable
called phones and I'm gonna export some
variable name it so I'm gonna see
montserrat one say I'm really bad in
there mom see you at with - yeah like
that and I'm gonna see the name of this
finally it's gonna be the name of you
put here so I'm gonna say de montserrat
by default so months you're thinking
already yeah I'm gonna just click on my
regular I'm gonna click enter but then
you just want to add the same thing and
I'm gonna put like that so my montserrat
variable is gonna equal to this months
you're a big lor now what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to go to my add the GS so
where everything start I'm gonna import
my font coming in from my SOC that you
told that foot like that
and now you see the welcome it's this
thing here so I'm going to just put like
that
so the welcome here what I'm gonna do
now I'm gonna say fun family equal funks
that Muncie right I'm gonna say and I'm
gonna refresh my screen and that's it
you see that change he said the same
anymore anymore so if you see that was
the the one negative one and now if I
say this one and i refresh you see that
change so I can use this one two for
this one right there so that change
maybe that don't looks too much because
it's pretty like I mean it looks the
same so I'm gonna use the bold one so
enter when I take the bowl in I'm gonna
say bouncy rap bowl you call this value
and now yeah well I'm gonna say I'm
gonna say that equal montserrat bowl for
the welcome and now if i refresh boom
you see so now that become the fun we
choose so the one we just done just by
doing this little comment and you don't
new need to do any more thing if you
want to add another kind of fun
you go to except fun you add your other
TTF file and you put and you do our
react native link so now I'm gonna do
the same for anywhere so what I'm gonna
do is I'm going to open Genie motion
also Android is gonna work - I mean I
just want to show you then it work - so
I'm gonna open a genie motion at Google
pixel version
so for the one we just want to see that
in iOS you can like almost of the video
right now I mean because this thing is
just for showing the any work to on
engine but I'm sure if you work on a
magnet if it's because you have to work
on both platforms so ok I'm gonna just
run Yankee run Android sorry gonna run
the code
and I take a moment I'm gonna just I
don't think no almost done
in nine I'm gonna post the video I'm
gonna come in back when it's done
this is done and now you see - change
right there the the application fun
familiy because by default the Roboto if
you want to see I'm gonna uncomment this
one now if I click - time on are you see
that was the one but by default now if I
put back my monster right Bo now this is
the value you up so now you can do
whatever you want with all the fun you
put there so I think it's a really good
way to manage if I mean it's pretty easy
so if you don't use Expo or creative and
active native create react native app
will make your life really easy for that
I think this one is the best and the
more easy way to make it on your react
native project I hope you enjoyed this
little video and we talked a lot about
