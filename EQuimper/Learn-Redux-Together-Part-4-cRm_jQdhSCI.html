create a JSON server sorry last time
making put that number don't know where
I can delete some apart and I didn't
change it so we're going to create a
JSON API I don't want to lose time on
this tutorial on the backend but so
that's why I find this JSON server
really easy to use and severity I really
easy to run can be running like two
minutes so the thing you need you need
to install this on server globally first
so and game in so global JSON server
after that what you do is you create a
DVD JSON so we're going to create a DVD
JSON inside the root here and now after
that you just need finally to okay
almost like copy-paste this thing here
and now you have that so now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to change this
thing to be too loose yeah and now I'm
going to just show you I'm glad to do
like that after that I'm going to quit
internet packages and I'm going to
create a new sphere call reason server
and this one going to be what they asked
us to do it this thing right there so
these are server watch the db2 jason
again if you put this DVD editions on
another folder don't forget to put it
right here so now inside under terminal
I'm gonna run your choose a server but
now I get my local O's it's not working
because I have already something in
local oh sweet other so now if we go
down a bit then we're going to see the
court so what we're going to do is here
I'm going to add a port of 2001 or maybe
a 8800 like that like this yeah so now
if I do this yongjian server now I get
this on my local host it
EDD if I go to EDD reduce EDD
I go to EDD to do like that now I get my
to do of the one I've add inside my ear
so if I want example I'm going to create
a second one I'm going to put the ID
like that I'm going to remove the Como
because it's ISA and now if i refresh my
screen I have to to do that data you to
create an Etsy to put the let's do to a
batch they let you delete they let you
fetch everything so that's why I really
love it it's simple to install really
simple to well that's nothing more to to
do with this thing and we have at least
something to make some API requests and
after that we're going to just set up
what we need in video streaming API
request for a change so the only thing
we need to install this to library code
Axios and redux song ISIL is not
probably does but this is the one we're
going to use for make the Ajax request
that we go to the store we're going to
add tank from redox tank and for any we
add this middle work right here so it's
another middle work and you're going to
see what we're going to make with that
later so that was a quick it isn't just
for I set up the DB ji-sun I hope you
enjoyed it care have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
