part where we're going to install the
react native navigation from Wix inside
your reiative project first we have
already some kind of program is not that
much but magnetic navigation won't work
yet with version 52 offering ative and
this is the one we use right now this is
the latest version so that's why so how
can we fix that so it's a good question
and I figure out for you I've created
Fork of this package in my github so
we're gonna make use of this one so just
make use of my URL don't worry I'm gonna
put that in the description and what are
we gonna do if you don't have this react
native navigation who came from my iOS
like that I always portion we just did
before just make sure you enter
reactants in navigation and we're gonna
paste this without the carrot but just
this thing like that
we have netsim navigation and my version
right there go inside your project well
yarn
and now that you install the project for
you and my version perfect
we all set up here after that I'm gonna
open Android studio to my Android polar
that open for me my project
know why they
of the clothes
it just closed everything I don't know
why they are all open but
so now I have my project right there and
now
and now we're gonna finally do the
installation of what week's asked us to
do so that's going to be pretty simple
so we have done this Ling this sorry
this line Ling it's in French sorry
after that what we're going to do is
we're going to go inside the Android
setting a grater so you can also do this
in Visual Studio code you just go there
and you go inside the setting so that's
going to be pretty simple too but I like
to do this game and rich to do so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to copy
paste this stuff right there
and I'm going to place that right there
nothing more I'm gonna say I'm gonna
take sink
you don't need to do this if you use to
do coal I mean it's gonna do that's
going to be done by reactive after that
here what we need to do is go to the app
app bill greider so here inside the bill
Gradle of the app
okay what we need to do is changing this
version here to 25 and changing this one
also to 25 but also because this thing
gonna crash because now you say we don't
add a reverse inversion we can delete
this 9 so 9 1 41 we can delete this line
and now what we can do it just adding
this sign right there
compile project react native navigation
right there after the project of react
native like that I'm going to kick sing
now
after that
this is what we're going to need to do
some code
picture or work okay now we're going to
go inside the app inside Java main
activity and now what are we going to do
here it's we're going to delete finally
everything here and we're going to just
copy and pasting what they are here
so finally we don't gonna use a react
activity but more the splash activity so
this is what Wix asked us to do oops
sorry after that what we're going to do
is we're going to go to the main
application here
and now we're we're going to need to
change some stuff so first thing it's we
gonna change the x10
so the extent we're gonna change is so
first thing we need to import the
navigation application so I'm going to
just click here I'm going to import this
thing right there
and what I'm gonna do after that is I'm
gonna add this thing as the x10 so you
see your extend application that and I'm
gonna also removing the implement and
finally why not take all this stuff and
just do this gonna be easier after that
we can delete just this line because
finally they just see we don't make use
of this line so we can we go
all that and I can do the same for this
one and now what I'm gonna do - its we
need also to add this following because
right now what happening is before we
add index iOS index and drill but now
it's everything start from index so we
can just add this line just here below
so now I think we should be good to go
here they say update and you read
manifests and set the application name
with main application but if you go to
your manifest right there
you're gonna see it's already done so
you don't need so now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to click play and first
thing also don't forget to start your
projects on your own start
and I'm going to open that inside my
Nexus 6 right there so I'm gonna add
your if everything is work and school
have an emulator my emulator here
and now it's building
then I take some time
you
take some time don't worry just right
now a building this is the first time so
that's why I take time so
the greville be running
all I know
and we are good
see good to go
so no
yeah
Sorry Sorry Sorry
and now I get a debugger so something
good so looks like something is working
but I'm gonna just stop the limo des
debugging and one thing it's
okay I see what happened don't take mine
ear so what we can do for that it's
finally we're gonna run from here yeah
they've run Android
now should be good just because I've
done some testing and I didn't want to
Oh
you
and only work
and now you say okay yes it worked but
but now what you need to do it's you're
gonna go inside the next the video of
the iOS part at 13 34 and you're going
to follow what I've done with the knife
but for you we're gonna get nothing yet
in the screen without nikon without
adding an icon here in the tab so go
inside the the video part 4 for the iOS
go at 13 34 so go at 13
and
so we'll go at
13:34 and I'll follow all idea to this
point here so I hope you enjoy and we're
going to figure out the other program so
either good not evil bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
