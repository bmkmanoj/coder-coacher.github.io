that story on so today what we're gonna
do
it's we're gonna update exponent from
version 14 to 15 why I want to make it
it's they use the new react native
version 0.42 so that led us to now use
the percentage so known anymore react
native extent style she so this is what
we're gonna do for starting after that
we remove that if base we're gonna
update some stuff so this is what we're
gonna do first first thing we're gonna
search for native base first native base
so if you do shift command shift command
F you can search here I'm gonna look I
get that it Bates here so I don't need
any more so I'm going to remove it after
that here we import to time for missing
folder so I'm gonna take my material
icon and I'm gonna put it right there
perfect so I'm gonna save after that I'm
gonna jump to my package.json I'm gonna
remove native base and after that ear
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna change this
version to be 15 so this is the new
version of exponent after that I'm gonna
go to Expo thanks Jason I'm gonna change
it to be 15 and now I can run one of the
best coming icon from with yarn its yarn
up create interactive so if you do this
now up David look yes I'm gonna your run
yarn first sorry because I just
reclone my repo because I get weird
stuff so what we're gonna use to today
it's a Redux form so this is what I'm
gonna install today it's a funny estate
manager for your font input friendly and
I really love it
so like they say it's the best way to
manage your phone stake in with arcs so
now I can run my yarn upgrade
interactive perfect I want to update
moments I click space I want to update
export
b15 point zero two and i'm gonna update
async whimpers of mine in reg native and
I can click enter when this one is done
we're going to add redox form
so yeah perfect so I'm going to yarn at
Rideau farm
perfect so now we're gonna jump and
start exponent with X start create
another terminal with that first thing
I'm gonna run my back-end your death
because I don't want to get premises not
end until perfect now I'm gonna run run
X iOS to get my iOS version running we
can await everything starting so I'm
live coding so that's why we get we need
to wait at least you know like how to
make everything so I want to be sure
everyone know everything so we can I get
an error from exponent right now it's
cuz of the new version so just to be
sure everything it's compiling yep so
now I get expo component I've been moved
to expo namespace it should have a so
what I need to do is here I'm gonna
remove so inside main GL I'm gonna
remove component to be at it loading and
now I can remove component here so they
just finally remove the component name
so now I'm gonna refresh everything
gonna work perfect so now time to work
air with the text input who I want now
to be running with redox font so inside
my common folder I'm gonna create that
text input with validation file so
that's going to be a stateless component
we're gonna take the props coming from
redox form so I'm going to import view
from react native I'm going to import
from native element
gonna import form input for level and
form validation message because we're
going to have some validation now today
I'm going to import my colors coming
from my constant folder and now I'm
going to create a stateless component
called text input with validation here
I'm gonna destroy a lot of props finally
it's something give by redox form first
one gonna be input this is some input
value like unchanged in like this stuff
so that we're gonna have container style
that's going to be the style for the
container we're gonna create I'm gonna
put letter so this is the lab but we're
gonna give so finally like we do on
their last if done after that here we're
gonna get meta this is coming from redox
form so we're gonna get touched
so this is to let know the text input if
you have been touched before so you
don't want like to show a validation say
text it's not long enough but the user
didn't touch it before so and I'm gonna
get error to I mean finally here I'm
gonna get custom so this is like I'm
doing recipe return here so I get
everything from the rest so here I'm
going to put a view this view going to
add the style of the container style and
after that I'm gonna jump with a formed
labelled loop from input from label this
one I'm gonna have a ladder for the name
your you're gonna have a fun family on
Mon syrup so finally what we did in the
last result with the form but now you're
gonna know why I want to make it I'm
gonna make lettuce tie and now I want
the Liddell style two other colors of
color that blue black blue color a bit
more dork so that year
I'm gonna have my phone input and this
one I'm going to join with all my input
props I'm going to add all my custom
props and I'm going
finish with them after that here I'm
gonna say if error and that be in touch
I'm gonna show my farm validation
message this one's gonna show ever MSH
oh don't worry I'm gonna show you all
that work but this is coming from redox
form here I'm gonna see font family to
be Muncey read again and the levels tie
two other color so that's going to be a
error message so I think good red color
gonna be good for that first and I hope
you already know at the designer so
sometimes my style it's not the best
here I'm gonna run shift command D for
copy paste my line I'm gonna double
click loading screen I'm gonna do
command D for get both and I'm gonna
paste with command V my text input with
validation after that I'm gonna put a
comma here and command V for example
validation perfect after that now I
having install redox form I need to
first thing to add it to my reducer my
stop my reducer so I'm gonna ear import
reducer as a form so I'm gonna give it
an alias and you're gonna know why cuz I
want to use it with just foreign key
value same now I can add like that
perfect now time to work on the creamy
top so I'm going to show you a bug right
now what we get with react native
navigation plus we redux form I'm going
to import from redox for I'm gonna
import redox for in the field so now I'm
gonna add redox form here so this is I'm
gonna put the I or other component here
and I'm gonna give a name of create
meter so here I toggle finally my form
reducer and I give it the name for this
form here all this from gonna add the
name of quick meter so now if I save
this now you're gonna see the error I'm
gonna get with a react navigation
now I get my navigation white why I get
that I other function navigation a
reactivation I other function competence
sorry and both want to work together
I've put the issue in my ring me and I'm
not alone I think you get some stuff
coming with this stuff so that way I
find it it's I'm gonna put my form
inside his own component and I'm gonna
import it in cream meetup screen so
we're gonna create it I'm going to
create here inside my cream meetup I'm
gonna put a component a folder called
component yeah I'm gonna create the
create meetup form that GS so that's
gonna be the component we're gonna use
for the form of this cream meetup I'm
gonna put to a star come folder I'm
gonna click me every name I'm gonna do
command C for copy paste and now I'm
gonna do a new file and I'm gonna do
come in V for pasting and now I do that
GS here I'm gonna just use ESS to have
my style sheet here - I'm gonna create
an index that yes I'm gonna take again
I'm gonna do rename I'm gonna do command
C and I'm gonna do import from Korean
meetup form in here I'm going to export
it so like we did on other other place
and now here create meetup form gonna be
a simple stateless component so you're
gonna take react after that you're gonna
take you coming from react native after
that you're gonna take the field and the
redox form coming from redox form so
that you're gonna we're gonna add the
input
we're gonna add the button coming from
react native element reactive element
cuz you're gonna see why in one moment
so that here I'm gonna import
from my common folder I'm going to
import my text input with validation we
just create I'm gonna import my colors
from constan color and here I'm gonna
import this tile I'm gonna create a
right after coming from the style folder
and agree meetup for we just created the
fire that's gonna be a stick let's
component create it up for this one then
I'll add a view and this view now gonna
be to replace this view here so you're
gonna add the side container so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna copy paste our
content our air from the style coming
from the equipment up screen and the
item because I know I'm gonna need it
I'm gonna copy paste right there so now
here I'm gonna do you to be a sty style
that container perfect after that now
that means I want to get this view with
the form so now I can remove the redox
one here I don't need anymore like that
so now I want to plug the screen meetup
form to which redox form because it's
not a class we cannot use the decorator
so I'm gonna connect this one with the
all the way here that's gonna take an
object here with a form and I'm gonna
put the create meetup so the name I want
to give to the screen meetup form and
now I'm gonna go here and I'm gonna
import come in that from my component
folder and now I'm gonna add the Queen
meetup form right there to replace the
container now if I do this nothing gonna
really change what are we gonna have
some weird stuff yeah cuz now we have a
container here and another container
here but now don't worry we're gonna
change it I'm not a designer but
that ban so now here what I'm gonna do
it's this is the way you end all the
stuff with me rock song it's you called
egg feel so this is a another hoc and
you put component so we take a component
and we're gonna put text input
validation because we do this the text
input validation I'm gonna add all the
props coming from the field so all the
props I'll show you in the last file
it's the input and the custom doesn't
matter whether ever and touch here I'm
gonna say this is what you need to put a
title and then so if I do this now we're
gonna see what I'm gonna now I have my
my field with all a label in everything
so now I'm gonna add the level of title
and I can do this cuz I put a label as a
props and I use it here so now if I show
you
I'm getting my title like before but now
if you see the label is a bit darker
because now I'm using the black blue
colors after that in a creamy top now
here I'm going to add my selection color
so forgetting the forgetting the
selection finally we are like before and
now I'm gonna add a container style
container style yeah and I'm gonna put
it the style of item oops
but upper case lower case yes then it's
video helpful for there and now we get
like the five percent margin we put here
from the start right there a two percent
margin so now I'm gonna do when I take
everything I'm going to shift command D
to copy everything here I'm gonna keep
the component here but now the name
going to be description and the lab are
going to be description Plus this one
gonna be built e line like before and
now if I show you boom we have title and
description so what I'm gonna do just to
make it cleaner I'm gonna go to my
screen here and I'm gonna remove both
perfect after that
I won now to have my I want to copy
paste this one here I'm gonna copy this
one I'm gonna drum here and I'm gonna
pace here right there so now I've my
button already imported but now I need
to do my button click inside my style
Jameer I'm gonna do my button create I'm
gonna just copy paste what we have
before inside this one so now I've both
but now I don't have this this function
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just
remove it for now I just want to be sure
we got everything I'm gonna go here so
now I can remove the button create I
don't need anymore
I don't need item and container anymore
here in the Queen meetup screen now the
Queen meetup form now here I'm gonna
save but I'm gonna remove this stuff
before like that mmm I hope you follow
what I've done it's a video so at least
you can come back and as you can see we
have the meetup date right now but we're
gonna figure out cuz we're gonna just
take it off and we're gonna put it
inside the forum so we just finally get
everything from the phone right there so
the one with for the show for just this
button right there so I'm gonna take
this button and I'm gonna make it right
there at the top and I'm gonna just
remove the check title for now and
unpress for now now if I do this I'm
gonna remove this one I'm gonna remove
everything container I'm gonna keep my
creat meetup form like that so now if I
do now I get this but I have no title
and I get back finally where we are
before so now time to add some props to
the creamy top form so we can add the we
can do stuff here so first thing I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna create create
meet up and we're gonna pass the these
that create meetup function we have from
this one here after that I'm gonna sell
show date time take care and I'm gonna
put my DS that show the time picker and
I'm gonna put my check check tight up
and I'm gonna put my dis that check
tight oh if i do this now i just need to
run to my creamy top form now and here
I'm gonna destructuring cause I'm gonna
have some so I'm going to do create meet
up check title and show date/time picker
so now what I'm gonna do
it's inside my my button my button here
what I'm gonna make it it's I'm gonna
put on some milk so myth I'm gonna put
the create meet-up action after that
inside my button here I'm gonna put
title to be equal to check that title
check title sorry and I'm gonna have a
unpress even with my show
big time picker so if I do this we are
supposed to come back to where we are
before title function oh I know why here
I'm gonna call my function right there
perfect so know pick a date perfect now
is working again
perfect now okay that don't looks like
like nothing really changes or have here
and I have my title here myself so
nothing change but now what we can do is
we can add validation so here inside my
create meetup fuller I'm gonna create a
file called Valley the chanda GS this
one gonna be a function
create the Li they shall create meetup
validation and equal you're gonna take
some values yeah we're gonna start with
a empty object of error here I'm gonna
do cons require fields fields and I'm
gonna say for now I'm gonna sit title
and description so this is both feel
after that ear what I'm gonna do is
require fields that we're going to make
a for each and we're gonna see fields
I'm gonna do to the bracket and now what
I'm gonna say if no values to my field
so for each field what I'm gonna do is
say ever that feels so this is K
interpolation so I mean it's a with a
key with the object we pass so this is
the variable we get here from the field
so now I'm gonna say re Quarrier so if
no value it's required after that here
I'm gonna see if value so value it's an
object with all the way you for the from
from the form if value that title and so
if we have a value of title and value
that title the lamp it's smaller than
six so so you remember we need fine I'm
gonna say error that title equal need to
be longer so that I'm gonna say if value
that description and value that
description that only its - 6 - I'm
gonna say the same error ear with
description but I don't want to copy
face boat so what I'm gonna say is I'm
gonna say current longer need longer I'm
gonna put copy paste this one here and
now I'm gonna make the I did command
default keep take boat
perfect and now here don't forget to
return error so the error object here
well now what I can do it's go to my
create meetup for here at the top here
now I'm gonna import from the radiation
I'm gonna import create meter validation
and I'm gonna put now validate and I'm
gonna put to create middle validation so
this is a secret they're gonna make an
asynchronous validation of my field so
now if I show you I'm gonna click here
but I'm gonna cook another I think now I
get require you see because now if you
remember in my text input validation
they say touch and error I touch so I
get the require after that if I start to
type need to be longer and when he's
done that means I have six can do the
same here perfect so now I have some
validation so I think this is just
really good for user perspective so now
if you refresh and I don't touch that
thing add that thing I touch hello and
now I go there I have no problem but now
if I remove I get need to be longer
because you get touch and add an error
perfect after that from the criminal
form so coming from we rent me tax form
we get some props we get endl submit so
understatement we've got a pass us out
the value from this form so from this
component all the value you can see in
the this form so now I'm gonna add in
value so this is when we have some
invalidation and plus some mitten so
some a 10 mean when we submit we want to
we're gonna use it on the button to
disable it so when we submit we want the
button to be disabled to just make it
don't we use anymore so here
forget the answer me the only thing we
need to do is to put in those submit and
I'm gonna put my cream in up yeah
so and they're gonna pass all the value
to creamy dough after that here what I'm
gonna say so I'm gonna say disabled and
now what I'm gonna do
it's invalid or submit it if it's
invalid or submitting so now what we got
it's now it's invalid so now if I CLO
like that and now if I type five perfect
now I get perfect so now the creamy top
form is working now that's going to be
the time to work with the redox under to
make the stuff cuz now we are get almost
the same way and I know I sure so now I
can remove this in my creamy top screen
I know I should just keep everything in
reactionary with the sets take this
application mean I mean that don't gonna
be the next Facebook and then we're
gonna use without just to get to just to
let you know oh you can use without and
the first thing I'm not the best redox
developer but I know some stuff about it
so what I'm gonna do it here I could
imagine inside my queen meetup and now
I'm gonna import my meetup API so if you
remember they pee I we create the class
API will create so from EPR after that
I'm gonna do cards meetup API
oops yeah quite new neither API so I'm
gonna initially my class here I'm going
to create after that three three action
but now before I do this I need to add
it to my store redox tongue so redox
tongue make you available to me to use
this patch coming from redox in a Singh
way so I'm gonna do yarn at redox tonk
anything you need to do there
it's do import chunk coming from redox
tongue we're gonna get it when it's done
perfect redox
we dogs thunk yep and I'm gonna add it
right there with just talk no need to
call after that I can use what I'm gonna
do
so here I'm gonna do see if you use my
snippet it's our city to be with our
constant enter and now I'm gonna type
create meet up so that I'm gonna do
command D to go in the other line I'm
gonna do our CT again I'm gonna do
create meter success after that come in
the again re CT create meter ever if
that doesn't work so yeah I'm gonna
create my function call create meet up
and this one gonna take some argument so
that's gonna be the argument coming from
me that's form here I'm gonna do a sing
and dispatch dispatch it's what we are
in the store by default when we do this
up from the dispatch but because we use
now the media we're a free ducks tongue
we have access of dispatch and action so
here what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
dispatch when I start a type of create
meetup so I'm going to just enter an
action here after that I'm gonna do
around a try and I catch the cat gonna
take and there are but I don't really
gonna use it but here what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna dispatch sorry I'm going to
return this patch with a type of create
meetup error here what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna avoid because I have anything
so I cannot wait now meetup the create
group and I'm gonna put my orcs oh and
when it's done after it's a weight I'm
gonna dispatch create meetup success and
now what I want it so now I cream my
meetup I'm gonna show some loading
screen but what I wanted
gonna close my window so I'm gonna close
my model and I want to come back to the
on screen and we stretch again
yes I cannot do it with we dogs but I
just want to refresh again because I
think that's gonna make more sense in
the future what I'm gonna make with you
so I know this is maybe not the best
practice but for now I think that's
gonna be good so we're gonna ear import
from home in action so we have already
created section I'm gonna import fetch
my meetup in here if everything is
working and will return a white dispatch
and I'm gonna dispatch now my function
fetch meter like that perfect after that
ear and Sam I could meet up now I can
clean my reducer for this screen so I
could I reduce off for each screen this
is what I do want to react native from
sure I'm gonna import my create meet up
meet up error and my create meet up
success
perfect yeah I'm gonna create a initial
state constant and I'm gonna say error
it's an object with on to be false and a
message be nude by default and now air
I'm gonna see is loading to be false by
default so I'm gonna create a reducer or
ordi if you use my snippet and I'm gonna
put initial state here so if you don't
if you want to use my snippet
individuals to do you go to extension
you type react and it should be the yeah
the first one right there we are native
react we dog snippet after that here I'm
gonna say create meetup what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna return that the dot
initial stay but is loading to be true
why I do that initial state it's because
example I get an error I want to be
fetch my row gonna be true but I want
don't want to recreate it so I'm gonna
just the initial state I'm gonna we get
this back
but now the loading gonna be true after
that I'm gonna create another case of
create me dogs to set yeah I'm gonna
return
we turn I'm going to return with initial
state I don't want to get the error but
now area I'm going to get is loading to
be false and now finally what I'm gonna
get an error we're gonna return this one
gonna have an error of fun to be true
and message error I pen so I'm really
good with error and now I'm gonna say is
loading to be false perfect now inside
my index now what I'm gonna do it's I'm
gonna I'm gonna do come in D shift
command D here I'm gonna say create
meter we do sir coming from reducer and
I'm gonna import it perfect so now after
that I'm gonna jump to my redox reduce
our redox with command P video sir right
there now I'm gonna do here create
meetup we do sir now I'm gonna say here
create Meetup so each screen gonna have
is reducer queen me the producer perfect
perfect this reduce are gonna be good so
we are the only thing you need to know
it so what I'm gonna create a meetup
diluting gonna be true after that when
he success the loading its false and if
you have an error we have an error and
if you see in the action but that means
we get diluting true now we get the
login and false air will get the routine
false here if everything is working good
so because here we return to that brick
right there but here we're gonna return
a fetch me my meet up again perfect so
now what we need to do to do its we're
gonna jump back to the create meetup
screen and now we're gonna connect this
one so now I'm gonna connect Redux ear
and I'm gonna cut it here connect and
I'm gonna
open with my state and I want to get
Meetup
so this addendum and gave it to state
that create meet up after that I'm gonna
import my create action create meet up
and I'm gonna pass it right there create
meet up don't need to dispatch this is
that prep let dispatch after that just
because I I know I don't need any more
I'm gonna export the folded up and make
less line export default oops and export
default perfect so now here what I'm
gonna do it's now so now what I'm gonna
make its I want to call my cream beat up
and pass my value coming from redox form
so now if you look at it I don't need
any more title in the description this
is B the exponent elite for us after
that we don't need anymore change title
and to change the description redox from
and elite for us and now this function
now we're gonna need to change because
now we're going to use video X so this
function what's going to do it's gonna
avoid the function this that traps the
create meter and we're gonna pass the
value so I'm gonna pass your value so
that's going to be the value coming from
the redox from library when we end
though some it's an air one this one
it's done so when it's a weight I'm
gonna do this that drops that navigation
Navi gation and I'm going to go back so
the same a phone I click the X what I
say it's when we finish to create it so
this is a premesis I'm gonna me run to
go back so I want to came back to the
home screen so after that here I don't
need anymore the title so just for now
we're gonna keep it really simple like
that
after that ear we need that this stuff
is good perfect so now what I'm gonna do
perfect
so now I think we can try to create so
I'm gonna call this one this is Sunday
oh I forget so i get my lawyer
this is description so now i'm gonna
cream it up oh I know what I forget I
want to show the loading screen so what
I'm gonna make it's inside my cream eat
up now I'm gonna import from comments so
I don't know it so I'm gonna import here
my loading screen friendly because maybe
now it's easy cuz we rerun on lock
allows but later if they use other
batting internet connection we want to
have some loading screen a better u X
now I can remove my cont meetup API here
