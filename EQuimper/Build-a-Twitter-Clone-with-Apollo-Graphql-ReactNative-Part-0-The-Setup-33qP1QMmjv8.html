video of the Twitter clone with graphs
to alleviate that deal so for this video
that's going to be like the kind of pre
fat so this is where we're going to
configure eight all the basic server to
make it run and after that we're going
to start to learn so or so here I'm
going to just tell you all I'm going to
manage this tutorial now there's going
to be my new my new version of teaching
so what I'm going to do I do is here
inside the the repo I'm going to ask
every it is not gonna have its own
branch so this way it's easy for you to
to get that like the setup and know
where at the end of beat the video you
just watch where you should be and like
that so the master are going to be the
final project so with everything inside
and the like HP's are going to have the
place where I finishes so I push it
right after the video so a what I do is
I create a insider in me and I create
like everything we're going to do so I
radius and ear please Manglish it from
the perfect so if you think you can do
better please do a pull request and I'm
gonna accept that at 100 percent I have
written maybe gonna need L for the
English part so thank you for it so here
we're going to go over the pre Ricky for
this video so what we you need to do and
know is to add MongoDB and sale and
they'll react NetSuite and nodejs so I
don't go over that find on Google you're
going to see so many tutorial about set
up this tool tested after that I want
you to have an understanding basic
understanding on MongoDB nogf reignited
and a bit of graph drill when I'm in a
bit I just want you to at least
understand well is gradual so what that
and why everyone loves it and that's
nothing more and maybe like a bit about
proving resolver but it's okay if you
don't
after that I want you to know some part
about the website yet because we're
gonna have real time for the cyber risk
and add a new tweet and be passing with
me so so err as you can see I put
everything in the part one but this part
going to be breaking two part the part
I'm going to fit part 0 it's going to be
the basic setup and the part one is
going to be what we're gonna start with
the SQL so it's going to be the time to
start so now here what we need to do
first create a folder that's it and
after that inside this one you need to
create two folder one going to be server
so we're going to stop here for now
so create a folder called server CD
inside this one after that here open it
in you text editor after that treat I
getting no files put no module inside we
don't want to push it to get up and
after that run the command yarn enos or
in gaming it and kick and turn until the
M not anymore
after that here what we need to run you
SQL with no GS its I'm going to make use
of Express this is the free mode the
most usual mode so we're going to add
three packages Express body parser crust
and like I say I want you to have some
basic learning about nodejs or Express
if there's going to be like the
framework kind of framework for the
dough GS body parser we need that to
pour the JSON format for SQL for the
post and finally cross M is for adding
environment variable working for the
Windows user nothing more after that
create a folder inside the root called
source and be sure you are inside server
first so I create a file called index at
year here we're going to setup the basic
Express server so X import Express
import body for serve from body for sir
here create
a nap instance of Express gso current
app equal Express after that we're going
to say which part we want the Express
server to run so process that and that
node not node but court or 3,000 of this
line would on understand that when you
push away Roku something like that is
eternal shame you're going to use the
environment port if not here what we say
it's we see 2000 so if this one is
undefined or null we're going to use
2000 hey I'm going to make I'm going to
put body force or that Jason middleware
inside my app so this is all you do this
in a in express out to put middleware
and in finally we're going to go to a
pretty simple app defense part if we
have a callback where we receive an
error if we have an error we're going to
consult error this error else we're
going to console load up listen to port
and then we're going to put the variable
port right there
so I hope you understand the import from
in this stuff I'm going to write in es6
es7 feature I'm going to make use of all
the lattice rescue I think make the
language much more arson so if you don't
understand this point it's like they
require so that's here now inside
package Jason we're going to create a
new script well we're going to make use
of the cross M so cross and node n equal
they're just and what is that like I
told you it's for make use of the node
environment make it easy for the Windows
user to add an environment variable
because in Mac we have on that by
default mode and here we're going to say
node source that index yeah so here I
want to start my my project with no my
index address inside source in inside
and um EndNote M so now if I run your
death oh my god what just happening here
yeah you see unit potato can import no
GS right now don't really understand
everything about the
like yes seven stocker yes so you don't
understand again the imported just on
the assembly require and I don't want to
go too much in this topic but this is
what that means so we're we're going to
install babel to make it work so what we
need to make it work is we're going to
need better CLI with the tool you run
the data we're going to make use of
that'll preset in m whoo
it's the way to say i want to run or
maybe like no GS 6.10 so give me
everything I need to run on this one and
that'll plugging transform object rest
period here it just for adding the
spread of errors are working and don't
forget to install that in dev dependency
so I installed this after that I'm going
to go there and I'm going to copy paste
what I have here just to make it quicker
for us so what we need to do here is
we're going to create a new file and
we're going to say here battle that I
see you get a pacer for the one will add
watch other video from me it's the my
basic stuff here I say I want to run on
6.10 and I put my plug in nothing more
here pretty simple now here I want to
run this stuff so here what I'm going to
add is I'm going to add that a note
right there if I do this and I run the
on there now what good at them no I
guess I cannot go cry thingy so yeah now
the app is running applicant to 3000 we
are good to go we just build and now
some app we good no I mean I'm thinking
so you when I will happen in - now
that's work so babble take the code here
and make it look what no just wanted to
see so we're going to make it they
require here and everything going to be
the version what you need to read from
6.0 perfect now I say oh
so I do some changes example I do this
and I say nothing at them what I need I
need no one for that no man we're gonna
make finally at the code we run on
change yarn
add the gnomon in there the frenzied
perfect go back in package.json you put
gnome on
can we see exact and now if I save it
and I we run you're in there when I pan
still work oh yeah let me take it sorry
I have another terminal open with the
same so now I can do this you're on
there and now now it's work but now if I
save look II restart perfect so if I
change that to 3,000 won
now a year is going to be 2001 all right
Basic Express setup done time to do the
MongoDB folder config right there in
source we're going to create a new file
called constant come then that year and
this one we're going to put to constant
for now import default port so we're
going to put the process end part so the
same thing we have another one so we're
going to clean the code after that here
we get a CD be that URL and I'm going to
say a inside string MongoDB locale and
now which database I want it I'm going
to take tweet develop them like that now
start my config I'm going to create
another file called DB that gf but now
I'm going to make use of Mongoose to for
that so air is going to be pretty simple
I'm going to say add the Mongoose and
not the Mongoose
so Mongoose is the ORM we're gonna touch
the monkey DB directly so I don't need
to make this thing by myself that's good
and they have a really good API to make
it work okay we're going to import
Mongoose from Mongoose after that I'm
going to import my constant object from
constant that yes
here we're going to say Mongoose that
promises equal global promises so
finally you know what I'm going to go to
the ear and I'm going to copy paste this
line right there for now
I'm going to tell you what that dude's
going to be better for you
we need that because we're going to get
an error about the precondition about
promises after that ear what we said I
want to add a debug on so what I mean
you're going to see that in the next
episode it's finally we're gonna see if
we time we insert create delete update
whatever the DB we'll get to see the
process in the DB yeah after I say
Mongoose connect so I'm going to try an
error that's going to be more about
testing so I just put that because I put
this thing every time any right to
connect with my content DB URL with this
URL right there if it if you don't
connect I'm going to try to create a
connection and finally here I say use
one gue client because Mon now Mongo
asked for this perfect now how can I get
this connection so just be sure here if
everything is word I'm going to see
MongoDB running so now nothing happen
here because now I'm going to need to
import this song will be be here I'm
going to import from config DB like that
and now if you things work boom MongoDB
running perfect so now we just setup
MongoDB Express so now time to do
something else we're going to install
ESPN so that's why you see me adding
this es Lindo console stuff here real
easy what you see a sleighing again add
another video where i talk about that it
just a way to see your error really yarn
add - b es lien yes Len yes income pay
so this is my configuration you don't
really need to follow this one if you
don't I'm going to add prettier already
and yes link containing prettier I'm
going to make a video about that only
but they are pretty simple to understand
finally just about like it I'm really a
good code looking addict so yeah I'm
going to see a extent is going to be an
average what I'm going to put my my
configuration so equal per and prettier
here so for the one who don't understand
this fortunately it's always that is sir
master yes and configuration any weights
them so now if you're eating is work I'm
going to call on my
Windows by doing commented coming the
value coming TW like that now if I go to
my index that year now I get some error
will see unit spectate console statement
so myosin is just say our warning so
that's why it's bring any say a this
thing here here I don't want it to I do
have this in prediction so that's why I
put the console load so for now the way
to remove it is I'm going to stick here
at the top we important to have only one
star from each side I'm going to say
ESPN disabled if I do this I disabled
everything but I want to still as it
work so I'm guessing new console so
finally the error message if you don't
know where to search for this your
Savior
one sick I'm going to just take anything
now you see the error right there it's a
new console perfect so now I can check
and that's it now that's work and why
it's awesome yes'm if I do this Oh what
is that you enable to result back to
module nothing you see so yes I'm going
to be really there to help me to give
you the code so when I do some typos
that's going to be there for me and
after that now here what we what we are
going to go it's now I'm going to just
finally add the prettier on it so what
is prettier it's a way to make all your
code really pretty
so here prettier organized I want every
quote in my app to be single quote and
after that I'm going to say Korean width
to be Eadie
so I mean the the width from the left to
the right 80 so the this is the width of
the screen I'm going to say I want to
have a trilling coma so this is the last
comb at the end of each stuff yeah I'm
going to say I want to add two to see
every file would have been right in here
inside quote single quote because we are
in double quote I'm good sick source two
stars /gs of every file javascript files
inside source so now what I'm going to
show you is exam
if I do something like that someone give
you cold and look like this thing really
bad but now if I run your on prettier
look at this boom everything is perfect
for us here if I do like something like
that we are too much space you run PDR
boom that came back where they are last
thing a double code there someone give
you code give you the real code you run
prettier boom single code exit so we
just set up the basic server for make
the app working next one we're going to
go over the inspiration of the graph QL
server on this we're going to set up the
first collection account we because we
built with our so yes I find a good name
and we're going to go over making some
mugs with shakers with that and make the
first curry with graph QL so hope you
enjoyed this part 0 finally this preface
so we talk later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
