can you all hear me hello what up
perfect yeah Oh everyone's going today
okay yeah oh yes I can
yeah it's something like I really want
to learn in same time so yes this is
something I can think about that Julian
you just like I'm pretty new in
programming and so I just tried to
improve the skill i have right now and
after that I'm gonna jump on other stuff
so this project I just gonna build there
is just a project I've built in the past
so if you have seen like my movie tinder
application I've built with react native
I just want to take this ID and just
make my kind of own social media about
movie and TV show we can dominate week
on foundation like to find it and movie
stuff like that
nothing crazy but you just a funny idea
I got
oh thank you yeah it's that was just
something like I got as an ID in a
weekend I just like build the project
really quick and I just want to share
what I've learned in this weekend so
this is almost like always what I do
it's I just play with some technology
and when I learned something and I would
like someone to teach me before I just
try to give it like example right now
I'm try to do a video about a full
identification because I know I didn't
find this kind of tutorial before like
what I mean it's like having password
reset having all to do like a two-way
Atta fication
and stuff like that like sending SMS to
identification plus the password we set
out to send email after you have been
created user and stuff like that plus
all to send education in react net
season
yeah
most
so right now I just really just do the
basic setup
oh it's I mean you mean like there come
and I just I it's I remember daddy just
cuz I have set up a lot of little
project and just I I know ever like a
kind of a good memory but this is this
is not that that we see and I have a lot
of like for react I have a lot of
snippet ask me like if you type in react
I think I'm right there and this is my
snippet as to five qv8 so this is just
because i just remember this kind of
stuff so what I think I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna just set up like I've done
with the Twitter clone I'm gonna just
set up wet packed pretty quick maybe not
webpack but bad or at least and I'm
gonna just copy paste one that I see
this oops like that
and what I need it's your ad - deep
babbles CLI bubble preset and on Mon all
in the F dependency after that I'm gonna
need to my object RESP red because I
want to use the spread check so now I
can just set up my script put here
really I put that off
oh yeah I think I'm gonna be good and
now I'm gonna just set up the app just
quick and see if it's gonna work
okay so what I've missed
cross E&amp;amp;V del fine preset in V relative
to
true yeah well I can't have done this I
don't know why I've done this which one
I've installed oh thank you
I think I have done a mean story so yarn
a - sorry thank you
it's a good thing I was live streaming
so now I can just remove this one and
this one
and now that's thing that's why I got
this terror yeah Thank You Daniel you
just saved me
perfect so no this is what I'm gonna do
so yeah so my act finally oh my app
gonna work it's gonna be I mean I start
to just set up the business logic so
what I want to do it's first thing that
ABS gonna be like about everything about
like movie and TV show like I'm really a
dick about watching movie and always
watching TV show like example game I've
shown you just finish and stuff like
that and I was always me and my
girlfriend we are always like looking
for new movie and new TV show and we
never really find something like good so
like I mean we want to always watch new
movie but we never know which one to
watch so I just thinking about like just
creating like a small little social
media while example you have some you
follow some people who like the kind of
movie you like and you just get an idea
about what whatever they have watched in
the past like day and something like
that inside you feed and you see like
the rating and they review and stuff
like that so just to give you an ID plus
I'm gonna have my sweating left and
right like tinder for you to get the
recommended a Wiccan so the term about
like you're getting a movie you're gonna
like and stuff like this and I'm gonna
keep track of what the user I've like
and actually ever and give him which TV
show you can watch in the future and the
tank receipt just I want to learn much
more about building a social media yeah
so I just check yeah so what I think I'm
gonna do first I think I'm gonna jump on
the mobile side first yeah I think the
mobile play is gonna be better
I'm more of a front-end guys and I think
I'm gonna go there and for this kind of
app I
should I go with Expo yeah I think I'm
gonna go with the Expos gonna be easier
oh yeah I don't mean like this is the
kind of question you need to ask
yourself if you're gonna work with Expo
or react native only it's doom I'm gonna
need a good amount of nets Eve let's see
the library and some what I think I can
go with no item gonna just go with clay
magnet severe negative in yet
Oh Expo give you a good amount of good
acts access of library you can use and
it's react native you can just plug all
the net Civ library and Expo you cannot
if you want to do this you need to add
Jack Expo it's awesome I mean it's it
just goes here I want to maybe a blog
like Microsoft code portions anything
like that just check if yeah I think I'm
gonna go with
yeah this is what I'm gonna do tonight
I'm gonna play with the mobile side I
need to open my simulator
I'm gonna go with iPhone 7
yeah I'm gonna use graph QL a tour
tourists M yeah progressive we're up
shall have been a good ID I never really
build this thing something and check it
just right now I do so much more by then
I think I'm gonna just keep it there if
I want to finish my project yeah like
before the end of the year I want to
that what that's gonna be my own firms
like my not client stuff but my own real
app I'm gonna push to to the App Store
because all that I've build was for
client and I don't have a my name of on
one of my iPad bills Oh
yeah maybe
well this compilation is really slow
finally succeed
perfect I think I'm gonna run that on
oops I make a mistake heck yeah so just
forcing that work you it worked perfect
so now this thing is set up after that
what I'm gonna set up to its I think I
have my flu configure I have the flu
config so now I can just say so I'm
gonna set up flow and yes
oh okay I know what happened now I'm not
inside the right directory
yes
hey Cody how are you hey Julien
what is all done
mobile
really
like a CD mobile
yeah I know what I pan yeah I know what
happened okay I'm gonna move my mobile
find me a movie to mobile move
yep so move how can I do this I think I
need to
mmm
okay
should be good now so out there are this
I was just crazy because I have too much
fine now I think that looks like this
yeah because my get will have been
really big so this is the thing when you
get with many folder inside you route
like that so now I'm gonna go there
perfect get ass
oh
then I start to worse so when you use
flow you should check so the use 4901 I
for you know what 9 1 so I'm gonna add
flow bin so now because of this I'm I
can set up flow so I can say a flow type
in stone so that's gonna oh I create a
folder flow type where I'm gonna have
all my flow stuff so all the library
have used Oh Thank You Juliana I didn't
check it oh nice a curry perfect so now
I've set up this this is setup app GSS
setup perfect so we're gonna play with
some design I like more the the new
Xcode the simulator you can make it like
the size you want no yeah I cannot so
what I'm gonna do so oh I'm gonna design
that so I'm gonna open Apple device I'm
gonna open it iPhone 7 so I'll do I'm
gonna make
for sure the thing I wanna I'm gonna
want to other either ear what I'm gonna
have this one I'm gonna have a doors and
I'm gonna have right there the search
for sure after that what I want
it's a cord gonna take like this where
I'm gonna add my friend can see feel but
I'm gonna just feel with really less a
CD like that so I'm gonna have a card a
card now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
us another cards 15 it's a good size and
now my iPhone 7 I can push it down so
what I want it's after you look at to
car like I type it ear tricorn I want to
show a nervous and house cruel view but
from what I've seen now one card is too
big so I think it's better if I put it I
think like 250 would be great and I'm
gonna just remove this one to redo
command D 15 and another one 15 so this
one 15 and now right there I want to
create my resent old-school view yeah so
here I can type
Vico foundation
and I think I'm gonna maybe make use of
the lead of the new now I'm gonna use
material you design I'm gonna use like
maybe the new kind of UI design of Apple
they get I think inside my sketch yeah
yeah one sec iOS 11 sketch I think I can
get some design kit
yeah perfect this is what I want you're
gonna see inside a moment one six so if
you go to this website I'm gonna send
you yeah that's the thing sketch it's
only on a Mac but you can use like
Photoshop or something like that if you
want I'm so mcavee so sorry I'm gonna
show you what I'm gonna get so that
gonna just give me some basic component
so what I maybe one it's I won my car to
look slightly the new app store so if
you have the new iOS 11 it just looks
really awesome yeah for me I like it
it's like the material design for Apple
and they all use a vault Iike so yes so
this is the design they give me and as
you can see this is all they do their
cards so what do you think about that I
windows I think people it's I know I do
be XD I think I do be XD but as you can
see here what do you think about this
kind of card pretty like it I don't know
why one so this is the new design they
have bill but as you can see their card
yeah
yes so what I'm gonna do to Android
phone it's I'm gonna surely let yeah
that's a good I thing maybe good what
I'm gonna do with that yeah I'm taking
about that like you see like I just I'm
building in same time what I think it's
if I get to yeah well I mean I just want
to get the size of this thing and so the
size of this to 35 by 4 24 12 so finally
they don't take the full space so here
my car so what they say to 35 for 12 so
this is the size they give so this is
one of the car they have put yeah I
think I'm gonna go with that I'm gonna
go to gonna go there and what I'm gonna
do this for the Android part I'm gonna
just change this car to make it more
much more material and I think that's
gonna be like so it's easy an active
when you have a file so I don't know if
you know that guys but like when you use
like example I have my ad that GS air
we're gonna work we're gonna work for
both but you can say example card that
iOS that GS and that's gonna only only
gonna work on iOS and I can do the same
for any wheel so that's gonna just be
awesome if I can do this too so I'm
gonna just focus on the iOS part and
after that I'm gonna jump on the enjoy
some I just want to get some basic and
let the designer allow so I just try to
to get the most I can so the background
I just want to get their shadow so 0
sixteen so they have shadows zero 16 and
16 too much I think
0 16 16 and the color they have put 14
like that and now they have put a radius
of 14 radius okay I know I don't want to
put the shadow on my card I want to put
the shadow on this
so here it's gonna be shadow 16-0 16 16
and I put here 14 and they have a radius
or a 14
14 years
yeah I think that's going to be one car
so that's gonna be detail don't know
what I'm gonna call that like card
and I'm gonna just cream my other can of
corn right there for now I'm gonna just
take the same size they have so what I'm
gonna do because I'm too lazy why I
cannot take so this is a mask so I'm
gonna copy place that ear
so this thing right there it's their
other cars like you here I think I'm
done gonna have border yeah I think I
can be like in Phil
yeah now the only thing I want is this
text so they put it as a symbol so I'm
gonna juice no you don't put it as a
symbol what they put title three okay oh
so they they use SF prove yeah but I
think I can go with L veto yeah I don't
have a such providing San Francisco No
so SF true fund one sex so when you want
to I just type SS yeah I just want to
download the the fund so I don't know
the fun and now I can just open it click
on the package click continue it's done
so now I shall be able to have yeah
perfect so now I have the same fun I
mean I just want to build that really
quick so I just want to get some idea
about so it's 20 to 24
like that 34:24 too big oops
6:22 perfec
their color is black they use 41 from
the spacing and that's it
yes that's it laughter I can close this
one so they use almost the same and
after that I can manage my stuffing yeah
perfect
so what I'm gonna do
so this color is too much I'm gonna just
put some kind of you so I'm gonna have
another card my iPhone 7 okay so if I
put two card this is not really what I
want so I think I'm gonna put the
recommendation before the second car
yeah like that so what I'm gonna do
20 yeah 20 and 10 from the top this one
can go up one time like that go at the
middle of sting on that after that this
one can have 235 yeah after this one I'm
gonna just go ear a bit so now here I
can I don't even buy how I put ruler
show layout rule area then I just put a
line here thirty five and ten okay yeah
the thing it's maybe not this one so
this one I'll I'm at 20 so if I say ten
yeah perfect I'm gonna just add a second
one and the second one's gonna be right
there yeah so just I want to get that
just to get an idea about
yeah this thing and now this one after
that can manage it and put that yeah 25
yeah perfect
so this is what I'm gonna build right
now
just some square for now at least
getting that basic design but I think if
I do this I'm gonna put and I'm gonna
put my feet right there and my
recommendation yeah what do you think
about that
I think that's gonna be what I'm gonna
do here just for now I can maybe put
yeah what I'm gonna put it's gonna be my
nav bar I think 50 55 it's a good size
and what I'm gonna say it's maybe I
don't know like just a blank but what I
can do is I'm gonna just add an icon a
simple line icon and I'm gonna just say
search know which one am i unique on
search and I'm gonna use this one so I
on search where are you search I don't
see it I'm supposed to have somewhere an
icon search why are you
things just don't show
what there and did I lose where's the
icon mass copy I don't want to have a
mass copy and what in your underlying
mask
I mean why it's a mask oh oh ok mass
copy re card so now I can delete this
one in this one
oh my god that was because I copy and
pasting yeah and now I can add my ionic
on search
now I must be somewhere nope
but I know what I'm gonna do so not a
big deal perfect so I need to do this so
what I'm gonna do
perfect
and so I don't gonna plug the rudder and
everything yeah this is what I think
it's the icon but what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna just coat it so that's gonna be a
pretty okay so so what I'm gonna do it's
um so that's we're gonna need I'm gonna
use with the old-school react yar yeah I
don't get a you styl component for this
one so and I want when I'm gonna make
use of scroll view just because they are
much easy to install that's I'm gonna
see feed screen view text feed screen
and now I'm gonna go there just for now
bitch screaming perfect is there perfect
so for now the freed screen what I'm
gonna do it's I'm gonna create my style
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just say
my route and I'm gonna just put a margin
top of which size I put 55 and I'm gonna
just put that on this style and now I'm
gonna put a background color red oh yeah
perfect so now I have some margin from
the top lol oh are you like that yep
so after that I'm gonna take a flex one
yep perfect
so now this is what I have so now I need
to create one card so now I can remove
the real so here I can maybe say feed
and what I'm gonna do yeah so now I'm
gonna create one card so that's gonna be
a view I'm gonna just do this like that
for now and I'm gonna say card and I'm
gonna put my style right on this one
and I'm gonna say an ID off 3 3 3 4 12
and
okay so I'm gonna just build one card at
a time so I'm gonna just for now a line
item center because it's so you use a
flexbox and a line i ten-cent are gonna
Center that from the left to the right
but the thing it's gonna Center
everything and this is maybe not what I
want so far now just because I want to
design it really quick I'm gonna sing a
line itself so you're gonna align
himself in the center so I don't get a
touch of this feed
so this one is there so I'm gonna just
put the margin with my sketch asks so
what I've put it's 11 so I'm gonna say
10 because I really 8 so I'm gonna say
margin top of 10 so now I get this place
here after that I think that was border
radius equal to 14 so now I'm gonna run
my corner everything perfect now if I
want I want to design the shadow so I'm
gonna show you all you can check the
shadow so it's 0 16 16 so 0 16 16 so I'm
gonna just type it really quick 0 16 16
so here all we can manage that I'm gonna
say a light gray so I'm gonna say shadow
shadow color first thing I think that
was black yeah 0 0 0 so this is black so
this is what we want so shadow color
black after that we add an opacity
shadow opacity of 14 so this is the
number of right there so this is
rgba so this is the alpha
today I'm gonna see shadow offset we
take an object with a width I'm gonna
see zero from the width but the height
is gonna be no zero from the ID and two
for the wit I think and not to emerge
that was 16 so 16 so if I do this and i
refresh oh maybe no no that was not
16 for sure shadow opacity Oh 0.50 14
and it's too too dark when I miss shadow
color shadow opacity shadow radius it's
easy okay so how I'm gonna do so it's
not the width it's too much x and y oh
that word x and y oh yeah so that was
the first thing okay make more sense
I'll just take back this color phil was
DBD 8 and i put 45 up a CD yeah so this
is not that Apple because I need 20 to
16 to 16 to 1645 to 16 RGB a 2 to 16 to
16 to 1645 perfect yeah I think this is
yeah yeah sorry it's when we live
cutting sometime it just yeah I think
that's pretty good
yep
yeah yeah yep so I have one card so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create a
component folder and I'm gonna say I'm
gonna say on this folder I'm gonna
create a feed card that yes this one for
now is gonna be only like that put a
view and I'm gonna need a style sheet
and I'm gonna say export the fold
function feed car we're gonna take that
thing and gonna return a single view for
now nothing crazy and I'm gonna just
take everything I have here but now I'm
going to call that route
like this
and then we're gonna check so if I put
two of them yeah so what I'm gonna do
it's for now just for now I'm gonna put
a scroll view right there what I'm gonna
put my card and I'm gonna put like three
of them and
yes so that's maybe okay what I'm gonna
do
so we're I think that's going to need to
be a section list because if I want to
have this kind of section so because if
I look at this I'm gonna have a list
view and here you have another view list
Google and say that oh because I use I
use a function like that because this is
what our B&amp;amp;B has to do so like if you
watch our B&amp;amp;B this thing if you go to
this file you're gonna get like all the
setup of our B&amp;amp;B and I just follow their
pattern
a rust
yeah it's I think they send their ducks
it's just better for but I mean I for me
I just think it looked just better doing
this you just mind myself I mean it just
but I I'm sure that you function don't
have any problem with that no I do
really don't
so we act netsy scrollview always until
hey yeah I'm just I'm just playing with
some code I'm just building a little
project for myself
Oh
I mean Amelia what that mean
oh no problem oh-oh-oh-oh
this thing here yeah so what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna just close though I'm
gonna just so have my feet card is done
I'm gonna just design my this one
whew it's really easy so it's a tree
tree okay so just to so I'm gonna say
feed small card @gs I'm gonna get all
this thing
you
so the IDS 215 I'm gonna just get this
color for now
no align self by the radius of five and
they have no shadow
oh my god
I think that's going to be their good
size yeah
because this one is so like this one is
gonna be easy because I can just put
why Visual Studio is slow
what
I'm gonna just change the odd word
because iphone7 go really really bad
with my keyboard
so I think that's going to be just too
much complete for now then what I think
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just put this
tooth in here remove that put these two
thing with that put that ear
yeah like that it's gonna be easier for
me and it's gonna be much fun
okay so I think I'm gonna keep it the
style and that's gonna be is just some
math we have a 215 from the Ides on my
scroll view it's gonna have I
we don't need padding we're gonna just
say 250 215 gonna be 235 because I want
10 from the top and the bottom
yeah once okay so I'm gonna say 300 yeah
maybe
280 okay also I want to have a margin of
top of 10 because I want to be 10 at the
bottom of this one recommendation and
what I'm gonna say it's recommendation
I'm gonna say text I'm gonna say
subtitle I'm going to say what was the
size 22
I think I make a typo we call mound
ation yeah I take to em
and I'm going to see subtitle other
margin left of 10
yeah but that don't resolve yeah this is
too right
much better
so I'm not alone we want to have there
so finally if I want to do this
it's not true 50
oh I know
lol Oh a baby
oh I think we have what we want a right
there never use this section lists but I
think that can be what we need so if I
see section Li as they have list other
component matter the very beginning of
the list perfect so now right there I
can say what
I'm going to you let them yeah I can
I just want to get like get item layout
okay
I know this is my supper
oh my god I hate that I was like more
when I can show here their model
and just one my shows
but that don't help me this is not what
I want yeah maybe
don't know how I'm gonna do this
so for the data what I'm gonna do
on the phone is not
yeah
oh that leaves you I want that leaves
oh my god oh my god sorry
I get the index as the second element
yeah so I'm gonna have the item in the
index items gonna be an object and mine
there's gonna be a number and now what
I'm gonna do
it's if my index equal the first one
this is what I teamed I want to return
this thing and else I'm gonna return my
feet card like that
so it's almost working but it's not
working so it's time to debug
object I index off on the fine
oh so this is only info so what I got
here should be oh like that
so now I think what I can do
it's my feed car 20 is going to be
better writing
when the issue
three good so now have the feet after my
recommendation and now because I'm here
I think my recommendation don't gonna be
a scrollview but it's gonna be ListView
who can be a reason tell ya because the
scroll view it's really bad in
performance of where I can do I'm gonna
surrender
are we on tail lol oh are you
and this one for now it's going to just
return let's feel small cord like that
just for now and so I'm gonna say ears
gonna be like that are you our Irish and
so if I don't burn as you you name right
boom
okay enough yeah so now what I'm gonna
do is I'm going to just set up react
navigation
and I'm gonna do and send my source
Oh
yeah just for knowledge it's so what I'm
gonna say it's think I can do this
nananana
just put some real data just to help me
with the design porn
I'm just do three today I'm stopping
there so I'm gonna just copy this thing
and much that one time so now I'm gonna
just remove that funnel and now what I'm
gonna do it's this one can we see vitam
and i'm gonna say that that item yeah
what I'm gonna sit I'm gonna go to my
feet small corn because why not that
don't do nothing but now I have only
tree I tell but now what I want is I
want the car to take the full background
so what I can say is I need the image
and I'm gonna tie my props so the props
I'm gonna receive and what I'm gonna say
it I'm gonna have an image URLs gonna be
a type of string I'm gonna have an ID is
gonna be a type of number and I'm gonna
have title who's gonna be equal to a
string after that I'm gonna see right
there I'm gonna have that as a props and
I'm going to see image URL this is what
I need for now
so now I'm gonna just put my image say
I'm gonna have as a source the Uwharrie
equal to image URL and I'm not raped
gonna work no but what I'm gonna say
it's my image and have aspects of one
whit of nil and the eye of new I t's not
so it's HT so now I have the image it
looks really bad
I'm gonna say resize mode I'm gonna say
resize mod contain cover center if I see
cover I think this is already covered
before yeah and if I see contain oh
yeah this is not what I want so you just
really bad as the image
but at least for now it's maybe not what
I like the most but
I'm going to set a title right there so
I need that to have a position of
relative because I want to have my
position absolute from my title so I'm
gonna put text whose going to be equal
to that title need to input text let's
see title when I came from here color of
28 too much so I'm gonna say font size
of 22 fun family bold on the way
a sh t Wonder Woman right there
background-color:transparent okay I know
why it's because I need to put
position:absolute and after I'm gonna
say top of 10 and left of 10 what I've
been that's what
after that yeah but it's not a good idea
to wrap this there yeah yeah I think
this is what I'm gonna do so I'm gonna
Queen another view this one's gonna wrap
my text and this one's gonna add the
position:absolute why I want to do this
it's because I want to add this some
padding because I don't want my text to
go further so I'm gonna take my
position:absolute gonna save top:0
left:0 right:0 and bottom zero so like
that I'm sure you're gonna take
everything like that
now I'm gonna sit padding 110 padding
from everywhere so now you see you take
the place but now I have some padding
ear and ear and now what I can say it's
inside my text I can now add number of
line and no more than one so if you go
too much further you're gonna add the
tree dot for myself
so now what I want to is I'm gonna have
my category reason my categories should
be an arrow and this one's going to be
action and adventure
okay so what I'm gonna do it's there I'm
going to Queen another view who's gonna
be my rapper from my categories ever
wait now here I can catch an eye and now
in this thing I can have text where I'm
gonna save my cut but I'm gonna put my
key equal to the eye like this now if I
do this I get that like this but I beat
by default it's like as a :
so now what I can do it just change my
view ears say style that style that
categories rapper take this one go there
and now say Flex
Direction row if I say that now you're
gonna take left and right so that this
one way I can say margin top of five
because I want him to take a bit at the
bottom here after that I don't want back
background color
colors FFT but they change the opacity I
think 7g
and I'm gonna put red not red but maybe
like pink just see what happened oh yeah
because it's my a line item I wanted to
get the center of it but now what I want
to my justify contain is gonna be space
maybe not space what I want
I'm gonna do some inline style for that
it's I'm gonna say so what I want I want
the adventure to go a bit a bit right to
this thing so what I'm gonna do
so we're gonna put that here with a
square bracket make an arrow and I'm
gonna say margin-left
and i'm gonna see if i its bigger than 0
I'm gonna say so the I it's gonna be the
index action is the fridge and X I don't
want him to take someplace from the left
so I'm gonna say that the one I'm gonna
maybe put 5 and the other one's gonna be
0 so now if I yeah you see now I get
some space
I think I need to put the image my
border-radius because he don't looks
like he have it and my rapper yep
70s Thule I think it's better
recommendation see
yeah I think this thing what I can maybe
add it's like a bit like what you took
do like a watch later so I need to set
up the ecto icon so lecto I can do some
people are still there can you hear me
and all the talk on you need to install
that like that yarn ad and you finish
that just by running react native link
and now they ask you to rerun your
project just to plug everything so now
I'm gonna have access to I think it's
like 3000 icon and they are all here and
now I can say watch watch later which
icon I can put what shadow this one
you'll fail nice
why do you think yeah
always your days
I mean inside my police phone provider
they are all connect so this is what
I've pulled so this should be good
hello how are you
perfect thank you to let me know welcome
to my little stream
what
traffic oh yeah let's go and crash
they are all there that should be good
you'll succeed
whoa yeah too strong
watch later clock yeah I think I'm gonna
go with this thing a bit like what
YouTube do so if you go to youtube I
think they have change
maybe not watch later Rogers
yeah I think you
yeah you just see looks like stone yeah
kind of I can do like that just put a
little icon here little button right
there so I can click and just say watch
later yeah are you an icon
also I'm gonna install my app and float
touchable library to make use of the
button
my route is on a relative button leader
if I say I of fifty and width of 50
should be able to see where I am
where is my button
oh yeah fivesome z-index yeah thank you
right there yeah the thing is that it's
Parliament it's a bit too behavior so I
think I'm gonna put it at the bottom
so this is like that and I don't know
like watch later and I'm gonna say true
for this one false for this one and true
for this one
yeah I think I can like it but I don't
gonna go with the this color but this
one yeah I just think I'm gonna maybe
just remove my role
I think it scroll something
I want to remove the disco thing
if I go inside scroll view show scroll
indicator I'm sure this is the thing and
I'm gonna say false what
and eat caterer
roost I cannot remove it so I don't
gonna lose time on it for tonight I can
just maybe create an extension on my I
think I'm gonna go with that for the top
and for the sheet
okay so I'm gonna just do this card here
so I'm gonna do this so I want ear
yeah give me some ID maybe like I can
put that other user here put the title
of the movie here
yeah justice below after that I can
maybe have like choose a star ear with
maybe like five just for the rating at
the bottom
and you finally at the top I'm gonna
just put here like button if you want to
like this no you're gonna see what
this before I finish I'm going to just
add touchable heat slope
perfect
thank you
you
oh sure I just see something oh boy
maybe like I'm gonna need to other view
here and I need to have that
border-radius
slide the shadow never go with the image
- I think it may be like it more without
you know rapper because this rapper what
we gonna do it's gonna again do like the
other one just get inside to get some
padding so I want a padding of I can ten
I think is gonna be good and what I
wanna hear
it's another view but this one's gonna
be another tour
so just for now I'm gonna say avatar and
maybe not a data with as big billion oh
yeah
just one add a torque who's gonna be our
circle of 5050 and border radius of 25
and for now is gonna add a background
color of white but this thing this thing
I have the position:relative and this
thing's gonna have position:absolute
maybe no no don't need to do this so if
I do this no my repair gonna need
position:absolute
so I'm gonna just take my image for my
from like Twitter just put a real a
bottle here and see all that blue so
what I'm gonna do it's inside these
things I'm gonna just see your cans fake
URL equal this I'm gonna just put an
image between that and this one gonna
have a source equal to fake URL like
that
so because I don't want to copy myself
I'm gonna do this like that I'm gonna do
this and I'm gonna like this so now I
can we use the style' image for the
second one but this one then have a
border radius equal to 25
don't know if I like it I like the top
side but this side I'm gonna try I'm
gonna just put the title first so inside
my rapper I should have I have my
another view with this one's going to be
the top rapper and this one just for now
after that I'm gonna have
contain rapper and this one for now I
can maybe just put the text with that
title inside too
and this one gonna have to a flex of one
but what happening oh because I need to
do you think this one
don't take the fool yeah yeah yeah I can
say Eiling self stretch no I'm going to
just set up zero button zero let zero
and write zero
you
so I'm gonna just remove some padding
I'm gonna just add more padding so I'm
going to studying vertical it's gonna be
20 so drop and button re is on tail I'm
gonna be 10 yeah a bit better I think so
Wonder Woman yeah I want to just put the
action
oh and I keep it like that for now
you
can we do this
one after two that become
so if index equal to
no no no I'm gonna do this and I start
to have too much inside this design now
on that thing I'm gonna just set up the
swiping do this like that
I'm gonna just remove the movie keep it
like before what I'm gonna do it
sighting so what I wanted to sit action
like example you have to reaction you
can say watch later so I show your
friend and say what you know I want to
watch like a spider-man like later you
can say I've adequate sake so like a
review of it and say we take art finish
to listen it and the third one should be
currently watching yeah this is what I'm
gonna do currently watching
Oh a decade' are you a away River are
you
oh no problem yeah you have a lot of
project
oh yeah yeah that's why sometimes Apollo
it's it's nice to have when you have a
lot of data we ducks you start to have
so much reducer and just crazy so I need
to put my top rapper as a flex Direction
row and I'm gonna say a line item
centaur oh
so I'm gonna just remove tree and maybe
two
now oh okay just for now currently
watching I'm gonna say more Jing laughs
Daniel
I cannot go with I need to have my full
white ear because if not I'm done gonna
see nothing and maybe like 20 is gonna
be okay
I can just put me in the name of the
term or nice the delighted the fact the
new queen multiple we do sir
oh nice yeah it's but I'm sure they're
gonna they're gonna learn to love you I
know some people like to have just one
we do so but I mean it's like you don't
module this thing so I think what I'm
gonna add it's a side menu
if I remember it was pretty good this
thing
yeah the thing is no I can I think I'm
gonna just go with the top bar yeah it's
gonna be better for my case I think or
maybe
shriek or two too much
and that works
Oh
what do you think do I go with the
sidebar or I go with the regular tab tab
bar for the navigation
you think I should go with both our cuz
it looks like I'm not sure about I'm
gonna check if I
yeah
not sure about this one
I think I'm gonna just set up that and I
think I'm gonna stop after there I need
to go to the gym
it's topped our icon
don't know for now I'm gonna go there
and for an inactive I'm gonna say I
don't know have no color in mind right
now
a car
oh oh this is what I want
oh yeah I really think I'm gonna go with
that but it's gonna get the middle ear
that's gonna be your profile with some
of the stuff so here I should have a
setting I think our us sitting a unicorn
really
like this
but only thing I want to do before I
finish its core button I want him to
have like a background color for now
we're gonna just go with I don't know
like a yellow just for now and I want to
just put this thing inside of you
okay
that's gonna go with the color ever if I
see
this is not quite like what I want
if we start now yeah but now maybe just
I want so that means this one I want him
to have like 40 for this to be 35 can be
good but I'm gonna need to change to
like 60 and this one's gonna be 30 whoa
whoa whoa whoa what did add it wrong too
much here 60 60 30
Oh
oh my god
so we have out of 50 so I need to add a
margin bottom of 25 but I don't want
that to be this I want that too looks
like this it's too big yeah I mean
I think I'm gonna maybe put that as a
tree yeah now I think I need to have
three from the bottom but the ID of this
one's to be yeah because when someone
gonna click here you're gonna go to the
swiping right and left cards so you can
choose like between searching for a TV
show or movie so this is for helping you
searching a movie like right now and now
you're gonna see the thing about like
your profile and stuff and you click
them and yeah you're sitting here is
gonna be your feed and the sitting is
gonna be pretty simple page

like a to two hour ago so it's not crazy
but at least yeah so thank you for
watching I'm gonna stop here I'm gonna
push together up so I don't know if some
of you wonder the repo and a push to get
