the first one so for the one who didn't
really follow everything I did in the
last one you can just came to the repo
here and go to a branch zero zero here
and we're going to get the basic setup
of everything we did in the last one so
the ESPN battery C and the basic Express
set up waiting more like I told you I'm
going to put everything in it done so
time to drop on the coal right so now
here we are we have so this is where we
we quit the last time so now time to put
the graphical setup
criteria set up so what we going to do
it's the first thing we need to create
like a schema and like the Korean
everything to make it work and blood
Allah so we have a lot of stuff to do so
all I'm going to work right now if we're
going to create a folder models so we
can acquit finally the first collection
to make it work with MongoDB going to be
simple don't worry about that
here we're going to import mangoes and
also the schema from Mongoose after that
year we're going to create the tweet
keema we're going to be a new schema and
this one I think crazy we just going to
send text so the text going to be the
tweet himself so it's going to be a
string type string after that we're
going to export the useful am mongoose
model where we're going to call that
tweet with uppercase and i say get that
with the tweet schema so we set up the
basic collection for the MongoDB here
after that we get a jump on the source
hold area and I'm going to create
another folder called graph QL why I
call a solar is a call graph tool that's
a good question here what I do it
everything about their shell gonna be in
this one and if I create a recipe I I'm
gonna have a fuller career so yes you
can have manage many kind of if you have
four you eighty I mean it's
my graph QL is everything where I can do
my stuff and I can maybe ask some rail
for the rail because I call to a340 API
like I don't know like IMDB am PBA stuff
like that so here what I'm going to do
is I'm going to train in time a gift you
will follow I'm going to create a schema
the gs5 so if this is your main line
like this is your most important file
for your Blacula so here I'm going to
export this all back tip it really
important and ear this is why I'm going
to create the schema model for my QE so
we have to well it's a query language so
it's a language who worked in the like
in between the client and the server and
this one is really small but you don't
know everything by default you need to
teach in what is you up because like I
mean Facebook use it but Facebook is
like least Facebook so if I use it like
you cannot understand all I'm I'm
working with my app so if you add it's
different so here what I'm going to say
it's finally I'm going to create my
first schema why are we going to go over
finally the tweet so a I'm going to type
tweet this is an object ear and now on
the store ID string out why on the
square
MongoDB on the score ID always remember
that text string okay what is this text
word this is coming very simple text and
it came from here so what we finally see
is we're going to say - yeah we have to
well I'm going to get tweet you're going
to have something to thing you can
search for me going to be the text and
gonna be the ID of this tweet that's
really important where the same name
because if you'd only go down into
manager way to tall grass ql like
example under square I equal ID for you
so after that here you need to create a
room for you so I'm going to call that
curry and I'm going to say so that's
going to be my my busy three and finally
you finish that with the schema where
everything going to be set up and I'm
going to
right now what is actually thing about
tree like everything in rest ways get
everything when you get something you
carry something you get so here I'm
going to call my first query for this
awesome app get tweets with the s why
because I'm going to give receive an
array of tweet so not just one tweet I'm
going to get every tweet so now we
talked pagination we're gonna get a v2
so now here I can say tweak so I'm going
to say I can receive a tweet right there
but the thing is if I do this I just
going to receive one tweet if I want to
receive an area of tweet it's pretty
easy you just put square bracket around
it from now the after I know you're
going to add a list of tweet that's it
we just build the first Kure right there
but that cannot work without a resolver
because like I told you right now you
don't even understand we have a MongoDB
database so how we do this is by going
rescue well fuller I'm going to create
another folder called resolve verbs why
I put s we can have many of them so here
I'm going to put an index at yet and I'm
going to put another file to call tweet
Wiesel ver because I'm going to get
again many resolver
so now here is going to be again pretty
simple like I told you it just basic
stuff for the beginning so we're we're
going to import the tweet schema coming
from the model folder right there and
then I'm going to export default an
object where I'm going to add my gift
wheat so get the Xtend collection what I
do is I always put the same name you
tweet in here a result VAR it's a
function will return your data and now
here I say find everything so in MongoDB
this is the way you can find everything
so I see give me everything coming in
from the connection tweet so that's it
but that all we're going to make it work
it's now going to go inside the index
that GAF resolve are here where
going to import at the top my tweet
resolved our object we go over from
tweet resolver right there and now a I'm
going to exploit default and now look
what I'm going to do Curie and I'm going
to get tweet and now here I'm going to
tweet resolve our da get twee is also
called autocomplete awesome yeah so now
here I'm a Curie get three so now that's
going to match this career by doing one
little thing that's going to be inside
the index that GS where we're going to
create a grass ql server we're going to
make right now because right now we do
we just talk with different do nothing
so time to make a change so in we get
any to install some package I'm going to
make use of the Apollo we ask you well
server so we're going to do everyone
yarn add Apollo Apollo server express
because I'm using Express if you use
that T that's going to be a police over
a peak use lambda function from AWS you
can use Apple over lambda after that I'm
gonna make it I'm gonna install another
tool called graphical tools we're going
to make gonna give you a way to use what
we just build with the SQL I'm gonna
install that I'll make a typo so I see
grass yeah SQL tool sorry about that oh
okay so now here what we need to do now
we're going to jump on the index that
just here at the top here I'm going to
import from Apollo server express why I
always put my from here before I go back
to the curly bracket look at what my
just will do autocomplete right there
graphical Express and I need also graph
QL Express I'm going to tell you what
both do in a moment don't worry about
this yeah I'm going to import again from
yeah
- well - we're going to import may
execute all schema okay so here what I'm
going to do is here I'm going to create
my schema so what I'm going to do is
here I'm going to take current came up
equal make a big dose chemo will take an
object and right there we know what we
need is type def and air after that
we're going to need the result words so
type def and resolver we have some
connector logger blah blah we have a lot
of stuff here so here I'm going to call
something type def the thing is this
side there from where I'm going to get
that that may be your question so that's
going to be what we just build with the
schema we're going to say type there so
this is the beauty of calling something
expo defo you can give it the name you
want I'm going to set from graph QL
chemo that yeah so not my type def is
that after that here I need the result
verse 2 so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take the resolver app I'm going
to import a result work from graph QL
and I'm going to resolver and because
I'm using an index the GS enter my
resolver
I don't care about putting in there is a
GS JavaScript it small enough to
understand this part perfect now we have
the schema so we are good to go after
that here we you see I use the same
variable I put inside my constant here
so now it's time to delete this one now
we're going to get some error from es m
so pretty easy to do now we're going to
import content object from config that
content and now I'm going to just pass
constants in front of each one perfect
but now ok yes SQL ok we import a stop
but that thing is set up so far set up
graph QL with with Express gonna be
pretty easy it's going to be like a
middle wire so here I'm going to add
that use and I'm going to say here graph
graphical so that's going to be this ref
scale right there what I'm going to do
is I'm going to take
graphical Express so we have to call
Express right there there's going to be
an object here
and this object take one thing here it's
going to be the endpoint URL and right
there
what I'm going to do is because I want
that's going to be again another
variable I'm going to create right there
in my configuration constant now I'm
going to call that graph QL Pat and I'm
going to say slash we have Q so by
convention everyone put always put just
slash we ask you well for the input
so I'm going to say graphical constraint
graph that's it so now it will just set
up graphical graphical is the idea the
awesome idea and I'm going to show you
right with that at the end of the this
part so just follow me here hey I'm
going to add that use and now that's
going to be something more if you need
to tone my URL for that so here I'm
going to say content that we ask you
well password is going to be setting a
few L and now here I'm going to use the
SQL expir be sure this one is graphical
and this one's gonna be gradual because
this one is the IDE so the tool for talk
with reactive and this one is the the
real middleware so can be a function we
take an object here and this one don't
need to you take it the schema for now
sorry about this what's spinning right
now yeah so this is key mod like that
perfect but now we do that use but now
it's not again a graph your server so
all we can make that is by using a
module already built in on nodejs oh
that's why mine yes and don't get an
error and this is create server so all
we do this it's going to be pretty easy
I'm going to take current grass QL we
have QL server and I'm going to call
this with the create server and I'm
going to make use of my app but now look
at anything we need to do now is we're
going to replacing up here that listen
with SQL so if I take this one and I go
there and I save now we are on gradual
so now maybe you don't really see these
things on now if I say
oh yeah now I get an error look at that
I want you to understand I'll read an
error can define module B SQL going to
be pretty easy to resolve yarn at
virtual I forget to install this package
here
perfect now if I run the dead now again
most provide tight death must provide
type def right there so here I see what
I've done wrong it's here look at this
really bad thing edges this so here I
put an area but that's an object so
pretty simple to just case we go over
and we make it as object and now MongoDB
running epicenter poetry tosser so now
if you go to Google Chrome and you open
local oh sweet thousand graphical if
everything is work you get that and now
if I run my Curie I so this is the docs
Oh to generate by graphic close so here
you can see we have the three we have
the twist and now you're at the Adina
text and everything it's coming because
of the of the schema right there
you read your tweet and blood Allah
right there so now how we can make a
curie by doing get to eat like that and
here you see what do you need here I'm
gonna sell on the IV and the text now if
I run that I get nothing
why because I've nothing in my DV that's
pretty simple so here all we can take
that gonna be really simple so here
we're gonna make use so here you see one
go to each fine why I get that is
because of my DB idea here I get be able
to to so now I'm going to create some
mocks because now you sing attaining you
cannot speak what I mean by this is
awesome so inside my mod folder I'm
going to call an index the GS and this
is the place where I'm going to set up
some mocks data so marks I mean some
fake data to make it easy for us to work
then it'd be like 20 line of code so go
if we go there we're going to install a
new package called figure so figure it's
a PI K
to get like a fake name fake whatever
like fake a username take emailed
illallah
so here important writer from feature
here I'm gonna import my tweet because
we want to create a tweet from my model
tweet after that I'm going to create a
variable called tweet total I'm going to
say I want 10 tweet for now and I'm
going to create a functional we're going
to be an amazing one like that where by
default every time I'm going to with a
try-catch oh yeah because food bread
something so here if I whenever I'm
going to show it here by default what I
want to do is I'm going to always remove
every Twitter so when I respond my app
I'm going to remove every tweet so every
time i refresh I'm going to remove every
tweet going to be going to be good for
just product production that prediction
that like for help us with the project
productivity SP so here I'm going to
call I'm going to do another is sing
stuff so using a weight if you don't
understand this part like promises new
kind of premises you can find many great
story about eating a work on the web if
you get stuck there maybe I can make one
if you get really stood here so yeah I'm
going to every from so I refer me to
wait to make an hour an array and I'm
going to say I want it to be and every
finally of ten so that's why I'm using
length so I'm going to take this because
it's an area I'm going to use it for
each and I'm going to make use of the
callback air the callback can be
anything one wire here I'm going to just
click await tweak that create so this is
all we create finally start on MongoDB
and air inside the text I'm going to fix
a tower that lower Ram the paragraph I'm
going to put one for now like this and
yeah like that so yeah so if that do
this is because of yes um so I'm going
to just keep it like that so there's
going to be one line
I do dislike that I'm going to be better
so here we finally create an area of ten
knots nothing inside averages an area of
ten of them and we loop over each item
and we create a new tweet that's it
you know now what we can do is by going
inside the index folder and index file
inside the project yeah I'm going to
import the mocks from my mocks folder
because it's an index guess I don't need
to import the file and now here what I'm
going to do is I'm going to run my graph
QL server after my mock is done so if I
do marks with function y have access to
at them because the promise is now I'm
going to take all this thing and I'm
going to put it right there inside like
that so now look what good Apple
Oh what is all that so you see we create
so if we come if it come here it we
create finally ten stuff to the DB if
you don't trust me on this place I'm
going to open rebel Mongo with a tool to
see you DB and see if I open a tweet
here collection tweet oh ten tweet with
the text right there so this is a text
we just read with a mod but now what
I'll let us to do if you refresh your
SQL graphical idea here it's now if I
get this cow boom we get the delica
meaning from MongoDB here like you see Y
graph there it's awesome I can say I
want the idea in text this is what I got
if I say I don't want to get the text I
run it ID on me every run again I'm
going to get my text to someone I can
decide to remove the ID and I get only
the text you see it's pretty awesome if
you want to know how I get the same
without clicking by doing command K a
command enter in the Mac so that was
this one so if you get to this point
where the graphical work awesome job
this is really great this is what we
on and now here the only thing you can
do before if you push it to get out or
something like that your yarn prettier
and now everything going to be pretty
nothing to do more and you're going to
pretty everything we did to make it
looks much better and make you code more
countries on everything so I hope you
enjoy don't forget I put the link on the
description about the repo and I hope
you enjoyed that please like it if you
liked it and also come in if you think I
can change some stuff on the tutorial
because this tutorial is for you not for
me
so hope you have a good night and
without mirror bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
