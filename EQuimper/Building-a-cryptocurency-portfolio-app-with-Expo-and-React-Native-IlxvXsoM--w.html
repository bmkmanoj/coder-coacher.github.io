can do it
the thing about this thing it's yeah
yeah get this thing gonna return a
boolean and oh I can manage it I cannot
really do I get but I can do I get
effective like that not really because
because I want to see if this one at the
same title I don't want to take the ref

that's the same of time select finally
here I can maybe see these things gonna
be an array of not really yeah maybe a
string and now here I can do a my if
statement take this thing and we turn
this thing but now what I can see here
it's if title let active that is active
it's going to be a boolean by default is
going to be false if I talk equal the
days that flow up that time select I'm
gonna see is active it's true and now
what I can see right there and it's time
button and see is active and say is
active by doing like this way and now
here you always need to put the key and

like them and now if I do this queue
after that Oh what I can manage its when
I need to manage it's gonna be my top
here another function called select time
who you're gonna receive a time who's
gonna be a type of string and this thing
your final just gonna do this that
substrate time select is going to be
equal to time so I can just say time
select here this one
well nothing I'm gonna get an error
because you're gonna say can I be a sign
of a video and define oh I'm nothing the
good place so yeah I'll be there it's
gonna be on index coin detail Cohen
detail that's right there now I don't
get I get a value say it synced in

like that and now here what I need to do
its pass it down to my top six select
time equal this that select time after
that what that mean it's my quaint up
ears you're going to receive as a props
the select time was going to be a
function yeah but it's gonna be a
function we're gonna take a time select
who's gonna be cool a time select and
gonna return the time select this way so
now what I can do with this select time
here who's going to be called ear on
this thing here
I'm gonna say here select time quote

I'm gonna pass the props that title and
now I can have this phone select press
and it was gonna be a function I pass it
there and now your essay on press this
unselect press now if I do this
okay now have some bug it's gonna be
because of my ear my touchable opacity
right there what I think it's I'm not
kind of I'm not sure but if I pass this
tile here with the same style of the
other one at the bottom okay now it's
better now I'm thinking do I really need
to have this do I really need to this
view and I don't think so Haven or you

every time I click I don't want to be
able to click so here what I'm gonna say
it's disabled it's gonna be disabled if
it is active finally and now if I click
here this I cannot take anymore so now

and now here I can save value going to
be called value dot these that studied
that time select you mean uh on the web
know what is that what get fake so I
need to pass a number so that western
I'm gonna say equal 10
oh boy I don't like this
if you mean in the webapp yeah can they
be checked long time I didn't touch the
well man I really don't like this
animation you
component will update
I think what I can do its component will
receive props will receive props and
they let's say if if next props dot
value it's not equal two days that prop
that values now I'm gonna call this
animation my men or or you oh man I
don't like this what you do when I get
all right I do right there
why did that mission on the other one
that pie chart I think I did well
because I put it in my name shape that's
why that's why that's that's the thing
I've created so here I should put the
same I think admission duration I'm
gonna see 200 for now oh yeah but I knew
okay so first thing the first work
component without the layer animation
cream
do I really need this on the other
oh thank you yeah yeah I can check for
building like if you're an idea about
which kind of project I can check of it
I mean right now what I want to do it's
not like I've done with the other one
why I did a video when I have time when
I'm gonna do it I'm gonna just take like
two full day and we call record all of
them and push it all of them in the same
time on YouTube so nobody gonna wait but
if you have an idea about a certain kind
of project I can check of it would be
great for me to play a bit with CSS good
it's too too much yeah why didn't you
I'd say if my previous me yeah this is
component comes in that state and I call
you
well that's what I've done it's my put
my more
you go there and I see
so I'm gonna just take that for now
that's from but but from was the
previous graph so pret from one yeah
that's the thing is I try to do this
without the d3 I mean I have it there I
can just retake this I mean oh hey Laura
I figure out the while I'm cutting I'm
really not a designer so that's why I
must have someplace I know it's good but
some play or like you I'm trying to do
something oh yeah even I will take this
as grid for me all the layout and I will
use flexbox for all the other CSS our
perfect ten
thanks ends yeah I can maybe checked you
to just make a video about CSS grill
I've used it on one of the project we
build last weekend and kind of love it I
mean with CSS grill now I just think
bootstrap it's it's going to be maybe
you just forgetting the element with
some CSS
so far I can keep to add my I can do
this the only thing I need so I mean I
don't need this thing if I check out via
I can just reuse the one I've used cuz
you're this shape don't go what good
what I need
I call that on which kind of function
just this one because I mean maybe the
stroke white I'm just coming out I'm
gonna coming out this thing coming out
this thing now what I can do here
its value item don't look at this one
now I need to have my III I cap denier
things gonna be better I go this way
this year this year this year this thing
oops
really
this this way the tree I'm gonna put
that right there and even shape I can
just stick it there this thing go here I
don't need them more because my and in
shape gonna have a mining ship gonna
came from any machine right there and
now what I can do it's almost like what
I've done here it's just the value and
the time about the time I don't you
really need to come on down here I'm
gonna just say did we shave area D
de-index okay and that's gonna came from
this that values yeah
and now here what I can do I don't think
I need that
yeah maybe the only out surface group
was good it just the enemy ship after
that I can put the stroke white with
your stroke stroke width
and now this critter oh thank you thank
you
oh yeah it's why why I do this kind of
video it's when I have our start
programming and I was always searching
for a tutorial because I'm more video
person and it just I think we have a lot
of tutorial in Java and Grube and stuff
like that but in everything about no GS
it's missing I think
jason'll or cannot find cover
okey so this is the thing here what
happened it's here I should just do D
writing and I crash my app and you're
not working anymore this is that probe
that color I'm gonna just if you color
for now
okay I like more this animation but the
item the the width here is going to be
equal to the we'll know what I've done
here with it was five five okay
stroke colors who quit
I don't need this value I think oh I
know it's because if I put that here
it's because in my an insight sorry I
need to put that in my ear this Apella
color but stroke width should be drops
true we can maybe there it's gonna be a
number and this true quit stroke width
is gonna be cool this that product an
expected value at 11 to mr. kuhmo
oh my girl what is that
way tonight
so I say I'd of zero but here change the
eye
we
we're singing about this line rapper
okay
why do this one
I'm good width this is what I don't
understand you get the width from it the
weight from the stage like I've done on
the other one but I think it's maybe
their own value on the other would
change everything but I don't think can
be the problem
yeah because if I don't do this I'm
gonna need to say like 300 and 300 yeah
so you don't gonna really change nothing
because my only out get the net severan
right there
what I've done here at this trove I
don't need to move to because I mean did
we do this thing for me did we show
curve that's real so that's why I get
the curve here this is a prop that value
Groot
I think it's time to D boy oops
so we see one problem was this one
okay but now I should check for any
shape and in shape
so my values how this thing it's gonna
be an array with number if I see a
thousand what that's gonna look like
okay now what I think it's the value are
all the same I'm going to open this and
I'm gonna search for my detailed coin
with this one top detail this one's get
which one have value okay value an area
of 60 to 75 but the value is okay
if it's not if i signal 450
what is this line
I think I'm gonna go with the version
without the animation for now because
when I'm losing time here
since 4:23
sixty-four
and 100 now it's too much yeah that's
the thing now 20
overriding previous level animation with
new one before the first begin I need to
check this thing too
I'm not even trouble to do here I mean
this error what is the same I never get
that that's cause of this thing I showed
you at the bar I'll make it too slow so
that's why
and also what it looks like
yeah my thing next time too
so here what I can do for the top your
honor what I need as a I need to have
the I don't have the name out here I
need to maybe see them kind of the
market stuff maybe don't put that there
like can maybe you just put another top
here with some value
so what I have right now it's
this yes so that you have this with no
fuel
really
like that so now era if I take all this
I'm gonna space to build these things
I'm gonna just put like this this blue
for now so if I take all this ammo
I can manage I can maybe say what I
would think it's having eared like the
logo having here the logo and having ear
and ear
can maybe put that in here Bitcoin to
move this thing say Bitcoin right there
with this one now having this one
something like that well what I can say
here can be here that can be which value
would you value make another API call to
www that HTTP API slash Quinn Marquette
market cap tap count slash tech hours in
a worse take care then oh I did this API
call
API the coin market cap
okay I have it here something like that
this is what I have market cap
I think market cap can be really
something we want to know when we see
the details and also the price so here I
will say price also here I can say
market cap market cap after that what I
have access available supplier I don't
really care about this thing but the
person chain in one hour I don't take my
soul
yeah but I and if I do an appeal I go to
this one would just make no sense out
big decision I mean crypto comp our API
if you are request data Queen this
parameter always return this thing but
the thing is can I get only one
really fast okay really fast here so me
and epi crypto compare what is that mean
I work with all symbol price USD in
Europe so if I say CAD we will from
Quebec okay so now if I have this one
because I'm in this one year I can put
here when I get the gang like not again
but the turtle I said I can take this
value here because ever I need to check
for the the currency want to get but I
mean you know don't just want to get the
price
price historical men API crypto
compartments and this dog it's not that
good
again we have read
okay so at our okay okay so if I want to
get the price of the ad are at a ROM I
can say give me the item with the price
of Bitcoin USD and you're out and you're
like I mean I can change that to get
that a Canadian - so now here but now if
I say just that I would happen I get
that okay so F seen
because this this one you'll just make
no sense or big distance I mean the
skull it's just to be I think it's like
thirty thousand line of code and look at
how much time it took me six six hundred
millisecond I mean okay maybe just put
the ring that thing this is what I
missed
no yeah I can we put here the ring but
here which prize market cap and what I
need to I think it's maybe the available
supply total supply can be good or the
price in pricey new and BTC yeah it can
be really good present BTC like that
okay this is what I'm gonna do you price
I love this thing
okay time to work on the coin top but
now I'm gonna just have a lot of
this thing okay so here the top you have
the image or like I see in my eye I'm
gonna need to have the name at the
bottom of that so I'm gonna see text ear
and this one's gonna have type of thing
I get that coin you get a sick one I'm
gonna say Quinn the name and now this
text can have the style of title I'm
going to title call our cannot see the
color but at least I can see the fun
side you know see why I cannot see the
color because the color change with the
team so fun-sized going to be on maybe
16 and I found white it's gonna be 600
and also I think I'm gonna just put it
all uppercase maybe not title yeah and I
may be emerging top off only five
element 5 pixels so no air I can say
give me that but also for that color
get me the team that takes color this
way so now if I do this merging top so
now I get Bitcoin right donkey so now I
can work with that it's here I'm gonna
need on my image rapper I'm gonna say
background color of yellow
I was thinking red but in some title
yellow okay so now I took this space
yeah kind of I think it's good and now
in the right ear I'm gonna have another
element it's gonna be the this rapper so
I'm gonna create a meta rapper and this
one's gonna add a flex direction of
I think it's gonna add a fixed direction
of Rory I know why so I'm gonna SiC
style of this thing and I'm gonna put
also a flags of one finally gonna just
take you're gonna take the full specs of
the other one or maybe not I need to see
670 because I the one it's 30 image
rapper it's 20 so this thing need to be
80 okay so now in this one but I need to
do up a bit this thing but in this one
what I need to do a ping this one here
now what I need to do is pass the four
kind of chord right there tag tag right
there so now all I can do this is by
creating one here and now what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna create I'm gonna just
read that right there at the top just so
now it's a function element car this
one's going to return a view and with
text of the title coming from here just
from now title and now this element car
it's gonna also have a style just for
now I off I think I put the size I of 50
out of 50 with a width of 54 and also
I'm going to put that background color
of blue and I'm gonna put like this way
and I'm gonna say L car and that ADCs
the new clothes always my health card I
don't
yeah maybe not a title just a children
here
no a title title and I don't know like
it's the prize in u.s. I'm gonna say
three 2003 I have it here so we're gonna
go with this prize so that's gonna be
their time so so now I have all this
water key so my metal wrapper is like
that so I've it on the row also I can
see straight
justify contain space around I'm gonna
show you or you can like manage like to
have two from each side sake now right
now we have four day this way because
you take mod and you need to take more
than the 50 from the ID so I can see
that it's it take this thing gonna take
40% now I'm gonna take 50% of I but the
person there is going to be 40% we're
going to take the 40% of esperen or
maybe not
yeah but now okay now I need to submit a
rapper a I need to see rap Flags rap and
I'm gonna say rap don't know if I go
this way now the rap you see and now
what I need to stall here it's I'm gonna
see also so inside my a line item I
think I need to see that a line item I
think I see if I say centaur gonna stand
tied the middle no I didn't item justify
contains place around
I think it just because he don't take
the Eiling self stretch no I mean I mean
I mean this thing take the pain okay for
the idea I can just go with the I 40% -
yeah but that's gonna be a square and
that's gonna be really weird so we can
go with 30% and Margene a reason -
marching just for now okay
time to make it its own component
what
this way you know I see it's a string
but you and I think I'm gonna see in
number cuz I'm the trouble oh I'm gonna
receive it but now if I go this way
should stay the same but that these
gonna okay so now what I can see also a
justify contain center so I'm gonna
align everything in center in each
square like here and also now I can see
a title here I'm gonna stick color off
now right there should import my text
color because always remember I and the
Turkish because if I change the team
right now I get their thinking will be
better if I make this thing kind of it
in square it's gonna be better if you
going in square and now this okay so the
square is gonna add background colors
the background colors and this
background color is gonna go right there
cuz you're gonna go with the team so I'm
gonna say I gonna color like that so my
meta
here if I go with all of them one two
three four if I say background color
equal team dot card background this way
so now I can just remove this background
color you know in expect a token 28 to
so here for now
okay now you're gonna follow the
background colors but now I can remove
this pink
given its not the core background I want
its the tab bar colors okay yeah it's
gonna be a bit better so now and when
it's gonna be so I can just remove the
yellow to when it's gonna be dark okay
so now so now I need to get the text
color too so background color is going
to be a string and text color is gonna
be a string and now I can see sky of
colors going to be text color and this
text color can do Aaron ticket
it's called are gonna be quote team that
text color this way
oh I know I think I click on my slow
animation yeah no I get this one this
one this one and in dark a light I mean
okay
this Disney's
and now I just think would be better if
I have the title somewhere because I
mean it's why I don't make any sense I
don't even know what is that
so
so I'm gonna need to have another view
here put this one and I'm gonna have
another view here wait another text
while you can pull this one so this
one's it should be the title the title
should be this thing here these things
going to be the amount or maybe like I
will can call that its value and value
is gonna be a string number and title
gonna be on your string and value is
gonna go values gonna go there now
that's gonna break all my stuff title
here is going to be price
the second one so this is this one I'm
gonna say more kept or kept kept the
third one's gonna be price BTC this
one's going to be price USD for now when
you change it's gonna change and this
one's gonna be sub total supply I think
you know that's gonna break all my CSS
for sure not really but I would have
think this thing would have done I think
I wanted at the top of this I don't know
if you see what I mean but this thing
here should go on this thing here okay
so the route gonna have this size maybe
a bit more height like 25 and maybe 45
and after that this view here is gonna
have a style of style of chord and this
one's gonna have corn and now this one's
going to have this border-radius and
also going to take one of the car and
this ones will never start off I don't
know like start that a title wrapper and
this this one's gonna have a flex off I
only want it towards like 20% of the
okay now it's really weird but so this
one's gonna have five and the other
one's gonna take that
me before and now this thing you need to
add a line self stretch and now this one
I need to have this and the same for
this one I think but this one I'm maybe
gonna need two okay the tighter so here
this one's you have the style title
style that title and also then I have
the color this one's going to always
stay like you were this one's going to
be color that library
what do you think of this
I mean it's maybe not dance but
photographer Peregrine colors pink I
just want to see where this one get to
okay
it's right in the middle
flex of this thing it's 40% of the
screen I just think the graph here can
take less over here I'm gonna say 45 and
I'm gonna jump back to my index air whoo
so this one I had 45 so I still have 55
to say 55 so this one I will say 25
and so my coin detail line can have a
flags of Trulia perfect so now if I go
there I'm gonna have a bit more space
okay looks a bit more better and now if
I take some real value so example I'm
gonna take the Bitcoin so I'm gonna say
this is the price really good price
mountain in a u.s. DME photos and it's
better than this weekend so here no
Quinn detail so price USD I'm gonna pass
this thing after that I'm gonna go there
and I'm gonna say market cap market cap
and this number is too big for more
price BTC surprise me this is gonna be
one because it's price BDC 1.0 and that
our supply
I'm going to take the Bitcoin because
the bitcoins gonna almost have always
that bigger and I crushed everything
so I think it just to be this one size
of 70 needs to be hey you know I want to
see 1.0 so what I think it should be out
and string and now it's better so now I
can remove that in their ears is gonna
always be a string and I'm gonna get
that string from my graph QL so it's
okay sorry I can remove the pin for now
okay and you I'm gonna just show you a
little tricks I found it's here in the
text you can sing number of flying and
I'm gonna sing one so what's gonna
happen it's if if I go further than then
the box I have here so your first thing
I should have put some bugs not in this
one first thing in this one so first
thing on my box my view with the car
shouldn't say padding and I should say
like five I think okay why I do this
it's so this way with the number of line
what's gonna happen it's if I go further
than one line by default react native
gonna give me the three dots like you
see like the always like the three dots
you can get when you go further than
something so you're gonna go gonna give
me a for free so just for testing that I
can maybe see something like this and
we're gonna see if I'm gonna lie and no
I'm not lying
so you see right there it's the element
I just get here so if I go too much
further
okay so the Bitcoin ETA ROM and couldn't
get okay but yeah but I mean this value
have already so wired don't use it so in
point of total I think I get that cornea
so right there I can say right here I
can say Quine that price USD right there
so what do you say why
oh because it can be false so here what
I can do so finally it's why can't be
for oh yeah I'm gonna use inversion
no it's not invariant its idx I'm gonna
need here okay I'm gonna need to see
cons that price equal idx coin and here
I can say twice USD like right there so
now I can put your right and see if I
have nothing here I can see zero I'm
gonna get an arrow say okay here are 0
yeah like that I really start to love
this thing I DxO ears should be coined
that price
so this coin quaint right there I should
surprised which where you have
trice BTC so if I do this I'm gonna need
to run we like yarn in relay - watch
because my relay watch is gonna give me
now the price BTC rather yeah so now
which one I need to market cap market
cap USD he give me so here I can just
sell my coin give me market cap USD and
also I need to ask total supply total
supply okay so by doing this now you're
gonna see them now if I do this and I
see price BTC and now here I'm gonna
have access to Quinn that total supply
and market cap - Quinn that market Mart
market he was like but I think it's now
they all came here so what I shouldn't
say so
one thing I start to use - it's this
thing I call that crazy ways devices may
be bad to do this foreign market
two ducks
yeah this way so now what I think it's
that's gonna work flow type told me I
have no ever and it's true
you
if here I see to learn what can happen I
doubt the thing that's the thing I don't
want I want to see one but the the way I
think I'm going to just remove some why
wait if it's not
I can also remove the front side
are you still there even
I
I don't think I'm gonna put them in
there but the thing is if I go to
something with a big name like like you
see what happened
and I've already the name there so I
will just need to remove the name so I
can remove right there
and also what I'm gonna I think I should
do it just put the same background right
below this one so image router and I
should say another view I'm gonna say a
style of image mean name container me no
mold SMS real problem in this image
container what is gonna do its ear first
thing I should create a very local
clones image I'd who's gonna be poor 250
if I do this I'm gonna change this to
here and now here what I can say it's I
off this thing plus 20 and then weird is
gonna be distinct plus 22 and also is
gonna be border radius of this thing
plus 20 divided by 2 and also this yeah
like this and now this background color
this right there I'm gonna have a
background color of team that tab bar
colors
and you almost almost you're gonna have
the justified contain and I like seitan
yeah but is really weird
kind of really weird I think this thing
or this is the pixel is not good enough
it's why what is my API I get this file
here image coin point in juice after
that it's dead corner sample 22 22 that
PNG I set the knife
oops the ideas after ID go right there
and what static image coin steady image
Quine / sighs oh it's X okay and now if
I see 50 by 50 so we don't exist if I
see 52 by 52 which one is this 60 by 60
64 okay I have 64 - so if I see 64
but if I go this word thing I can juice
- needs to be first
oh man I don't want too much painting
but I think I can keep the other size
but 60-foots to be no I think it's what
you think of this size you just the
thing it decide your tire it's I mean
Manero
another 15 minutes that I'm gonna be
dead for tonight maybe I can do the
search and think about the design year
after
yep yeah let's see another lucky
no that was not lucky that was react
that was the thing I know it's weeks not
to wait my we are gonna say a direct AB
this thing here it's for doing animation
they have really really good animation
so it's all I think it they all want you
to have like a six different by second
animation
the demo
because what I want it's I need to have
an admission when I'm gonna click on
this button here this thing gonna go
down right there
why after that I'm gonna add a search
can do this
yeah I go on the AppStore from here nope
or I can just maybe use the layout
animation maybe
you
you
so this
so here Oh what looks like
also uh another text view but text in
podium
here I'm gonna have another view in this
one I'm gonna have my text input this
view here everything you should sit
padding the v10 and on my wrapper
I'm gonna have width
oh maybe I don't need the padding I can
just see width bit of 90 percent of 90
percent and what I can just do with you
see justify center and a line item
center near my wrapper gonna have a
fixed direction of row so we I'm gonna
have this I'm gonna have down but now I
need to have the same navigation you
have the same I think it's simple line
icon my search its are you like I own
icon but this one now is gonna be you're
gonna see white for now gonna be 20
okay so now that takes input in here I'm
gonna have a background color I'm gonna
have a background color I'm not sure
about a rgba 0 0 0 and 0.5 maybe RG beer
okay border radius of 10
takes input the input gonna take a flex
of 1 then I take all the space I think
but yeah I should have a view what this
one's going to control the icon that
sure it's really neat but I can rapper
and this one's gonna just take flags of
maybe 0.2 justify contain centaur just
enter in our line item center by doing
this I think it don't get a touch
anymore yaki but now here okay I'm here
right there so I think 0.1 should be the
good size so I know I'm right there so
now if I don't put any more color color
I think you pass the color on my
navigation my own screen I'm gonna need
to pass my team inside this one and I
think I get the team from this
accrediting do we get the team this one
I get the team
so my search boy is gonna have a type
from the type you're gonna have a type
type color you're gonna have the props
it's gonna be team of team color data
lock it just pass here and now this
style right there can have a color of
team team that takes color okay
also this one's gonna have a selection
color selection man selection react
Nativa text input
sorry and I think I'm gonna have the
platform that because and we don't have
the section colors so I can color it
right there so now you're against a
section color it's gonna be cool depen
up above the platform but if the
platform that OS equal I Oh s I'm gonna
say here to give me the color that
primary it's gonna be undefined so this
value don't gonna exist because like I
told you and you really don't work and
I'm gonna be soon an error if yes so now
you see I get this thing and now if I
said I I get the color I need the only
thing I don't maybe like it's this
background black kind of ish so I will
maybe go with the same black value I
have coming from this thing here but
constant what was the value card
background so this value here so in rgba
this is this form colored background I
don't make any sense because these
things okay what are you gonna looks
like in in light
oh I don't like it I mean I mean I
mean it's not that bad but I think I
need to go back to here to is gonna be
cool but acting my navigation on my home
here I should have a border but a width
of 0 so now I don't want to have this in
aesthetic token 115 and now I get
whatever done with with with with bar
okay no I was good juice border I guess
I still have one maybe I think it's I if
I put water button color and I see
transparent I do not want to have this
I'm gonna always have it I think so what
I should do with this search bar first
thing 90 percents too big so I'm gonna
say 80% but for the width I'm gonna say
90%
and maybe it looks too much sure if I
see width of 150 and 100 pixel ear and
also don't put border-radius what it
looks like so this we don't gonna looks
like too much and then it looks too much
iOS and now here what I shall do
it's safe and elite colors that and that
color is but team that takes color
because you're gonna just follow the
text oh and white is going to be black
okay
and now if I do there okay okay okay
this thing may be a bit bigger 25 yeah
so now what I think I should have done
so I'd like to work on dark so I'm gonna
go back on the door you know I'm right
there the thing is I have no idea Bell
wired this thing stop you see so what
I'm limiting its maybe my route right
there can maybe a background colors
another background colors but a border
but um with one border but colors off I
mean if I sit primary that's gonna looks
truly will really weird yeah but if I
say light gray I think this one's gonna
look good yeah I mean for now so this
way I mean we see this one and now what
I can do so now when I click here I show
this thing
so so this one I don't have other choice
then adding it inside my V docks I don't
have other choice I think because I mean
this thing it's coming from react
navigation and this thing I don't think
I can gonna be order if I go with
plugging with some function so I can see
your function toggle search bar would
this one's going to be an action and
gonna return type of app the search bar
then I'm gonna have a string an error
with flow because I need to create it in
my action where I'm gonna say the same
thing of this one but now I'm gonna
change this thing here and take your
search action right there this way now
that's gonna go away yeah so now what I
can do it's go to my reducer app
anything right there search bar is
search show I think it's gonna be false
by default and this thing's gonna be in
my app state and my app state I'm gonna
say is search or sure if you don't know
what me in the plus it's meaning it's
gonna be me table it'll be an immutable
value okay so now it's gonna be pretty
simple for this one's gonna be a type
app tag your search bar when that's
gonna toggle and then you just finally
return the past state but also you're
gonna change the is search bar to become
the opposite of what Europe this way
well now this function right there I
need to pass it inside my redox ear and
also this search bar right there I'm
going to connect it with videos I'm
gonna see CR connect I'm gonna connect
this thing and now this thing's gonna
receive a state who's gonna be the same
type of state right there
and when I go down I can sustain state
now this thing is going to receive is in
show I'm going to see state that that is
search bar show issues gonna go to my
perhaps it's going to be a boolean and
for now the only thing I'm gonna do it's
it's if it is show return you're just
for now so now it's going to be nil so
you see I have nothing and if you want
to see all that's gonna looks like when
I'm gonna toggle it I can go right there
take my props of my actions of this
thing right there the name of my action
came here put in my time click dispatch
so now you see this is what that's gonna
look like but it's really bad I know it
just let me some time to do the design
but at least so this is a good way for
testing your action in redox okay so now
I'm gonna just remove it
so now what I can do it just go on my
navigation now I'm gonna make yeah so
sorry I mean I don't wanna have other
children bending this thing so yeah what
I mean
thank you
oh man I'm gonna take it I'm gonna
create a component because
slow import reaction after I need the
ion icon coming in from vector iron icon
laughter I'm gonna need that button
others coming from import button coming
from the slash but another come on
yeah but they're also I need the colors
coming from my youth Co can't stand and
now I can have it but this one's gonna
be connected with Redux so this one
right there it's going to have connect
from react we dogs
and now I can just take my button search
thing my button sir I'm gonna just do
this for now on my own like that I think
I need nothing more for now so now okay
so now what I can do on this one it's
button search okay so what I need here
it's I'm gonna need to have the action
coming from action that app it's going
to be toggle switch bar also I'm going
to import air with and large coming in
from recompose and I also going to need
to compose and now what I'm gonna do
they're like that like they're after
this one gonna have a wit and learn and
after all that I can have my butter
Sarge this one's gonna on press it's
gonna be a function gonna take the props
and this props gonna call another
function we're gonna find any disco
clubs that target search bar this
thing's gonna be unpressed
i'm treads gonna be a function i'm
prayers gonna go there the props and now
on prayer gonna go right there and nice
one shot okay so now what I can do here
it's just where I'm getting my button
search Quinn detail can you see that
here and here if I do this I'm supposed
to don't have anymore
another thing it's reducer keep track of
this thing so I'm gonna just need to
create a function on my app here I'm
gonna need to create make sure the
search bar closed in a panther
hey gyro oh yeah it's you're gonna
reignite - I mean it's when you know
react you almost know already like 70%
of regnant is the thing about reactivity
just you will need to know some kind of
boat API for Android and iOS and the
design also and also I think some skill
on swift and and you read some and uncut
into so swift cut in Java or Objective C
okay so now what I'm gonna do for this
search bar it's yeah I'm gonna do some
animation because I gotta let this thing
just this way I mean it's so what I'm
gonna do
it's air I'm gonna create a component
will receive props component will
receive props while the props gonna be
equal to props and then what I'm gonna
do it so yeah I think that each show is
going to be equal to this type of the
issue so I'm gonna other state is shows
gonna be a boolean why I do this maybe
you pass it's because now you know what
I can say if if next props if next crops
that is show it's not it's not equal to
this that perhaps that is show and next
props that is show it's true okay so if
it's true now here what I can say I can
say this that show when I'm gonna call
this thing right there what I'm gonna do
it's this thing I'm gonna make use of
the layout animation right there and
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna say layout
animation that I think it's configuring
nexium here I think I'm Java can add the
duration when I see 300 maybe 500 just
for testing and I'm gonna say create
here what I'm gonna opt here I'm gonna
say type of layout animation that type
that easy type that easy in
easy Oh you know I think it's not and
property the automation that property
the opacity yeah I mean
oops
I mean it's not that bad I mean I don't
really need to check this one here
because yeah but the only thing I mean
sorry the only thing I need to check
here it's this thing but
oh this border oh thank you Jerome
yeah this is how I learned to it's I
learned by watching other people and I
learned by watching I get other people
to so I just think it's that just why
I'm man I'm cutting this up on in front
of if you want to just fold it people
learning the same way I learning so I
don't say I don't say everything I do
it's perfect but taking juice yes I
don't want to ups I don't want to have
this thing the only thing I need to do
it's if it's show so here if it's show I
shall just need to put this thing a bit
bottom can I send marching a5 example
yeah
and this thing should have not this
background color i thing but the wrapper
here should have the team background
color of team that chord background
color
so now here it's a good trick if you
want to see your your animation you
click come in T so the debugger and now
I'm gonna see my animation really slow
so now our one problem it's the year
it's perfect I see the opacity coming in
from here but you see when I get back I
get one problem it's the thing goes out
I don't see it anymore and so here how I
can manage that
it's I think I should create another
function called Ida yeah that's why yeah
yeah true yeah so what do you think
about if this search I can become like X
when it's open
that's really a good point thank you so
here what I'm gonna do so when it's
IDing it I'm gonna just say finally
layout animation that configure here I
can just say duration so then I'm gonna
okay so if
I mean
don't know why I think it's if I go
really fast and maybe that gonna juice
the other nation and you have epi
see an in type yeah but where is the
enemy type okay
spring I think spring can be maybe
better I don't I'm not sure but if I go
spring that gonna just like mean
so this value that is forecast is
because I just want to make if this that
probes that show that's gonna be boolean
I mean it's gonna follow the state so is
for kids gonna be a boolean and now what
I can say it in my text input it focus
or to focus
you
yeah hey I'm gonna go with that fun now
and now just go on my button search and
now this one I can just take the under
state and right there I can just say
state equals daily is show by doing
state that the is search bar show it
shows going to be a boolean
after I get to is a show and now right I
can say let icon equal is so if it show
else so L is gonna be this one and this
one's going to be close I think it's the
name close and I can just say icon here
and we play this thing
close okay don't exist vector I can
oh that was MD closed
well no I mean it's
dang it
I mean for now I think it's okay
oh thank you thank you I really
appreciate underlined eye color I'm
gonna just remove this for the enjoined
and also I think key type because the
thing right now if I open my keyboards
return but I think I want to have search
so now it's search
and also I'm going to co2
I think it's correct autocorrect solves
and I can already just do at least the
text and here that's going to be an
empty string text gonna be a string and
text change I'm gonna get the text maybe
a string and then I'm gonna just do
dance that's straight and I'm gonna say
text right there like that so now what I
can do with the context change and just
go into my text and put in C on text
change I think um text on change text so
that was unchanged text so I should
change this name
Anantha now I'm gonna have my value in
my state can you move this thing
okay
I'm going to test it on white
kind of like it
the phone father I like about react its
exhibits the fact then example you want
to play it on your phone you can just
connect your cell phone on Xcode you run
it at least one time when it's done if
you don't make any change on the native
side you can just refresh you from
without being connected so example right
now I've opened my cell phone and I'm
just playing with the app without having
any cable or something like that I just
need to have the same Wi-Fi
and I just think the only thing I should
maybe add it's the fact that now I'm
gonna show you I just I sit with my
phone I'm gonna be going dark because
that gonna looks maybe easier in your
eyes it's if I go there and I click on
search and I type something and I click
search
I would like to I'm not sure but no it's
ok
yeah that's the thing here I think for
now I'm gonna remove it from the wallet
yeah it's gonna be a bit better I think
so now that one of my problem now what
I'm gonna have it if I go
Landscaping I mean it's not that bad
the only thing about the landscaping
would be this holding air I shall have
need a scroll view and okay yeah it's
this thing - yeah I think it's just
better if I remove my I'm gonna remove
it later I mean it's not done
I'm gonna just do them
so here inside my redox Perseus filter
reducer
the thing is I have one problem with my
Perseus
it's I want to I don't want to wear my
you want to start on a subset of Y usted
on video someone you want to remove some
key before you search I think this is
the one I need because I mean I don't
want to have this that's gonna be crazy
I mean if you see like if i refresh this
thing you're gonna keep open that just
don't make any sense so what I'm gonna
do it's cause of my redox process my
redox process right now what I'm doing
it's I'm taking all my state so I were
at least on my app and I don't want to
keep it like that so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna just add this filter right
there on this one here so although we do
you install it transform save subs oh
yeah so that's the thing we need to do
so you create the filter so I'm need to
install this thing so yarn and maybe
gonna save everything first add search
bar just a please I'm gonna do the yarn
at this thing with the expert assistance
from filter and now looks like when I
mean it's create blacklist filter you
want to remove some key before usage
yeah that's the thing I want its I want
to just remove some key so save okay so
I need three Black Keys filter so right
there I can say from redux transform
filter and now right here okay yeah
so here I need to see transform or
that's gonna be an a variety no okay so
transform air I can recreate this thing
outside of my inside my constant like
right there
really so now here I can just take sub
set reducer and I just want to remove
the is search bar
so I'm gonna test it and by opening my
Vida burger and my app which I don't
work debug GS remotely payload app is
search what this thing I don't want
my reduce our
key you don't want to say key don't want
to say that's what I've done I think
transforms
keep it's not what I want
in this one it's not supposed to there
store transforms
again let me just create a filter and
not go with the black lace now one year
to add the team and also dark adding
team and loading and now what I need
it's pretty filters when I came from you
know if I do this fan it's not working
why I'm not supposed to get to here or
so I'm gonna try to make it false so now
it's false okay looks like work now okay
okay so now if I'm changing it and I'm
refreshing now I work the pillow okay
now I work I'm probably sure that create
that black lace would work too and I'm
gonna have less co2 right so can you say
is just to make sure you're gonna work
I'm not the payload nothing I make it
work I'll be fishing the screen boom
still work out boom so now I can go and
remove some of my to do so Eric and just
type some
some come and I'm removing this to do
here it's done
good so what I can do oh I forget to put
in them and I shall have a search bar
animation I'm gonna make it to the queue
way but it's not done and getting graph
epi cube inception this thing you can
check for that search option is done but
the search is not finished set up a
tempura batter with dark is done
what I'm gonna need to do to its
database saving mobile or server so what
I'm thinking it's the thing it's so as
you know in my app what I do it's a add
a cryptocurrency right there so it's
example at Bitcoin I paid a Bitcoin
maybe like photos and what happened okay
that's really weird so this thing I'm
going to need to check that example I
say I have paid a Bitcoin
14:14 Bitcoin at four thousand dollars
so you have a lot of money and here what
I'm going to say it's example one I'm
gonna save it here now I need to save it
out inside maybe like database inside
the mobile app maybe gonna use the
realms this tool here so realms it's
kind of database inside app who work
with we hang native this voice are I'm
thinking about adding that to my API so
the thing it's I'm using a server less
API so what I'm meeting its if I do this
and I'm saving I'm gonna need to make
all my Curie in my mutation and I'm
gonna surely use dynamodb I think I've
reduced form my persistence that my
persistent about cashing the value of of
the API call
I'm looking if I'm gonna use DynamoDB
it's a database I would like to do some
tests with you that so you have an
infinite scale with that the only thing
I don't really like about it it's the
fact then you have it's pretty weird as
a Evi
like when you do example a query this is
all that's gonna looks like it's thing
if I go to my no GS and I got DynamoDB
then I'm gonna be in and I click on
getting start and I should have one with
no GS no GS and then I only be asked so
you see like example if I want to cure
this is what that's gonna looks like you
will need to create a parameter table
name so for your example I can say
cryptos with some condition so example
here they say they're gonna have a
variable years
this is something I can check later now
I think it's so what do you think about
the app right now I think the only thing
I need to changes may be this color of
uploading this
this thing Porsha I'm gonna need to add
animation I mean it's too sick to stray
the thing I can maybe check its the
feedback and after I'm done I see that
from one hour but now it's gonna be real
here I think for if you want to do a
male so react native male - so I want to
send an email I want to send an email to
me for the feedback so we need linking
so I'm gonna go to my setting where here
what I want it's finally one I'm gonna
click click wait later click on this one
so I'm gonna import the linking on fig
that press so what I mean by this one is
this thing here the feedback button I
want to open the mail app
so if I read that here this is that's
gonna be any synchronous one yeah it's a
done
okay so I'm going to seek can open equal
linking that open URL and the URL I'm
going to pass its first thing I'm going
to go to my constant
and here what I'm gonna six feedback
emails so I'm gonna put my email and I'm
gonna go to my so I think here what you
need its mill like in the web so it's
it's like you doing the web the email
feedback emails and now I'm gonna see
sub Jack equal I'm gonna go back to my
constant feedback email plus a URL I'm
going to see email it's gonna be that
any I'm gonna say also subject going to
be cool to keep my folio feedback like
that so now I can change that to be that
feedback email the email and the
subjects gonna be property that feedback
email that subject like that after I'm
gonna say so that's gonna be an hour
wait if can open so if it's true after I
don't think I need to do its linking
thing is that no it's a better return
linking that URL open open URL when you
pass the what no
we should create the URL
you
enable - I'm gonna test it on my phone
maybe it's my phone
yeahit's omnia he work on my phone so we
don't work on simulator so I think I can
just remove it by adding variable called
a simulator react native know if
simulator
I'm gonna need these worth this this
library is really really good you can
have a device that unique ID device
model system name bottle I did bill
number when you want to show your number
time zone app is running in emulator
so I think I'm gonna install it
I'm gonna need xqo so I'll be running my
app on my phone like I told you when you
do a change on when you do a change on
on an Etsy module if you want to run it
on your phone you need to reopen it so
what I'm gonna do it's here I'm gonna
say yarn reactive device info after that
only thing you need to do it's react
native link negative device info oh
your nano module I did a mistake
here now I have a package ISA but I
don't want it now I can just say
negative
hope everything's gonna work so now if
everything is working I'm supposed well
if you go to you libraries I'm supposed
to get we device info so this is all
you're almost like cooling now so and
now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna have
inside my constants I'm gonna have
export count device info so yeah I'm
gonna create some variable already
coming in from this library
now when I say it is emulator it's going
to be equal to device info that is
emulator on the phone instead of a work
I think just because it's not finished
yet
that's the finish to build
so now by doing this I think I'm going
to need to be run it on my simulator too
so looks like work on my phone so now
what I'm gonna do it's here
okay so now here this thing here so what
I'm gonna need to do and I can close
this thing here I can close it ewriting
I can we run my butt Eric and now Syriac
not here run iOS so we're gonna rebuild
that for this one I can have done this
with acknowledges I want to close Xcode
I know if you hear my computer right now
but it's gone crazy the close preview'
too
we will succeed sounds good okay so now
what I can do it's go back to my search
bar that's real or here to my setting
here say device info so here I want to
if it's device info what I'm gonna do
it's here that's gonna return me a
boolean what I can say here it's if
device info dot is emulator so if it's
the emulator return false we don't know
nothing here so by doing this now if I'm
clicking here the app don't wanna stop
but if I do this on my cell phone I have
the inbox opening like I think maybe no
oh yeah so now I know when this is the
emulator or not and now are these
constants bill right there so now what
I'm gonna do is I'm good I think I'm
gonna just do a type of it
and maybe just give it enough
perfect so now I have no error of flow
type just to make sure how can we be
running
and I need to do this winter in the
world and do it in Android which we
agentic in Android app build Gradle add
this dependency
oh it's already done okay after that in
Android sitting Gretl
it's done with react native main
application so main application main
Java main application here I need to say
Aaron device info yep it's done and
every hour man this Ling it's awesome
add appropriate optional permission to
and we'll read phone state for phone
number and device name yeah I don't
really need I don't need this permission
then maybe thing I'm gonna add to it
this finger friend maybe I'm gonna make
the app open with the data what what is
this error if this is from lower
I mean I'm not supposed to learn through
I don't want this
now should be good so I think I'm done
for tonight I hope you enjoyed this
three-hour session so I hope you learn
like I learned - it's that was pretty
good - just play a bit with this kind of
animation I mean it's not that it's not
finished I mean this animation it's
really not done I'm need to finish that
also this stuff I need to gonna have the
real value coming from like the DB and
here I think this value I kind of maybe
like this we're you just maybe like a
big logo like we pull here I'm not sure
about the size but after that here I'm
gonna need to plug this thing with the
air SS about the app and also I want to
add the way to add alert so example you
can say I want to add an alert on
example you can add an alert on some
price
something is really slow now
yes
and the thing too it's when I'm gonna do
the search here I'm gonna need to search
over everything but this thing can be
done further oh and also I think if I do
this no yeah it's done
so have a good night everyone I hope you
enjoy and I'm gonna check for another
