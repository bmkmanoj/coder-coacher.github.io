perfect if you have seen what I've done
yesterday I fixed my problem this why if
I do any
didn't set up the babble with flow type
you
yeah that was what I did so although I
can came here this one's going to be an
object the context going to be an object
and the callbacks the functions
so now I can call the API and put it
inside my graph key well that's perfect
so one of my plan for today it's gonna
be to plug it much more like really ask
for the pagination and after I'm gonna
work on the mobile
so I find that it and I need to have a
node connection like that I need to
create my own connection so I need
connection definition and that came from
this library did I have installed you
have to fill oh yeah so the name it's
one I do connections it's connection
type connection definition and what you
need to do it Const example somewhere
connection type
to use connection so here I can say crip
those connection at signing at age time
and yak you know to do okay so here I
should say Christo's
so here doesn't crypto connection type
and this one I'm gonna call that crypto
edge type that I can put the name so I
can secret toe and type node type so air
that's going to be my cryptos type so
now this one's gonna have a type here is
going to be a type of crypto connection
type
you
connection from every Muslim
hello how are you
I'm good too thank you for asking so now
I must be close so now we have my
connection type coming in from here
you
you
you
you
so I'm gonna need a note feel this is
what I think
you
relates not easy as easy as as a polo
you
Oh
is going to be my editor
a join for you
you know are you ready
you
you
oh so you have my know in my notes here
so you know they all Mary's over to the
it's for returning
oh boy
so I need finally to plug in this no
interface right inside my type as an
interface this year she'll everything
and at the bottom I put interface I put
an arrow of no interface like they do
here
crypto ID felt I must be uptown type but
God objects what
oops
do start to crypto
you
hmm so
so you start to be really closed so now
I just need to understand this as you
can see you see what I've missed its
first I've made like some kind of
hosting kyouto type was create ear so I
need to put that ear also you put the
interface here the non interface cry
meaning right from this no definition
after that my curry this thing you're
gonna get the crypto connection type was
finally here you just put like a name of
this for this variable so it just like
it's the same like when we do like weird
and with like that equal this mention if
you want I mean just like you put a
variable here for now I'm gonna just put
EDL like I can remove this and this I've
started to see a bit an ear you need to
put an ID global feel for the crypto
here I think I can just remove them
names too
no you need to Alan I remember that when
you do other name so now I have my Curie
so if I go to my note I get the ID if I
do to know so I need to understand so
Sisto hello are you and enemies and
enemies so if I go to my first so crypto
start cursor or what what won't do that
thing
kay
that's the same name total supply due to
the supply work
exciting now you up everything
where I resolved
or maybe I can just remove the new all
this mall
no I think they're gonna work
we have Creole string isn't oops and
don't forget the new volume okay
so percent change in the seven last day
so this isn't percentage oh yeah
so now I can have the name Bitcoin cool
the only thing I need to search about is
the ID because I want to keep the ID
an excel you
you know you know what I know I know
something what I'm gonna do here is I'm
gonna say crypto ID and this one's gonna
be like the other one but look what I'm
gonna do here that's gonna be ID so now
if I still fetch this one is word but
now if I say crypto ID boom now I have
two video to record I'm gonna record
them tomorrow and I think this week and
I'm gonna check about doing another
notification so I need to learn about
this right now I just need to do a lot
of qfq any really because are we gonna
get to big client in the next month who
they all gonna use that and I don't want
to be the one who make everyone slower I
hate doing this so that's why so looks
like it's good so my data with my
cryptos with the edge and each edge of
its nodes so yeah so this is what I'm
gonna do with the Twitter clone it's I'm
gonna add maybe notification system so
I'm gonna plug a Roku server we're gonna
just manage the data fication that they
were server but I'm gonna put that on
the server we have right now yeah if you
want you can join the the discord I put
the link in the description I've put a
channel called ID for a next video you
just saw after that Twitter I'm just
looking about what I can do
so I was thinking about building maybe
like a or BnB clone but by using graph
cool now so
so looks like I can plug this thing with
my friend and now I wasn't sure I'm
gonna fill it today but looks like so
see the mobile X start today I'm gonna
start my simulator
oh my computer screen right now
so yeah so I've get to some other ID so
what I'm gonna do like as you can see
the well like I'm gonna like it it's I
think I'm gonna put right there at the
top so right there at the top so what
I'm gonna do I think in the others in
the right side I'm gonna put the whole
much percentage you win or lose this
week after that ear at the top I'm gonna
put kind of a slider who's gonna show
the biggest winner of the day and some
coin you did you don't have after that
that's gonna show you your coin and I'm
gonna maybe put that search bar right
here at the top but before doing this we
need to plug that maybe gonna close this
one and now we're gonna set up for the
first line of my life
real light so gaining start I know what
I need it's a network layers yeah
so I need you really run time
we aquilae to library I'm gonna need
after you create your energy ran man
with your fetch query so it's almost
like what they just show here I'm going
to create a file in my source code
network that yes
and this one's gonna be K kind of e
maybe not that easy but I need from yeah
yeah really runtime and also I think
Expo I need to have a set up for I think
I need a battle stuff
really
using ref QL
oh hey all night thank you I hope you
gonna enjoy it
first I need to install that after that
you add relate to you battle or you see
as a plug-in acting and I not sure but I
think yesterday have read please not
that the really bugging show run before
other plugin or preset to ensure the
graphical template so it's a good thing
to know
so you put this thing before this more
and I think if you do this not sure but
I think I think you're gonna need to
restart because when you touch the
battle or see I'm sure you need to
change to restore
so nothing looks like crash that's a
good sign
so from really well network I'm gonna
need the environment in the network like
that after that I'm going to create all
all we need others object this one is
gonna have a content type equal to
application reason and I'm gonna also
accept application please you can hear
my Pacey right now is that's crazy
don't know looks like I have no CPU well
brand new MacBook and now I can create
my function and fetch me with this one
gonna get operation up low down in
everything here and return fetch fetch
now I'm gonna say HTTP local oh sweet
ass on slash graph QL after that here
I'm gonna have a method equal of post
also I'm gonna have the others equal to
my object I've just grid here at the top
also after I'm gonna at the body where
I'm gonna just Jason that's stringify
truly gonna be the operations that text
and after that I'm gonna have after that
I'm gonna have at things the variable
one sec my girlfriend ruse takes me
and variables right there boom like that
after that you see I don't invent
nothing is just coming in from here Dan
here yeah you get your response and now
area I can say return return the thing
is wrong right now respond return
respond to but here are like more ways
so so I don't gonna need the upload all
looks like and not cache country after
the you see kirn's network equal network
and you pass you fetch curry after that
you see currents on view run man equal
and we run them and this one take an
object and one of them is gonna be the
network
yeah but because I call that I'm gonna
do like what I'm just
I hope everything gonna still go well
start to understand a bit more now run
time no way I get down we run man
so now I go real and run man that's in
the loops
now I think I'm gonna need to have my
provider
the thing is I'm sure I need to plug
this thing for sure neato like kind of
providers on the right map extent we
limitation
Oh
do someone have a user really before
yeah or maybe realm' like the database
for inside this thing here
Expo canoes realm's

who think it's worth at start
yak really react really
