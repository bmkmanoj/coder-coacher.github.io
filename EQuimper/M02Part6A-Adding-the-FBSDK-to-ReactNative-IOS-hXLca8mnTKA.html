number six for this second milestone so
the plan of today is to install the
Facebook SDK on both iOS and Android so
at the end of the this part what we
supposed to what is supposed to happen
is whenever I'm gonna click here on
continuing with Facebook I'm gonna get
here this kind of logging up ending in
my application so this is what we're
gonna do today
so so for this part is going to be the
first part we're gonna do this with the
iOS version and the second one's gonna
be with integrated so this is what we're
gonna do today so what are we gonna do
first
its first thing it's we're gonna go to
this link here react native Facebook SDK
and we're gonna follow what they say to
do so first thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna round react let's say
install react native Facebook SDK or
finally just doing NPM install so inside
your project go inside your mobile make
sure you are in tell you my bite and run
yarn add the egg native Facebook SDK
after that we're gonna run this come in
here react native link Facebook SDK
don't supposed to take too much time
okay
after that we run this Kamel so they're
gonna link the react native Facebook is
decay perfect and now what we need to do
so for the iOS version now we're gonna
need first thing to follow this getting
start get here going to be pretty simple
so first thing we need it's going inside
your Facebook app developer and add a
platform inside your setting iOS so
click inside of your setting here click
add platform click on iOS after that
what you need to do is go inside your
Xcode project go inside your app near
the app here Instagram clone and copy
paste this bundle identifier
inside this and click enter after that
we need you to click singular sang
sign-on and after that just click on
save
change everything is say no ever perfect
after that what we need to do is to
download this here and put that inside a
folder inside your root document
Facebook SDK so add all we did on that
right there I've put that inside my
Facebook SDK right there so you can do
this just make sure that is this is
inside your document folder and this is
where you're going to put inside that
Facebook SDK with this uppercase SDK
here so what they want you to do is to
drag and drop inside the folder
framework if you don't have the photo
frame or create one but we have one now
so the folder they want you to put is
first thing it's gonna be the bolt so
bold framework we're gonna drag and drop
that inside the framework right here
make sure you have copy e 10 if need if
need so we're gonna click OK after that
the one we're gonna need also it's going
to be the core kit so core kit drag and
drop that same thing finish that we're
gonna do the same with a sure yet so
sure kit right there same thing after
that we're gonna do the same with the
logging kit locking kit that's it after
that we're gonna go inside Visual Studio
code we're going to open us and we're
gonna go to the infoplease folder inside
the Instagram clone info.plist file
inside inside Gun Club
because we're they're gonna ask you to
add this line here so just copy paste uh
this don't worry I'm gonna put this link
in the description and right there what
we're gonna do is we're going to paste
that right here so after our line 24
after they see a bundle version I'm
gonna paste this stuff here I'm gonna
just then a bit okay now here we need to
put the
i D so here you can click to copy rather
at the top right what you do is you're
gonna change that to be your app ID so
you can do command D to selection bolt
because we need that here too after that
you app name so the app name we have is
in stock loan so I'm gonna copy paste
that right here so this is like where
you put on you app ID stuff anything
like that and this is where the finally
the Facebook is the key gonna read your
stuff inside you info please so you can
close this from visual studio code yeah
yeah go inside Xcode and now what we're
going to need to do it's good inside
your app delegate em okay make sure this
is the appdelegate.m now one thing we're
going to need to import is going to be
here this line FB Facebook is the key
core core kit all this stuff finally we
are right there okay after that they
asked us to place this code right inside
here you see right inside this launch
option right there why are you going to
do finally right there below I'm gonna
save that and after that what you need
is to copy and pasting this full block
ear of code and be for the end but
outside of this one here that's it so
now we're going to say and now if
everything is worked this is suppose to
be able to confine so I'm gonna run the
compilation I don't gonna come when it's
gonna be done okay now EE succeed so now
if it succeed we are support at least to
see their screen if you see the screen
that means we should be good perfect so
now that's going to be that for the for
the installation of the mobile iOS
finally their Facebook SDK for the iOS
the only thing we can do it's maybe try
it so what are we gonna do is we're
gonna go inside the login screen and
first thing we're gonna create it's a
unlocking Facebook button so on logging
FB button I press sorry press
and this one is going to be any sinkhole
its function here yeah but no equal here
like that okay
this button is going to be called where
when we click on this Facebook button so
inside there continue with Facebook we
should be able to see right there
on press there's that on logging
Facebook press perfect and now here to
make it work what we're going to do is
we're gonna import from FB is DK like
that when I import the logging manager I
don't know why I don't have the
autocomplete yet logging manager okay
now in what we're gonna do is we're
gonna do Khan's rest equal outweigh
logging manager that log with read
permission here you put just public
profile
okay nothing more for now so now if i
refresh my screen I'm getting an error
and one of my error is going to be again
this icon stuff so all we manage that is
by seeing this stuff here again this
code here now we're gonna reload I'm
gonna put this code in the description
and now if I click on continue with
Facebook and now it should be able to
work you see you previously log into the
inside in cyclone blah blah blah and
that's it so that's gonna be this photo
anyway apart so I'm gonna do another
video for the anyway user so I'm gonna
stop here for now so we're gonna jump on
there anyway part in a moment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
