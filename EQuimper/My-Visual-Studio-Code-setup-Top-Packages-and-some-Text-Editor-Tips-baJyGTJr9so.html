a simple video it's just about what I'm
using as a code editor and which kind of
flagging I'm using I guess this kind of
request in my in my commands and I think
that's a good idea to just show because
I've seen a lot of people at being video
on about the atom package but never
really about this law studio comb
so once it so here it's my text editor
so it's a reserved studio code it's made
by a Microsoft and this is open source
so you can play with it and this is free
on Windows Mac and Linux everything is
for free so for the one who didn't have
you can just download it right there so
what I'm going to show you is my top
package and and which one I'm using
every day and I can live with without it
so my first one is that a Tillison so
what do pet intelligence it's this
little piece right there I'm going to
show you so I'm going to add something
here example I'm going to show I'm going
to we're going to just remove this one
so I'm going to do fetch meet up and
this is where packetization came it they
autocomplete for me like that you see
all easier is that I mean they help you
to find your your path they el pew to
don't make mistake and other thing if
it's a package you can see right there
it's some kind of package after that if
I came here and I start to type
something as inside my API I can see
what I can import another thing I think
that came from Visual Studio code it if
I'm a Mac if I do come in and I click on
API ear I'm gonna go right on my file so
for the one who don't know how to
download this kind of package you get
there you're going to type that in the
we sent em this is this one right there
so good job - Christian you build that
it's a Allison package you need some
kind of setting to do but I'm going to
I'm going to pass all my sitting inside
a gift and I'm going to put the gifts
inside my description so that's going to
help you second thing as project manager
so what do project manager is like the
one on Adam they help you to have many
projects and just go to the other one
without really fine where is the so ear
example I'm going to do shift command P
so this is all everything about my
visual cue code so everything you can do
outside of your project so like every
tool excetera Zoe I'm going to type
project so ear example I can do project
manager list project to open in the new
window I'm going to click here and this
is the project AB C's so it example if I
open this one they're going to open my
project right inside a new window if you
want to save a project only thing we
need to do should come in peace project
you go there you go space project I'm
going to click enter here and now my
project is saving nothing more to do so
if you want to download it you go here
extinction at the bottom and you're
going to type project manager this one
here so nothing more to do the only
thing you need to PC is there it you're
going to get project that JSON files so
if you want to delete some project you
have finished something I guess you can
just use this one so my third one is the
Auto V name tag so what do a Tory name
tag it's I think that's one of the most
awesome tool to have in VI example here
you see a review I have two tags use of
my component view if I want to change
that for the effects example now I can
type text and look that change the one
who is close to him so this text is this
one is the close one so now if I go back
to view that Oh to finish that I think
that's a really awesome to make you code
much more easy
- right so for that it's a Auto Oh -
close tag right there by John egg and as
you can see it's really easy to install
a package in inert Auto closer photo
rename it's really easy to install
package in the in is also Jojo it's
almost like a Adam you just need to
click install but I think it's with the
Vsauce your code you always need to
reload I think Adam now if you reload -
but this is all you need to do after
that add a JavaScript es6 code meter so
finally JavaScript code because what
that do is that just helps you to add
some kind of some kind of snippet for
your code movie FX or example here I can
start to type terms I'm gonna get turn I
can have my class I can how this kind of
stuff so this you just meet that if you
work with es6 this is something to us so
for this one this is a es6 code snippet
so this one right there and my five one
is output color reason so the only thing
that do is that just help you to add
some kind of colour inside your terminal
so if you want to know how I open my
terminal for me in my Mac I think this
is the same in in the window I do
control and I do my little this thing
here I think it's like little waves so
and I can open and close Martha Minow
like that the things that I do output
color is or it's they're going to add
some kind of green yellow like if you
work with web pack and you're going to
see your color in the terminal so I
think that's awesome tool tool so this
is my top five who I really need to add
each day after that whoo I think you
need to ask you it's a bad belly s6o bad
or es6
here now it just for help you to add
some kind of color schema for your code
if you write in es6 so example for me
i'm writing now in javascript double so
now if i just go on javascript example
react that getting changed up for battle
is better but
my my code can just detect the GS file
that's but the thing is that makes your
code much more syntax highlighting with
data because now I can just come back to
JavaScript plain because I have a set of
everything to be a JavaScript level by
default but if you down sometimes
something like this view air that don't
going to be the a good color or
something like that after that I have
color highlights so what do color I like
example it's it's full of you to to see
your color on the when you type some
color in see which color that give you
with the code so color are that this is
what they do is they just finally give
you some kind of color for your you code
so that work on CSS that's worked on
some JavaScript file here you can see
this is what they do so it's the FSO for
white if I type rare you're gonna see I
get real so I think this is just good
for for for C so this is this package
color highlight after that add editor
config so if you follow me on my story
on I always use editor configure this
one it's one circuit editor country yeah
this one it is our config for Visual
Studio code what I do it's that gonna
help you to keep all your project code
with the same kind of properties so
example you want to have space tab that
going to make everyone who use it
detergency
space tab but you don't need to change
that inside your own set up that do that
for you for free so you can add stuff
like like ear example haven't the
project we do inside the micro so where
we build a meetup app in the react
native and note you have my editor
config so here when I say it's I have an
Indian style of space in then size of to
I want to trim our white space and I
want to insert a new final newline
in so I really awesome project and that
word I think you have yet to in Adam and
sublime so just keep in touch with that
after that es limp so here yes then what
that do its that help you to find error
before you run your code so here example
add my category so in my tutorial I just
imported but I don't use it right now
and because my ESPN add is assigned a
value but never you so you can do some
kind of like that
if here I make it an error now I'm gonna
get some kind of of problems I mean
example here if I forget to if I forget
to think with the rest I'm gonna get
ready not define here if I remove the
semicolon missing semicolon I get this
because I have my own yes lien or C so
it's my instruction if you want to
download the one app it's on the in NPM
and the name is equal per I'm gonna pass
them I'm going to pass the link on the
the the description
it's a the for the one we know is that
if I'm using the Rd and you want with a
lot of other rules I could and I work
with es6 but as you can see that just so
powerful I mean you can that can really
help you to write code and ear load ear
my earth have a problem because of what
cuz I forget to add a bracket here and
that just a few cells on ear example if
I put name I'm going to get expected to
get a short end because you knowing the
XX you don't need to have a key value
the same like that so now I think that's
awesome so to have if you work on issues
download it is es thing right there
after that flow ID I don't have nothing
to show you but if you're using flow use
it back awesome - it's really fast and I
really like it so for the flow idea
nothing more to do than just install
fluidy
so it's
Flo Eddie this one it is called so Eddie
right there so if you see here in the
video you show you like a photo one Muno
all slow words it's just the the tool
tool so that just like as you to see
what it didn't define and or to complete
your stuff when you have all set up flow
and everything so maybe I'm going to
make a video about flow if people want
it so you can put it inside the
commentary if you want me to add this
kind of video after that get that this
one is awesome - so give it's the one so
now you don't going to see it because
I'm using a rainbow - but get its these
- this line here just for L pew to see
where you are in code so you see now I
get a red line so if I put you see I get
a real line right there so get it just
goes on vsauce2 dual code I didn't find
really out to get some kind of gear like
that so I just find this package so the
package is just geared to and this one
so that helped you to just get some kind
of line and just see your invitation
after that after indent Rimbaud so this
is a one who make my indentation with
some color like that I just like it
there it's just really quick in my eyes
to see so you see it's a yellow-green
where so it's much more easy for me so
for this one it's a rainbow in them and
then window this one right there and
because we are still in the rainbow I'm
going to show you window Gracia so what
people bracket do is they just put some
bracket color so if you see there you
just that make this rainbow color but
that just make your life easier to just
see which one is closing the other one
so here that if you can see like if I'm
open some room color now you see what
that do so you see the yellow is there
and the red and I think that just makes
your life easier again
so the name is Trimble bracket after
that add a jumpy so what do jumpy is
when you install it you can do shift
enter they give you some letter where
you can jump so if example I want to
jump here I just need to type d po Pipo
and now I'm here so for the one who came
with the end this is a it's something
similar with that and now I can do shift
enter if I want to join example here I
do e e I so like that so for the one we
don't like to use the mouse that's
something really awesome so the name for
that it's jump T right there after that
add the react native tool so I don't
really use this but I know people like
it so if I don't want my react native
project what you can do with that it's
do shift command T you do react net
react native and here you can example
put this to exponent command use
exponent I can every form a package or I
can run under it I can run on iOS and
it's what you can do for them and I
think you should work on react native
some I think it's a tool you need to
download and another one I really like
it might what a time so right there so
what I find what do it's that just
calculate time you put on your coat so
the only thing you need to do is install
what a time let's all work a time and
that you're going to need a code you're
going to put a code coming from the
website work a sign right there
so you just create your own project and
after that you can load for example you
I'm gonna look with my guitar I'm going
to see how much time you put on the code
and actually we're and you see your
language and section so you can see all
you use your time with your code so here
example I'm using my resource to do code
and all my project can
etc so donating you need to do is here
click on integration you're going to
search for going to search for one
support ID you go there and you're going
to find your ID so example for us it's
Visual Studio code you click there and
they show you what you need to do the
only thing you need to do there it's to
install this one and after that you
enter your API key inside and after that
everything is running each money when I
receive each week you're going to
receive what you did and like which
project you've done which the numbers
time which language you write how many
time you increase inside the daily
average and I think that's a good tool
to just get and get a metric of what you
do after that for my team so for my team
for my icon right there I'm using a
material item so material icon right
there so we just I think that just make
some good icon really easy to follow and
for JavaScript it's easy one the folder
when its open etc so I think that's a
good one to be a and for my color for
the one coming from Adam he looks like a
condor but this is that this is like a
myriad with and I'm on okay so the name
is Adam it's a one dark mono carry one
dark one mana kiting so if one mana can
team so this is this one one thing I can
show you with the Visual Studio code for
the one who never really use it it's
this one right there so you do shift
command T you type color and here you
get your color team so now you can
target each color team and see which one
you're live in real-time this is
something we often I mean in Adam when
we do that we need to reload and
we don't get if we want to just change
it and I think that the tool to have to
see in real time like that so mine one
it's one minute I like this after that
for the one who don't know because I set
up people some time when I is some
people to go if they don't use their
comment e what do come and see if they
let you to open file inside your your
project so here maybe in that this one
is not a really good is not really big
but this one example if I do come and P
and I start to type I want to get here I
want to open my route in my meter so if
I start at route I can see meetup so now
I can open it I mean it just faster then
you just faster than going here and
click on each file in if you want to
close a window just type can enter value
if you're on Mac and that open a window
like the through the window like this
after that some kind of stuff I see
people doing - if you want to search
inside your your file you can just do
come in air so here I can type route and
I get my route if I want to check
searching all my project I do shift
command F and now I can search on all my
project so now you can just get here and
see where you add them the word route
after that here in Visual Studio Co you
get you'll get so you can add so you see
you change like that and you can come
here to Iraq and cyber come in and see
example clean clean code so I'm going to
do comment enter so my Committee is done
so if I want to push a key here in the
Twitter and I can do push to and I'm
gonna do right now because I don't want
to add a lot of comment for this one but
you see what you can do after that
another good tool with this get here if
you can undo laughs come here you can
show get output so you get there and you
see everything you did so before so I
think that I
and awesome to do have with with this
and I know i Adam as one with get plus
with really awesome but this one give by
devil and if you get some kind of merge
problem you're going to see your program
right there
so after that I think this is almost
everything I want to show you or the
other one when you have some kind of
markdown bought downside you can just
click here with a little loop and
they're going to open that in a preview
so you can see what your markdown do
that's it if you want to open another
window on with your pseudo code if you
follow my gift set up because I'm using
a sublime kind of of keyboard I just do
a comment and I do the dis slash here so
for me it's just at the top of my enter
so if I do this I do comment that and
now that opened me a new and a new
window like that I think this is the the
one we use in Adam for closing the nav
bar but in Visual Studio code if you
want to close the nav bar if you follow
my setting on my gift you're gonna do
come and be come and be I can close my
elbow like that and as you can see
Visual Studio code is really faster than
Adam for me and my on my Mac and if you
build on top of electron cube but I
don't know but you faster and I really
like it so if you want to change example
your your your text font family
you can just do come in coma so that
open your setting one thing I really
like about Visual Studio code is here
you can search for your settings or if I
see a type from family I can see so now
I can just click here and if I click
there that going to copy paste here so
you see I'm using console app but if I
want to use the example of a razor mono
and just save the file so command s and
now I came back and now you see it's a
operator mono so now I can come back so
my editor tab side
everything is there so I'm going to just
remove that for now and this is what I'm
going to give you for my gift so what I
have it's so add my concise 216 and some
can try to excuse just to get my Jesus
you code faster because you have a code
alpha inside yo a activity meter
sitting on Mac and something I see my
code l / is just 2 - CPU I so I find
this kind of file out can exclude here
for mmm
so what do we met I'm sure a lot of
people know that you do Li you do time
so that tells you a lie for you if you
do ul and you do Li like them and now
you know kinda more like this and now
you type they're going to give you a ul
with a li and now if I want to do Li 10
times I do this and now I can do tab and
I get my li if you don't have the
setting I just have you cannot do this
in GSX
and I think that you need to have that
in jesús I mean if you always treat a
component view and you want to close it
you can just do it like that so I think
that's awesome tool plus if you create I
example a stylized CSS and you create
example body and you go there and you
want example a margin:10px you're going
to do M 10 you're going to tab
margin:10px if I want to in percentage
I'm going to do M Tempe and I'm going to
get more drinkin person like that and
this is all you can do a lot of stuff
like padding 5 and I mean this is why I
really like MMA and and I think I'm not
sure a mat come by default with with the
sauce you go
yeah yeah you come by default so again
it's awesome to to it so and so in my
package to what I have is
and exclu so when I search when I'm
running a command T I don't want to get
my known module in my iOS when I'm
running on the react native something
like that and after that here have side
trim training right 32 HTML suggests
extreme elf I so why I want my HTML
should yes me html5 stop I want to get
my npm intellisense gathered evidence
see to it
you want to get that if you want to your
npm a patentee listens to see you
package for example you have my
Airstream complete equal par with my
death if I don't that that I cannot do
like example yes in from equal per you
see it's at the difference in now so I
can get it after that which one it
should be good for you it's a terminal
integrate fun science so here it just
forgive me my font size of 13 nothing
too much here add a sink or to download
so therefore so for what I think the
thing it's the thing with more you can
you need to know here so I'm going to
just paste this one inside a gear so I'm
going to create it right with you yes so
I'm going to put that and I think that
can really help people sometimes you
just find some fittings so we're sitting
that JSON so I'm going to put everything
there so I'm going to send you this link
on my description so I hope you like
this little show of what you can do with
Visual Studio code and why I really
think this is an awesome tool I hope you
enjoy it and if you are any other
package you really like just asses in
the comments I'm good I can maybe add
some at the end of this video and try it
at the same time so I hope you enjoy and
take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
