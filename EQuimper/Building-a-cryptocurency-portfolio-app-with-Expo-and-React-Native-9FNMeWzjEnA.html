yeah
you
trade time is lucky so this is the tree
that stopped real one period seven
samba
I'm gonna go
so what I'm searching right now it's I
need to get their price at some time
because I need to build a graph here I
want to be like graph at the bottom
about your crypto so when you're gonna
to a touch example knee or something
like that you're gonna see if the graph
about our your asset moving the thing
about that it's thinking about this it's
I'm not sure if I can get so I need to
get like the data on this coin at
certain amount of time so I need to get
the data for example after because yeah
so here as you can see when I'm clicking
here I want to I'm good a daddy we said
I like a graphic it right there we're
gonna change with what you touch so era
the plan now
it's you came to your page you're gonna
see the whole thing only if this is an
old day so I'm gonna remove some of them
when you don't have an example after
that when you're gonna add the asset
right there and you're gonna see isn't
tell you well are you gonna get the
total the gains and again in percentage
maybe gonna put here a button about 24
hour a week a month extra Libra and now
after that here that's gonna be your
portfolio assets so example here I have
22 percent neo and now a 1 I'm gonna
click on that here I'm gonna get the
graphic right there the thing about the
graphic is I need to get data of what it
was at the certain amount of time but
I'm not sure where I can find this
because I don't want to get the bid so
that's going to be what I'm gonna search
for now and
and also I'm gonna need to search a SS a
new stuff for the cryptocurrencies I'm
gonna check example when when someone
example I had some Bitcoin I'm gonna put
here inside the notification all the
Bitcoin that's stuff you can get so I
maybe gonna change this icon to be like
a I heard or journal or something like
that thing it's so I'm using Quinn
Marquette coin market cap API one market
cap so I used this API will give you
this thing right there Oh
everything is green like and more KDP
Ike so even have a ticker global data
take care take care but my things I go
to HTTP slash grass that Quinn market
in the USA Bitcoin that's fun well I
think it's Q&amp;amp;C Oh Oh what we got okay
but what is this data market Kappa
available supply priced BDC price USD
volume price USD this is a date
price to USD in Christ BDC do this is a
timestamp so here a new date and I pass
the this value invalidate two things
hmm
surprise BTC and press USD 18 bucks 14
this is this thing neo eating box 14 so
that would be this thing right there
but here it was 55 bucks 13 29 bucks
29:27 no I think we are I need to go so
many data okay right there 13:18 20 to
15 this is and that must be a date new
date new date and delete Dave's it's a
timestamp I think times 10 to date
JavaScript converter you next time okay
so you need to put this with your time
but multiple by a thousand so that also
that give us Saturday August 7 in 49 Oh
so with it an invalid date
so here they do one so this is the graph
there so 17 May so that must be
something like that they give us access
so example Bitcoin
that don't make anything don't see how
can you read this thing
Oh
I think I'm gonna just design this
graphic at the bottom for now before
adding this value you just cuz I would
like to know what that's gonna look like
because it's not that don't make any
sense
yeah this is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
go to my wallet so here I put my
portfolio PI wrapper
I'm gonna quit another rapper called
wallet you have rapper and this one's
gonna have I of two fifty two the same
way it's finally gonna have the same
value of this thing yes actually maybe
create use the same value but the thing
is I'm not sure if from that going to
change oh man this Visual Studio code
sometime
okay so now what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna quit my company here and I'm gonna
say wallet graph what a currency oh it's
a what a graph I mean it's gonna be no
yeah I mean I can just reuse the same
graph so what a graph
oh really
and also I'm gonna connect this with I
don't need to connect that which we
don't because I can pass so here I'm
gonna say dear and I'm cord my wallet
graph I'm going to copy paste this I'm
gonna go there and pass my wallet right
there remove my T here and now I can
pass the team like I've done right there
team equal team if I want to get the
team maybe no you know looks like yeah
I'm gonna I'm gonna pass these two
things so team and the work team so I'm
gonna create my props here right here
I'm gonna get team I'm gonna get dark
team talk team it's going to be a
boolean
like this
now what I can see right there it's
gonna be a style with a background color
of you I'm gonna do structuring the team
I'm gonna say game that tab bar color
lookup okay so now I get my porn by the
thing it's so yeah I see something a
shoe shoe Don's gonna be I gonna need to
have a scroll view you're gonna be a
style of scroll view and this one I'm
gonna put it right there who's gonna get
my tea wrapper
like now
now I can scroll this thing so this
thing still work
I mean maybe I should put the other two
so
what I'm gonna do - its I'm gonna say
now add some attribute content and I
never know I'll never remember this
school you
we are native and this is content
container style so here I can see
padding button I'm gonna suggest them so
now you see I can have some space right
there but I think I should go with five
so you're gonna keep all the same size
everywhere
be good no these things still work
you
yes or no
I mean if
I don't really need this kind of stuff
hey buddy are you
object the substring of t is on the five
loops you see when I have ad oh yeah
time to go
you see I had this I follow like a
tutorial about d3 and the guys did like
almost the same I just change it a bit
and I think that was like what I need
for this application it just like I wait
throughout the wallet AV cache yes I use
really in this one I need to learn it
for one client in the next month so now
I want to have like he did ear hi
graphic right there about so like you
have done this is for face and it's your
face in the group I think yeah that's
pretty all that work surface and group
and I or the only thing you need to do
after right path surface here
and you close it with you group
and now I can import my name shape
what is this but doing
sorry Rakesh you can be taifa I just
removed the but I thought my butt go all
this crazy it's not me
so you see y1 and me and d tweets not
and that data okay so I think I'm gonna
just copy is function just to get
something quick I'm gonna need to manage
you did a really good job with know this
is something I'm gonna add like I've
long believed for building this
application this is what I've set up and
but I mean I I kind of start to like
really a lot now
okay I see what you've done I'm gonna
stay here
graph history data this graph if story
data
oh no problem
I'm going to fix some props cons that I
hear
in abbien every of gonna be an array of
year ear you need I hope all that gonna
work it's date who's gonna be date and
it's gonna be an amount it's gonna be a
number and all your talk instead of that
Harry from Lent when I say give me 20
the map what I'm gonna say
with nothing here but the index and I'm
gonna say return no return
I mean I yeah
well can I say that
I think if I did like that now divide by
a thousand multiple not divided but my
name is a thousand multiple by the index
yeah and a Mont it's gonna be I don't
know like twenty multiple by the index
and I can see
inspect it - okay and 36 -
there are props oops
type
think this one's gonna work
okay so now I'm back here and now I can
say this that for the data right there
and I mean now I can just copy down so
now get here take that approps it data
do this just for now
since that props that worked
we're an even shape oops yeah so here
that's going to be D equal this is the
three area yeah I know it's not a
function let me
so here that need to be to function so
what I've done here it creates some x
value
and a y-value where you get one item get
one item and an index was going to be a
number
really are you in the trainer even
so now add anything you need to do
it's another function who's gonna call
this is that a y-value oh okay I see
you
oh yeah eat em that amount
I'm fine area D Trish on the frame data
that land
undefined area that Shrieve create 51:36
so there's that grab the data
you
what
I don't need anymore
oh because I found a tutorial where
someone did that and I mean he that was
in same time for all about learning
these projects I just don't see why I
get nothing
I think this thing it's cause of this
and now I just do
and this thing it's X and y-axis
oh we have something here we have
something here but do you like this
effect even like this
so now this is not the binding here
now I lose my
and I want that
this meeting the problem is this oh yeah
yeah okay we create a date year and
month
month
and I like that
met that flower return a number I'm good
new date oops
a monk
what
we just met
so we know all that work but this thing
is working my looping is good so now I
go to my waters graph
that don't really change my yesterday if
I hear so I really work
that's gonna change but this is what
you've done in it and I'm not that
cunning indeed
and that don't change nothing
I mean things that supposed to be Jenna
she good
drop study calligraphy scrub daddy so
aronow need call to bind this ear I
don't need that it's done okay so this
thing we know after that X&amp;amp;Y I mean they
are okay can we just put Fondren and
further and now item that amount X Y
value was gonna be the top
and I mean how what I can maybe change
its this thing change the day to just be
and say that's gonna be a number
maybe the number are just too big that's
one value of what I've put here
you
Oh
Oh
yes
they're small ear
what for you by unselect Oh
oh I can call I can conceal all this
more just for now
you
and the Phoenix not an object type 2
ampere
we'll see these colors what I mean it
will be yet get get color is gonna be
dysfunction that's going to return a
string and this thing is going to be
this thing now can remove that now can
call this that get color like that
so now this color inside the port for
you pi color it's gonna be a string and
now I can say is that crap that color do
that for that color and this is that
from the cover
who should ask me oh okay okay yes is
something so I think for now I can keep
it like that okay yeah because this this
wouldn't need a Turnitin deck that's why
I got this kind of stuff but now okay
about the width of this thing what I'm
gonna do is this graph you're gonna
receive a props coming in from this
index right there so now I'm gonna run
this and now what I'm gonna do here is
I'm gonna import from react net scene
oops an import dimension I'm gonna get
I'm gonna get the width of my screen so
I'm going to seconds with with equal
dimension that yet so if you don't know
what I do with my width right there with
wit it just I finally just recall this
variable width so and now what I can say
it's my port for you
pi I know my that have a width here
equal to width like that and now if I go
to my wall at graph and I'm gonna
receive a width who's going to be a
number what I can see now it's this fond
red is gonna be equal to this that props
with and for the eye it's gonna be this
that props that weight divided by two
okay so now we get this point but now
this 152
you
so the X it's left right
all I'm gonna just sit down now maybe
not just five I want to have some five
space or if I say five okay you have
five but now here I have ten that's the
problem
so all can I fix that it's by seeing my
width it's gonna be that
No yeah this thing's gonna be under the
top I'm gonna keep it like that for now
oh I mean it's pretty Santeria
I don't need this to thing I think now
this thing everything is green thing and
inside light mode when you think of this
event maybe the only thing I can maybe
add ear will be like the icon right
there maybe I don't know but now this
thing is to be inside my index where I
say what I do we have rapper I see 250
then ISO 200
thank you so gonna be I gonna mount up
though yeah
I think I'm gonna maybe need to do is to
put the date here but that's gonna be
another one but now they are fake data
for that this get color get color
 short for chart I mean I can
create that inside the L / you'd see L /
get color photograph for wallet graph
yes this one I'm gonna have the flow I'm
gonna take this function and I'm gonna
export it I'm gonna import this a Freddy
tell you baby in porn constant P chart
constant
like that
here we know that's gonna return a
string for sure and I can maybe write
some tests for this one but not what I'm
gonna do
it's inside this one I can now import
I call that get colorful what
so now what i can just do to change this
one here now I can remove this coal
now the only thing you can maybe see
from here will be to just sort this
thing in order of but I think I'm not
sure but I think sort
it's a mutable thing if I say every
that's or immutable JavaScript
okay so I can just do this so dad I
don't map what I'm gonna say see I'm
gonna happen I do this
okay what I can maybe sit that I and see
this thing it's gonna be a an empty
array and inside the component in mouth
I can call a function called is that
sort data whose this one's gonna be
right there sort data this one was gonna
do you're gonna return that data
sort and I think how you do this
okay no you have a and B a minus B that
number like that
so now
Conte knew that equal now I can say is
that such side that are equal new data
and now he reckons they stayed gonna be
equal they're going to be equal a data
and now
and so we cannot worry but now it's the
the inverse so I think that will be plus
alone that will be just be number minus
a number
yeah but now this thing don't make sense
that out I didn't look at here this
graph 42 percent don't worry it's not so
where I see our data or these that state
that data now I make more sense
what do you think of this
yes listen yeah Maui
hmm
when I remove the - 20 year
no I'm gonna make surely need its I need
to have this like almost in the center
and I think the size was 209 is 100 it's
too much
so 50
so I'm gonna stop for tonight I'm gonna
go and record the new video for the
channel I hope you enjoyed this
livestream so we're gonna talk later
have a good night everyone and good
weekend
