hello
can you Amy sorry it's my first time I'm
live-streaming on you too so
lol oh hey oh are you everyone
perfect yeah it's it's the first time
I'm like reading for like I'm almost a
year so oh can you see the screen at the
top right I just need to do some setup
okay
yeah this is what I think I think what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just do
something else
thank you
I'm gonna go this way and I'm gonna go
with
perfect I think and again yes I'm
building a small little project just a
side project it's gonna be a portfolio
kind of app for all the crypto currency
like Bitcoin it I run and stuff like
that just because I have some money
there and I just want to have a place
where I can see my profit and everything
so so I'm gonna still use react and
redux and that's gonna be a full step
application so so for now the thing I've
bill it's like I just start almost like
20 minutes ago so I just really setup
the basic of the application I just put
like the navbar I just put the cars
right now and I'm just working on this
thing so I'm gonna just do some UI today
and tomorrow I'm gonna surely streaming
again I'm gonna start to build an OGS
part so here that only thing I've done
right now it's - I've set up the
portfolio page and I just set up
everything with a creative react app and
I've put my navbar and my sign up page
excetera so the thing is I don't want to
touch with the signup and everything I
just want to concentrate myself today
about this kind of card so what I want
to do for this page it's gonna be when
you look at your portfolio its I think
what I want to do it's to show each
Queen you have inside a cards and when
you click on them I'm gonna show a d3 d3
oh you said that like graph where I can
see like your profit and everything and
I want to have a tea chart in the top
left here where you can see how many
percentage of one of the scripto you
have in your portfolio so this is the
thing
ever really use its detorri so that's
gonna be a good learning for me long
time didn't use yeah short thank you
long time I didn't use the web I just
want to see yeah thing like a chore like
that
Detra basic or digital term so this
thing gonna okay so this thing finally I
just think it's overlap and you get some
tooltip okay he's the same same thing
you just you have tool tips okay yeah so
I think I'm gonna go with that hope is
going to be pretty easy so in the
instruction
between a Sikh I think I think that can
be easy to change so if you have
questions you can always ask me I mean I
think I have like a 10 second delay so
that may be why I'm done responding
quickly but yeah it's it's that sorry
it's my first time so it's not that
surely don't gonna be the the the the
best one but the thing I don't like
about this library is this thing first
thing we see out update.last Camille was
a year ago yeah so for me it's almost a
no-go for them I don't like to work with
kind of library where you they don't put
their time oh yeah I think I have used
this thing one one day rechart yeah I
think this one can be pretty good and I
think they have they have my P chart
yeah tool a two-level picture oh if you
look at this thing I think that the
designer start to be a bit better so
you're really think that can be perfect
yeah this is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
just play with oh I'm gonna set up this
thing
one second
I just don't understand sometimes why my
now if I get my sketch yeah perfect
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just
do a bit of design in sketch because I
have no idea about I want to sit down
like acting about this thing like get a
diesel so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
just just one see where desktop this is
my page so I have my novels gonna be
just really a quick yeah setup so I find
a ball like that so what I want it's I
think I want my chart to be right there
and after that maybe I'm gonna want to
put some news here so I'm gonna put news
what do you mean what this for program I
it's for just for mock-ups its sketch oh
yeah my side project its I build a
portfolio tracking app for my
cryptocurrency not increasing just for
its for myself but in some time gonna
make it available for everyone so yeah
that's gonna use the technology I always
use like an OG s and yeah this is sketch
oh yeah so yeah yeah I'm gonna just have
my news and I think what I'm gonna do
so I'm gonna maybe just say here I'm
gonna have my cards yeah so that's gonna
be like the main page yes I'm this thing
in crypto so that's gonna be my main
page here where I'm gonna have like my
cards and when I maybe one like it's 12
like 3
side by side like that and now after
that I can just have like this something
like that I think if I do something like
this and now maybe ear I can have like a
button and I'm gonna maybe just say load
more because when I'm like I mean it's
not everyone we're gonna have like more
than six crypto so if you have more I'm
gonna just put this one riding South
right inside himself why my this like
that boom dad after that I'm gonna just
put some radius yeah yeah I never use a
dough Adobe like I mean I paid this
thing like 90 bucks and now I'm using
death every time and I'm on Mac so I can
make use of this one so what do you
think about that I think that can yeah
so here that's going to be the card so
ear example if we look at if we look at
example I don't know if you know a bit
about more about cryptocurrency but you
have more than one good - you have like
Bitcoin you have veteran so example for
me I've investment Bitcoin at everyone I
have some IATA at Neil and I have risk
and so so this is what I wanted so I
want to keep track of the one ad ads so
if I go to my sketch each of my cards
gonna be the one with the logo so
example if we look at the page I've
right now all we do is put the logos at
a room so yeah I think that's gonna be
something like that oh yeah you you you
look that too
yeah oh yeah I know at least it's crazy
and I like risk and III mean risk it's
awesome for the JavaScript developer too
so yeah I think this is what I'm gonna
do
oh I'm gonna set up this thing
just like I mean I've used like 70 while
almost like a 10 month ago and they very
reused a web almost so they must have
layout I think oh yeah given yeah that's
gonna be crazy so all the grid work here
I think they have row yeah so they have
row so we can just take the grids I'm
gonna go to my portfolio page I'm gonna
import from sim at 6 UI react yeah after
that I'm gonna have a grid here and now
you see how much : so I think they work
with the okay right okay you just say
how many so
hello-hello writer by the refers a bit
less today maybe - she knows in the me
up Sally Sally
sorry by my brother just call me so
Cullen so from what I've seen looks like
you asked on my new column you want but
this is really not something I want
because so here you see three columns
okay
I broke in yeah I think this is what I'm
gonna do it's because I want to have
like that side boss or if we look here I
want to separate these things so my I
think I'm gonna just do this in Flex box
that's gonna be pretty much easy yeah I
think this is what I'm gonna do it
something I'm gonna do some flex books
so so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
import a star component and I'm gonna
say accounts I don't know like left side
I can't container yeah rapper is maybe
better and I'm gonna say this play Flex
I'm gonna say Flex one gonna take the
fullscreen
yes yeah I didn't take time to check CSS
grid oh yeah I'm sure it's awesome just
like I didn't I didn't touch the whip up
a bit of more time so what I think I'm
maybe gonna do it's tomorrow I'm gonna
maybe just refactoring this thing in CSS
built just because like I know flexbox
much more and I just want to make sure
like first thing you work so this is
this place yeah perfect work so what I'm
gonna do
it's so I think in react native the
color it's current by default and in the
web it's row so we good so yeah I'm
gonna say left wrapper equal style style
that div and I'm gonna say I want him to
take maybe what 40% and gonna add a
display flex so my left side is going to
be there and just for testing this one
I'm gonna just put my h1 inside this
thing and for the right wrapper I'm
gonna say take the other space so I'm
gonna sit take the Flex one and we're
gonna say display flex and right wrapper
gonna go there
yeah kind of death so you wish so what
I'm gonna do
yeah so we had an in talk real about
that it's what I'm gonna do it when you
enter to the website you're gonna like
sign up you're gonna create a number of
portfolio you want maybe you want to
just test one port for you and see me
all much this one gonna make money or
you want to make your real one so
example if I create my real one I'm
gonna add up inside the portfolio page
I'm gonna say add Cuenco you're gonna
click on this thing and you're gonna see
I want to add example Bitcoin so you're
going to add Bitcoin and you're gonna
enter the price as you feel like I mean
I don't want you to like to connect with
your icon I don't want to rock with the
security but for showing the life
graphing everything I'm gonna plug with
the API for getting the the update of
the the price so what I want to do it's
example if you say I paid to a Bitcoin
so I put 10,000 bucks I put two Bitcoin
at 10,000 bucks and now the boat give of
you like 11,000 I'm gonna say you're in
profile a profit of one thousand for
this week example and I'm gonna put that
like other Quinn Marquette stuff like
example here when you click on one of
the thing they always show like one day
one day seven day a month three month a
year so this is what I want to do too
and I'm gonna make that with that day
I'm gonna try to do the most I mean this
project just gave me in my air like a 1
hour and a half ago so so surely Don's
gonna be the most awesome and I'm not a
designer so I'm gonna just really check
here
I think this is the one I won here so
what I'm gonna do first thing I think I
need to install this library so this is
V chart but it's a yarn add we chart
chart is with C or C maybe I'm gonna go
to the github I always look at the dark
yeah I'm not sure about that yeah I was
thinking about like maybe like use kind
of other language for doing the
mathematical if I have too much to do
because I know JavaScript is not is the
best thing to do with this but if I can
use some JavaScript library for this I'm
gonna make use of this I'm gonna add a
chart after that I just want to have
like a really simple design for this
page here so I'm gonna just in for P
chart from with chart
okay so this is all that work okay so
it's really simple it's really simple
thing you need to do so I'm gonna put
that so we're gonna unfortunately P and
we need tool tip and after that I need
some data some for now I'm gonna just
copy paste what they have just forget at
least some you know do this like this
and now if I go to so I like the
animation of this one but this one don't
do because I put is animation actives so
if I so I think by default they have
animation so that's why yeah okay I like
this first thing I want a new one
PI and no Chris it's the first time I
did yet this is the first time I hope
you're gonna enjoy yeah boom and p.m. PI
oh oh yeah PI chill
so you mean
must be this one I think okay so you
have access to I pythons career
oh really good thank you rust so thank
you I'm gonna cover this one I'm good
luck so one sec I'm gonna just learn pie
fight on yeah thank you
so I think that's gonna be what I'm
gonna do tomorrow so now here this one
you like more green or purple oh yeah
nice yeah I was thinking about using
golang because the other language I know
which it's going so wrong nice nice you
really save me here so the latter nice
so here so ear six must be the wit so I
think 300 300
yeah I think I'm good I like more this
one but I'm gonna just change so what I
think peach are okay so here you put a
sideswipe and you see six okay so this
is 300 from the x-axis and 300 so if we
have like F - yeah it's like thing if I
go this we're gonna get the center so I
know when I know that mean you must add
a styling or I can put a background
color of real okay so this is what I
think so if I want to put this thing in
the middle first thing I don't like the
width it's too much so I hope I can
maybe put a width so I'm inside my
parents so I just want to get 100% of my
parent so I'm inside but what I can so
they don't like percentage
responsive container must be this Thai
responsive oh wow so you wrap nice so
you import responsive container and you
wrap your p-chart with this and after
that from what I've seen looks like you
can remove your island with and now
you're gonna follow yeah
but now what happened it's my flexbox my
flex bugs by default it take the row so
here what I want is my flex direction to
become columns so if I do this now my
portfolio page ears or the title and
these things gonna be maybe not so what
I can use the ready key okay
so I need to change that directly no I
don't think in this thing okay short
you don't have a lot of coming
so they saved a turkey but they made me
B value key where you keep here inside
the P the key of each sector ok so what
I think they happen it's they want this
name but I mean this thing don't make my
hot dog vendors I'm gonna keep it for
now I don't want to have 6c why I think
if I don't do this you're gonna stay in
the middle yeah no I've like that now
what happen here
oops too much too much react native yeah
perfect oh oh boy
okay so look like I'm gonna have to oh
thank you Chris yeah sorry yeah I've
learned English for learning to code so
but yeah thank you so I need to say that
oh yeah so now the picture here so what
I think is the responsive container
don't gonna stop so I can sit oh yeah
good idea
so you can just put that I'd here so
what I want it's this thing I don't want
to be more than like 50% of the page so
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to go
there and I'm gonna say I of 50% and I'm
gonna run prettier now if I do this yeah
maybe if I say 100% oops
so 100% finally I think and stop there
no yeah so maybe what is better is just
to put a real light like I think 400px
can be good oh yeah because it's a
number
yeah perfect we stop here I mean it's
not a design so I'm gonna remove the
rails at least this thing is really bad
so now I have data perfect so I'm gonna
have this portfolio page gonna change to
the name of the portfolio so maybe like
a my portfolio like that after that what
I want at the bottom here it's like
where I'm gonna put the news so what I
can see for the news it's what I want to
do is I want to scrape a Kuenn desk or
something like that will give some news
about cryptocurrency and what I want it
I'm gonna check for news about the
crypto you have saving this portfolio so
you have a save example Bitcoin and at
around only you just gotta get this news
about this too so that's why I want to
add the new so I'm gonna put that right
there
so inside my left wrapper time I left
wrapper gonna say cons news wrapper
equal a style of deal and this one just
for now I'm gonna say a 500 px of
it--and I'm gonna see a background color
of of f EF e FB I think maybe not if C -
C - just a bit darker and I'm gonna put
that right after my picture just like
that I just want to get that there
square at the place so this thing so 500
is too much I'm gonna say fondue it
yeah just for now you're gonna be good
there I said that I don't like this
thing so I'm gonna change that so this
thing and what I'm gonna do with my
cards so what I've done is I've created
component where I put my card is right
there and my card I think what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna stick on C equals style
four cards and what I'm gonna do right
there I'm gonna say and right of three
hundred and my image I'm going to see
150 you know too much 100 yeah so that
turn now it's gonna be there yeah
prove I think that's a good size but
what is this weird thing so I have my
right wrapper what I'm gonna say it so
I'm gonna say just a file contain well
as his face all wrong
yeah so if I do this I'm gonna get space
between each of them but what happened
here oh I know why it's because this No
oh I'm not and then do a developer mean
I do react native but I don't do a
anyway
Nancy what is that Oh boom I have some
margin here so what I'm gonna do so I'm
gonna go to court and I'm gonna say
margin:0 I I need to see pay tithing
yeah
beeps what
you want a card
you weren't a corn
you are that Corso I just think what I
can do like you are in that car margin:0
looks like this thing I've work so I'm
gonna just remove it from my portfolio
here ate when I don't have my control so
now I've like that maybe you're gonna
have three other one so I'm gonna have
six now I have too much so what I need
to do so if I remember in flexbox what I
need to mine H it's my right rapper I'm
gonna have nailing items Affleck start
and I'm gonna say flexwrap equal rap I
think this is what I need to do kind of
okay yeah so this is what I pen it's
because I can enter three there I can't
talk for that's why so what I'm gonna do
it's because I take the full widow I'm
gonna say with of 80% of my parent and
I'm gonna just say a line self-center so
I don't gonna be in the left of you
okay no my lines have came here
hey John yes I'm building a portfolio
tracker for cryptocurrency because I've
started to investing in that and so what
I need to do it's what you're gonna
create your portfolio and you're gonna
have like all your Quinn ear which you
port for you there and then you're gonna
have your news and when you click on the
one of your Quinn you can get to a graph
and yeah just something really quick
eyes think about that like this today
and I just want you to build this thing
really quick so what I think I'm gonna
do so you have my write proper and I'm
gonna say Concord rapper I'm gonna see
this one David dear this one's gonna
have a width of this have the display
flex after that you're gonna have all
this thing and now this one I'm gonna
say just a thing
Center my cat my card rapper gonna juice
wrap these two thing yeah true say you
work now so now I have just too much
space between all of them but I maybe
know why it's because my right rapper
really good to put back on color
yes rechart so why
what I'm gonna say it's my height of
this thing it's going to be only 80% of
is Peron like this
yeah and I may be gonna put some padding
top ear off ten just because I don't
like when he almost touched yeah I may
be better to put that inside my card
wrapper
so
oh you know what if I do this I'm gonna
get it right in the middle and now I'm
gonna just can put like my little more
ear so this is the only thing I need to
do for the design after that I'm gonna
start to do some data and some logic 8
when I need to do too much you why so
the only thing I need to build it's a
button so just because I'm too lazy for
not to create a long think I'm gonna
take one from myself button some more
yeah and they have yeah this one's
pretty the one I want so it's a button
right from somatic you are react and
after that you say primary I think I
like more secondary so I'm gonna go
there I'm gonna do right there and I'm
gonna say load more so that's going to
all that's going to be there only if you
have more than 6 cryptocurrency inside
this one so now what - it's my riot
right rapper is flex direction row so we
can change that by doing Collin
so now my LUMO is going to be at the
bottom yeah it's pretty much what I want
so yeah like this like that maybe I can
just utter radius what I mean other
radius P other it is
see if I want to another ayat and I wit
because right now it's really small
Detroit the ID of a child so the child
can have a genuine and a wit of channel
well
not sure about this something I can
check later so now this the only thing
it's error so what I should have done
it's my rapper ear I think I can do this
with padding I can say padding:0 from
the top ten from the right zero from the
bottom ten so I think I can just do this
yeah perfect
now it's a bit less squared
think of portfolio that have the news
rapper I think I can just create a
company called news portfolio news I'm
gonna cook them gonna just take the
first rapper for now
after that I'm gonna just need that and
I'm gonna see so this new rapper I think
I'm gonna create that as a class because
the thing is this one's gonna be connect
so I'm gonna show you use graph QL for
that with Apollo it's gonna be easier to
get a real-time updates over here this
one's gonna be like that a component
because I'm gonna need to do some kind
of logic because this one gonna be this
component is going to be plugged to my
PI and get real-time update inside news
about the crypto you have entire so I'm
gonna just use a wrapper like this and
now I think I'm gonna just put like
maybe like maybe not a each one's too
big but like at each force and use your
news just for now and yeah like this and
now I can just take it like that
let's aportfolio news and now I'm gonna
just change my news wrapper for that and
I can remove this so now if I go so your
news yeah perfect so now this one's
gonna be his own component these things
Shirley is gonna be his own continent so
I must portfolio chart portfolio pie
chart because I'm gonna maybe have more
than just take this thing again this one
I'm going to plug this one with
now
and now I'm gonna just take the name I'm
gonna go there boom like that boom boom
like this and now finally right there
picture for
oh yeah it's really easy John like you
just plug yeah I'm using Apollo and you
just plug subscription with that and
they're gonna do the job for you you
just need to do like kind of that pop so
the pattern in your server to make it
work and you just subscribe to it and
your front end so yeah I think I'm gonna
go with that yeah so nothing crazy so
this is what I've done so yeah so when
you're gonna jump on your portfolio
gonna have done all your time now when I
want it's when I'm gonna click on which
one of them I'm gonna get once what I'm
maybe gonna do
yeah
this is what I'm gonna do it's I think
yeah I'm gonna take this so when I click
on one of them when I click on one of
the crypto what I want it's pretty
simple it's a maybe gonna take this
thing and keep this thing here but when
you click on one of the crypto now I'm
gonna have a big graph on this one
so this thing is gonna be their graph
about the one you use and I'm gonna make
it the graph working so I think I've see
which art they have thinking I've see
that in the example the other yeah like
this like you can so this were my user
can say I want to see that for like the
past three months we can just take like
Oh many month and maybe I'm gonna put
like a selector we're gonna say Oh take
it is a week and not in a month yeah I
think this is the thing I'm gonna do so
now I can just set up them I like when I
just do they're like really big design
really basic designs of this work and
rusa so what I wanted see if I click on
that so portfolio card I think my
portfolio card is connect with react
router but for your card have no
connection with react router so what I
can do
what I can do itself
I think it's gonna be easier to do this
from the chart so the chart
I've access to the router no but I can
make it access I'm gonna see import with
route are from react retard um I'm gonna
see with Rutter here and now I'm gonna
say go to coin and I'm gonna say I need
to have the coin so I'm gonna traps that
history the push and I'm gonna say
portfolio I think if I do this I just
add I'm gonna sequin like that
and now oh I'm nothing the good place
sorry I'm really not at the good place
sorry about this it's that at this point
it's my portfolio page and this one is
connect with the rather I'm sure but for
you pager is connect with the router so
I don't need so ear I can create my go
to Quinn and now what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna sit on I'm gonna say go to and
I'm gonna say this one when I'm gonna
click on this thing I'm gonna say you go
to and just because I know they all I
think imma get typos at the ROM it's
good I'm really bad in so this is what
I'm gonna do and now because I want to
I read that from I want to just fake
because now it's really good assailant
of 6 and I'm gonna see that map and I'm
gonna say take this one and inside my
map my first argument I don't want it
but I want the index and I'm gonna say
key I why I did that every from this one
gonna create I'm gonna create an aviary
with six for the length and now in my
portfolio card I'm gonna just go to and
what I'm gonna say it spawn click go to
so everything's still work but now you
see I can now click and do nothing
push straight oh yeah because I didn't
create the route
Lucia will use the car
the thing is do I really need to I can
just click on this one and maybe use if
I click on this one like right now I
don't think that's the it's I don't
maybe you want to open another screen
cousin right now you see like that don't
make sense because I'm already there and
maybe the only thing I need to do
finally it's when I click on that I'm
gonna I all of them and I'm gonna show
my I think that's the best idea about
this yeah yeah really good idea so all
we can manage this I'm gonna just set up
that we stayed and I'm gonna say
I'm gonna search show coin who's gonna
be near by default when I'm gonna click
on quantum dongle I said ok I'm gonna
click I'm gonna say show coin I'm gonna
take that coin and you're gonna place
that set state show coin with the coin
after that here what I'm gonna do
it's if show coin it's no I'm gonna show
the thing I've right now else so now I'm
gonna show a low world hello and I'm
gonna just pass the coin I'm supposed to
world light so I'm gonna say it is that
state that show coil so now I'm gonna
just change this show coins gonna be at
around like thats what's gonna be the
name of the coin that's and this thing
is that state yeah I think that's the
best idea
so now if I click on one yeah arrow it
around yeah but if I don't if I do this
I don't want to show anymore this button
ok yeah so is that our for me if I step
this thing one step further like that
and now I take this one oh boy it's
better for me for yeah better for me if
I remove this remove that remove this
take it cool there
take everything out from the red wrapper
because you need one pound and now I can
say my yellow right there because I
don't want my button a little more in
the other page so now I can say it I
wrong and I get L wait around but I can
still use the card wrapper because the
code wrapper gonna give me the design I
want like that
yeah so now anything it's how I can go
back I'm gonna just put
can just put like something really
simple like that where I can have enough
like I don't know that kind of an arrow
yeah so I think I can just do this with
icon and I think somatic UI give us icon
so they must have back arrow while they
are there I will left so oh you do this
you say I don't you say icon and you put
on you know
please easy icon and here I'm gonna just
say icon with the name of our left
that's it so when I click on one gonna
get this thing it's really small size I
want it to be huge
so you
maybe a change finally just be but this
one I want it to be a button so they
must show how to do I can border
circular yeah but I mean it's not I
think I can just add a unclick unclick
and this thing is gonna juice reset corn
yeah good
this icon you're gonna take the icon you
know you say that now you say that to
have or change button to go back oh yeah
that's a good idea
I think I like more this way I'm gonna
take this button I'm gonna put that
there I'm gonna say it back and I'm
gonna sleep on click it this that we set
boom back yeah that's going to be
perfect for this so we're gonna see a
terror arm so just for see if my thing
is working I'm gonna create an array
here of name I'm gonna say Bitcoin I'm
gonna say name I'm gonna say IATA same
name ripple name list name I'm gonna say
it around this is the only one I cannot
type I don't know why and I'm gonna say
name hey I want just six because of my
design so the corner to ripple it oh I
have some new too so
a cursor:pointer yet thank you
sometimes so now if I click on this one
this key and now because now I can just
read the item name and I'm gonna go to
portfolio car and now here I can just
say there's that problem name and I
crash everything and I get cannot be
props oh it's a function yeah
so I'm gonna need to go because I have
something tonight yeah yeah I this is
what I was looking at so I'm gonna come
in back tonight later I just need to go
and eat some food and almost passing out
