just do a quick tip and tricks about the
structuring so this is a small series
where I'm going to just show some tips
and tricks and really a small video and
so we're going to start so the
structuring I think it's a really
powerful tool and that's why I want to
show you and I use it a lot in my
tutorial so so I'm going to start so
just for be sure I'm going to just show
you a pretty log it's really simple it's
just an L PI where I'm going to just use
an stringify my logs and make it better
I'm using webpack for using ìletís es6
stuff and nothing more
i've already set up some basic stuff to
make me able to teach you faster so here
we're gonna do the basic object so first
thing we're gonna just structuring an
object so when I talk about this for
terrain gonna see why this is really
powerful
it because like we all know in
JavaScript when we want example to say I
want to get the name of my user I'm
gonna do something like username so now
if I run that inside my common line here
I get my name so a manual yeah so we all
know that but with the structuring we
can make your life easier so here what
I'm going to do if I'm gonna do Khan I'm
going to take name equal user if I do
this now after that I can do pretty low
and I'm going to put the name if I do
this now I run my code I get the same
thing
so now name become a valuable so finally
you take all this variable coming in
from the object but you must be sure
this variable is the same name ear
again you can do this with other stuff
you want to have the location you can
load the location too and look here I
get the location who it's an object and
this is everything so you can do this
with everything
also you can destructuring one step
further I can just return my state
so here example then I remove that and
I'm going to say in time allocation give
me my stick if I do this and I
console.log state now you're gonna see I
get codec so it's perfect but now what
happen if I try to load location you're
going to see here the location is not
good now because this is not location
with the structuring it take so you need
to keep that in mind it when you
disappearing again establish a further
then that make where your other step not
working perfect so here after that we're
going to jump on the disappearing object
which we named so here I'm going to do
again current name equal user but empt I
want to change that to be first name and
I'm going to make use of the uppercase
so is that's going to be first name and
here now if I load this one
look what gonna happen it's still
working
now first name become the voluble of
this destructuring method here so that
can be really awesome to just change
some names so maybe like you're going to
get that you're going to receive
something coming example for the backend
in the front-end and you want to just
change the variable name so you can do
something like that and you don't need
to put it inside uppercase if I want I
can make it lower case and they're going
to still work so just for showing you
I'm going to say and I'm going to rerun
end up work again
so that was the object with me name
after that here I'm going to show you
the rest the rest is something awesome
I'm gonna have a video about rest and
prepare return so the 3d culture in next
week on one one but this one it we all
some here I am gonna do current example
name dot coma I'm going to say dot dot
dot and I'm going to call that risk you
don't even need to put the name rest ear
you can give it the name you want come
on I can give it a dirt everything but
now if I lock this thing and I log rest
what you think will happen if you say
that going to take everything out after
name you have to so rare
take everything after the variable you
have already destructuring so if I put
nothing that going to give me everything
if I put name
location like that that going to give me
only profession so the rare mean you
keep finally that's what I mean
we call that res it you take all the
other part so so this part was about the
object so as you can see that can make
your life so much easier after that and
this is a really powerful tool so time
to jump on the array so now here we have
an array so I called an amount so if we
had a dog Katherine fish so a basic
array so it all you can just stop
turning an intern an airy it by open
square bracket and I'm going to call my
first animal animal one so you can give
the name you want
so you we don't have renamed in in re
because you give it the name already you
want and I'm going to say anymore
so the my array right there now if I log
my animal one took what gonna happen and
I'm gonna just get my first one here if
I want to get my animal to example I can
give it that or maybe I'm going to call
this one already cap because we know
that's going to be a cap I'm gonna call
cap and I'm going to receive again the
same thing so this is the word you can
basically basically a disappearing
inside an array
after that every with default so I'm
going to show you after that in with an
object or you can add D sold with the
function but with an area to you can add
default function so what I mean is if
this stuff is from define or noodle
you're going to add default value so it
work and I'm going to do if we have tree
any model so I'm going to say dog cap
fish and I'm going to say ear maybe like
a beard and I'm going to say equal to I
don't know like a name so done something
like that and I'm gonna say animal now
bear we know we have nothing but if I
pretty log this thing and I pretty log
my bird like that I'm gonna get
oh I get an arrow because we have cat
already sorry
so I'm going to change this one to be
anymore - yeah
so now if I run that I get done so I get
a default value of the bird but example
if I came here and I create a bird like
that and two legs and now I do the same
thing now I'm gonna get my bird so
finally if I have something I get my
thing
five-nothing I get John here so you can
set up default value so this thing is
working so now we got a germ with every
and ignore so here what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna say current and I don't want
to have the dog I only want to have the
cap but I don't want to give a name
their dog because like I mean we don't
have infinite name in the mind so here
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to just
put the coma so here I ignore something
and I'm going to see an example I'm
going to call that so I'm gonna just
comment on this one for now I'm gonna
say cap and I'm gonna say anymore
and now if I log my cap
Oh Logan I'm going to receive
myself because I think no one maybe
you'll kept going to be the third one or
ear I want to add the fish
I'm going to put another I'm going to
put another coma right there so here I
see ignore the first 2 1 so 1 &amp;amp; 2 going
to be no right there and now if I load
this thing again I get my fish so this
here I just make my life easier for
naming and stuff and I just make it like
we ignore the stuff and you don't need
to put toys I mean I can just put the
takoma like that and that gonna still
work
I just put space because that makes
sense for me here so after that we can
add to an array with risk so in I can do
like we do in the in the object I'm
going to say give me ear the dog and but
all the other stuff gonna be called
inside and a variable called react and
now if I do pretty log and I load my
risk what I'm going to get it's my two
animal left and now I get again a
certification so finally what I'm gonna
do is I'm going to come in out
everything for now like that and now if
I make it work now I get my cat and my
fish because my I get my dog and I don't
get and I don't want to get like all
this stuff here becoming time a variable
rear in here you can do something like I
don't want to add the dog I want to have
the cap but I want to add all the rear
and that's going to make the fish
because I say don't give me the dog give
me the cap and the rest become all the
other stuff that can be really default
when you want to maybe get like the free
side time internet re and put the other
one just inside of all your balls so you
can keep the tracks on it and do stuff
you want with perfect so here that was
airy and object so now we can jump with
function so example here I'm gonna add a
function called maybe greeting and here
like that and air for now I'm going to
just return a console log and I'm gonna
say okay I'm gonna say an argument to
art and I want to have my hello
or that name who have age of an ark that
H so now here if I do I'm going to sit
pretty sorry really log like that so now
here if I call my function meeting log
and now that need to be an object
because we have named an a so I'm going
to say name of maybe John an age of 55
if I do this and I run my code now I'm
gonna get ello John who have age of 55
for the one who download this back tip
is the string interpolation coming from
es6 so when you use the dollar sign
curly bracket you make you you can put
your valuable there so it's much simpler
than all string Oh string in with
JavaScript so now here I have my
greeting that's perfect but I mean II
right I need to keep track on my art and
put art everywhere so what I can do I
can this top string right there
so I'm going to disruption the age in
the name communing from the object and
now I'm going to remove arcs from both
sides and my function gonna still work
so you see you can just stop swing for
the one committing from react we do a
lot of this stuff and you see me do a
lot of this stuff too in my tutorial so
so now if we have the greeting in
everything but here like we did with the
stuff here with the default value we can
default value and objective so I'm gonna
say if I have no name I'm gonna say this
is Jane and she's gonna have like the 68
years old
and now if I run this now I get my stuff
running because my name is my age over
over go on this default value because
remember the default value gonna work if
name is undefined like I mean here again
I can maybe don't put the name and age
like that and now if I call do you think
that's gonna work
and no cuz now read what happened in
here can match against undefined or new
so what that mean it if we try to match
versus nothing but yes oh can I make it
work yeah pretty simple here the only
thing you need to do is add equal in an
empty object so finally you're going to
match this stuff against this empty
object and not against nothing so now if
I run the code now I get ello Jane who
at age of 68 because my name because I
put nothing I get Jane and I get 68 here
if I came in and I put name and I say
John
and I said this thing here I'm gonna get
hello John who have 68 I don't give a
H so my age is I get a default value
right there so that was the basic of the
function and air I'll just show you all
you can add before value remember this
equal an empty object if you don't get
this error of match on the file after
that we want to have the function yes so
what I'm going to do I'm going to cook
I'm going to copy paste this right there
I'm going to use the same function I'm
going to uncomment this function but now
here what I'm going to do is this one
we're going to have a neat name and I
want to rest like that now here I'm
going to happen aim age of 65 in country
I'm going to say Canada like that
and now like you know I'm sure you
already know if you follow all the video
we are going to be equal to everything
but now the thing is like if I put my
wrist here I'm gonna get here object of
object so now you just need to keep in
mind the rest become an object to so the
rest become an object of the Asian
country right there so now if I want to
have the age I'm going to need to say
rest that age and now I'm going to be
able to have my 65 years old coming in
from ear and that's what - if I see
country here and now I run that now I'm
going to get an error because name is
not anymore - I'm going to say ello
country something like that and I'm
going to run and now they're going to
still work ello Canada at the age of 65
I know that don't make sense but at
least you see what I mean so I hope you
enjoyed this little video for helping
you understand a substring I hope you
enjoyed please click the like button if
you think that was a good one and let me
know in the comments if you liked this
little video and so we're going to talk
later and I think I'm going to talk
about the rare and the spread of a
return so hope you enjoyed and we talk
later at the good night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
