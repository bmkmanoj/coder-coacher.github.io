finish to build a photo card design we
don't left too much we just miss finally
here the bottom stuff after that in the
next video we're gonna just pull that
stuff from the graph QL and when we just
add create about getting older the photo
for the sheet for finish this first
milestone so I hope you enjoy the series
or what we've done yet so time to jump
back so this is what we're gonna do it
we're gonna do the bottom first time we
don't gonna put the view here because
this thing it that was because that was
a video and not a portal so that's why
we don't really need but this is much
more like what we need here so all we're
gonna work it's we're gonna do like we
did in the other video we're gonna start
by building a new component inside the
photocard
folder called meta for all the meta both
the photo
and this one what we're gonna do is
we're going to do just a function
after that we're going to import the
view text and style sheet we're gonna
after that just create the basic side
here with the route like we always do
after that we're just going to export
default function called meta
here we're going to return a view with
this a view like that just for now with
a star of stylet root in here I'm gonna
just put for now a background color of
red and also I mean I fifty just at
least be able to see this thing and now
here I'm gonna come here and import my
meta from my meta right there and I'm
gonna just pass this right there below
now if I say we get this stuff here so
if this is one of your question you may
be asked what you following it's too
long that don't go really well with the
design yes don't worry the way that work
it's here as you can see we put a min
height of 800 so 800 and the thing is
when we say example 50 because this will
take tracks 1 we remove always like a 50
pixel eye on every element so this way
the photo gonna start to shrink a bit so
yeah
so all we're going to work here it's
we're gonna have a first thing a rapper
we're we're gonna have the number of
like I don't think yeah the don't really
show here but I'm gonna see gonna make
more sense when we gonna start to see
that in the screen a I'm gonna just need
to add text and here I'm gonna say like
by and I'll go it's the word Instagram
work its we say like by and if you have
one of your friend wave like the photo
will say here so we take a one friend
like randomly and we're gonna put like
like by whatever name so y'all I'm gonna
make it work its I'm gonna say like I
know like Jon Snow and
like that and 1060 1068 others like that
but this would like one of your friend
and 1088 other so that this is one of
the stuff we're gonna need to manage air
and after that we're gonna have here
another view where we get out a text
and yeah that's gonna be the caption so
here are the example my name and I'm
gonna signal this is beautiful though
yeah
you see we start to at least see this
stuff here so all we're going to make it
work first thing we're going to add the
padding here and we're going to see 16
like all other one
after that we're going to import the
font from reactive typography just for
adding us working with the text for
typography I'm gonna just sing we I know
we're gonna need the human in this
system wait after that here I'm gonna
just read alike rapper and this like
rapper going to be just a flex phone
just because I want him to take
yeah but I'm gonna just grab our you're
gonna see why is because or finally I
want the H like this one in this one
pick each one the 50% of the box around
them already so stai wrapper and stai
wrapper ear so you're gonna see gonna
take a bit more space after that here
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just read
one start ear called text and I'm gonna
make use of this on all play I'm going
to say here that that you man that food
note object and I'm gonna say system the
life and all my texts are going to have
this one
and like this so the text a bit more
light but now the thing is I want the
name to be a bit bigger like to to be
easier to know the name all we can do
this it's wrapping the name here with a
text and this one because I don't really
need to change the human who know the
only thing I can do it is saying system
wait that regular and now look what's
gonna happen
it's may be hard for you to see but you
see just by putting system when we get
out here we get all the style we got
from the other tactics as we wrap in
here but don't know become a bit bigger
and yeah like that and I'm gonna do the
same with this one a t28 I can put that
in text page and I'm gonna SiC style
stem that wiggle or I'm gonna just run a
prettier and now you see it's a bit
bigger here and I'm gonna do the same
with my name text and I'm going to put
style
system we go now if I save you just a
bit bigger and I look slow looks like a
bit more like Instagram so here now what
we're going to do because we have some
variable which I'm going to say here
we're going to add the verbal called
caption who by default is going to be
equal to this this is a beautiful dog
and I'm going to put the caption right
there and after that I'm going to put
user name
give the name
so what are we going to get the real
data that's going to be easier to work
with
oh that's it that was the minute nothing
more
so now after that what we left to do
it's gonna be to build like how I can
say that like a comment wrapper so I
place it where you click and that gonna
open the command gonna be again pretty
simple so all we're gonna make it work
it's we're gonna just add a view here so
don't really need to go a bit further
for this stuff to create a component
it's gonna be really simple I just need
to import my touchable here because
we're gonna add some action now here
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say
touchable
Oh keep this stuff don't forget to put
the feedback opacity
and this one I'm going to add a side of
comments rapper comments rapper like
other gonna have I of 50 in a padding
horizontal of 16
and you want I can put a background
color yellow here now we get that the
photo showing a beer and now we get the
comment section and here inside that the
touchable ear what I'm going to do is
I'm going to see you
all 13 come in so that's gonna be war
example when you click on that you can
go and see all the comment already built
so you know I'm going to create a style
oh come in you all the easier for me to
follow which text that's going to be and
this one I'm going to again need the
typography typography
that's in the human and in this one I'm
going to be a carload so again like I
told you in the last one you can just
open
you go to typography and you just search
on le that takes whatever you want like
example you look here the material the
you man and you have all this ten light
and you have all and in here and example
if we look for the human dialogue that's
going to be this one you're a regular
sixteen
hello object and I'm gonna sit color and
I'm gonna put the fellow from iOS color
and this one's gonna be at need three no
if I say I'm gonna remove the yellow you
see now it's a bit light but it's the
button for getting the view alcaman now
from what I've seen also I don't really
need to have this view here so I can
remove the view and having just my
touchable here now if I do this
right not really we don't want to get
that because the button can I be 50 I
just want the button to wrap the text
off please keep it like this then it is
perfect so now and now what we left to
do it's to having an input command
like that
and now
yeah just pretty weird I just started
see so now after that what we see need
to bill is gonna be to put that act on
an input ear and also putting that time
six hour I go something like that so for
the command input oh I'm gonna work its
I'm gonna create another component but
inside the inside the the component full
during at the photo for because I'm
going to mainly need this one in the
future to command input that GS in this
one for now
because I know we're gonna need some
action with some state action or with
them I'm going to make use of the
component I'm going to give you
the text that stylesheet' the image
because we're going to have the avatar
next to it after that I know also I'm
going to need some color I'm going to
use a typographic again
our us color and I'm going to also need
the searchable library
you
I'm gonna already import my figure that
out we have quit inside the pen stand
inside a util constant time Oh pick a
tower
and I also gonna need two of the action
we create inside the team so as you know
that's going to be the make circle and
make it slow but I'm going to clean my
style really quick
or really going to be again a min.i of
50
and here what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create my command input
and ear now I'm going to just put a view
with that style route
if I don't allow this to team like that
and now I'm in team here I'm gonna say
import come in input from the Dozen we
need to go outside input and now we're
going to put this thing once I got need
to check back yeah right there II go
from an input
you
you
in me
so now this one's going to be really
really simple it's just an input with
the avatar next I'm going to just go for
now inside the feed screen right there
instead of protein I'm gonna just stick
content and then our tire and I'm going
to say
margin buffer that's the 100
patting button
okay just I want to scroll and see
myself though yeah I'm an input going to
be really really simple
we need finally
here the other tower and either input so
have you
we're here we're gonna put the image or
ear we're gonna have the source of my
fake avatar after that here I'm gonna
put a start of avatar
would outside to the Avatar it's going
to be pretty simple it's going to be
just make circle make circle and I think
50 not 50 but 3 going to be perfect so
Suganya ran there after that what I'm
gonna do is here I'm going to put style
of
ah that's all rapper
and I put it at that top can you rap
different one and this one we're going
to just put
flex 0.1 and I want a background color
of yellow you see this one and now here
I'm going to just put my touchable below
this stuff
with the feedback of opacity and this
one going to have all for its slope of
pony and you're going to have a style of
input wrapper
you
and now this one gonna take a flex war
so if I say
I need to make sure first then my route
here and at a flex direction of Roe does
I want it in the next so you see the the
yellow I put up a controller to him here
blue you see so here that's going to be
my input so although there's stuff we
can do here is that I thought a wrapper
here we're going to put a justify enter
in center just make it at the center
right there and also I'm gonna say Alan
idea
let's start it because I want to make
sure that any gonna always be there here
okay like that and now you know what I'm
gonna need
it's I'm gonna just strike on any other
and then put here this is gonna be a
button we're gonna push to a new screen
so all I'm gonna do this this thing I
can remove the blue and I'm going to
just put here a view well I'm going to
see inside a text
add a comment like that for the command
we can put a style I'm going to call
that input text
and this one gonna have color of iOS
color the light
you're a too
you
you see like that okay
yeah a pretty weird name but the one two
and three so they have three times at me
a way of light drizzle you need to
choose which one you want and after I
finally I'm going to just start here
style that in put that right there and
this one going to be to be like a must
almost like a circle so I'm going to
just say a border width of one we're
gonna see em now like that after that
I'm gonna say border color to be the
same iOS color that light gooey too
like that after that I'm going to put a
justify
don't align Center I'm gonna put padding
vertical to make it a big bigger I
padding a reason tell from the left to
the right then to make sure I don't go
outside
I'm gonna solve so you're going to take
a width of 95 percent of experiment so
we we remove a bit here then I see a
border radius of 20 to run this stuff
like that and what is
you
when I miss it you I need work
it's not here once a I'm gonna fine
salon item
let's make it like that
and
on input rapper ear the input or FM that
I suggest apply something enter and
alive i dead so now I'm going to do a
bit to the right because remember we
think 95% of its parent so you'll hear
and I said by going for a liar I can
pearl paint
look what good a pen you see maybe not
but you see it don't take everything
because you take 95% of its parent so
always remember that when you work with
reignited a 95% it's always from its
parent so the different so like that at
a condom
all right I don't think I like the this
here in the center I don't know they
take in the center I'm gonna sit next or
ping it like that
some button I'm gonna like that
so it's good here the only thing I don't
like it's this you all come in and I
remove this padding and only I need
come on wrap this one Tommy does I put
once
you
please come in Virgo and something
nothing
you
you
something will do the trick I'm gonna
just at least finish what we're supposed
to finish for now we just have one
element and this is finally the ear I'm
going to put another view with a text of
six hour ago
here we're gonna have a sign of time I
go rapper so here it's going to be that
time you have freedom pole time I go
fine I go a bar and time I go for the
time I go is going to be the human food
no object and the color going to be the
i/os color that made
get some learn but don't worry every
time I go I'm gonna put I 77
justified contain center the a line-item
let's start
now we get some strange behavior right
now
you
pretty strange then I did one design and
he was working perfectly and now with
the same value I get this weird stuff
here
so all we gotta make it work it's going
to the background on
yeah let's see what that so what I think
I pen is this time here and let's go
outside
yeah
I'm going to pull the view in just
coming back in a moment so I found my
proton it's human barrier in the
touchable I've put the comment wrapper
all again if you look here that's why we
get really to the right is because we
have to time depending on we can tell
because the touchable is right there I
can remove this stuff here
and now if I save it get better
I know what I can do finally to finish
this stuff it's here my time I go I'm
gonna put a padding average until 16 to
make it to the same side of the other
one so now I think it looks what I want
so here are that gonna work its wonder
you use are gonna click on add a comment
we gotta go to the we're gonna push a
new screen while we're gonna show every
comment
but you're going to add the input focus
but if you could give clicking on the
view I'll treat in command the input
don't going to be focused
now I'm gonna save this stuff and that's
it so that's good there's going to be
debt for this video the next video we're
going to just stretch whatever we have
done in the back end to make it work
here and having the real data we have
saved so I hope you enjoy and we're
going to talk in a moment have a good
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
