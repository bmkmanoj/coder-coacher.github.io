one's gonna be the basic setup of the
server side for the API we're going to
build for the user identification system
so in this part nothing crazy
we're gonna just set up everything about
babble for make use of the latest
JavaScript es6 and stuff like that we're
gonna also setup Express and Mongoose to
in a bit about the photo structure so
for this project we you're going to need
to add one folder like a Drac there and
you're going to create another folder
called server you're gonna after that go
inside your server and we're gonna open
a text editor from here so I'm going to
open my Visual Studio code with night
etic text editor after that where you're
at the same point of me you're gonna
need to create to go back to UI terminal
and you're gonna run yarn in it on this
on this project and - w-a - why to make
sure then you're gonna just do
everything yes or go with NPM and do the
same in a minute
so now for starting this project we're
gonna need some dependency so like I
told you you're gonna need to have some
know GSM knowledge but here you need to
make sure then you're gonna ask - kind
of dependency the dependency in and
their dependency remember that the
dependencies the one we're gonna run on
your virtual server a server when you're
gonna push the prediction so why I told
you that it's because I have some
student who came to me get some problem
with like a rock or AWS or something
like that where they have some error
about a you don't add this package you
don't have this package and done at this
package it's because they don't run the
dev dependency when they installed it
just install the dependency so just make
sure that every package to your app need
for running or inside the dependency
yeah this is just a quick tips so now
we're gonna start with Express body
parser trust Ian Lee also we're gonna
need mongoose
so that's going to be inside the
dependency if you use NPM that's going
to be M p.m. - - save install and all
this thing make sure this is all in
dependency after that we're going to
need in the dev dependency Bab babble
preset env babel CLI by the plug-in
transform object RESP red so here they
are just better setup to make sure we're
going to work with the lattice es6
feature so install that and make sure
that was in dev dependency with the
slash D added rest there after that
we're gonna also need in the dev
dependency Morgan who's gonna be a tool
for us - for running to see which API
call we did is really good in dev
environment after that we're going to
also install yes Leon and es Lim config
and I'm gonna install mine because I
know all your work and also it's really
easy to set up so you can go with or B&amp;amp;B
and stuff like that if you want why I do
this is because I think in a tutorial
you need yes Leon when you go over there
because I can make some mistake and I
want to make sure that I get this thing
first so I'm right there in my project
I'm gonna just run a generate editor
config so I'm going to push so this
editor config here it's a really simple
one it just says set up to make sure
then if someone take my code or
something like that you're gonna just
add this up setup for the editor so it's
a configuration for an editor if you see
some of my other tutorial I'll show you
how to use it but as you can see I'm
gonna just I'm gonna use space and I'm
gonna use the two in the inside and this
is just a basic set up after that could
another file and we're gonna call this
one yes then I see this one is gonna
take an object with an X 10 and this one
just take equal per so this is the setup
for the es Leon nothing more yes Lenora
see with a dot X 10 equal / if you used
mine after that dot yes Leon ignore
who's going to be we're gonna just say
yes Leon to
the node module folder we don't want yes
them to run on no module that's it after
that we're going to need to install a
batter or safai so as you see it's all
dot fire so they are configuration files
so we just you know pretty basic to is
do setup the first one the preset air is
going to be where we're going to set up
the preset env so we're gonna say env
you know I'm gonna say which target I
want to go and I'm gonna say I want to
go on the node and I'm gonna assist 6.10
because if you want to push to AWS this
is what they're gonna ask you that I'm
gonna see plugging or I'm going to add
another array and transform object yes
sprayer so this is if you want to add
the es6 spread of Avatar and yeah I'm
gonna say use built-ins you built-ins
yeah - that's it so this is the setup of
the Babel
so just make sure then you follow and if
you didn't follow here I'm gonna push
the code on the repo and I'm gonna put
there before on the data get up on the
description so after that we're going to
clean another folder called
SRC so this is where I'm gonna put my
source code also I forget to install one
thing and this is no money we're gonna
install that in development C so for the
one who came we never did no JSA just if
you don't use no money gonna always need
to restart your server for adding the
change not no one gonna watch for us go
to your package JSON and create a script
object and we're gonna say death why
here we're gonna say cross E and V node
E and V that dev the man so we just say
finally this code gonna run on
development mode and you know as to why
I do this in a moment so that yeah I'm
gonna say known one da - exact
Babur node SRC not index that GS I know
it's pretty weird if you it's the exact
first it's pretty weird if you never
seen that but
it's kind of simple you just say here
that's gonna be in development
we're unknown man and we exact babble
we're going to just compile the code and
we go over SOC index we're going to
create this index file right there so
now we can use the es6
import from Express yeah I'm gonna just
say really I'm gonna just go really
simple with a cons up
equal Express and I said I'm gonna just
say app that lists end on 2000 just for
now here if add an error if I have a
never I'm gonna chew my ever else you
know I'm gonna say console or server
running on the court 3000 like that
so now forcing if everything is work you
go to you terminal and you run yarn dev
or NPM run there looks everything is
work go to if you have postman with an
extension or you can use the google
extension to just post my next video so
you should download that I'm gonna put
the link in the description if you go to
local owes 3000 now and I do I get
requests with by doing come in enter and
I get full for and that's perfect I mean
yeah so for it's bad but that's perfect
for that just mean that org right now so
we have the basic setup of just Express
so we make Express running we make sure
than Express now it's able to run so now
we're gonna just module a bit the code
we're gonna create a config folder
inside the folder where we're going to
create a file called constant at GS here
it's a file where I'm gonna put all my
constant the constant it's the variable
we're gonna never move for the app and I
need that all around my app so we're
gonna see that in a moment I'm gonna
create a object called default config
who's going to be the default
configuration of my app is
gonna be an objective I'm gonna say part
where I'm gonna sit process that E&amp;amp;V
that part and I'm gonna say 8-under
8,000 why do this it's because what
you're gonna run on a Roku or something
like that they can add their own port
number so by doing this you make sure
then in local I'm gonna run it doesn't
but when I'm gonna push the prediction
I'm done getting it this kind of problem
after that what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna create another object called
develop men who here it's gonna be
finally an object I'm gonna have a DB
URL inside that side this one I'm gonna
see the MongoDB local O's slash user
authentication and I'm gonna sit there
like that so this object here gonna have
a DB URL if you follow what I try to do
it it's because I'm gonna have another
object may be called prediction where
this one is going to be example
prediction like that
and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
create a function called get env you're
gonna get a and every one man and
infinitely gonna return you're gonna
show me I should say config I make a
mistake like this I just make a little
mistake sorry about that so we're gonna
go connection like this and now here
finally we just return the country with
the env inside that so as you see here
this thing can be prediction of
development and you're gonna return this
object by the wing bracket notation and
now here we can export default an object
where I'm gonna spread the default
country and I'm gonna also spread the
get env but this one's going to get the
env by doing process that Envy that note
IND so if you should follow what I've
tried to do it's by gaining this
environment variable right there
so if you match the development I'm
gonna get this thing so just to make
sure all is working what I'm gonna do
it's air I'm going to import the
constant file we just build after that
I'm gonna change this treatise on by
doing constant that can't stand that
something looks like is weird right now
looks like I have one error
before comfy
art pretty strange and my visual to do
didn't get it
you
now we're gonna see so you know that so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say can't
stand the court
we need bhakti for that that's it and
now eight thousand so it looks like work
perfect this is what we want
you know so I'm gonna come so look the
anger on map so that's going to be
easier for Ian and V run man we're gonna
say process that env that no DnB and now
we're gonna see right there development
maybe you're gonna need to restart by
doing your yarn dev again but now you're
gonna work and now we see its
development so now we get all the setup
of the development here if you don't
want to have this error you can just add
the ESN disable line of both line
because my es limb
told you so I don't want weather comes a
lot so this is what you can do for
disable this thing or you can disable
that at the top by doing yes then
disable no console and after that you
remove this thing and now that's gonna
still work like that so now we have did
the config of the Express but now we
miss to do the Mongoose so we can occur
in another file inside the country a DB
this one what we're gonna do is we're
going to import Mongoose from Mongoose
we're gonna import the constant five we
just create so this is an object we're
going to set up mongoose promises as
asked abide dogs if you think i do you
it's it's the dogs ask you so in a I'm
gonna do a try and a catch because that
can be a problem when you're gonna run
on when you're gonna do testing actually
I so I just always set up this thing so
I'm gonna save Mongoose connect what I'm
gonna have my constant that DB DB URL
and a I'm gonna just use Mongo client
true and here I'm gonna have my rubber I
know
that what I'm gonna say it's mango with
that create connection Const and that DB
URL and you a mango client
true so here finally just say I try to
connect if I have an error just create a
connection finally so if you know the
work create a connection and after I'm
gonna say mangu that connection here at
the bottom what I'm gonna say that and
so on so when that happened at one time
so when it's open I'm gonna console.log
Mongo DB running on air are so when I
have an error the error right there and
I'm gonna just finally throw the error I
think we see here and I can disable my
life right there so now for make sure
that gonna work I'm gonna just need to
import it and because I don't want to
use a variable I can just import /
config stash
maybe nothing more now if I go to my
terminal I can I'm supposed to see
MongoDB running and we have it
that's perfect this is I mean this is
what you really want to have in your
that just means a family that works so
so now what I'm gonna do is we're gonna
just set up to the the middleware it's
gonna be pretty simple we're going to
just create ear inside the config
another middleware file who are in this
one we're gonna take the body parser
from body parser and now a I'm gonna
create a variable also create a call is
there so the is there is going to be
finally just a boolean value who's going
to return me if the environment variable
process and we know DNV equal no DNV
development so if it's test or prod is
going to be false what I'm doing this is
because here now I can export default
and that roof function who I'm gonna
pass my app who's going to be my
expressed instance what I'm gonna do up
that use body parser that JSON for the
one who don't know what is body parser
it's a way to pores
always your egg buddy you don't want to
do with json.stringify on everything
that's gonna be crazy you don't want to
do this so now here you body part also
the URL encoded because I want to use
that in postman and when its extent true
and now I'm gonna just say if is in
depth dependency
I'm gonna take my Morgan equal require
Morgan here you cannot do an import when
you do they import it this is at the top
after that you need to do inside
everywhere this way and now I'm gonna
just say add that use Morgan and I'm
gonna pass that like that I think I go
quick I know you just disco our bolo
plate if you are beginner and know GS
this stuff you suppose to like maybe
that don't gonna make sense but more and
more you let's see the code one more
that gonna make more say it just below
played on one I don't want to lose time
I'm just a setup of the code so here
inside index we're gonna just import the
middleware from config and middleware
and now finally after the app is bill we
passed the app that set and now we're
gonna make sure everything's still work
go to push man and do another get on
8,000 maybe and now if you work we see
now the get with a photo in yellow
that's cuz of Morgan this is what Morgan
do when we pass the Morgan death here so
if you don't understand what happened
now just we create the instant of the
application we create a function here
we're gonna take this instance and we
finally do what we need to do for
putting middleware because they are
middleware but it for shot some either
one Morgan to and we see app that used
and we pass them there it just a way to
abstract let me the world that's so that
that's it for this episode I'm gonna
pull the call together out you're gonna
enjoy again the be pose going to be in
the description and we got a drum on the
next one why are we gonna set up there
user model and the user registration
with the service and everything and I
think if you follow my two
gonna maybe like the new way of my
services where I get that from other
language so I hope you enjoy and we're
gonna talk later other good any dessert
and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
