so here this is my plan for tonight I'm
gonna recompose my setlist function
right there I'm gonna do a context for a
team because I've set up the function
for that and I'm gonna also set up your
dukes process to save the user data
laughter I think that's gonna be done so
here this is the function of q e right
there the dog team in arrived change a
bit the design and ear to that in the I
put the date of today
hmm
like you so recompose me me gonna need
to do
so here from recompose I'm gonna need
the wiggler
really do this right after and I'm gonna
need to compose I think no era can do
export default compose
maybe not because this thing it's a oh
yeah so I just put yeah
and now I hear what I'm gonna do
so I'm gonna say with and learn with
this thing it's a function take an
object right there and I can say select
press sure but I think he take the props
that's quite sure
yeah take the props
and so for the props here I can just say
props and this one I can keep to say
that's gonna be the same kind of
function but you should add gonna still
work on the phone yeah
but what I've did wrong maybe gonna just
need to create
the
I mean why not do like this show
you
you
lol oh are you
what nothing
Oh
I'm good too I'm good too
we expect a map of order other function
is right
oh I maybe know why it's because here I
need to have another function call
another function like that
okay
I think this Haven are you are you on
the train again
now this thing is done
oh nice I'm real happy to hear that
so now my plan it's one I'm gonna click
here all the things going to be white so
this is what I need to do
other question I mean if you don't want
to learn no the next press and stuff
like that you can just use react native
and if you want kind of DB can check for
firebase we're gonna surely help you to
just understand a bit our you can work
with the outside API if you build a
project but for me I mean I'm learning
by creating projects so
oh I'm gonna end this redux this team
stuff here one of the thing I'm thinking
right now it's I can maybe just make use
of it inside V docks I know I can use
context but the thing about context it's
I mean it's I don't want to get some
kind of program but if I do this with
video X thing that can go pretty well so
I'm gonna put a reduce are called teams
who's gonna have all my color yeah I
think we ducks can be better and having
that so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
create a producer inside my app yeah and
inside this one I'm gonna have the teams
who this one is gonna be dark and I'm
gonna import the color and I'm gonna
have like it's going to be the color
after that I'm gonna just set up my
stage I've set up here
for now I'm gonna say object what is the
error
yeah
so you have the team tab all colors
yeah good idea
thing like this white I don't need that
tap power color I don't need that here
like Yuri I'm gonna keep it here know
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna see color
air is gonna be / color like that inside
my state I'm gonna
you see what I'm gonna need to do let's
take all the colors I know it's a train
what I do but that's gonna be winning at
the end
like that so now when I go to my state I
can see
yeah
about their internal storage and I'm
gonna show that they're like almost
right there I'm gonna use with experts s
so that's gonna be something like you
can learn so they done have a good thing
there beep Oh awesome really nice it has
a lot of get up stuff that's really
helpful
okay like that we're almost good
so now you have my team
how can I manage it the way I want oh
why doing something like that when I can
so by default I'm gonna use the teams
that team that dark so that's gonna be
by default I'm gonna go back on this
state I'm gonna say this thing is gonna
be equal to this thing like that and now
what I'm gonna do it's toggle team and
I'm gonna say team it's gonna add the
team and here I'm gonna say if state
that
yeah so this thing - I'm gonna have been
changed but so if state that dark team
it's true a we're gonna push so I'm
gonna kick back so now that's gonna be
like is gonna be doors so we're gonna
see that gonna work so not one team so
accord background one six one C three
six now if I go there and I click here
boom
a work perfect I'm gonna remove the
debugger for now
so now example that navbar navigation
so here now hmm I'm not sure about oh I
can
I'm gonna try something but I'm not sure
that you know work
I really don't like this way
yeah that's the thing
so I can handle
what I've done now
Oh Oh finally I was maybe gonna work
oh thank you I'm out yeah thank you have
a good night and take care you too and I
really appreciate this kind of wording
you
yeah not work this weekend at work what
I've done the work now
mmm
you
48:40
now I never have used a realtor for like
you
yeah me too it's something like I would
like to try but I didn't touch the web
for a long long time
yeah I think that I can just go with
that
oh yeah boots nuts it's awesome I might
be few like like you yeah I really like
boots up to
oh that's gonna work that would be
awesome
once it
so screen props exist that bow our color
of on the phone
oh yeah not yet
being props
how can I test that
oh yeah Chris I've wasn't or Kennedy nor
me for almost like seven year yeah I was
a firefighter when I was younger and now
are me and after that programmer so we
never done programming before
nothing relate to a computer screen
props it's an empty object screen props
it's an empty object
yes yeah programming it but I love
programming it's just I was always like
I'll always like computer but I was then
I don't want to go to the college and
get a degree and so when I see now you
can become programmer without that I was
happy with this thing anything I can
maybe see is there the one I'm looking
right now where I do the console or it's
inside the add coin so if I take a look
on the add coil
yeah the only thing I got from there now
it's like I'm just a bit like discipline
so well I can wake up earlier and I told
all day long
don't understand oh you make it work
oh he put it there
oh oh oh what I've just seen there oh so
now it's all its supposed to go like I
tamed now I will be able to
here get against the props I'm gonna sit
I'm gonna see enough crops I'm gonna
have your screen props what I'm gonna
have the team inside that and I can see
enough props and now these things gonna
be equal to props so now if everything
is working all right then I just make
the swap because they just put it the
new idea that's it I just want to try it
and like this thing here if you I told
my DA they just relays this thing here
yesterday so just want to try it and for
now it's okay I mean it's I've worked
all day with that so so now if it's
working now I'm gonna remove the
debugger if it's working
yeah he's working for testing that I
need to see air props
well boom boom boom oh that be
you
yeah but sublime tree I didn't like for
the past wet like at least a year our I
think I'm better not sure that word
yeah the only thing is this thing oh man
if I put
you
with its
it's done
maybe if this thing work I'm gonna be
good
you
so funny I can just take that bar button
go meaning from here
like that
Tabo component
okay so now I've done this one so now I
think this one's gonna receive this
thing as a props okay so what I think
it's so you're gonna receive here as a
prop style so we know you're gonna
receive style
so now style I can I can maybe say it's
not quite sure is that gonna work be
equal to stay that up the team
this thing looks like you weren't the
thing it's we don't get my eyes because
I think if I do ear and eye someone to
other example I I'd of eighty so we're
gonna see the change because I mean ad
it's gonna be pretty big II so what I
think it's if I want to do this I'm
gonna need to merge yeah you see now I
don't I'm not sure if I see yeah
160 you see down work so what I think I
should just put
like that
perfect this thing is worth for this
after that so my button here that's
gonna be inside a company but not this
one looks pretty good because this color
don't never gonna change
I'm good with that so finally I shall do
the same with the others because here
I'm always copy pays myself yeah maybe
not here but that yeah I'm gonna have
the other title style
hey Chris oh it took me six months seven
months
so if it's dark I want it to be like
that and if it's white I want the ring
maybe
welcome change to the status bar
I don't gonna need anymore this
I think this thing will be better if I
put that inside I don't want to connect
too much
this way
yeah but there that's gonna be like that
and this thing
so now by doing this my status board the
table is gonna change the color I think
so now if I go there you see Bob so this
thing is done so now I'm going to need
to change
so I can surely change the provider of
inside my app oops not here inside my
app right there this is my problem is
this team here so what I would do it's
say maybe get I'm going to get team and
this one's what's gonna do it I'm gonna
take the store so I'm gonna say Khan's
equal store that get state that up I'm
gonna get the dark team and I'm going to
see if dark team I'm going to return
team the dark is gonna return team that
light and now here I can say this that
get team
and you not work
temp relator
you know what I am gonna remove the
tempura visor I'm gonna crash my app
if my app crash I'm gonna adjust if we
do what I've done a year but I'm gonna
go one by one and see work first because
yeah I think that's gonna crash because
stack up I'm gonna yep so now what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna go like that
I'm gonna remove this thing now what I'm
gonna do here is I'm gonna go over so a
good place where I can see it's gonna be
in this sitting place so right there
so finally I'm gonna need to connect
some of my team why I'm gonna say stay
that add the team and so here the route
the route here I'm gonna say style and
I'm gonna pull right there I'm gonna say
background colors it's going to be
called these shrubs that team dot and I
was cord background I think yeah like
that after that so now I can remove this
one and now card but this one now is
gonna be tab color
perfect
and for this one primary so here don't
you think I'm gonna need to change its
white um tan color
so now yeah
it's not that bad thing for now at least
so this thing it's done that I'm gonna
do the circle thing that was inside my
navigation add the Add button bygone
color now this one you can keep its
utter a button this thingy right there
it's my problem but ooh this button gets
car you know here what I'm gonna do so
the color here style of background
colors it's going to be equal as props
the screen props that team dot tab our
colors now I can go here and remove this
one
so now perfect so I'm gonna just finish
with the kick might for your ear and
after that I'm gonna do this thing and
after I'm gonna start to do the redox
Percy stuff so this thing is the on page
home page
I'm not sure I like this iOS surge
outline so I'm gonna just change if I
come now are you still there I even
increase
oh boy what happened here okay
search I'm gonna take this MD search I
think Oh
iOS search are you a search I think it's
gonna be better
what do you think about this teaming
stuff you take a good amount of time to
figure out but now yeah for now so I'm
gonna just change this oh really
hmmm I think I'm gonna maybe just go
back with Visual Studio code I think
it's happening cause of Adam take too
much I think
Adam take too much CPU and that's why
I'd keep reloading
let me note that go more with this thing
I think it's my CPU right now it's crazy
yeah let me know if that go better now
with this thing
so No
I mean I don't really need Campos here I
can just create
you
introdu decency
now here I can change everything first
thing root its core background
well I'm gonna maybe destructuring you
perfect so now just to being sure that
work do not this thing it's better
perfect yes so Adam it's bad for
stirring okay so now this thing gonna
work but I need to change think that was
in the car of course style I'm sure
oh yeah for me man it's I mean this if I
remember in 2008 who has the bad people
would like in 2000 like take more in the
silver and stuff like that and will make
money on top of everyone and get charged
I think 16 billion or something like
that I mean I just think like if you
look at this the people now I'd be and
is more scare so a boy amore are this
morning but the thing is I just think
they just know that that can take more
place and they are scare about that
that's why I'm you what do you think
about that
oh yeah and what you feel about this
yeah I know it's but I mean the one I
put the oh yeah I know I think yeah like
for 25 bucks Pizza and let me know
something like that yeah
but the one I follow a lot it's IATA
just because I really love the
technology they put behind
so yeah so the so the name its course
that
I'm going to do like this song
function
maybe maybe I don't need the connect
stuff here what I maybe need it's
you
oh maybe that was
you
nope
so now I don't gonna prove with the card
what I'm gonna do
it's fun and I'm gonna just say you
stick the
going to the clinic era
and I'm gonna pass as a props to the
coin
the buck along
title holding text price USD remember
that total text title
title
prai's USD I think holding tax this is
what I say title holding text pricey
with the text and total texture it's
gonna be changing hey think you flee
yeah Chris it's I think for me it's like
more and more people talk about that
more and more that's gonna just really
go further than we think
this is all I think but I mean I'm
pretty pretty like I just start with
that so
total tax
what I say no more that was because of
this
this thing it totaled takes
yeah I think we are good with that for
now
maybe gonna need to change the green and
the red thing to the color it's
right so now the Ducks persist
so I think we ducks process is pretty
simple to install so we say a yarn add
Redux persist
it's Auto video editing but - yes and
now here what I need is I need to take
compost from the nerves I think this
thing out I see Campos and now at the
end of this one
I mean compose with devtool it's already
the same thing I think then I go to my
app
and enzyme up I need to import from
redox purchase the persister and now
what I can do so I'm gonna need to
create some state you know say the app
is ready falls by default
okay now it what I'm gonna do
it's inside a component in mouth I'm
gonna say persist or we take their store
also after that I'm gonna need to take
an object where you say storage oops and
storage finally I'm gonna put using
storage coming from here so you just
told him which storage you take like
that after that I'm gonna say whitelists
so which star want to keep it I'm gonna
say app for now so I don't want other we
do start to get this thing and after
that I think here after that you have a
callback where I can just say this that
set state is really true and now here I
can take from Expo I thing oops
can take from expo the uploading and now
I do it if this that stay that really so
if it's not is really we turn up loading
and now if you work
and now if you work and I choose to take
a light team and i refresh my app I'm
supposed to keep at white boom so my
using storage your work now and you
think I'm gonna sit yeah I'm gonna
create a variable call and we do source
whitelist I'm gonna put that in the
constant I think
I'm gonna sit up
and change this one
oh really
so read this my team is set up you know
go to the wallet where I can already do
and also team
you
you
I think I think I'm gonna remove the
animation
that's why I get some kind of leggy
stuff coming from the left-hander right
yeah you see it's better now so now the
only one I need to fix it's this one and
after that we go man took me took a
while I'm gonna connect this one now so
from the type I'm gonna need the state a
zap stay and team color yeah I'm gonna
say model cryptocurrency connected it's
equal to connect where I can say team
equal to stay that up the team and after
that I can see your model cryptocurrency
and at that I can use this one here so
now I'm gonna have my team I just need
to put that inside my probes and now
what I can do it's the route here who
have okay rapper here is going to have a
star of
background-color team the tab bar
background cut up colors so I can remove
it from here and now I can put that here
and say team equal these that props that
team like that oh yeah yeah I like dark
I mean they just I think two days I go
one of my I show that to one of my
friend and just say that would be a
great idea I mean in just a feature you
can add and in same time I'm just
learning all to use this kind of team
changing stuff and you see like I get
some kind of laggy stuff cuz I think
what happened now it's my loading it's
still like black but now here I think
just for that I'm gonna have the same
value here and now on my crypto item I'm
gonna have my type
on the wheel
oops it's nothing I say why why okay
oh man but it's okay I've done just a
job for this one you see I've done this
job
here are my subtitle Suzu crypto and I'm
also must have
perfect this one is done so that was not
that was here add coins creat so the
connect here I've done I would have done
this year and I will have pass it
sorry about that we are almost done tan
color and state as upstate we close
close close we're gonna have team as a
team color after that here what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna connect this page
this one gonna add state state it's the
last thing team equal to state team
perfect so no my model keep two here I
don't need that anymore
cuz I'm gonna receive that from the
props so here now I can say from my
model team equal these that props the
team and now
oops
no I mean this thing I can keep it like
here it's we're gonna see the change
thing root
rapper to
also called tab bar color now
we must be close now I think here that
came cause of my
oh yeah I think it's cause of disgust
you see yeah
and now choose a crypto and I myself
forget one title boom
what do you think of this heaven and
Chris thing now it's done
choose a crypto bitcoins oh
close close close input that's why
anything input color and now what we
need to say its style for this one this
one
better for me - doing your height there
when I have that a lot then choose a
crypto Bitcoin and if you maybe say oh
yeah but if the user enter GW yeah
enough on real phony gonna add this
keyboard so
must have white somewhere ear ear ear
why
so now boom get ear Bitcoin cost three
thousand nine we lost a lot and now I
say I want to buy two I get this I want
to about twenty three I want to about
twenty one like that and I want to
change the price because my friend send
is sell it to 360 and now it work the
only thing I need to figure out now it's
going to be really quick it's going to
be the luang you see so the only thing I
need to do it's this loading a paneer
nothing here I use mice
so loading right there okay but this
loading here
so someone keep out of in my
you see I have the blue
you see what I mean and what is that
where that came
you think that came from at navigation
so I not sure cuz you I'm gonna check
no it's not there so I go to my main
nerve why I go to my home screen
because of the cards
I know I'm gonna show you why once say
hey I'm sure it's cause of the car style
no because we dogs perseus air then
happen in the din Mountaineer the set
state gonna on only happening if this
thing is ready so we get cow so the
first thing God is the app navigation so
app navigation is this thing right there
we're gonna few here and after that the
first page I gotta so so I must add ear
a background color but maybe am you
maybe get true cuz
because my loading here don't have color
to their color but why get this blue
thing
so here it's my animation
so somewhere here we use card background
keep the light in Quinn detail don't
thing it's the problem
because the quaint detail is just this
thing maybe I can maybe changes right
there gotta take one sec
I'm like you have ray discs you're
supposed to have only ten fetching each
minute so no we still
I mean if I do this and I refresh do
that's going to be one
no somewhere
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and
sign my constant and I'm gonna take this
card background only one place or maybe
this color here only one place
oh did you see
but yeah so for now I think we're gonna
be good with that but I like to work on
dark mode so
another thing to do done so now my main
feature is this thing after you choose a
crypto I will add this thing with the
crypto you
so I'm gonna still code the 30 minute
and after that I'm gonna stop I need to
record a some video and one of them is
gonna be about flow type I get this
asked and I get asked this about doing a
video about that in the discord so and I
think I've done pretty good amount of
flow time in the past days oh yeah
so oh I'm gonna save that in the reducer
I'm gonna save that with kryptos and my
crypto you're gonna have an initial
state of and it is gonna be an empty
object and so
function
oh yeah I'm gonna have multiple so
Oh yet I hope you enjoy it I think it's
something like like we're gonna start to
see more and more and more and I think
we'll be good for people to just learn
this thing
what I mean it's the price it's not
really what I'm gonna have
this is what I'm gonna have here a
surprise for you
and I'm gonna have a total
yeah but I can just keep it like that
and I'm gonna send and what I'm gonna do
so now when I'm gonna submit here I'm
gonna call my function with the dead boy
into the lamonta this is what I need to
do here so add coin so here I shall have
my submit button there's a mid press
submit press ok that's gonna be error so
now what I need to do it's here I'm
gonna have my function cow coming from
my action that Kryptos and there's gonna
be new coin
maybe boy a new coin now add new holding
so as a props we're gonna have that
who's gonna be a type of new holding at
the bottom I'm gonna put that right
there
now I'm gonna call that ear there's that
prop the new holding but now I'm gonna
create a coin who's gonna have some
value some of the value is going to be
it's gonna beat
what happened
oh I think it's the the new update of
iOS 11
so price pay it's gonna be
okay
so price pay price total pay it's gonna
be cool to this total amount of the
Lochte oh what I've done again after
that I'm gonna have price daiquan was
the price after I'm gonna have amount of
coin I'm gonna say total amount of
crypto I said I'm gonna have name is
gonna be equal to selected crypto the
name
so I'm going to have that boy
now I'm gonna get an error particular be
access opposite possibility under finite
values of area I should just put
inversion and say if I have no selected
crypto then selected crypto require
I'm gonna go to my data I'm gonna create
another that I call holding data who's
gonna be finally what I've just add why
these things gonna be number price buy
coins gonna be a number I think the
total amount of dollar is gonna be a
string string string string string date
so now I can take this thing where go to
my index export this thing from here go
in my action import that sick one's
gonna be equal to that after that I'm
going to clean my action so this is that
the flow even almost all will do with
fluids
after that you create you action you say
type add new holding action what I'm
gonna say type equal to this type I'm
gonna import here my holding data I'm
gonna say I want to return a coin of
holding data and now inside this action
export type action by doing this now all
my reduce are like example this one as
you can see now this reduce are can have
all this action so you're going to
choose the one need so example now if I
still copy paste this thing and I go
there now I can do something with that
so here what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
return the state for now and I'm gonna
say entity entities
here gonna be the same for each one but
here I'm gonna go with the action that
ID you see if I say action that coin
that I that coined that name yeah the
thing it's name is gonna be in uppercase
so I should have ID - so ID is gonna be
a string and you're gonna see what I'm
gonna do with the idea is I'm gonna go
here I'm going to say ID crypto ID
here so I'm gonna have a crypto here now
that's gonna be the problem here or I
need to manage them
because I wanted to keep track of each
transaction you're going to build so
example if you have very Bitcoin I know
I'm gonna say mine's gonna be better
and here what I'm gonna do it I'm gonna
say
Kengo fighty I'm gonna sit transaction
ID you're gonna make more sense

Krypto I'm nothing I'm gonna some gonna
boy bitcoin gonna say I'm gonna buy to
Bitcoin right there and I'm gonna kick
some min okay
now you see I I called my a new Ling why
I put my full object right there like
that price bad coin and price that'll
play it's really the way but you see now

have add another one example I call at
around and I so I'm gonna boy to not
click ear now I'm gonna get at the realm
ear
and now if I buy another Bitcoin
organism
okay now this thing is wrong
I have a fixed air to do and I fix to do
that inside the price price by coin and
priced at LP
name an idea
this is something I need to fix but now
I think this one's gonna work if I say
it around and I bite - whatever
no this one's gonna have the ID number
one and now if I say here by another
Bitcoin I've paid only one now so you
have another problem
one fix at the time here the problem
like that
so I'm buying one Bitcoin so my
transaction here I'm going to buy
another Bitcoin I'm gonna buy two
yeah now I work
okay so this stuff is done now why the
price price and total amount of the
lower pay it's not good
okay that's why today I should say this
at set stained total amante it's going
to be equal to the result
I think
yeah but can I just get this thing

this
yeah the market is pretty red so what
I've lost today yeah let's hear another

gonna I'm gonna sell I'm gonna buy a
Bitcoin here I have a loaded I need to
remove that here I'm gonna start by a

you can see now of the transaction of so
far I almost screen my own kind of DB it
just because I don't have like a DB like
I'm done gonna have a server yet just
for now
so this way like what I do is I see my
transaction and now I can say like the
proper I can create inside the crypto I
can maybe hear like priced at all play I
can just sum this with all other one
like that how many how much did you play
so this will you know how much you pay
in total also yeah so this way I can say
how many profit you have and stuff like
that
