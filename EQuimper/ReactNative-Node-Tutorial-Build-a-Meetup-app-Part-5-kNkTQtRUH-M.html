soil so today the plan is to add videos
to the stack of the application so we
don't the talk about the estate manager
for the one who don't know reach out
right now I'm gonna put some description
something in the description for you to
someplace where I think it's a good
place to learn redox so like egg eggs
and don't worry everything gonna be free
for that so for now my plan is to add
redox work a bit with what we have right
now as I like in the application so
we're gonna just change the way we fetch
with the home screen so all we've added
a my meter we're gonna add this to the
store and - my plan is to add the redox
Redux remote dev tool for react native
and maybe at the end the pen of O go to
the video we're gonna add the native
base and start working on some design
stuff for create the create meetup page
so first thing react native debugger
what is that it's a so we just friend
fairies just put your console log on
steroids it just add what we have in the
web but they are gonna add this to the
react native stuff so in the web we have
the redox left or we had all the react
component stuff we can see but only I
can achieve we don't get that so some
people create this tool and they let you
use this thing so first thing we're
gonna do it's for the one using map here
we have a we gonna you're gonna install
like this so in for the door yeah they
have the release page etc so for a map
Mac grew up debut casts install if you
use on Bruce first after that what I'm
gonna add to its the react native
debugger open so they just cuz if you
don't add this stuff by their fault
they're gonna open the control lock the
normal one and not your so here I'm
gonna add this link so react native
debugger open to my dev dependency here
don't worry just my back and running
right now
so I'm gonna install this after that add
this command to you package JSON so what
you need to do it's ad right there after
this what you need to do is this post
install that I came when we put any in
game install so first thing we're gonna
do it so we're gonna remove the new
module we're gonna remove the new module
perfect so you can delete manually so
this is how I do a ram area a new module
after that
so just for be sure I have no other no
more job perfect so after that I'm gonna
do you are so it's like NPM install so
we're gonna wait everything's working
don't don't worry about this error if
you get it just cause my ass Lin tried
to run but we didn't answer right now so
we're gonna reinstall the new module so
every package we have yeah it's weird to
install but don't worry so now we get
replaced
open the bag our UI with chrome to open
reignited perfect so now open exponent
open exponent find your project click on
your project wait for the package r2 to
be start when you're gonna see your
device to be black you can open it on
your simulator I'm gonna open it take
out a bit so I plan to it to change the
way we did the class I'm gonna add a
TRICARE just forget the error manager
and for redux not and an expert so what
I'm gonna do just like if you follow me
just follow me with what I'm gonna do if
you have any question add the question
and if you have any tip for me just add
it I'm using redux maybe not the same
way of everyone else so that's why I say
that but I think I have a good and
further standing about that so here you
see I get my react native debugger open
but he's not so I need to reopen it
and now this is the touch report okay
perfect so now here we need to read
below I'm gonna refresh I'm gonna reopen
my package and now I get my console so
now my debugger is active but now I'm
gonna need to reload again when i
refresh I'm gonna click on it and now
they make the connection
perfect perfect so now we have the
connection so now everything is working
with the debugger perfect
and don't worry if we like we get gonna
get some weird slow thing if we use the
debugger so this is really normal it's
what happens when we have the debug open
+ r ag- now it's in development so we
don't have all the performance stuff we
asked for so what we're going to add for
videos we're gonna have some stuff like
we need to install in the de belem C
redox react with dogs because Redux it's
a it's a state manager and that can work
for view can work for ember can work for
angular and canyou can all work with
that on the venire Java scripts or react
Redux it's just a way to connect each
other so we're gonna add video X we're
gonna add a react Redux and we're gonna
add redox from a premise middle warrior
for the one who know a bit more about
redox I'm not using Sega I know it just
cuz this tutorial I mean it's not for
really advanced
Vedic stuff so we're gonna just go with
plain data script so I don't think we're
gonna add inside devil dependency so add
them we're gonna add Vedic Stoeger so
with lex luger what that's going to do
it's going to console.log each action of
freedoms so we don't need to control out
a reaction we are perfect after that
here we have react navigation version
better 1.5 but now they have the one
point zero zero six so we're gonna just
update it so our yarn add react
navigation you just do this and by
default they're gonna install to version
26 perfect now I get that point 6 now
I'm gonna need to refresh this one so
now I get my debugger it's not so now
what we're gonna need to do this is
we're gonna close the simulator again
and now we're going to just restore this
one we're gonna close and we're gonna
restart
you
I'm going to reopen my device
so now what happened it's sometimes some
weird stuff coming with when I have my
everything like installs so so this is I
just need to refresh cuz we use a watch
man for the Watchmen keep everything so
now we are supposed to be good perfect
and now I'm get this problem so this is
a error I've seen I get because of the
vision point 6 so now what are we gonna
do it's that's why I'm gonna just make
everything coming from redux here so
first thing we're gonna do so I'm gonna
close this thing here so what I do I go
to my source folder I'm gonna create a
folder called redux
in this one the only thing I'm gonna add
is I'm gonna add a store that yes I'm
gonna create my store and I'm gonna
create a reducer where I ask that gso
that's gonna be the main place where I'm
gonna put on my reducer
because gonna get see I'm gonna have a
lot of videos are coming from you where
so so here for the video are gonna be
really easy the only thing I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna import combine reduce are
from redux I maybe think another tipo
combine we do so yep
yeah I'm what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
export default my combined we do so
we're gonna take and I'm Jake and I'm
going to just put for now fake and I'm
gonna say it's an average not an every
then function will return an Eric that's
it
so just think about this I really sorry
just a function will return data after
that we're gonna jump on we're gonna
jump on the the store and we're gonna
play two out to create the store and
make it running with the debugger I
would just create so what are we gonna
do we're gonna go to the store we're
gonna import so I'm going to do from
redux and it'd be easier I'm gonna
import create store I'm gonna import
apply middle war and I'm going to import
my compose apply me the work for apply
altimeter war Cristal for Crete destur
and composites when you want to add some
answer like for us now that's gonna be
the redox dev - yeah we're gonna import
logger.log about promise middleware from
promise middle warm after that here I'm
gonna create a middleware array by
therefore gonna take my premise middle
wire like this I said that here this is
all we have the process environment
development on the react native so what
I'm gonna do it's if they're like that
so this is how you get the dev from
react native yeah I'm gonna say yes Lynn
disable line cuz you don't understand it
there right there yeah I'm gonna say
current logger equal require redux lugar
October because I want to use it only on
dev they have development not on the
production so I'm gonna just a
middleware that push and I'm gonna push
my logger
in because my middle war it's an area
right there
after that I'm gonna sit can't compose
the answer
oh we can just answer for now and so
we're gonna equal so now window
so this line of code this is what they
show us on the redox debugger so this is
not a line I'm gonna create a redox
slash dev to slash extension - compost
and now you put this thing like that and
now we're gonna say our compost like
this after that we're gonna export
default create store move by default
take three argument first one we do sir
we're gonna import it import we do sir
from reducer certain thing take
initial state I'm gonna see under fine
for now thirteen and I take the answer
and I'm gonna put apply middleware and
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna spread my
middleware every right there like this
so we should be good to go with that
after that I've installed my V Docs dev
tool at the top I'm gonna import
provider from react redux this is all we
connect after that I'm gonna just make
it like this so what I do now I put my
library at the top my component here and
every other thing I'm gonna import right
there just make life easier for me I'm
gonna import a store coming from source
and coming from redox and my store and
now the only thing I need to do I'm
gonna put my route here I'm gonna put it
between a provider and I'm gonna put my
store on my provider like this so now if
i refresh if everything go well I'm
supposed to have here a state open now
yeah
so now I have my favorites an empty
array that's it so now if we look were
screaming that it's coming from my
reducer right there so if I say ello
example and i refresh my screen now I'm
gonna get a state by default I'm gonna
have an area of ello perfect so now
we're gonna jump on the we're gonna
change the way we fetch the home screen
so right now we fetch the home screen by
doing a call from the API so we called
that right there but we're gonna change
that and make it
redox well the other thing I want to do
first thing it's go to my P I here and
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make this
line right there inside that try-catch
try like this and I'm gonna make a catch
I'm gonna
ever and I'm gonna console.log ever if I
receive one so if I do this everything
in that supposed break right there
perfect everything so now oh I work with
Redux so I'm gonna open back my screen
here so here you see so my own page of
my own screen for me it's its own
application so that's why in my own ear
I'm gonna create an action folder and
file that action oh sorry
they rename this one to action that GS
and I'm gonna create my own reducer for
this on screen that's it
so for my action gonna be gonna be easy
you're gonna see it's the only thing
we're gonna do we're gonna import from
the API file we're going to import meter
epi here we're gonna do cons meet epi
equal new bit of epi so if you follow
what we done on the other video it's
almost we just do what we did here but
now we're gonna put it inside an action
after that first thing I always create I
create my constant for my type name I
always put that upper case and we do
this cuz I don't want to put a string
inside my reducer and get some tipo so
here I'm gonna just say fetch my meter
cause at the end what we fetch it's my
meter that's here I'm gonna curl I'm
gonna create an action called fetch my
feet up this one gonna take no argument
and you're gonna return a type so you
return an object
fetch my meat up for the type name and a
pillow we're gonna be my meter that
fetch group like that so this is a
premises so by default if I do this I'm
gonna get my fetching stuff coming from
redox really from with promises by the
focus of the redox promise middle
so now so now I think here what I'm
gonna do
it's now I'm gonna jump to my own screen
what I'm gonna chain so I'm gonna just
put my component at the top like this
perfect now I can remove this line of
code my line 8 I can remove a meet-up I
can remove this one now I can remove
this tree line and now I can remove my
state here and I also can remove all
this oh I'm gonna do this now I'm gonna
import I'm gonna import connect from
react redux yeah I'm gonna use decorator
so I'm gonna use connect right there so
it's the same of when you put export
default at the bottom I'm gonna signal
and here I'm gonna put my action I'm
gonna call right there so import from
action and the name it's I think it's
fetcher my Meetup yeah
so now I'm gonna put my fetch Meetup and
dispatch meter right here inside my car
name now I'm gonna call it right with my
component in mouth so I'm going to just
need to do this that perhaps that fetch
meetup like that so my kind of parenting
mode by default gonna call that is that
curve that fetch meter so if I do this
what are we gonna see now I'm gonna get
my premise everything cannot read
property loading because now I have no
anymore eluding and but don't worry
we're gonna change all that so it's
almost like TDD but with some view so so
here we're gonna jump under any place on
the reducer so oh I think about we do so
for me we do sorry it's like it's like
the schema of your database so for me my
store it's like my database so I'm
talking with you like if we think about
the backend stuff so my story is like my
database my redo so it's like my schema
Mac ssin is my controller so I figure
like oh I work here it's like almost the
same like I play with my controller and
after that I move my schema so yeah I'm
gonna import from
action fire so if you remember I'm gonna
import my constant here my constant
called fetch meet up after that I'm
gonna create initial initial state
object so this is how I'm gonna work
with that because my own page gonna add
more than just one piece of video store
of data so yeah I'm gonna call my Meetup
that's gonna be another object so an
object where I have another object
inside that and in this one I'm gonna
have data to be an empty string by
default I'm gonna add is fetch to be
follows by default and I'm gonna add
error where it's an object where I'm
gonna have on so if I have an error and
I'm gonna add message so that's gonna be
the message ever if I have anyone I said
that I'm gonna create my we do sir
so for the one oops initial state for
the one who want to know how I write
this code like really quicker with my
snippet I'm gonna put the link on the
description too this is my own snippet I
think it may just sense what we can do
it
so here it's gonna be pretty simple
so here I'm gonna say inside a dollar
sign I'm gonna call my fetch meetup in
here I'm gonna add pending so this is a
three stage of when you work with
promises the first stage is spending the
second state if you fill and the third
stage
it's the reject so this is when you get
a problem after that here when I'm gonna
return pending the only thing I want to
return it's my initial State Eenie so
stick when it's fulfill so when we
receive data what I want so I'm gonna
recall I'm gonna recall back this one
and now what I'm gonna do so I'm gonna
make it like I want so my payload and my
dad are gonna be my action that pillow
my is fetched gonna be true by default
and my ever gonna stay like that why I
don't do like dot dot dot state and
everything like this and keep my error
cause if I make some kind of we want
like refresh screening because I get an
error
I want my row to come back to fall so
that's why I've been calling right there
so after that only thing I need to do
for when I receive an error so one I
reject now what I'm gonna do it's my
today gonna stay on empty every stretch
it's true no my error no it's now true
and my message now gonna be error when
fetching my Meetup perfect so now what
I'm gonna do here I'm gonna go to back
to my page error when I import my home
screen so inside my index inside my own
folder I'm gonna import home reducer
from reduce our and I'm gonna export it
now I can jump back to my reducer here
I'm gonna import from my screen because
I imported inside my index now I can
just type O reduce or yeah so now I'm
gonna change fate to be ohm so I'm
calling it so this is all work with
rehang nesib my reduce are gonna have
the name of the screen so when it's
state only below I screen I'm gonna put
it inside the screen name and I'm gonna
just say o reducer perfect so now if the
page refresh so if the console we fit we
are supposed to get here the state by
default now we get an object where data
is fair error and everything so
everything we put inside the initial
state so now I'm time to play with the
home screen so what I want you to
understand it's when we're gonna put the
connect and we're gonna put the my
meetup stay this is the object we're
gonna get from this that perhaps that
might need up cuz oh I'm gonna work with
that create a new line here create a new
line right there close this connect this
here I'm gonna do my callback for my
Maps state props here what I'm gonna say
it's my meetups going to
go to state that own that my meet up so
what I want I do this if I console.log
right there
console ugh this that probe that my
meetups if I do this what you gonna see
right there one sick you see I get my
meetup stuff right there
so my data my error it should ever know
what I may be thing okay no okay so now
what we gonna do there for making the
the component working with the reducer
so now here I'm gonna dis truck you
quote these that props I'm gonna
district from these that traps that my
meet up like that I'm gonna this truck
my my fetch my data and also my ever so
I think just for now I'm gonna just make
this a prop like that so we I make a
mistake too so I'm gonna put my meet up
so the name of I passed right there my
meet up in this one I'm gonna diss track
again I'm gonna dis truck I'm gonna dis
truck is fetch I'm gonna destroy data
I'm gonna eat this tour error so now
what I'm gonna do my loading gonna be if
my is fetch is false so if I do this and
i refresh my screen now I get is fetch
it on the phone please switch it on the
fine
cannot read what it is fetch it on the
fine so what I got is fetch it to be
true
oh I think I maybe make one mistake this
that prove that fresh media right now
and my action
right there one sec I'm gonna look here
that's gonna be really you have my feet
up right there no I'm supposed to be
good yeah I get my fulfill right there
so we see I get my pending pending
fulfill and fulfill again what I'm gonna
do here so when is fetch so when it's
found after that else if error that on
it's true what I'm gonna show its I'm
gonna just show a simple ever so I'm
gonna just show on some pearl return
view with text in we're gonna see the
message ever may say just for now I
don't gonna design this one and else ear
and I'm gonna change this I said the
meet up to be only data now if i refresh
my screen no I get a weird thing
happening it's fetch is undefined so
yeah so life cutting so we're gonna do
boy so it's fetch is coming from my
meter and coming from my prep so I'm
gonna do a console log these are props
first
okay perfect so that is that props is
this thing right there so now I have my
Meetup it's under fine and I mean up was
an object right there so err my meetup
was so here I'm gonna find what I miss
yeah this thing is perfect this thing is
working after that I have my own screen
right there oh I have every setup so cuz
they're so we got almost like all life
cold in front of you so that's why we
get some weird problem but at least you
get the idea about how I'm our ID bug
after that so what I'm eating it's I
make a mistake with my API call
so if I come back to my API right there
let my constant if I go back to my API
what I have it's my my data
dispatch yeah here I have no problem at
all hmm my payload right there because
this is not the problem cause now my
redox right there I've the pillow cannot
be properly stretch off undefined so I
must have one word problem right there
is fetch to be true it's fetch to be
true initial State
here am i oh I see hey I need to return
all my video sir so here that was my
program because you remember the this
reducer right there
it's an object inside of the object and
what I do now it just I'm returning a
plain object so here I make the mistake
so here what I hear oh you need to do
it's my meet up gonna equal to this
thing right there and this is gonna be
the same with my meter just find out is
gonna be the way we're gonna play with
it I know everything supposed to work by
default
perfect so now as you see this is the
redox logger I get my fetch pending
first so my state of my own was my
meetup was plain stuff and my fulfill
when I get it back I get my every so I
get my pillow
that was my every so that's why my new
stain on my own it's a data of 10 stuff
and error object where I'm SH Neil and
on falls and if I get any message I'm
gonna get era when fetching my meet up
so that's it so that was the video for
today for redox next video I'm gonna and
we're gonna add native base so this is
like a boot strapped for react native
and we're gonna play with the form for
add new meter so hope you learned a bit
and you see how I do me and I'm sorry
for the boy so hope you had a good day
