of an F figure out how to make the
computer was that all I mean just
because when you want to update like a
boolean like that you want to know what
is the value of the ones first and I
because I really like to patch when I
use I something like MongoDB or
something like that it's easy inside a
controller to my the update everything
but now I mean I just figure out that
I'm gonna make a put so I put you need
to send the full object to make the
change so we're going to make the put
after we get the dispatch to the the
community Docs so what are we going to
do
it's the insider action finally so
they're complete to do again the same
area I'm going to make it success and
I'm gonna make error so here and say the
complete idea here that's going to be
now missing the dispatch and now I'm
going to need to the get state so here
here what we can do is I'm gonna first
thing to make I'm going to make a wait
dispatch type of complete to do and I'm
going to send ID so that's going to be
the first thing like we gotta change the
to do like you are like to to be false
and false mutual that's it and because
it's like a promises so we can avoid
here after that what I'm going to do
here now I'm going to do current to do
equal get state the to do to do that
data so almost like you we can
copy/paste this thing here cuz finally
we want to we want to send the the full
to do object to the API so this way we
add the to do of what we need for send
to the API now I'm going to add a try
catch all that stick gonna work it's
going to be this one going to be we just
need to add
type of complete to do error we need to
have the error and we need to have the
ID so finally we just make it like it
was before so I don't know if you follow
what I try to say but funny if we have
an error we just finally toggle again
the boolean but for the EPI so we're
going to create the API really now it's
just a Singh complete to do I'm going to
take an ID and a we're going to try I
guess Dante the ID let's take the to do
and a catch Simon error I'm going to
true that ever so e dot yeah I'm going
to return our wait Axios cannot type
good now because we need the idea in
sometimes we're going to do that app
slash to do that ID and we're going to
send it to do so now here inside its
here I'm going to do a way and to do the
API that complete to do and I pass my to
do right in after that I returned
dispatch tie-off complete to do success
like this so now if I go to my video so
now I need to change this thing here
because the complete to do now going to
be in final object added up state data
gonna be equal to this thing but now is
take that data add up when so now I need
to import complete to error and continue
to do success complete to do success
like always return state another type
another tip I can show if it's here I
can
case complete to do success okay
come delete to do success so like you
can waterfall every if you success you
have so like here are my pit to do
success my so now I can remove it from
here my complete to do success I'm gonna
put ear ear it's already as my fetch to
do success don't take it and now my so
you see like you can make this way so
now I can remove this in here but now my
case complete to do error now what I
need to do and I'm going to copy paste
this thing and that's the curse thing
about it the videos are going to have
changer but we want to reach change it
that's what to do yeah is it like that
so now we just need to do the same
inside the app so we're going to go
inside the to do component and app that
yeah we have the end all complete so
we're going to send this and I'll
complete to the to do here so and the
width of the - here let me the same of
the delete like that and to do the
delete and time like to do I'm going to
have my end I'll complete now on change
change and the complete here I want a
typo so let me do so yeah but since then
an object so now we don't know
so now if I toggle I'm not even sure so
we're going to refresh on now here we
have evening Falls so if I toggle this
one now I get complete to do success and
now if I refer this one I shall have the
last one to be true so you see if I
click on one now my well going to be too
too if I found come in so if I don't
complete it now my was going to be false
and now if I have an error so whenever
I'm going to toggle and things on world
yeah the complete is false but the state
didn't change so complete its fall but
this value didn't change so something to
look but my state is working because I
complete and now it's solved but you key
so it's something we can like take more
time but like this story all were just
me thinking about I need to just show me
dogs really quick to pure source to some
people so I just make it really quick
nothing it's before I know sorry for
that so you can see like an owl life
code so if you have some comments a
comment just let me know I'm gonna done
this one for this I'm going to do the
delete I'll complete another it day but
don't worry I'm going to make other
external I'm going to continue the media
app too and I'm going to make an alert
so yeah now we're gonna add a back in
and I want to show you my Derby boy I've
create past weekend I want to show you
