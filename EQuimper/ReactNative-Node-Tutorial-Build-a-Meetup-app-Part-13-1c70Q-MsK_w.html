we're going to consider tutorial sorry
for the PAX 2 we get it in make video so
today what we're going to do is we're
going to continue with the logging so
don't know where it's or plus it's like
the almost laughs the last part are
logging in the front end so time to
germinate so what are we going to do is
we're going to update dividend see as
always we're going to remove the
debugger open we're going to create a
Google app and we're going to set up the
logging with Google so here delete line
9 we don't going to use anymore the
debugger so this app we're going to add
something more better for this after
that we're going to run yard upgrade
direct see you after that we're going to
do es Lian we have native element great
extent today everything else and react
native does Expo manage it for when is
going to be done we're going to remove
the non module and we're going to do sir
be sure everything's working
perfect we don't really need the Nomo
just so what do I'm going to run it's
yarn oh okay perfect so now after that
if we can run X start to start exponent
the time this is starting we're going to
jump air and we're going to create we're
going to create an app so if you go to a
console and so funny I'm going to show
you if you go to the new website of Expo
so they change the design and I really
love it so they take time to take a look
of that if you go air you can go inside
their Google in the left they show you
what to do so we're gonna just do the
credential for the iOS but you can just
follow for the Android so go to the
credential power page after that when
you came here just create another
project and Eric I cannot so unlike you
have another one
but what you need to do finally is
really simple it's air you told you
everything we need to do is create an
app after that I go there click on the
create credential oh Alki and ID
after that you there you see configured
on Sun screen after that I'm going to
project name we're going to say meetup
me so the name of the app as I click on
place as I are we're going to use iOS
and inside the bundle ID just copy paste
this line here both apps apps exponent
ok create perfect we have it take you so
click on copy right here after that
inside the content right there we're
going to create new files google config
so after that what we're going to need
to do is we're going to create this
thing and we're gonna call it export
default and we're going to call it the
client ID iOS and just paste what they
give you save it and after that it's
ready to get the views after that air in
the expo start again start to open the
iOS part
and that sense my first in the by if you
get some memory sorry my computer is
really really slow so
you enjoy the smaller video I try to
make it less than two a minute it's
better for you to do my ear my big
accent for one hour so this one going to
be good to go
always long to bundle the first start of
the day after that we good to go
and add something to tell you at the end
of the video so maybe I can say right
now the time this thing is done it's I'm
planning to make an OG s to tell y'all
anything any internet parallel with this
one going to be deep with no GS at the
deeper I can with Mike knowledge and so
I want to like show you like also use
webpack in the server and our setup but
education and all this stuff so I would
like to know if this is a course people
like you want to to to get so I know if
this is a good idea to make so I would
like to know this in the comment so time
to play with some Google out ear line to
add Google ear so we're going to add
Google from Expo after that shift
command D copy paste the same line do
ear command D on Facebook counting and
type Google confit after that here we're
going to create another function called
logging with Google so this is already
set up cause of this one here and here
it's really easy to do the only thing
you're going to do is a try CAPTCHA so
you're going to have a an error I'm
going to just through the orokin now in
here I'm going to see current result
equal weight Google that load anything
and here we take an object and the
object going to be iOS client ID may be
equal to 0 config that client ID iOS and
the scope going to be equal to or what
we asked and we're going to ask for the
profile and finally the email in cokes
like that that that ear we didn't just
do if result the type equal equal equal
success so if we have a success
we're going to do something else elk
we're going to just return canceled
again to be true like that so here what
we're going to do for now
alert alert like that like we did on
what ear I'm going to log with Google
and finally we're going to just put the
result that access to can just to see if
that's work we can save after that we
just need to add what we have already so
on press we're going to set up Google
perfect
so now Facebook is working when I click
we have Facebook like before but now
when I click on connect with Google now
I get to continue with me down me click
on my name and if it's working logging
with this book and now I get my token
perfect so that was it for this video
next video we're going to jump on the
server and be ready to make we're going
to make the connection with the token
and make it available to now log and
after that going to be time to work with
adding a meet-up and do stuff like this
so hope you enjoy the video as I said
before I'm playing to me a no GS course
and parallel with this one that it's
going to be like a one one video each
week on maybe more to the no GS because
I've already make something about the no
GS if you want to see what we're going
to build with the new GS course I'm
gonna be some something like I did with
my new GS
if the eyeball or play right there so
it's a big project I've done and I want
to make a video about how I make it and
what I learned and maybe that can help
you to make you know GS API so I hope
you enjoyed the video I'm going to again
space out the description and all the
stuff in the description with my repo so
quit out later have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
