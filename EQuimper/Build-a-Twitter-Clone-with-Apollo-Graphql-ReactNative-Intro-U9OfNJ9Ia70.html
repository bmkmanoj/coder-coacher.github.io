hello if you want long time I didn't
make video sorry about that
so what we're going to build a day as
you can see here in the simulator going
to build some kind of Twitter clone so
that's going to be another tutorial
about react native and I'm going to add
the stack rescue with Apollo client also
we're going to make use of MongoDB and
no GS so finally we're going to create a
server and everything first thing this
is not a course about design so if the
design looks like what you want sorry
about that this is more about feature we
can have subscription so real-time
update we're going to optimistic UI and
we can add other stuff flights and how
to how to maybe like a send education
and stuff like this so here what I have
right now it's nothing crazy we had some
data coming from the backend and you can
see if i refresh on my screen that's
going to persist or yes so this is
coming from the backend another stuff I
put to is the placeholder so if you see
really quick we get the place older
loading kind of Facebook loader after
that I can live video in the video tweet
so as you can see at the top left we see
when I fetch to the server I guess some
kind of loading also if I clean another
tweet hello well and I tweet here right
there we get optimistic you I don't need
to refresh I get that right there and I
can like my stuff whatever another stuff
so here okay yes that looks okay and I
think really crazy I mean I can refresh
and I get my stuff I can go to my
profile and have one tweet and to like
if I like here and I come back here it's
just like so this is all from the cache
thanks to upload to make that but the
crazy part is there sorry I'm going to
cut another user so I'm going to create
a brand new user I'm going to take it so
can and I'm going to go there where I'm
going to create another
another tweet so I'm going to put that
right there in a savior and now if I
send that look here on the right and
same time if I sell well as you can see
I get a real update of what I do so I
mean this is pretty awesome this is with
the website yet kind of pretty awesome
what we can make with that and this is
pretty easy so here if I do get sweet so
I'm going to just take every tweet right
now I'm going to take the first one here
is to make it easy for us to see that so
what I'm going to do is here if I'm
going to cover it at week I'm going to
make a mutation I'm going to say farmer
it's a tweet I need an ID and the only
thing I'm going to take for now is the
ID and the favor returned so now I want
you to see the little error here what
can happen if I send that now as you can
see I get a real update so when someone
lies from like another mobile I'm gonna
get the real update here and I think
it's pretty awesome and now here if I I
can be like it we move from realm no one
and as you can see that's pretty I think
this is cool this is not crazy but after
that I can I'm gonna have to I can log
out and I can come back to my account
sorry I'm going to be put in my name put
my name and I'm going to log and now I
see that's reload and I get back to
where I was before and I get my user
here with my four light and stuff like
that so that's this is the intro this is
what are we going to do I hope you're
gonna like it as you can see this is
another that is the same well what I
done before back to the project first I
show you the intro with the project not
gonna build it's not like the other one
why I was kind of confused I mean I just
started to cope and I also don't speech
but now I'm going to know what I build
to the N and for another thing you're
gonna see which feature we're going to
build in same time also
we're going to use all the version as
you dear so that's going to be much more
simpler for you but if we start of when
we start the video we don't going to do
like what I did before with you like 15
minutes of just in telling a new version
so I hope you enjoyed and without in the
next video add a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
