milestone introduction so here we're
gonna talk about what we gonna do for
this week so the feature we're gonna
bill is going to be the light photo is
gonna be pretty simple but don't don't
worry we get hung a lot from that so you
as you can see this is what we're gonna
do we need to create I mean we're gonna
need to create a reaction context so we
have already at post context for the
photo but we're gonna need and we have a
user also but we're gonna need also
context for the reaction so the
reactions going to be what where we
gonna put the light for the photo and
also the follow reaction what I mean by
the photo is gonna be when we're gonna
follow another user or anything like
that so we can put that all in the same
reaction context after that we're gonna
also do a mutation for liking the photo
so as you know we have to well we don't
have like a put pose touch delete and
thing like that we work with only a
Korean mutation and also subscription
but for here we just need a mutations
gonna be for finally doing what kind of
a post and it's gonna be about creating
a light funny like for this photo and
also we're gonna update the UI for
following that stage what I mean by that
it's example if the user have like a
photo you want to show into the in the
screen so he's gonna have like a pink or
red or thing like that and when you
don't follow unlike this photo I mean
it's gonna have an empty earth I know so
what are we gonna learn on this one is
going to be about the many-to-many
redirection reduction so it's gonna be
pretty nice to learn how to do this with
Phoenix and you're gonna Sao ecto with
the kind of om om manager for your data
but it's going to be pretty simple and
you get a shake - it's a video awesome
for that and after that we're gonna
learn all to use this many-to-many
relation in a graph QL endpoint and
we're gonna learn also about the
optimistic UI with Apollo if you don't
know yet what is optimistic UI it's a
way finally for you to show kind of a
real-time update to your user without
reading the request in the server so
what I mean by that it's
well you as the server to like the photo
and you want to show the like the earth
change only after the the server give
you like a true or false boolean if this
is like my coin up thing it's if the
server take ones are going to response
that going to look pretty well in the
the screen of the user but by doing an
empty mystic UI you can change their UI
without waiting for this server and that
can be really awesome for giving more
like more steam in you in your front-end
application finally so I hope you're
gonna like what are we gonna do for this
week and I hope at least you have
learned a lot from this series right now
already and we're gonna talk together
and a good night of real bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
