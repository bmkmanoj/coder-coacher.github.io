sorry about that
so today what we gonna do it's we're
gonna update again some dependency like
I said I want you to keep always the
latest version and don't worry I'd test
before doing this stuff so we're gonna
update dependency we're gonna update my
Iceland config where I did some tweak
about it I'm gonna show you how to make
the auto fix working in Visual Studio
code plug in your terminal after that I
want to make the route the route block
if the user is not at all skate so we're
gonna make it with the navigator after
that we're gonna talk about the design
so I make some beds a mixture so don't
judge me there I'm not a designer and
finally we're gonna create an out page
just the basic design for the first page
and after that for make us ready to work
on the Facebook Google logging in the
next to Ibiza so we're gonna start again
we're gonna upgrade oh great all there
the dependency so you don't upgrade a
directive so we're gonna update exponent
mo man we're gonna have the react native
element we're gonna do mode mode the
time picker redox form Axios after that
we're gonna update my yes lien react
native debugger in redox logger when
everything it's good we're gonna start
exponent so I'm gonna jump on my
terminal don't forget to open the
backend I'm gonna jump on the mobile and
when everything is done I'm gonna start
it
after that you can SM gonna miss one of
the package and makers of my air config
that's gonna be es Lin in himself we're
gonna add it I just make it cuz now we
can like our to fix with the terminal
and they didn't know it before so and we
can auto fix with Visual Studio code too
if all that I'm gonna show you perfect
so as you can see we miss yes Lee and so
we're gonna do yarn add / D so in their
dependency piously
so that for me sure we're gonna do X
start oops I delete so it's a good thing
for you global and X but I know I I need
to make it with NPM cuz I get a bug with
yarn sorry
yesterday I clean up all my know the
stuff so one thing so for that one we
don't know X is just like exponent but
in the terminal so we don't need to open
the the X there for that I'm gonna
install this in in this in this time now
what we can do is I'm gonna add some
comment in my package is own for this
name inside my package JSON I'm gonna go
to the script here and I'm gonna create
two script one we're gonna be a script
but Clint and that's gonna be
yes lien or sorry see in the main that
GI so the folder SRC in the minute GS
file and after that I'm going to Lee and
fix and that's going to be es lint that
- fix ur Lucy and main degeus perfect so
if I do this you know I'm gonna have a
lot of problem if I do yarn alliant I'm
gonna have a lot of es lien problem
because what I've done with my new ESN
is add the commenting here so this is a
como at the last line of everything but
don't worry we don't need to make all
this change that's why I have the lien
fixed first but what I want to show you
today - it's out to make it with Visual
Studio code I'm gonna show you Visual
Studio : after that we're gonna fix
everything
so if you type command coma and you go
here inside your visual Zucco if you can
add this line
yes Lynn auto fix unsafe and you pass it
as true if you do this what's gonna
happen it's now if I go to example my
reducer so I'm gonna go to my reducer as
you can see here I've missing twinning
Como missing everywhere but now if I say
you see I put a comma everywhere so
unsaved my yesterday I'm gonna configure
everything so now my reducer it's good
so I can jump on the home screen and
that's going to be the same if I say
everything it's saving but because I
don't want you to I get all this pain to
me we're gonna just run yarn lengths fix
and that's going to fix everything for
us and now one error this is a warning
so because we just put fixing it with
the warning so we keep the console so
now everything have a comedy girl
perfect after that we're gonna jump on
exponent we're gonna start I hope I
don't have other problem with like maybe
watch me because I think because I get
problem with my know the instance
yesterday so I we start everything
for now we finish yes Liam I'll show you
the terminal after that I want to work
on the attach station route this thing
get some CPU
yeah sorry for my slow computer
and don't forget I put everything again
there I put the link I found useful on
my ghetto and don't need state to came
there and see the new change and you can
like just clone yet if you want and for
the one who don't know if you have an
exponent on your cell phone you can take
this QR code and open it in your cell
phone but because I want to show you on
my computer we're gonna run X iOS hope
everything gonna work
you
you
let's see gonna bundle everything and I
think I'm gonna get one program and
that's gonna be with redox logger with
October from the version 2 to the
version 3 it change one thing so this is
what I'm gonna show you I really think
that's going to be the program so
yeah so I get in Logar and stem so what
are we gonna do is we're gonna go to the
store right there and now logger so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just remove it
from here I'm gonna do import create
logger from low gear I'm gonna just
delete it from here
and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
just change the name here for Crete
Luger that's it no if I say it should be
to go now yeah perfect
now notification and there this is not
what we want we want to create a
toxication page for that so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna just create them
make the basic attached occasion page
just to get something to to show but
what I'm gonna do it's inside my screen
here I'm gonna create a folder called
authentication sorry authentication just
out and I'm gonna create a login screen
just for now we're gonna change it in
the next episode but just for now so
that's going to be stateless component
we're gonna just take for now text and
you after that ear what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna just make it or we can already
create it as a component cuz I know
we're gonna need it in the next
it's a oops sorry so that's going to be
logging screen for my snippet don't
worry I'm gonna again put the link on
the description you want to install it
so login page perfect as you can see I
saving everything came like ESN asked to
do perfect
after that we draw on the out here we're
gonna create index like always and I'm
gonna import
screen from looking screen and I'm gonna
export it okay it's good no I say boom
perfect so now what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna jump on the navigator port so on
my route here I'm gonna create a file
called a navigator that yes to what
we're gonna do - its I'm gonna install
and navigation we do so right there this
one gonna be really easy so finally what
I want its to plug with the reducer plug
with Redux
the the nav but don't worry we're gonna
jump yet after that and I just forget to
yeah so now I'm gonna do a companion
here I'm gonna make I'm gonna import
something from react navigation and
that's gonna be something called a
navigation Network yeah after that I'm
gonna import connect for me docks that
I'm gonna import logging screen from
screen I'm gonna import navigator from
the navigator and after that I'm gonna
create app navigate our component we can
make it a proof function but I'm gonna
use a component here just cause later
I'm gonna show you what I want to make
yeah I'm gonna use connects from Redux
with the decorator I'm going to say
navigation gonna equal to state
navigation don't worry we're gonna
create this reducer and I'm gonna create
to a state of user like that
oh I like to call it more out like this
oh yeah oh can get user perfect so now
here what I'm gonna do it's inside a
render now here I'm going to return the
login screen here
because here what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna do Khan's navigation so I'm going
to create a navigation right there it's
equal to the add navigation helper take
an object with a dispatch that's going
to equal this that probe the dispatch we
get that cuz we connect from redux
I said I'm gonna have the state who it's
equal to this that props the navigation
so this is the navigation we came right
there I save everything yeah yeah after
that year
if this that props that user login so
this is a boolean here I'm gonna create
it don't worry
hey I'm gonna return so here I'm gonna
put the Navigator then B yes sir so the
one we had before and I'm gonna say
navigation it's equal to navigation like
that now if I want to now I'm gonna jump
on my we do so we do sir and now what
I'm gonna do there is I'm gonna import
router from up navigator and I'm gonna
export default I thought whoops export I
cannot type function Navi gation we do
so on state in action like that
now a I'm gonna do continue state equal
to router all that are you can find it
in the dock so I don't in vain a I don't
do nothing they're creating here for
action
so get state from action I'm gonna pass
my action and my stain coming from so
that gonna came from my redox store and
now here I'm gonna return a new state or
I'm gonna return this thing you know
perfect so now what left us to do on
this part it's now I'm gonna jump on the
reduce or of redux
I'm gonna jump on the reducer here now
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna import
navigation from route and navigation
reducer and ear after form or before if
you want the ocean like that key value
the same perfect now because I'm gonna
use the user reducer what I need it's to
create one so that's gonna be really
easy for now inside the out I'm going to
create a reducer and the only thing I'm
gonna do for now is I'm gonna create a
reducer and you're gonna have on you an
object with log it to be felt by default
like that and for now I'm gonna return
that tip and so now I'm gonna import we
do so I'm gonna import oh we do store
like that so now I can jump on my index
in here because this is something I
forget from out because I want to import
everything here so that's why I can use
it in the screen sorry if you get
confuse there and now I'm gonna jump on
my reducer on the redox and now I can
out reducer and I'm gonna do user it's
out we do so all we shall keep it
consistent and type it user user reducer
sorry about that it's better to make it
right now and to make it user really so
like that perfect now what we left us to
do
it's we need to change the route so this
route here don't gonna go with the
Navigator anymore you're gonna go with
the app navigator now if I make it here
and now they're gonna break all the
application
so now I get in the fan it's not gonna
be a writer so I make right yeah so here
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do export
counts rather equal app you're going to
equal the
they call the navigator that router
right now
perfect now I get my legging page
showing about that so now we have the
login page so now I'm gonna talk about
design so I'm really sorry about this
it's all gonna talk about design so this
is what we're gonna make today just this
page but that's gonna be the flow we're
gonna create on the next - episode - so
we're gonna get this like landing at
education page why we see me that me
will come some work on message and here
we're gonna add a sign up sign in button
so when you click sign up we're gonna
get to this page with a you can close it
came back here so here the first time
I'm gonna see sign up here with avatar
and so when you click you can choose a
photo so we're gonna take a photo a
profile photo and after that I'm gonna
type is full name so this is a local at
education here you're gonna have email
and you're gonna type this password and
gonna click create so this is if you
want to keep local if you want to go to
Facebook we're gonna take our Facebook
or your Google is the same you're gonna
take the profile picture so it don't
gonna need this one here so down here
when you're gonna sign in what are you
gonna go up its we're gonna see the big
meetup me a name email password sending
again with Facebook and Google in there
if you don't have a sign icon gonna sign
up so we're gonna jump right there so as
you can see I'm not a big designer but I
just make the flow for you and see
what's gonna happen so I'm gonna close
better than me and this is what we're
gonna do but I want to show you a new
technology to work with and that's going
to be styled component style
sorry about that I get someone on the
door so so we're gonna continue there so
yeah so style component let you like
create component with like only styling
at the like only for styling so like
here I'm gonna create a title gonna be a
style with a h1 and gonna put like the
standing Raider and what I really like
about it you work on where penny Morgan
that'd only thing you need to change it
to import it from the edgy like that
and that's work for the with the CSS to
reality perfect so we install you know
time to play with so what I'm gonna do
it's a we're gonna jump on the login
screen and now we're gonna start to
design it so I'm gonna show you some tip
I found about designing and so what I'm
gonna do here is I'm gonna do import
style from react native like that and
the first thing we're gonna create is
the Flex container so we're going to
create a Flex contain our component
we're gonna only be a style with view
like that and this one gonna take
effects of one justify contain of center
and a line item of center as you can see
it's it's like CSS playing here so now
if I say and everything is supposed to
work perfect I get my login page right
in the middle
perfect after that what I want here is
I'm gonna create all within my meetup me
title so I'm gonna reopen but let me
just to let you know what we build right
now perfect so yeah so again John we're
gonna create meetup me so what I'm gonna
do here so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna separate that on three flex so all
the big one is flex one here I'm gonna
have a flex of like almost one flex off
maybe 0.6 and another flex air so this
is all I'm gonna work with the Flex box
stuff
