so now I think I'm gonna need to do some
mutation
if you create a like thing we'll just
between a boolean so it's you have like
or not so you're going to know if you
favorite photo or not and you're gonna
need a photo ID who's gonna be a type of
no nil ID and also after that in my
reaction and I'm gonna call that create
light so here I'm gonna have nothing I'm
going to have the photo ID and I'm gonna
have nothing after degree man so now I
want to create a lie so I think my photo
I have many user lights and I use our
many photo like so user I can have many
photo he likes and photo can have many
user you like but you can like on you
one time one photo so here inside my
create right there what I think would be
the best idea
it's I need to search first if it's
exist if it exists I delete it if not I
create it
yeah I think this is what I need to do
here
frumpy in no it's not that it's going to
be in reaction dot our color like photo
where the p dot photo ID equal for IDI
pass and oops and I don't like you I
don't detect no I don't detect my M
where that user ID so for now I'm gonna
see the user ID I'm gonna say use
already equal one so I'm gonna get my
ten like that after that I'm gonna say
like equal people that one three after
that if like equal nil oops
if like it's nail I need to create one
so you're gonna say I'm gonna see
reaction
we're like photo where I'm gonna tell
the photo ID and the user ID and one
this thing it's done I'm gonna return ok
and now that mean you have liked this
photo else I'm gonna say reaction the
thing that's gonna be delete photo
really like for you daily large photo
and I'm gonna pass the like okay I'm
gonna say no you don't like it anymore
hey are you so right now yes I have
already some like so if so I cannot like
the photo ID number in mine so we're
gonna test it we are like I need pad
passed mine oops
and now if hear that word I'm supposed
to receive false yep
so you see so here I did select so I
select the career I find okay so that
means you drive like this thing we see
this career finally just for saying like
if this user have this
dislike so it's a many-to-many so as you
can see in the DB I save both ID so user
ID in the photo ID and finally here that
mean the user have liked this photo so
if I select again now it's not so now if
I click again I'm supposed to receive
true and now if I do this again now we
receive 1 &amp;amp; 9 again so now that means
the user can like a photo so now this
kind of career here I think I can just
make it inside my inside my reaction and
I'm gonna just say get user like it use
our lips where I'm gonna pass some
argument and finally what I'm gonna do
it's I'm gonna think I'm gonna just
check oh yeah
they get yeah like a Judas pass this
thing seeing then these things gonna
came from all that photo and arts the
user ID and finally returning
we pull that one like that so now here I
can remove this thing and sing right
there or I'm gonna pass the for ID and
use already like that so now if it's a
word you not work
oops
Oh era what I can do to hear its I can
just say we pull that get by remember
the things that it's just get
really one of 26
20 oh no Tokui is there for some time
you get some weird problem like example
if a doctor is not there I'm gonna
receive kind of this kind of error like
maybe not this one here but you can
receive some error like a P that pay a
photo ID like cannot exist something
like that it's because you need to
import a library or if you want to do
this kind of code right there no just
syntax before print SC we pull that one
okay so finally what I think at then
26 what I did wrong
I don't know whatever okay
you
think this movie can worry
not again the best in this pattern met
all that's gonna be on your key
this will be my
here if I do this now I'm going to get
that
No
any people one
I was good
yeah I was good I mean this thing here I
don't mean that I can't just see that so
it was working
oh this thing I don't need that could
call me after that
err why this Neil don't get go so get
user like here my reaction
this thing exists oh man I know oh my
god
I'm so done
I think it master with my if statement
then they're effective
okay and now if I want to get working
this one big photo like comes here
should we sit at least one for the
number nine
hey then are you I'm good you just
really tired so so I do my like scheme
use our photo light poles use our like
for photo
okay so likes can no no integer K era
because I don't know
kkkk
think this is how you're supposed to oh
I can do the aggregate
it will be better if I
I'm now
that's true aggregates give me the kind
of dessert yeah but I don't need to so
familiar would be the Sun eternal number
visit our blog post
I can just come the number he created he
made of aggregates some
I mean I'm gonna go the other way and
that was this thing I was searching
from L in reaction like photo yes why L
at photo ID equal the flu idea give you
their select Frank man with the count
that and after that air should return
this thing here like that yeah so now so
now okay so now my photo number nine
have zero like so if I say mutation and
I say photo number nine so now I have
one so now if I fetch again I receive
number one right there
so one and now I should receive zero
I have the number of consoles
okay so
so the only thing I think I miss here
world
Instagram I never used this app so
whenever I know so one sec so I think
I'll miss ya
no thank you so now what I have already
done so here I can show the avatar in
the username I can shoot a photo good
after that I can show the like here
after that year I think I've put this
color there I'm gonna just stick here
Wow computer is really really slow
okay
infinitely when you like I think really
what happened when you like in in
Instagram one sec I'm gonna like a photo
like you yeah so this thing become full
now
but cannot oh yeah I can no I cannot
maybe I am art okay they have this kind
of art here
I mean this earth
the same
and this one I think this one looks like
the one they are no
so yeah so you see this is a simple line
icon
so looks like material thing material
should have the good one all front arson
yeah so photo awesome we'll add this one
and they have the empty one this one too
really
okay
I'm not sure but I think I can create a
symbol and symbol
okay yeah this is what I want
okay so this is what they say this okay
yeah remember
yeah this thing deplete a okay now we
need the diesel cable if you don't
okay
finally it's not one symbol it's two
symbol Ani
I see
like this
yep so now when you like it's like this
when you bookmark something ok so
finally when this thing is booked more
it's going to be still
I mean the name I'm guessing nope
bookmark nope that's it
and finally this one was from material
and now this one I can say bookmark yes
and I can move it
look monk no yes
for this one it's yes I'm gonna just
change the color and I'm gonna sell as V
maybe when it's feel is this one if not
this one - okay perfect so this is all
that looks and when you just finally
when I click here okay and when we just
finish to say they have something here
no border it's kind of white like this
and here the save to collection sorry
about this design stuff I mean I just
want to make sure then the corner I
gotta give is gonna be a good one so so
for me before I designed this thing
really helped me so locate 2014 I want
15 like you the only thing I don't like
it's this number of like this one I can
create a symbol to I'm gonna say like
cons a and I'm glad just updated
because this thing it's I'm gonna sleep
13 and this it's really really big but I
think it's bold not bold
it's not bold it's black no no it's not
black semi bowl
yeah no it's gonna be regular I'm gonna
keep it like this yeah so now if you
please I see this one year I'm gonna
juice I don't remember
oh I can click on my clogging of this
that's where is my runner No
yeah I think for that's gonna be good so
tomorrow this is the plan is to design
this thing I think that they can do the
feet the tomorrow so after I can do some
video about feeling this feed you just
know what I miss it's after like at the
number of likes so this thing is done so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just take
this thing and I'm gonna say
so what I need to finish is the view
command the tag it's done I think I can
have the tag and I can have the name of
the tag yep
after the so I miss the coming here so
I'm gonna need the command crown I'm
gonna need the command also what I need
- it's going to be the fact that a user
can book more cubes okay
I mean I can do oh boy
be fair rinse after that I'm gonna have
a photo ID a boy I think I'm gonna just
come in first
oh man I forget something but I can add
this but I forget
what one sec my keyboard gets stuck my
comment again oh man the new mic Pro
keyboard is really really bad
I really don't like it so that's gonna
become an migration yeah I need to this
thing tween an index perfect things good
thing I need the time stamp
yeah this thing and the photo yeah I
think this thing is peeling so I'm gonna
run the migration and I get an error
inside reaction come in photo it's a
text of type text you know told me then
they don't accept it
Pictou schema schema
so they have streamed string okay so
Irfan Yong is better for me if I sit the
string but inside my table
I think this thing can be good
now I'm gonna just do something I'm
gonna say bye photo to e comment I'm
gonna say five and I'm gonna do a number
between them I'm gonna see you
recommends I'm gonna sit far want to
fake comments do now yeah there's gonna
be reaction that come in photo yeah I'm
gonna do the same thing of here I'm
gonna do the V points or a DM but now I
need to add the text was gonna be by
figure that Lorien that give me some
Shakespeare in English I'm left oh yeah
like that is
so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
close my D beer and I'm gonna do
something really bad but I mean I'm
gonna just reset and I get an error and
I got at line 53 okay so I think it's a
function is missing Germany what oh here
yeah doing it that's gonna be some good
text if I search for that so
Oh
oh yeah so really really so my command
what a piece of work is man yeah
so use our number two then I think I
just missed some come and I think I'm
gonna select 20 comments perfect I can
continue to start it and now what I'm
going to need to do to to do its now I'm
gonna need to apply reaction that
resolve are maybe not a breeze but here
reaction that type or finally I'm gonna
just copy paste I'm gonna paste it there
and I'm gonna just keep this one what
I'm gonna say
it's your that it's gonna be a comment
while we have an ID we have a text we
have a date so now I'm gonna say also we
have user energy I mean ayuzawa
no no you are and for that we're gonna
say resolved I don't need a Rizal
Association and I'm going to say you
that's what I forget is done
and I think that's going to be
Olivia as many
as many good and I'm gonna say the same
for user like that like that and also
like the photo I've done I need to say
it's gonna be below a user and it's
gonna be below a photo too like that and
so if I say so use on if I say photo
it's a no you know photo like that later
I can come in in under come in and now
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go in my
reaction take this thing we move it from
here go there I'll guess two things in
one
oh boy oh boy like this so what I'm
gonna do to have one in my photo so a
photo can many comments who finale is
gonna be a no new normal list of common
resolve the Association comment and
finally a user then a the same thing
like that so now for testing this
if I don't burn nothing like I use all
these already salons chemo come in photo
can you find modern stylish scheme up
papaki reaction tide yeah you see like a
pea pace and this is what I've done here
in my schema now I can I just don't
forget to encode this thing
okay we're so we're gonna test you know
so now what I'm gonna get on my photo I
can get ID and can I get a comment with
that text yes
are they and this is the request I do so
forgetting the ID so the photo ID image
URL I'm gonna get the user with the
username in is avatar you know so I'm
maybe gonna ask for the ID also I'm
gonna ask you for the answer it they
come and I'm gonna ask for insert that
close the user with the avatar and the
user name plus the date we enter this of
all that we break this really observe
resolved to nil but it's March
use all for photo use are so I put use
our ear in photo because in photo I say
belongs to use our
I didn't miss done my stuff ID user ID
to my photo schema so here are the user
ID
so my didn't accept this thing like that
so here my command now you see all this
stuff for this query if I run this is
what we got so we did one here 1 3 year
1 QV &amp;amp; 1 q so so query for doing all
this here and I think I can improve it
with some data loader stuff and now if I
want to get the like scan now you see
that's gonna be the thing because on
each photo I show I need to run this
thing but one of the first thing I don't
have yet it's you know I should say like
how many photo one maximum
yeah but I think so we have a photo with
the user the lights insert image ID and
they comment on it and the comment can
show the username blah blah blah
when you do you live of this what we
made so now if we have the comments I'm
gonna need to have the kinds of how many
comments I put well I think that's going
to be the resting for tonight so a photo
can come and come no no eat enjoy this
this QE I'm gonna really really need to
oh really
so now I show three to four five
you
you just look at the end all the con you
need to do because for each photo select
comes from Commons photo why okay so we
have one three year one year one year
one year so this one it's an N plus one
kick right there it's easy for you
because we have only ten but if we get
like a thousand but I mean this is
impossible I mean the you do like an
infinite infinite pagination and this
way you can like load the first twenty
photo example or maybe Canton I think it
can be a good number and after that when
you get to like the number eight and you
have to still below now you can research
again kind of a yeah an infinite low
yeah thank your own for watching I'm
gonna stop for tonight I think this
thing it's pretty good I mean now the
thing we need so we have that we have
that and I'm gonna just miss bookmark
and I think at bookmark it's gonna be a
many-to-many because I use our can
bookmark in many photo and a photo can
be bookmarks by many use are not really
it's gonna be a many just as many yeah
yeah so I'm going to let you go and we
told you tomorrow surely I'm gonna do
like another session and I'm gonna
record to video one for the Twitter
alone and I'm maybe gonna start to do
the video about this setup but I mean I
maybe tomorrow I'm gonna surely design
them all by the side of it so make it
work I mean when one card is done it's
easy and after that you have this so
we're we're gonna have a section that
last section right there yeah that's
gonna be the plan so I hope you enjoy
and I hope you learn a bit sorry about
my newbie skilling and examiner I know
what I do but it's the language of some
stuff I don't already know like I know
what I do when he came up to like graph
G well in that but when he came to just
the language sometime I don't feel quite
good enough but don't worry before I'm
gonna see you that I'm gonna take a good
week or two to just go over this thing
so I hope you enjoy I'm gonna talk you
know I got nothing wrong by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
