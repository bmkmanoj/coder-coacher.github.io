about Visual Studio code shortcut so
it's like I get asked a lot in some of
my other video about like which kind of
circle I do with my keyboard and like
the snippet ice creating the sauce do go
to the configuration at the extension at
create how can i use it an extra rest so
this is something I want to show you and
some new package as fun and I didn't
show in the other video of money on the
sauce you code so you have a list of the
command i use the more so so we're going
to start at the first one example so
example i'm going to go there so you one
example to copy this block of code so
what you can do it select your block of
code and do shift command D and that
going to copy paste everything you ask
below but for doing this I don't think
we just you Cody adapt by default so if
you search for sublime text in extension
here you should find sublime text key
map and this is the one I've install so
you see I decide you should come ND i
copy pasted what I've select and that
can work for one line if I have decided
you should come and be and that's work
so should come in d the first one after
that what I have is if you want to
search in pilot project your project a
file so some people didn't know actually
I so you do shift command F and you can
serve as your example if dear I search
for button I'm going to see every place
where I have the bottom and now i can
click on the file and go to this file
perfect after that select for a word so
example so if i close this thing so
example you want to like copyright your
facebook so if i do come ND i select all
my world just for showing you if i do
come and see
here so this is my world so come ND
select for well come in see i can pay a
copy incoming v I can take after that I
have a comment deeply shift command G so
that means I join a search in the
project in the the file so example if I
take this function right there so if i
do command D and shift command G I find
this one in the file so if you want to
refine somewhere so example you in poor
like this thing here so you do comment
d-shake OMG i jump I I have this one in
other place and now after that what i
can do is i can click here and click
enter and jump on the three plate don't
worry all this code for today i'm going
to paste it on a gift and i'm going to
put the gift in the description after
that shift command and tire for get a
new line before so if you get there and
you do shift comment and dark i create a
new line at the top and then now i can
type if i do come in and start i create
a new line below so the thing is if I'm
in here i can clean your right there I
can include any along there so don't
need to go at the end and get a new
night so that go to vm so if i use my
command arrow federal common arrow top I
go to the top below if i go to a line
and i go to the right to the left so
come and give you access to go at the
end after that comment p command P let
you search a fine name inside your
project so inside the tree so here
example I can search for something like
root and enter I'm going to jump so I
don't mean to go in my 35 a big folder
so example if I can search for like a TI
I get there plus you can see you get
always you recently opening plus if you
do a ctrl ctrl tab you can jump to the
last one so ctrl tab and now if you get
it you can like jump the one you want so
this is something that didn't say so
it's a control tab go
but to the recent file after that come
in l you get there you want to remove
this line you can do our Comment l and
you can remove it come &amp;amp; L lets you
select the full line but what you can do
more if you do this you can come here
and say I want to delete design I can do
come in X so that cut this line because
now i can paste it so this is cut come
in V I can come back so come in X if you
have no select that's going to cut all
the line copy comments II got a copy the
line you see how do come and see I copy
the line but you need to have no
selecting the same with the eggs after
that you want to go to full screen with
your with visual you do ctrl command F
control command F to come back after
that you want to close our window you do
come NW commendable you sometimes I get
some then so yes I give some course
where they all close there with a little
X here and i always told them coming the
value now if you want to call all
windows i'm going to open some window
and so i'm going to open some window
like that now you want to clean up all
this window if you do come in the value
that going to take some time so what you
can do it's right there so close our
window command key comment cake I mean w
so you do coming take command w delete
close all the windows comment K command
w if you want to add other side bar
right there you can do candy after that
if you want
keep open sore ear example if you see
here is it italic like my text is in
italic so that means this file it's not
like didn't change that thing so if I
open another one II didn't II close but
if I save look what's gonna happen like
the file now keep like you're like so
now i'm going to i can add it what you
can do for me I like more to save like
you see if I say that go but what you
can do like the toll is to do come in
come and kick come and enter so you to
come and kick and tuck and they do the
same but i think i love more to have to
save so you can do or sleep after that
you want to move from files so here
example i'm going to open this one I'm
going to open this one if I want to move
to the SD config i'm going to do shift
come in and a square bracket to the left
shift on in square bracket to the right
so you can jump the you want and if
you want to open this file to the right
this is the only other thing I really
use it by doing a command command and
comment below delete so I don't know the
name but this is this thing right there
so that's going to open for me my new
file after that add a plug-in called
jumpy jumpy right there so jumpy it's an
extension whoo it's really awesome if
you like don't use the tiki bar example
if you other like this file so my cursor
is there I want to jump to the width
here so I'm going to do shift and tar
and now you see I get BM so if i type BM
I John here scheduled shift enter again
I want to jump right there ed no I jump
so you see should be a shift enter I can
do whatever I want after that another
thing I can show it's like if you do a
ctrl G you can go to the another line so
18 after that if you do if you go
example to this logging screen and I do
ship comment oh now I can see all my
symbol

thing right there so it's a prettier
javascript for matter so a prettier is
something really big right now it's a
certain thing to like pretty all you
code and its really awesome format or
you code you can format by document but
what I like it to format of sight so if

I've add this tree line prettier print
print width of Ed single close to be
true and training como remove out so
what that mean it's now example if I put
this thing to be double quote if I say
look what can happen if I say that
change to single quote someone give you
this line of code and the indentation is
really bad like it this thing you say
that came back after that I want to have
to come at the end always so if i do
this in five safe I get my coma so think
about it like you had a disco dear and
you have like that indentation like this
and this plus this thing here it's
double quotes now if I say one shot
everything it's done so jealous crip PDF
or matter put this in new setting again
