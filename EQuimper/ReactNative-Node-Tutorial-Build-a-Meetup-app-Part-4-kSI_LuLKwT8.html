story oh so we are in the part four
so today and what is the plan is to add
react navigation so it's the router for
react native so the one we're gonna use
for the application right now and we're
gonna work a bit with a style about the
tab plus I'm gonna show you a whit
problem I got with Ginny motion in
Andrea so this is the plan for today so
first thing react navigation so they
have a awesome the documentation so this
is a pretty new project and this is
built by an awesome team will create
everything almost for us we we just need
finally to put code and everything gonna
work
so what are we gonna do for now so I'm
gonna just close this one so inside the
project first thing we're gonna open it
inside the code editor so we're gonna
open it so I'm using Visual Studio code
like as always perfect yeah so now I've
mine open so I don't touch any of the
code from the last video and I'm gonna
run my back-end - so I just want to be
ready when I'm gonna fetch some requests
I'm gonna do you're on there for the NPM
it's on the NPM run there uh-huh
so yeah perfect so we have the opinion
at the backend running now it's time to
run the front end to the mobile app so
just open exponent click on your meetup
new mobile app just wait to be ready so
when we're gonna see the device came in
at black that mean is ready
perfect now gonna open it as an airway
so we're gonna start with the iOS part
for now later in the video I'm gonna
show you what we need to do in the
anywhere to make it better so always
remember it takes some time for the
first time so here what we're gonna
start it's something we can already did
it's inside
my meetup this year we have put some
style last time so that well I read I
want to make it as a variable I don't
want to Ord code that every time so I'm
going to copy this color I'm gonna go to
my colors inside my constant my color
object and I'm gonna do red color and
I'm gonna pass it right there
so now I can come back to my side here
and now I can make like other variable
like this one here we dollar sign red
and colors so when this one gonna work
we get everything is like we did we get
last time so what we need to do right
now it's we're gonna install so instance
install in the dependency we're gonna
install react navigation Oh finally we
almost do like what did they ask you to
do so NPM install react navigation we're
gonna use the stack navigator so they
have a stack navigator so this is when
you want a route on another wall and
we're gonna use some tab navigation to
I'm going to see why in the future tab
it's for the tab at the bottom and stack
its if you don't want it's a route by on
top of other route
everything is stacking so when we wait
for this one and perfect so now what
we're gonna create we're gonna create
inside my source folder I'm gonna create
a route folder in this route folder I'm
gonna create ohm navigator so that's
gonna be the tab negator so that this is
the one for the own screen so that's how
i Akali so at the top we're going to
import the navigator from react
navigation after we need to import home
screen coming from screen folder that's
why because we have
in index we can just import it like that
here we're gonna act import colors from
not right now I'm gonna still with my
default here I'm gonna export D for my
tab navigator so this is a we don't need
to call you so that's gonna be a
function we're gonna just returned kinda
layer we're gonna just export anything
and object you in and we're gonna sit
home take a screen and this screen take
an own screen like that so just fine now
after that I'm going to create inside my
route I'm gonna create net navigator the
GS this one gonna be really simple we're
gonna take stack navigator navigator
from react navigation after that you're
gonna take that import I'm gonna import
own navigator so the one we just create
from same same level folder but week
data on that Gator and ear the only
thing we need to do now is export
default stack navigators almost what we
did for the other one
and now we're gonna pass the ohm as a
with a screen but now the screen green
gonna be the own navigator so my own
page gonna be a screen and inside this
one I'm gonna have a nested that Gator
who's gonna be the tab I don't invent
nothing it just I follow what they talk
about here in nesting and their Gator so
you can read this thing don't worry I'm
gonna send you the URL inside there in
me and inside the description in the
YouTube video so now if I save that I
have nothing gonna work for now so what
I'm gonna do inside my source folder
again I'm gonna create a new file called
root so that's gonna be the beginning of
Maya this one going to be a the most
simple react component the only thing
gonna take gonna import Navigator coming
from my route Navigator and I'm gonna do
a stateless component wrote but I don't
need this because I'm the only thing I'm
gonna do it's important that Gator
why do this for me look cleaner plus and
I'm gonna add be dogs I'm gonna make
this sense here so now inside my Mane
the only thing I need to do it's now I'm
gonna remove my homescreen and I'm gonna
import my route coming from my source
folder and my route right there so now
I'm gonna change my own screen for bit
route if I do this now I get my screen
but now nothing is working I get this
problem this morning when I started with
it and I wise not figure out why I get
this wide screen here why nothing is
working
cuz the game it's if I go to my home
screen and air inside my style and I'm
removing some flags and I just put
example I of 300 I'm gonna get I'm gonna
get my component so I was I was
something is wrong right now I don't
know what I can do for that so I find
finally what I need it right now we have
only run route route and I need to pass
at least two route to get it working so
this is what I've done I came to my
component here so inside my screen I'm
gonna create a new folder called
notification so that's going to be the
that's gonna be the screen for the
notification so that's why are we gonna
get like you have the meet up tomorrow
actually right so here we get a past
notification screen gs here this one
really easy one
then I import react with the component
I'm going to import the view and the
text coming from react native from one
who dragged my my snippet how I did it I
have a visual studio called package I've
built this weekend so if you search for
react native snippet you're gonna see
mine here at the top so equal / so this
is my snippet so if you want to download
it
I'm gonna pass out I'm gonna pass my
marketplace repo for that inside the
Visual Studio code so you can see
everything I did so that's why I can
type faster after that year that's going
to be as a competitor a class component
so that's gonna be notification screen
perfect this one no stay for now we're
gonna add at you and only thing we're
gonna do it's a text why I'm gonna say
notification and my view just for now
I'm gonna put inline style of flex one
stir that like I did in my other video
we're going to create index I'm gonna
import my notification screen inside my
index and I'm gonna export it right
there so now I just need to export it
like I did with my own coming from my
index who it's in the root of my screen
export from notification so I can export
everything out as a have inside my
export institution and now inside my
route so now I can go to my own that
Gator I'm gonna import notification
screen and now I'm gonna add it right
there a notification and I'm gonna pass
screen with notification screen so now
if everything is supposed to work now we
have oh and now add in education but
look now is working at my own without
changing my Flex and now it's working so
like I say I get this program because I
have only one window now we have two
windows or two screen so now that can
work so why not make a third one just
for now then I have less stuff to do in
the other video so we're gonna have
profile so that's going to be what we're
gonna have the profile with all your
stuff in excel area so for now what
we're gonna do gonna be easy one
you know just copy/paste the dessication
screen and we're going to add it inside
profile screen the GS just change the
name here for profile
Green and here we're gonna just put
profile screen right there after that we
just need to import it so inside the
index we import it from profile screen
and here export at the end after that
just go inside the index inside the root
of the screen and do the same export
everything from my profile every profile
fuller sorry so now here the only thing
we need to do
do the same with notification so we're
gonna do profile screen and here at the
end we're gonna add it profile screen
perfect so now if everything is working
at Twitter profile education plus my own
but now I think that don't looks that
natural awesome for now so what I'm
gonna do we're gonna add an icon I don't
want to have just text so all we work
with icons so I'm gonna close everything
now I'm gonna open my own screen and
what I want is I want to add an icon wit
exponent so inside get exponent this is
what I really like to it's like sugar
what I'm gonna show you it's they add
icons so they are all with the install
vector icon with a package for react
native and trust me if you never install
it that some kind of touchy here they
have vector icon everything already set
up the only thing you need to do is
import the name of the the wire that
come coming is the icon so like photo
also memorial icon and you just pass it
the name so they do everything for you
so here what we gonna do you would click
here and now so this is a where we can
see all the vector icon so this is a
little page where they put all the icon
you can just search so for me what I
want its I wanna um icon you see I type
home I get my phone awesome so I'm gonna
use this one for now so what I need to
do its I go to my
I'm gonna import font awesome inside
bracket from exponent victor i con like
that after that here this is all you can
add fun in react navigate and every
react navigation you do static
navigation option equal here I want to
toggle my tab box I'm gonna do tab bar
here first thing I'm gonna do I'm gonna
put an icon off I'm gonna put an icon
and here the only thing I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna put my phone awesome
so fun also just make some space
I'm gonna sit name so the same name you
have here so its own that's it oh I
think that's a good size wise a 25
perfect so now if I do this this is
what's gonna happen I get my own right
there so I have my own so we just need
to do the same phone notification so for
education we go there I'm gonna pace
what I have just so just copy/paste what
we have done here for this one
- occasion I found a good one was I
think that was the material icon here so
yeah I just search for notification and
I get my material icon this one I think
that was a good one so yeah I'm gonna
import material icon so what I really
like it it's you just do the same every
time
yeah you just change photo or some
formatting icon so now I'm gonna get I
didn't change oh I just need to change
that for notification with a s
notification like that so now my own in
my notification I'm going to do the same
for profile screen so just copy paste
this one so profile screen paste that at
the top of the yo render and so for my
profile I just choose a regular one that
was coming again from material icon so
we need to import material icon from
exponent victor icon and this one was
only icon sir cool so so now if you you
can drag and drop the exponent icon so
this is for when you click you can
reload and go to exponent no in here so
if I put it at the top we see I have my
own notification in my profile screen
but react navigation don't stop there we
add a lot a lot of stuff we can add two
to the ten navigation so what we're
gonna do for now it's we're gonna go
there here we put a comma
you put actually brand curly bracket so
we open it another object and a what I
want it I think this should be good to
have to go to another route just by
swiping so right now the only way to go
to another route I can that's why so I
need to click so they do this for you so
you do swipe swipe enable and you do
true so one second
I've won okay this is not ear sorry this
is ear so after the curly bracket so the
first thing take all that your screen
the second thing it's all your
configuration so now you pass what we
just done so just to make it better I'm
gonna just make it like that and one sec
you have some so we're gonna just
restart so ear coma perfect and now here
I'm gonna put swipe enable with addy and
I'm gonna put true so now if I do this
now I can swipe you see I can now swipe
to go to another round second thing I
really like the effect then really you
would like to have some animation
because right now when I click I just
get boom just like not nothing coming so
I'm gonna do animation enable and I'm
gonna sit to true so they're gonna give
us free animation so if I click now you
see I have some kind of swiping
animation so I really like OH
Moody's done a sound thing after that
for Andrea
by their fault they're gonna go to the
top so I don't invent nothing I just
read here inside my turbo navigator they
talk about everything here so turbo
option if it should ever so I want my
turbo in my and wait to be at the bottom
too so tab bow portion gonna be bottom
and now after I can add some tab bow
option this is why you can change the
color and everything first thing right
now well uh it's everything is dark and
I've some leather I don't know one level
I just want my icon I'm gonna say show
ladder to be false lab bill so sorry to
be false so now we remove each platter
oh this is a good thing here looks
better with just the icon after that you
I'm gonna add something called inactive
tint colors but before we doing that we
need to import colors from the dot the
end here in my constant if you want to
know how I got this kind of autocomplete
from my folder and everything I have a
video I'm gonna share and I'm gonna add
the card at the top of the your right
screen I'm gonna show you the video why
I show you everything about my visual
studio code and add all also a blog post
about that so I'm gonna just import my
color and I would like to have maybe
some kind of my blue dark color so if
you remember inside my color here it's
my kind of dis blue so if I save now
nothing change because here it don't
know what happened you don't know like
the ten color oh I can get that you go
to your home screen
err now and the only thing you need to
do it's really really simple so the
inside your navigation option right
there
the thing
you its ear we're gonna discharge a
property so they are the trucks called
ten colors and now what I'm gonna do it
here I'm gonna see color of my icon
equal now ten colors so if I do this and
I come back now as you can see I have
add another color so you don't see cuz
it's almost the same but if I get there
and just for now we put this as I read
I'm going to see if I'm inactive I get I
read Y I get that only for this one
because we didn't set up the same tab
color for the other one so we're gonna
do that right now so just do the same
air tint color we district it and here
color equal teen color we do the same
for the investigation teen color and
color so now if we say now we're gonna
have some kind of change here but I
don't like this blue like we don't have
this blue nowhere in the the application
so that's why we're gonna need to change
the active colors so and yes if you they
have already made that for us so you go
there and the only thing we do now it's
active tint color and that's going to be
colors red color so now start to looks
much more awesome and everything work
everything work with the swiping so you
see we can change the color just with
this small amount of code perfect so now
and now it's not really white it's kind
of great so I'm gonna change this color
to be a background color of white so
here I'm gonna just say style style and
I'm gonna sit background color to be my
color so I've already put in so white
color so now my background should be bit
more white now I want to change the
color of my
I want to change the color of my headers
at the top so you see there and now it's
it's a daughter like a small gray so
here I'm gonna change it and I'm gonna
do this run inside my home screen so now
here we need to import a color so I'm
gonna import colors from the dirt the
dirt until I see constant yet perfect
now I can have my colors know how we did
that it's here I'm gonna add other so
now my tab bar is everything at the back
below my doors at the top here I'm gonna
just see star and phenomena good as a
background color of red color so now I
got a red kind of a color in my other so
now I think for a CSS just for this
video should be good cause now we're
gonna get some kind of problem with
anyway I'm going to show you so now you
see in education like that's fication
they don't have the same color just to
be sure we're gonna just pass the same
here inside my notification too so we
need to import color to constant and
color you see all easy with this pad
intellisense plugging here we do the
same and import color perfect now when I
go okay I get problem here
oh I forget color try to go too too fast
perfect so now if I go there I go there
everyone have the same color the others
perfect
so now I OS is working perfectly
but now I'm gonna get a problem with my
Genie motion so I'm gonna open Ginny
motion and just for the video I'm gonna
close my iPhone one so I'm gonna show
you the only thing gonna change with
iPhone because the thing it's if I
cannot
really open because my quick time take a
lot of CPU I can try it but maybe I'm
gonna need to close my iOS so once ago
so Junie motion it's yes simulator for
Android
this is free for personal usage so don't
need to care about paying for this stuff
so arrive install the Samsung Galaxy s6
and I think that just a good size to
work with as you can see I use the
iPhone 7 I never really used plus I just
use always like iPhone 6 iPhone 7
something like that
sorry take some time to just turn yeah
so I really like why I really like it
genymotion to its the fact then it's
much smaller than any wedge to do when
it's time to run it so I'm gonna just
close it I'm gonna try to reopen does it
take much more time can expose so the
thing I want to show you it's that a
it's anyway I have some kind of problem
with not Edgware genymotion have a
problem with you look at also you need
to do the motion wire to fetch the where
you fetch you know Cal oles inside so
you I can server so yeah so yeah I'm
gonna close this I don't need anymore so
you inside my exponent I'm gonna open my
device on Android
and now we're gonna get organized see
I'm gonna get network error so I figure
out this stuff it's so I did some some
research about that in the the way I
find it it's you good
we're gonna go to the API file in here
at the top we use local O's this is what
we want for iOS but not what we want for
anywhere so I'm gonna just close my
simulator because my computer is running
really fast perfect so now yeah at the
top a way you can add multiple platform
variable inside the reactive it's buy
imported plat form coming from react
native and now the only thing here what
we're gonna do
it's some if statement I'm gonna create
a variable URL yeah I'm gonna do if
platform that OS it's not equal to i OS
I want my URL to equal HTTP and now this
is what I found so what I found it's
it's inside my stack it's inside stack
overflow so it's how to connect so it's
I'm gonna share the link in the
description sorry
so it's HTTP slash slash 10.0 point
three point two and the port 3000 and
I'm gonna say API and I'm gonna do a
else and the only thing I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna cut this one and I'm gonna do
URL equal API right there now here I'm
gonna just say actual equal base URL so
now if I do this it's running boom
everything is working now and because of
this platform here do I always gonna
still working but now as you can see my
Inuit I don't see nothing because anyway
by default go to the top and by default
they they don't show the
the icon go to euro me navigator again
here after I show leave earlier I'm
gonna say show icon and I'm gonna sit
true if I do this now here I'm gonna get
my icon perfect now as you can see it's
really small but I've yellow now yellow
line here I want to change the color of
this so oh I can do this
I'm gonna say right there indeed editor
ad cater style and I'm gonna be taken up
J and I'm gonna sit background color and
I'm gonna say color that red color so
now if i refresh now you can see a bit
more add a red color
perfect now what I want to eat to be
able to have like the ripple like you
know the ripple when you click on the
material stuff on annual the only thing
we need to do now it's press color and I
want that to be red to red color so now
is everything is working fine no I
should click now as you can see ah the
ripple effect of material UI material
design and now I can also swiping so now
everything is working the arab some will
success we're gonna change that to a
school you everything but now just for
for you right now i'm going to just
change here inside my own screen and
then put next to be 9 so my own screen
