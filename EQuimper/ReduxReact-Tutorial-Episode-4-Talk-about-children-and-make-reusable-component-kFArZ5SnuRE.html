thinking today about maybe just post the
story on right now just because I want
to not teach you but show you some stuff
in the reacts to react well where people
get really confused and I think this is
maybe the time right now just before we
really push in the application way so
what I want you what I want to show you
today it's what is really children in
react what is so just hear what is the
children any react make a reasonable
component I mean a real full reasonable
component and use function for your
value so what I've done for this one
it's inside my route I've create just
for today just because I don't want to
break nothing just create a roll here
915 where I've made ad that just fun and
I have a component just fun and I just
import this one coming from ear and this
is a stateless component where I just
put some side right now flex and all
that stuff just forget my just fun
working so this is more like a
playground so what I'm going to show you
it we're going to just make three button
with only one component and each one
going to be fully visible with a
children inside so this is something
people really confuse about so first
thing we're going to do its air I'm
going to create everything in time this
lesson five so just for be easier for
you so yeah I'm going to create another
component called button in this one I'm
gonna pass nothing just named here just
an empty argument sorry I'm going to use
a div and inside this one I'm going to
just say hello perfect here what I'm
going to do it's inside my
just fine i'm going to delete the h1 and
i'm going to use my button then we're
going to say hello in this one and save
it i'm going to came right here inside
and now you see my button called ello if
I inspect this one right now look what
going to happen so if i go to react deaf
too and I go to my button right look at
that add a children right ear count ello
right here I use our gain alone but this
is art code if I want to use it now I
can use it as a prep so I can this track
it now I can do chill during right here
and change that for children and now
load all this again the same cuz if I go
back to my button add a prep school
children so I can reuse it right there
why is useful now because I can create
three button and sir Bonjour hello in
French and just right now because I
don't really know any other language so
you see my ello and now I have Bonjour
if i go to my button your other one
other children hello one add a bunch o
but this is only one item I mean so now
with this one we can create a fully
visible component I mean now what we can
do its if some of you I've already used
like react bootstrap something like that
or us like we used react somatic who did
i do the same kind of pattern so here
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create three button well going to have
small one going to be medium and one
going to be large after that you my dear
I'm gonna put a style right inside that
you're going to put a padding of 10 and
a border of 1px 0
it and black just for right now so
you're going to see three kind of button
small medium and large each of them are
equal in size just medium because you
take better add more plays but if you
look at this now what we're going to do
its I want to make it dynamically with
resides like if you use the boots have
something like that you use like you can
put large something like that so here
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to add a
size not for the small but for the
medium I'm going to put a size medium
and a size large after that I want to
have another color for this one so I'm
going to pass another colors props and
this one going to be a yellow this one
going to be red and this one going to be
blue if I do this right now nothing will
happen because I don't pass under stuff
any stuff to my component so I'm going
to pass colors what I'm going to do I'm
going to use backgrounds colors Oh
something running at then sorry I don't
know what I 10 background colors
right ear and my background color going
to have the colors I just pass so if you
look what I pin right now if the finish
the refresh sorry guys you see now i
have my small medium and large because i
use the props as I colors but now I want
to change the size to be medium large so
what we can do it in JavaScript you can
use function to pass value so here what
I'm gonna do it's inside my style so I'm
going to just make it just
better-looking yeah i'm going to have a
width and i'm going to create a function
called check size where i'm going to
pass a size coming from here so now i
need to pass it in my component and i'm
going to create this function guns check
sighs take a size and air i'm going to
create a switch statement when i'm going
to pass this size inside this one I'm
going to add a case oh sorry k is large
in this one I'm going to return 150 in
case medium I'm going to return oh sorry
return 100 and by default so when I see
nothing that's going to be the small one
I'm going to be turn 50 now look what
what happen
you see now my smile 50 will 100 wit and
150 so if i do to my element just sit
here in HTML add a whit of 50 with 100
wit of 150 now so if i come back here so
what I pen I pass medium as a size at
last large as a size here and now I
destroyed my size I inside the style I
use will with checks sides with the size
i pass in my check size is a function
right there whoo check with a switch
statement which size is and return a
number who's going to be the value and
when I want to pass an ad number this
number you're going to be the pic set of
my will so that's why now you see 50
pics l/100 pixel and 150 pixel now what
we can do it's inside my button now if I
want to be fully visible I need to
either unclick heaven because it's not a
button if I don't have so I'm gonna have
unclick you I'm gonna pass an alert and
air i'm gonna say small i'm going to do
the same for the three others so here an
air so ear medium and a i'm going to add
large so now if i came here and now i'll
try i try to click nothing happen
because my own click here is only a
props it's not something i clicked so i
need to pass this perhaps so what I'm
going to do its ear i'm going to pass my
on clicks props so air in my dear i'm
going to do unclear and i'm going to
pass on clicks so now if you look I'm
gonna happen now i can now i can click
medium large
small so if you follow what I just did
right there right now everything is
fully reasonable reasonable reusable so
now my unclip going to be what I'm you
use so if I want to be unclear why I
push in other route I can now look at
that I'm going to use this one i'm going
to import browser history coming from
react router and here this one the small
one i'm going to push browser history
i'm going to push to a login for
managing page so if i come there right I
see ear I click my medium medium large
this one some of them sorry something at
then we are closer brother sister oops
sorry I didn't add the push sorry live
coding so i'm going to show you medium
large log e so you see all now i can
reuse this button inside another project
i can just copy paste this one so why i
do this it I get a lot of person who
didn't really know what it was children
and i'll make a fully reusable component
now this button can be inside his own
file and i can reuse it like I want they
can do what they want at the color of
what they want and add three kind of
size so because if i put nothin gonna be
devil so going to be the small one so
that's why this one I have no no sighs
allowed so now another thing i want to
show you today so i'm going to what i'm
gonna do it I'm gonna show you how you
can use
param coming from the reactor outer and
do something with that really quick
gonna be really quickly I sorry so first
thing I'm going to delete everything
here yeah I'm gonna delete everything
sorry and what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to create just fun again and now i'm
going to just pass the juice fun right
there just for be sure i'm gonna just
watch if everything's worked out I
didn't import components Oh a good thing
i checked before so now you're going to
see my new just fun with the only just
fun on that so now what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to show you parent inside
stuff so here and my just fun i'm gonna
pass ID and i'm gonna pass a like user
right there in my rod pad now if i
refresh i'm gonna eat my 44 because of
what caused my just funny the ID now and
I users I'm gonna pass 123 and my name
Emmanuel so if you follow me guys era
I'm surely understand what happen it's
my want to twist my ID my email is my
user now if i go to react dev tool so
again if you didn't add this one you
need this but I go to just front and
look here inside my parents right there
now as ID and then if the ID 123 use or
a manual so what you can do with that
can do a lot of stuff now here i can do
i can pass a div with the h1 where I'm
going to do this that perhaps that
paragraphs that user and here i'm going
to have ID so if you look at what can
happen emmanuelle 1 2 3 i'm going to
change that for Joe
you see Joe one two three so now you can
use your parents coming from react
crater and what you can do to why I show
you that it's here I'm going to do a
component with mouse so this is before
the component mouth finally here I'm
going to just do an alert and here I'm
gonna alert Midas that perhaps that
parents that ID why I show you that
we're going to use this in the
application look at that now i have my
before have something in the screen look
at that it's white screen right now but
now i have not want to be coming from my
parents who is coming from my route
right there so what you can do with that
section epi you pass an ID here you can
fetch API coming from this parent and
like I say if you have react they've to
now learn how to use it and just check
at this so you just came here and my
just fun and look at that at the time I
can reuse my ID and my user right now I
can do what I want with that and this is
just crazy I mean now I can fetch API
and don't care about how I'm gonna pass
the idea just push to this page with a
browser history and when I came to this
page now I can fetch from this so I hope
guys you learn something today Oh
everything made sense if not just ask me
in the comment I'm gonna pass both what
we did today inside the just for fun
component so just go in the description
and look for the get up people and i
hope i really hope you learn something
