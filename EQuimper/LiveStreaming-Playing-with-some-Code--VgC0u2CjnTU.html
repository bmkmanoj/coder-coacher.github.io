think I can
yeah so follow one who join finally I
told you in the video so my planets like
I want to blow Mo's as I can so I know
some people have questioned about the
tutorial I did our example you have some
problem with your own personal project
so I mean if you have some question and
it's okay for you to just share your
coal we can just go over that and just
do like an evacuee so that can maybe
help someone else something like that so
that's why I want to share this on
YouTube in the same time so I don't know
like you get some question about you use
react native and you have some weird
board with some life cycle something
like that we can just go over your code
and just see and I can try to do my best
to help you the time I have no one no no
nobody want to talk with me I'm gonna
just playing a bit with maybe the next
toy I'm building in same time I'm
building in the next month who's gonna
be with the Alexa graph QL in the back
end which we are native in the front and
again it's gonna be an Instagram clone
so I mean if you have question just let
me know and yeah do everyone hear me
oops
and a thing with an X I don't know why
but I need to open my stuff with Adam I
cannot use Visual Studio code because we
saw Cole make my code not reloading and
I know it's a bug I'm not alone having
this thing so that's why I need to use
that on there maybe gonna let this code
open so if you if you ever the question
like I told you you can just eat me on
this code just join the channel and we
can just talk about if you want to do
Aang out and just go over your question
like I just told you if I view yes I'm
playing with elixir if my computer don't
die right now I don't know what happened
to
I so OBS they get sick Stephanie
yeah so I'm gonna make use of absent
oops not the issue right there
so I'd sign it's finally it's the right
power for an Alexei to play with we have
fewer nothing too much crazy to like to
install to make it work it's pretty
simple and also what I like about that
we work with relate to so if you use
relay you don't really need to be scare
about using it
yeah the thing it's I'm gonna use so I
have already some code here they're just
so take the better version because this
is the one I've used on my last project
and well it's good first I'm gonna see
yeah
big thing
are you to defy view
hey Cuddy so nice yeah like I like I
don't know if you have some question
about maybe some of the Toyota ideal or
something like that but we can do
anything out if you want I wanna oh yeah
yeah Babel external yeah I never used
that
oh yeah first time you see like say oh
yeah let's see it's the language it's
pretty I mean awesome about oh it looks
like you looks a lot like a ruby and I
love it it's a functional programming
with everything it's immutable and stuff
like that yeah it's like Ruby on Rails
with the framework I use it just a lot
much more performant yeah it's really
really much more performant I never did
like test or something like that but I
know it's so I'm gonna do certain my
schema oops
oh yeah Cuddy I was thinking you have
did the course about Phoenix on on udemy
Oh indeed it's not the Ruby on Rails
it's it's an excerpt in too much to do
here I'm gonna just set up like yeah
like the basic scheme Oh even nothing
crazy yeah almost like this engineer at
all yeah oh yes
go Lang Korea its course it's pretty
good ongoing I just think he didn't go
to too much further like I would like to
see a web application or something like
that but you know he didn't play with
that but I mean he like always do a
really really good course so
what I think you're it's oh yeah you
gonna redo a golang one
I don't even think I need my graphic
you'll I'm maybe gonna add this thing so
it's almost like an on no GS you just
set up like you
you have QL and you can set up your
graphic you so the graphic you well it's
then it's the like that
no designate about the UI wire you can
play with your cue on the only thing I
will have loved to have in a lecture
it's better like it it are like this
have my stuff yeah I think I'm good to
go
oh yeah it's easier to read
did you start the SSR course of what AB
sign blog Rafi grass greffi yeah make a
typo
oopsie it like that okay how exciting is
that going to know it's rescue up okay
Tina near nadir here four thousand I'm
gonna get an IRA we're gonna say finally
no well no Rob for post-it yeah cause if
you're here this one is good but no word
found for okay yeah it's a API graph QL
so now you see so when I get when I get
my graph QL graph chaos and M everything
you have inside my graph here inside my
schema but I have nothing so that's why
I get a few must be an object with that
name as blah blah blah so use the thing
I need to have like my and some other my
crew you or something like that so what
I'm gonna do is say inside my schema ear
so I can start to like building my stuff
so I'm gonna do do them like almost like
not mock data but I don't really need to
have that all within my DB I'm gonna
just have an idea about what to build
here much more so it's Instagram so we
have photo after that so I'm gonna just
came out that connotation
so this is all you set up an objection
Cuddy thought I can see like a photo do
and now here I can see what I follow up
so I thought though I'm gonna say like a
can have an image URL and I'm gonna
maybe say it's no it's an O'Neill string
by doing this so I'm gonna say like this
thing here so I've my like my type in
everything so now I'm gonna just go back
here I say that ear really because I
mean I want to try myself to just teach
it a bit like I'm not the best one here
now so that's why the course is not
going to go right now you just I need to
practice myself much more but I've can
have an idea about what I need to to
build much more
so another example here I can see I
don't know like photos I'm gonna receive
on my photo here I'm going to say that's
gonna be a list of photo and I'm gonna
say no morgue sign in Newark but no yeah
I will need my resolver so that's why
here I'm gonna start to need to build my
stuff yeah it's a sick like yeah yeah
it's with Postgres and so they use ecto
so ecto ecto it's the this thing like a
it's gonna be everything about you like
it's almost like mongoose or sequel eyes
if you think it's like a wrap over your
database and you do almost everything
and it's really awesome really really
good really really good and I'm I'm
gonna quit my resolver so here Instagram
resolved where's that photo and now I
can I have no IDs yet so Eric and maybe
I'm gonna say photos so here so finally
you're gonna see I'm gonna show you that
in a second so finally here my schema
gonna call my resolve are and am I'm
gonna receive try to him like you know
like three item we always get in the and
now because I don't in any this item I'm
gonna just do this here and I'm gonna
just say okay and finally what I can
maybe just return its maybe I like you
image URL gonna be lol like that that's
what I'm gonna return for now I think I
can do this like this
but quite sure I never really do them
stuff like this
like you yeah i know i can add arias my
Instagram that resolver so this one's
gonna have my result very now here I can
resolve and I can use my resolve arrive
right there so when you add yes finally
you just almost like say okay weasel
because if I don't do that yes I'm gonna
need to do this thing here but now
because I do that yes we solve our
become its own kind of variable right
there so now here I can see that photo
and now I can see that photos and I can
say I'm gonna send it to your argument
and now I think that's gonna crash maybe
not so now if i refresh here I'm gonna
have my dog I can receive an aerial
photo so if I say photo and I get my
little will yeah like you Oh way then
yeah how are you even today and I don't
know what I get today I wake up and I
fall down from to my chair and I just
meant my arm it's really really bad
today so now you see a Cuddy you work
with the arrow well like you did just
for me I don't put space so you see it's
pretty like I mean it's pretty simple if
you look at this so the way that the
work it's just this import type air it
just it's building app sign whew it's
like the rapper so thing about outside
it's like a paragraph ql for the server
of express it take here so ii import
every typed like you see on some video i
think i've been awhile why he just show
a way to import like are you resolved
right and stuff like that just to make
it scale easier so now that import do
almost the same so finally the import
gonna go over the modules all the
modules gonna be the schema so because
module finally take the name here schema
so I'm gonna go take the photo type
gonna take my photo object so that's why
when I get here after that I can add my
photo because you get it from here so if
I create another one I'm gonna get from
right there after that
this chemo ear I say I'm gonna add a
list of photos I'm gonna have many photo
and a year I say my resolve gonna be
from my resolve work but example if I
want I can sell what I'm gonna add an
Argus and I can maybe say I don't know
like a you know like yeah I'm gonna say
I D okay just one out in a I'm gonna say
I D is gonna be a string and I can just
pass this thing and now if I came here
I'm gonna receive my art as a second
argument like you did on the and now if
I want I can see are you that puts here
I'm gonna say that this is the art and
now I can see right there inspect and
I'm gonna pass the art so if I do this
now what's gonna happen it's if i
refresh now I'm gonna need to have photo
and now you see AB ID so if I pass to so
that needs to be a string and I see
image URL and I do this if I look right
there you see this is the art and I get
my ID back so maybe like I can put that
there so just here thinking below if I
do this like yeah yeah and now I'm gonna
select ID it's gonna be equal to or the
ID okay so I'm gonna just return this
thing in same time so I'm gonna just
change my schema my photo type sorry
where I'm gonna see feel ID it's gonna
be a no-no and I'm gonna see it's gonna
be an ID finally so yeah I'm gonna just
change gonna be an ID and now oops
and I'm gonna say this thing it's no no
no no no ID so now if I do this you see
I have no charts to add my ID so now if
I say photo I pass the ID I'm gonna say
like tree and I see image URL + ID and
I'm gonna receive back my item like like
we did finally in no GS so for those
would never really see and like Eric's a
finale thinking about like they do in
the end it's like a truly bracket like
it's like that but I think you just make
more sense when you see a doing em
so I think this thing here this ashtray
we call that man we have this and golang
- it's a pointer maybe yeah I think is
that so the mix here it's like the
packet that Jason oh yeah they have like
so much and if you look at the
subscription so this is what I'm gonna
do with the story all the subscription
man oh my god is just crazy
Oh simple is that and also you have
access to the union interface like you
do on other project and now I can after
that match it with my my stuff yeah yeah
I think - its pointer I'm not too sure
but and you see so finally here the idea
is just find anything about data like a
death structuring because I I can I've
done this like this just I think it's
make more sense and this is the thing
here the same a with your ID you
argument here if I want I can have done
this like that and taking the ID yeah
but you need to do this like this so if
I do this now I can remove and I can do
this like that I get there I do the same
week oops I make a typo oops I know it's
kind of this you know if I do this you
see it do the same so you like you can
be structuring your stuff here too so
now you have your resolve are and stuff
like that so now here's the simple stuff
here you have you some of the error I'm
gonna need to create this stuff have a
translate error so after that year so
this is the new dating app it's pretty
hard for me right now to understand its
use now I need to have like contacts and
everything so what I think I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna do get s set up graph QL
server side and now what I'm gonna do it
so now I need to do a mix Phoenix that
Jen and I'm gonna set context so now you
need to create a context and this is the
thing it's pretty hard for me to catch
you just like I mean so it's the context
after that you create like you or you
said they're likely like your item
inside that so I mean the app it's a
social app so yeah oh can I call that
because I mean I cannot call this photo
because if I call that photo oh I'm
gonna call my element in the DB I cannot
say photo photo photo so oh I can call
this thing I mean like you can have like
like you see you have or the ring also
you can have like icon like that so
icons this is where you're gonna put
your user and stuff like this
I think I can put photo
I'm gonna call this thing I mean yeah
true true true
I can make yeah I can call this photo
like you say after that a I can call
that image so I'm gonna say a mate and
after that inside that I'm gonna have an
image URL it's gonna be a string and
what I'm gonna need the - I mean after
that I can do migration if I need so I'm
gonna have image URL I'm gonna need a
notar but I don't have yet
the I don't have yet a user setup and
not photo photo like that yeah so like
this and maybe like a favorite con yeah
I mean just like that I can start with
this hola you know you see so that's
gonna create for me a photo in that
image here so if you see here the image
now it's the schema so if I feel URL
string Y I need to add the image URL so
I cannot finally create the image
without having the image URL finally and
after that why do why is my ID supposed
to be there okay and now here you see
the photo so after that they give you
all that just simple crowd list out
image def get email when you get an
image create an image update the image
and delete an image so if you understand
what actually I'm gonna do
it's my reservoir when I get image I'm
gonna call this
this image from here so the photo here
is the only place where I can talk with
my DB so example if here I can say on my
photo I'm maybe gonna have like I don't
know like another stuff so what I pen is
this thing it's like the context of this
thing it's where you have like you bound
you boundary you know you're you photo
from here so this is from what we call
so here you have your web
so would you controller in everything so
your web is your interface we're gonna
call with your business logic who is
inside this thing here so after that I
need to do the mix it's to my mix it to
my grade so that's gonna create oops
nope maybe not yet I just do it to reset
okay what oh man I'm gonna say drop
because I think my migration so I need
to look at my migrations first oops yeah
so can I look here so finally when I did
this thing because it's weird cuz I'm
sure I'm supposed to have my ID there
I'm just not remember
no I'm dumb
yeah just like that so I can just do my
migration I think and I thought gonna do
this by default cool that makes it to
create and now make sector migrate ok so
now if I look at my table I can look
with pasta Co and now you see I have my
image ID bla bla yeah so that was built
by default so yeah I guess care about I
don't need ok so now what I can do here
it's I can just go on side my resolve
our air finally and this one finally I
can just plug with my I can plug this
with my cows to the this thing here so
what I mean it's oops Instagram that and
all that's gonna be photo like that so
now if I want to get my photo what I can
just say here it's finally I need no
letting air and air I can just call my
photo dot and now that's going to be
list this image like that oops
nothing more to do for this one so yeah
I can have my list image and now I need
to say ok I'm gonna have an on your are
and also I'm gonna poop soon yeah my
schema my ski mask
yeah like that no no no no this one this
one makes Phoenix ok so now if I run
this thing again
oops I'm maybe gonna need to real schema
I don't need to other nerds
you see if I say that I'm gonna get
nothing because I have no I have nothing
if you look here I have no item at all
so now I can create one so I'm gonna
create a mutation I'm gonna great
acronym edition so I'm gonna just do
here I'm gonna resolve oh yeah
I'm gonna say def create photo and this
one here finally I'm gonna get nothing
here for now I'm gonna just finally take
the image URL
you made URL so finally when you see
image URL me jor-el you just say it is
this key here just give it back this one
yeah and now I'm gonna just so you think
it's create
creating major creating the age where
finally I'm going to pass the image URL
yeah but I'm gonna need to so I think I
should have just let him like this would
have been better
and now here when I'm gonna get that I'm
gonna see this now I can just finally
see I'm gonna see photos
yeah like this
and now inside your skin when you just
need to create a mutation now okay I'm
gonna say create Cotto while air finally
we're gonna just return a photo yep and
here we need as I argh image URL it's
gonna be a no new string and resolve
it's gonna be resolved our resolver that
create photo I thing and too much photo
and now here I can see the tree and now
if I do this and everything it's work
no it nothing work the cure expression
is invalid in my schema
oh okay
now you see I have a mutation okay I'm
gonna try that Tommy thn I'm gonna
secrete it photo image URL I'm gonna say
you know I'm gonna take google image
gonna take whatever you made yeah but I
thought you really imagine I get image
I'm gonna say I don't know like a
penguin we don't like penguin copy image
address email address bang yes I want
the ID and I want me be back my image
URL just to let know then I get any
expected to Karen and I get boy
Instagram resolver it's not available
oh boy I know why when I send this
tinctures first thing okay so first
thing this thing is not working so we
know and now we get the same function
error is undefined create photo is on
define create photo in my resolve our
create photo and my schema screen photo
resolve our that photo that now why they
feel ID vis afternoon but it's more
non-nil non nail in your schema
please ensure that ID always returning
on so why
why this
but he's gonna save in the DB yeah how I
do my ID I know why man sure you just
put photo back yeah that's it
and now if I say give me all my photo ID
an image URL I'm gonna get - yeah right
there so funny it's nothing it's my
resolver who need to receive ID an image
URL finally receive my photo as like a
destruction this is what you need
get image should be better I will
recheck back I'm gonna call on this
thing this one you see now here a
breakup so what I think would be better
is this thing called image and my every
place photos image image create image
image because forums my context it's not
my schema you see right now is all so
now air will be fill image gave us image
and after that feel image gave us a
single image this one I'm gonna need to
a log that's gonna be an ID and that's
gonna be a no new ID and that's gonna
result to the resolve our get get image
I think I'm gonna just pass here the
drug you man like that after that this
one getting negative image get image
that's for that that crash everything
and I got no schema type must be exist
create photo is not defined in your
schema
here first thing it will be better to
call that image
oh you go with your context I think I'm
gonna still well with my context you
just create image I'm not gonna give us
an image and here that's gonna be
creating age and now it doesn't image -
now if I do this and I get in I see
image nice Eid and image URL I get all
my stuff but also if I say image with
the ID of one and I say give me image or
an ID I get a thing
get image man oh boy
now it's gonna work
yeah right there so now I have my see if
I get nothing I get an error because I
think the error right now it's because
of the way I did with this with that
bang ear but now if I do this I'm gonna
receive my ever know yeah I just don't
exist I'm gonna need to catch this error
here if I have no image so I think I'm
gonna need to create an error at reverse
to So Def you may defeat me
okay good
yeah so what I can I'll set up to it's
my photo here can have tag too so right
there I can say X Gen X Gen migrated
yeah
and where's my little complete sir I
want to do oh it's migration yeah
migration this is what I can do
no oh I'm gonna call my tag so an image
can have many tag and attackin and many
image I'm gonna need two other join
table between both of them so that's
gonna be a many-to-many situation
now I want to because I think now right
now what I try to do is I want to have a
schema but I want to to generate just a
schema in that migration in same time
oh yeah so that's gonna be Phoenix that
Jam that schema and that's gonna be
photo dot tag tag yeah well I'm gonna
have a name it's gonna be a string so
now if I do this that's supposed to go
right inside the photo there yeah so now
I have my tag right there and I'm gonna
have my migration and my present right
there so now this one's gonna be a like
a many-to-many relationship
and I also um get an idea so that's the
thing is I'm gonna need to a migration
after that migration or finally I'm
gonna need to create a table my
migration I'm gonna say create and now
here I can create a table and I'm gonna
call that photo 12 I don't need to have
an ID here because I'm gonna like oh no
this thing I don't need to have an ID
and now I can say photo photo image Oh
photo it's gonna be good
oh maybe not
oh yeah time I'm gonna have this one so
now I can run the migration I take my
gray so now I shall have to read image
image tag in tag or this one this one I
have no idea I don't need that
yeah that's it so now I'm good
not gonna need to change some of my
schema because they don't they didn't
need to have the the many many
connection so yeah I'm gonna go to my
time
and in too many mah
true eye and true to do do I need an
image
no yeah and now all I'll call this thing
image tagging like that what this thing
can have many much money and now that's
going to be almost the same for the
photo image but this one's going to be
tags
look I see that
so what I'm gonna do here what I'm gonna
do now I can create a tag at least I'm
gonna do this I'm gonna just go inside
my photo type because the photos gonna
be about Mary here so and I'm gonna say
that means I can maybe change that later
so I can same name is gonna be a no-no
string and I'm gonna have ID like then
and now so I'm gonna create a tag I'm
gonna do this my tag to do this illness
list a new suit thing you know I'm gonna
just take this one and this and now like
this this is what I need now in my
resolve are I'm gonna say def tags I'll
just get all my tag photo list tag this
I need to have the create tag
like this and now what I can do its ear
just want to get one time create and
after that here I can tags maybe a list
of tag like this like yes good good good
thing I think it's done keys I'm gonna
create a tag name I'm gonna set on them
like a sport and just give me back the
name and the ID perfect at my time
yeah perfect
and now if I do my get if I do tag name
and I have good
but now when I'm gonna create an image
maybe a use are gonna have tags so yeah
I'm gonna have image URL who's gonna be
image URL and now here I'm gonna have
tags which is gonna be taxed so here I
can just take the image URL yeah but I
mean no I mean I can keep it like this
and just do this in my context or
finally oops inside this one when I'm
gonna create an image I can do my
Association and check if the tag exists
so I'm gonna do an get tagged by name
and this one's gonna be
no I think it's like that's fair
remember get by but I don't need that
time so I'll get get to by name so when
I'm gonna quit my image I can I think
it's if I do this only one that can be
good
mmm
oh dude
so my crazy marriage it's cool so now I
shall create here so now here I'm gonna
need to pass the image and after that
I'm going to pass the tags suddenly
have question you can ask and also I
have again 30 minutes or if you have
questions about any tutorial or whatever
you we can go over your screen on like
hangout and we can just make sure that
you understand everything and and also
with any project you well I mean this is
free so I told I'm not you to just here
to help you
okay so finally I'm gonna do this with
one at the time I'm gonna call that
target by Ram
yeah but I passed this like this in the
morning name like this
yeah but yeah - I just need to I mean I
don't need this we're all here what I
need to return is this thing here
this one now I'm going to go one other
time
oops I miss my
