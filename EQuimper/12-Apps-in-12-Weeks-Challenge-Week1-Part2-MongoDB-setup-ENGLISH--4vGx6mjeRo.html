tutorial so like I said like 50 done I
do the video in French and in English so
I show you the guitar and you're going
to have it is a 1 English this is why we
finish in the last one and so I'm going
to post this link in the description so
after that something i didn't show you
is they get in your file so in the
beginning now for the one who didn't
know what is that it's so it's a fire
where you put what you don't want to
push up get together so example the no
module it's something you don't want on
any of your project because of where
when someone clone your project finally
gonna always use NPM install and that's
going to reinstall everything you have
inside your package that Jason so that
let you get up repo lean and if you do
the expected and in time I get ignore 52
i put the vs code so this folder is
created by fo x visual studio CO and I
think web song create a the idea too so
it's the same kind of fun I don't want
to push that in I get up so we're going
to continue where we left into this
video first thing I like clean code and
what I use is es link for the one who
don't know what is ESN is something
going to restrict your code and may
going to show you your error let's
relieve your error but code style error
so like I mean you if you miss a
semicolon or you have a declare a
variable but you don't use the something
like that so for that it'll be easy we
just need to install one package called
yes live config really cutting so sorry
so I make a one typo so I'm going to
just watch it go we're going to see oh
that's right so this is Yahoo I know
your own add that should be so this is
well as Miss
so in India in yarn our mpm you have to
kind of dependency you have the real
differences who can use inside you like
a were cruising right now so you're real
depth or you have your death this they
have dependency is for what you just
inside them they're not known so if you
use NPM thats going to be en npm e I for
install and that should be for their
dependency for us because i use yarn
this is yarn as HD es limb country
really cutting so i really like this yes
in context because you use the same of
our B&amp;amp;B for the one who already use but
we have some have less restriction like
coumadin go where you need to put a coma
at the end of each item inside an arrow
something like that so for setup ESN you
need to have ESPN receipt it's like
Babel orosi so it's a package you need
to set up PSN working so don't think we
need if X am here inside the ESN RC
double coat you always need in and put
ready cutting so now you can see now if
I remove a cynical idea to our one is
safe mix it and it's one ever sick
missing semicolon so it's really good to
follow this pattern after that what I
really like 12 is always an editor
config file this file is you it make use
of a tool called editor config i'm going
to show you how to install right after
we let you go be consistent between
developer so example if you use pace
stabbed the other they are going to use
a because you use the same token fee but
you don't need to change anything inside
editor
in that good for sublime Adam web store
and I think in visual Zuko here so all
the code i right it's really something I
almost copy phrase every time so yeah
I'm going to add in dying style that's
going to be spaced side on one tab here
I'm gonna have in down then indents eyes
on to everyone i'm going to have a to
inside and a line going to put LF after
that i want to have charter we're going
to write inside a utf-8 after that i
want to trim trim drilling white so easy
it's true what is why i spray is this
play so if i put a white face right
there I want when I space to remove it
and I want to insert finally a final new
line on each face so now if I say I've
no white space and I create a new life
and oh oh that can work is unique to
package first one you need is our
country so inside this Aussie usual you
go there inside sublime you just go to
the package control and sign Adam you go
to the package manager and inside web
stone you just go inside the plug-in
installed so that we need dsm and this
one that's only needa so after that what
we're going to do for this video if
install Mongoose set up a native
database and we're going to use mongoose
so the first thing we need to do you're
going to add mongoose as a dependency
inside that project like that everything
is working first thing we need so here
you see I've want people so one ear i
get is I need a new line so I need a new
line let's maybe a
search final so you see him when I have
an error i can see using creamy color
like that so oh you see now he's working
so have my new life first thing we need
to import mongoose so what is Mongoose
Mongoose is a driver for using MongoDB
will make your life more mature much
more easier than working with the
MongoDB database so what we're going to
do we're gonna set up the database of
first thing because i'm using a really
small index gs5 right there i'm going to
just put everything inside in some other
project we're going to module everything
much more better here we're going to
install the premises insight Mongo so
Mongo can use premises and the premises
we're going to use is the global one
coming from the net thief jealous view
you can add blue board q something like
that if you want to use other premises I
don't like call back l so that's why i
am using premises extrait ever after
that we need to connect the MongoDB to
the two URL this were real right now
going to be the one we use for the hotel
when we're going to push this out to
pero cool we're gonna set up with Angola
so here sorry you're going to use Raquel
oath and a i'm going to put short URL to
toe and that's it so this is all you set
up your connection and after that i want
to see when i get a connection have air
for a method call on so on the app and
one time so when its open have a
function we're gonna say north and mongo
DB connected just for let us know when
that work so that we have on metal so
this is what i really like about visual
studio you can see we think before you
do something on ever we have an error
here in the function and I want to
control error the error finale so now we
can check if that all work no index year
one could it be connected everything is
working I didn't show you how to install
MongoDB just go on other tutorial I mean
they have so many girls right now a
MongoDB and this is really easy to
install from me i installed MongoDB with
blue on blue so that make my Mongo
database always burning I just closed
when I close my computer so for you you
may be going to need mangu d like that
after that I'm tired to do note in index
GI so we're gonna Twitter strip so here
the scrip you use its that's going to be
an easy one to start and that's going to
be known so the common with all we do in
that lab here and now you sign my
terminal I can do beyond start and this
is supposed to do the same thing that's
so I hope you enjoyed the video I'm
going to pull this code to get on and I
hope to see you in the next video if you
subscribe if you like here and click
like and may be sure to your friends so
thank you guys every good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
