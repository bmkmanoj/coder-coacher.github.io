need it's a user can like after the user
can be the author and everyone I get the
image I can ask for the user the avatar
and all this stuff I can get its user I
need to get my likes conned
I think I'm gonna need to aggregate
aggregate the con from the table okay go
gasps stop
oh man this Google oh okay and after the
following I have many many comments
yesterday user can also bookmark
so I like it's a reaction a comments a
reaction a bookmark it's a waiting
reaction and after that I'm gonna have
the Fagin you can follow another user
that's going to be a reaction so I'm
going to need a context reaction
yeah
and I bought this suggestion I think
your I just missed some shadow no shadow
yeah too much
Ranga sighting and I think it's gonna be
a bit better
and maybe for
yes I just think blue I can't change it
but I don't need to do this right there
and I'm gonna need to have a bit more
space oops
it's on I shall create the user really
I'm gonna do the education yet but at
least I can create the users
you
about that at all
I think I'm done gonna make his
requirement
okay
oh man
so it's a V and use our on delete so
when someone delete I use already
they're all down
feel not know yeah but I mean so now I'm
gonna need to change my scene thank yous
are we're gonna sing maybe I don't know
five you thank you sir
well
okay yeah but if it's an ID so I mean I
can just random this thing to want to
the number of figures are know what
happens anyway we will not implement
four five
oops no my photo ever use ID yeah and if
I search for my use arm I get all of
them I'm gonna just create my account
resolver and I'm gonna just copy paste
this thing and I'm gonna just yeah this
thing and now I can do the same with my
schema I come type take these take this
take this go there change that for
account type don't forget to go to
scheme oops type and after that now I
can just create an object here it's
gonna be a user by user can have a feel
ID
it's an O'Neill ID after that I can know
when a user I have been created maybe I
don't need that but maybe my finally
gonna need so and after that here what
I'm gonna
- its username we just sit a no new
string you know so we're gonna have an
avatar no new string and now here I can
see I'm gonna have mini photo and this
thing's going to be an O'Neill blast-off
photo and now you know you're gonna need
to manage this thing by doing a weasel
weasel or that icon that photos for user
I'm gonna quit this one now here I'm
gonna call my function icon that I'm
gonna pass this user
No
perfect so now I have a photo here so
now I can see user know what I can type
ah maybe here I need to refresh
yeah
think it's goodbye
so that may be the thing I would like to
have it my photo should be able to have
a user because I mean what I'm gonna
show this thing I have here so that's
gonna be the photo I don't touch a user
night fish so so one photos gonna have
an O'Neill user and that's gonna resolve
to resolve or like that so now I can go
to my phone I'm gonna call my function
those and I'm gonna test my photo
but now that's going to be repo that
long and this thing is going to be used
on another I can say photo ID use our
username nah man what I mean do that
have a situation user no because it
belongs to so it's going to be singular
yes
yeah
so now what I can maybe add for the 40
piece that I think's gonna be there like
yeah and the photo can get that done in
there oops
you
here I miss one thing I think I'm gonna
do this it's just like finally create a
primary key between the photo I didn't
tag ID so if this is one and one that's
going to be 11 so I think for now this
one can be given so what I need to say
it's a photo
photo can have as many light as many
lights coming from reaction like photo

yeah so many too many I mean it's quite
the same thing
