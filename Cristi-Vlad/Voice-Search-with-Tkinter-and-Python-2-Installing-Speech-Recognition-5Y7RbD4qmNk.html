that we have to install additional
modules to be able to work with Google's
speech recognition API but actually
there's only one module that we have to
install so open up a command prompt I'm
using Windows 10 64 bits here with
Python 3.4 installed so in the command
prompt do this install speech
recognition all in one word now I
already have it installed which is why I
get the requirement already satisfied
message now we open up a Python shell
and you can do it here in the command
prompt and check to see if it installed
correctly but it should have installed
correctly since if you didn't get any
error message while installing it by a
bit so we try importing speech
underscore recognition as as our notice
that we use an underscore
so speech underscore recognition as as
our and if no error message is displayed
you should be good to go now we exit
this and this okay so I'll post a link
to the github of speech recognition in
the description if you want to read more
about it and the next video will gonna
learn how to select and use a custom
image like this one so we'll learn how
to use this image instead of the default
icon that's in the title of any TK
inter-app Legation and we'll also going
to select the style from TGA or same
decay that's going to be used by the
widgets of the application alright so
that's it for now
if you enjoyed this video please give me
a thumbs up and subscribe thank you for
