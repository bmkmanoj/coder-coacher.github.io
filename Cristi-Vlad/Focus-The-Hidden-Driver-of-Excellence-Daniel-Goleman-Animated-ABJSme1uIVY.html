loneliness and isolation that go along
with living in a virtual world of tweets
status updates and posting pictures of
my dinner he notes that his classmates
are losing their ability for
conversation
let alone the soul-searching discussions
that can enrich the college years Daniel
Goleman there are two types of mind
systems according to Goldman bottom-up
and top-down dating back millions of
years in evolution the reflexive quick
acting bottom-up circuitry favors
short-term thinking impulse and speedy
decisions the top-down circuitry at the
front and top of the brain or a later
addition their full maturation dating
back near hundreds of thousands of years
and of course let's look further into
these systems in the following minutes
I'll give you some of my insights from
Daniel Goleman's book focus when we
actively engage our attention we are
doing a top-down activity which acts as
an antidote to going through the day on
autopilot like a zombie the bottom-up
system what's active engagement of
attention it is staying alert to what's
going on around you it's questioning
your automatic daily routines and
mindless habits it is the conscious act
of trying to improve them for many of us
it's a luxury just to get some
uninterrupted private moments during the
day when we can lean back and reflect
yes those count as some of the most
valuable moments in our day especially
when it comes to creativity
end of quote when so many distractions
impair our ability to focus and fatigue
our attention we need to take a break
our brain craves free time where it can
reclaim open awareness in the tumult of
our daily distractions and to-do lists
innovation that ends in open times it
flourishes that's why the annals of
discovery are rife with tail
of a brilliant insight during the walk
or a bath on a long line or vacation
open time let's the creative spirit
flourish
Thanks schedules kill it end of quote
taking a walk down the street won't do
because there's too much toll on
attention coming from cars people and
the overall noise
in contrast a walk in the park or simply
gazing at the cloud puts far less troll
on attention this triggers bottom-up
attention modestly allowing circuits for
top-down efforts to replenish their
energy restoring attentiveness and
memory and improving cognition what
about high achievers and expert
performers those are the forefront of
human kind what do they do to focus
their attention I'm sure you've heard
that the 10,000 hour rule or how much
you have to practice to become an expert
in any given field the problem it's only
half true if you are a duffer at golf
say and make the same mistake every time
you try a certain swing or put 10,000
hours of practicing that error will not
improve your game it will still be a
duffer albeit an older one end of quote
according to Anders Ericsson the go-to
leading researcher in the field of
expertise you don't get benefits from
mechanical repetition but by adjusting
your execution over and over to get
closer to your goal and of code you need
to engage in deliberate practice to
become an expert you need to combine
extended hours of work with focused
attention you require feedback from
yourself or from someone who is better
than you amateurs are content at some
point to let their efforts become
bottom-up operations after about 50
hours of training whether in skiing or
driving people get to that good enough
performance level where they can go
through the motions more or less
effortlessly and if quote additional
practice in this bottom-up system leads
to negligible
provement the experts in contrast keep
paying attention top-down intentionally
counteracting the brainless urge to
automatize routines they concentrate
actively on those moves they have yet to
perfect on correcting what's not working
in their game and if quote experts never
stop learning they keep pushing it now I
think it's more than obvious that the
way the world works today hinders focus
making it more difficult to achieve
excellence in any given domain tools
like this book and a few others that I
will cover in the future come to help us
so if you're working hard on something
and you notice you're not making much of
a progress you might consider locking
yourself up in a closet with this book
at hand it could help you break through
