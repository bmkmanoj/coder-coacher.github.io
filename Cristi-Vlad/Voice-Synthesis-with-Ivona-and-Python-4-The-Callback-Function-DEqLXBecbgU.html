function if this is your first time
watching the series I'd recommend
looking over the three previous videos
as well so you know what I'm talking
about in short we're building a voice
synthesis application using the ivona
api in Python so first let's delete this
line over here we've seen that it works
already and we want to do something
similar inside a callback function but
we pass and ivona ok so we once I've
wanted to speak from within the callback
function and we do this by calling we
speak entry guess and i'll explain that
in a moment 10 and ok so we wanted to
speak whatever is inside the entry field
whatever is inside position one and the
end of the entry field you see this when
we run the application so once that's
done we want to clear the entry field
and we do this by entry delete
whatever is between position one and the
end a larger field so similar moving on
we want to have the callback function
invoked by the breath of the speak
button so we're gonna have to modify the
command recommended the button so
instead of thr which will use in a
following video which is to call back
let's see how this works hit f5 running
and valid syntax oh yeah once again so
let's just grab some text from my blog
over here okay thanks and he speak
I have no intention to set another PR in
2017 because reading is not a Madison
for me okay so it cleared the field let
me put it over here so it it's for
whatever was but whatever was between
position one which would be this and the
end say this and after that we have we
had the feels weird but let's do it one
more time and notice how the app freezes
while speaking I have no intention to
set another PR in 2017 because reading
is not a menacing for me that that made
the appt unresponsive so it froze and we
couldn't use it if we had other I don't
know options or other functionalities of
the application we wouldn't be able to
use them or I don't know select them
while having I bonus speaking so how do
you think we'll solve this well we're
going to try and fold this in the next
video using something called threatened
okay so that's it for now please give me
a thumbs up on your way out and i'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
