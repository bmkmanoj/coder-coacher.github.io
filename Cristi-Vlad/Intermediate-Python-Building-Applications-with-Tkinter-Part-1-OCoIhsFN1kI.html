graphical application in Python using TK
inter now for those of you who don't
know TK inter is the built-in Python GUI
development module and in this
particular case we want to create a very
minimal application that acts like a
universal search engine or a search bar
now what do I mean by minimal well
simply put it will stay on top of all
your windows and it will occupy the
least of space within within the monitor
I will be coding using idle which is the
built-in Python development interface
very minimal in itself and I will be
using TK inter and web browser as the
modules which are also built in if you
run a recent version of Python to check
that you can open a Python console shell
and try importing web browser web
browser and TK enter so if you don't
have any errors over here then you're
good to go
so prerequisites Python TK enter and web
browser now I'm doing this under Windows
8 64 bits but I think this is compatible
with other operating systems that
support by Chthon with that in mind
let's get started
so we're gonna import DK enter as TK and
from TK enter we're gonna import t TK
we're also gonna import web browser okay
so far so good the first thing to do
would be to create an instance of the TK
TK class and assign it to a variable
let's say root is TK TK and let's give
it a title of universal search bar to
see our little progress so far
let's hit f5 and run this save it as DK
app there you go nothing in it now we're
gonna start adding some widgets let's
say the first one would be a label
widget let's call it label one we're
gonna use the t TK here label we're
gonna add it to the root to our root
here and we're gonna say the text query
or search term or whatever you want and
we're gonna use the grid geometry the
grid geometry tool to organize to
organize our widget within the within
the app so label one grid let's say row
0 column 0
and this is gonna put our label on the
top left of the app okay now let's try
and run it see what we've got so far so
you see it was this is a text label it's
a label basically and it has been added
to the top left corner alright next
we're gonna create an entry where you
will be able to input text immediately
near our label so let's do entry 1
equals ttk a entry we're also gonna
assign this to the route and we're gonna
give it a width of 50 now we're gonna
use the grid manager grit geometry
manager to organize this on row zero and
column a 1 in this case column 1 okay
see what we've got so far now we can add
text but it doesn't do anything so it
only accepts text input
let's stop here for now and continue in
the next video if you have questions
