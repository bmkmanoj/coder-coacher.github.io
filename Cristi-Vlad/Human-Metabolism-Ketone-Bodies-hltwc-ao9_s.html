metabolism today I'm gonna talk about
ketone bodies by reviewing the
subsection 17.3 from lenin juris
textbook of biochemistry so ketone
bodies i already drawn them here
acetone acetyl acetate and delta beta
hydroxy butyrate or beta hydroxy
butyrate are byproducts of fatty acid
metabolism and liver minor Condrey are
so hardly created let's start and
Deliver with fatty acid oxidation which
leads to the formation of acetyl co a
which can further enter into the TCA or
cramps or citric acid cycle for energy
production or undergo ketogenesis and be
converted into these ketone bodies
ketogenesis so the first ketone body
acetone which is produced in smaller
quantities is exhaled while acetoacetate
and beta-hydroxybutyrate
they travel via bloodstream to extra
hepatic tissue where they are converted
back to acetylcholine which can then
enter the TCA or Krebs cycle the
ultimate purpose is to provide energy
for cells and tissues throughout the
body what happens in the brain well the
brain under normal feeding conditions
not on a restricted carbohydrate diet
the brain prefers glucose to be used for
energy but under conditions of low
glucose depleted glycogen or so low
blood glucose depleted glycogen a
ketogenic diet fasting and other
conditions it can adapt to using
acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate
for energy
now as ketone bodies are being exported
to extra hepatic tissue this allows for
continued oxidation of fatty acids in
the liver and the production of ketone
bodies when acetyl co a it does not
enter the TCA cycle in another video I'm
going to discuss about the regulation of
ketogenesis this is it for this one
though so if you enjoyed it please make
sure to hit that thumbs up button and
subscribe and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
