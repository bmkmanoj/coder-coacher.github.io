perform SQL injection with SQL map
before we start I want to say that if
this is the first time you're doing or
you're learning SQL injection you should
probably try to learn how to do it
manually because that's the only way in
which you're gonna understand how it
actually works and once you know how to
do it manually you can probably start
using tools like SQL map because there
is no no reason to keep doing it
manually since it's slow
it kind of is slow and it can take a lot
of time and you might actually miss the
target okay so another thing is that
this is one of the very few videos that
I've been doing on cybersecurity and if
you want to see more videos like this
like videos involving capture-the-flag
challenges or penetration testing or
offensive security related videos please
let me know in the comment sections
below so as you might have guessed this
is actually a vulnerable machine so it's
not a real target so this is a safe
environment and I'm actually using Kali
Linux to do this obviously so Kali Linux
is probably one of the most used tools
for offensive security or I should say
operating system for offensive security
and penetration testing so our
vulnerable machine is actually so it
hosts a wordpress website which is which
is vulnerable to SQL injection ok so
let's see how this works so let's just
do it from the
very beginning let's see what is the
target or the IP of my virtual machine
of my vulnerable virtual machine so it
is 192 168 point 0.1 let's browse to 192
168 point zero point 101 okay so this is
actually it after some information
gathering I learned that this has a
directory called academic RT b1 r TB 1
or TB 1 ok and this is actually the home
for the wordpress website so once we
know that we can use WP scan to scan it
and see if there are any vulnerabilities
so 192 168 0 101 academic r TB 1
ok
so I've already done this and this is
actually or not that this is actually
the vulnerability that I've been looking
at here so the SQL injection
vulnerability so 1033 yeah I've learned
that index dot PHP cat is the vulnerable
method to SQL injection and once I know
that I can just let's clear this we can
just actually start using SQL maps so
we'll use SQL map - you our target HTTP
192 168 0 101 academic RTB 1 and it was
index.php cat equals let's say 1 and the
first the first thing we're gonna want
to do is to see what are the data bases
of this of this SQL so we're gonna
specify - DBS okay and we learned that
there are three databases and the one
that we're going to look into is the
WordPress database so delete - DBS and
specify - D and the database WordPress
and right now we want to see what so the
next thing we want to do is to see the
tables in that database so we specify
tables okay once we know the tables will
actually probably want to look into WP
users for login information which is
what we're going to use in the login
panel so we're gonna delete tables and
specify the table WP users
and we're actually gonna look for
columns now okay so we have quite a few
columns here but we're only probably
interested in user email user login and
user pass I'm not even sure that we're
gonna use the email so let's just
specify the user login and user pass so
we're modifying the query and specifying
the column user login and user pass and
what we want to do now is to dump these
values okay so do we want to store the
hashes to a temporary file sure
do we want to correct them hell yeah
so let's say let's just say no here
okay so it finished really quickly so we
have the username Nick James and the
password admin so we didn't actually had
to we didn't have to look for the
password for these hashes because the
tool did it automatically okay let's
head to the control panel so to the
login panel and use Nick James and admin
so let's say WP login dot PHP we're
gonna use the user Nick James and the
password admin alright so we are in the
admin panel of this outdated WordPress
so the next thing we should probably do
is to try to upload a PHP shell and once
we're inside the server will look for
escalating our privileges to root but I
guess that's the subject of another
video so if you enjoyed this video and
you'd like to see more cybersecurity
capture the flag and penetration testing
walkthroughs please let me know in
either of the comment sections below
thank you for watching and I guess I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
