orbiter took several pictures at the
cydonia Martian region during a mission
to the Red Planet
one of the images this one received
particular attention from the public at
a first glance it is easy to note a
striking resemblance with a human face
people prone to conspiracy theory and
magical thinking and also many people
from the non-scientific educated public
hypothesized that what they saw was the
work of aliens 20 years later another
spacecraft Mars Global Surveyor took
pictures of the same region now looks
like our friends the aliens were trying
to cover up their traces as it was
pointed out from the very beginning the
images were nothing more than the result
of natural forces like erosion and winds
and the light and shadow effects at the
time the 1976 image was taken and I
think we should give proper credit to
the Sun for that but many people didn't
buy it as Rob Carroll wrote in the
skeptics dictionary one of his books
this soon gave birth to the claim that
the face was a sculpture of a human
being located next to a city whose
temples and fortifications could also be
seen some began to wonder were these
built by the same beings who built the
ancient airports in Nazca Peru and who
were now communicating to us through
elaborate symbols carved in crop circles
end of quote now this is probably one of
the classic examples of power
dolia in psychology pareidolia refers to
seeing or detecting patterns where there
are none other examples of pareidolia
include images of human faces images of
objects animals and even religious
figures in cloud formations the moon
rabbit the man in the moon the face of
Jesus in the stump of a tree hidden
messages in record music records or
music play backwards you know do an
image search on these and amuse or amaze
yourself now Carl Sagan an astronomer
thought or things or thought that
pareidolia is an ingrained trait we
acquired through evolution in his 1995
book the demon haunted world
he explains and I'm iguana and I'm gonna
quote here as soon as the infant can see
it recognizes faces and we now know that
this skill is hardwired in our brains
those infants who a million years ago
were unable to recognize a face small
backlash were less likely to win the
hearts of their parents and less likely
to prosper these days nearly every
infant is quick to identify a human face
and respond to respond with a goonie
grin now while this may be beneficial
for us in recognizing faces there may be
other explanations for pareidolia toward
animals or objects according to dr.
Steven novella a clinical neurobiologist
and senior editor of science-based
medicine and I'm going to quote here
humans have a well-documented tendency
for pattern recognize
that is both a great cognitive strength
but also can be a weakness because we
may see patterns that do not actually
exist
we constantly recognize illusory
patterns which are manifested in
pareidolia data-mining hyperactive
agency detection and superstitious
thinking so pareidolia this innate
tendency of ours for illusory patterns
can be detrimental in many circumstances
what should we do or what can we do to
overcome it now it may be clear that
thanks to evolution we are thrown when
it comes to detecting patterns in
randomness and it can often do us more
harm than good we enter life prepackaged
with numerous heuristics and biases
mental shortcuts as I explained in
previous videos in this series
now these they they may have served us
well in a dangerous primordial world
where we could have fallen prey to
predatory animals and in some
circumstances they may serve us well
today but more often than not they don't
so one way or several ways we can
respond to our flawed brain is by
raising our thinking above it's faulty
factory defaults and we can do this
through learning about critical thinking
learning and developing critical
thinking metacognition which is thinking
about thinking and analyzing how our
thoughts thought processes undergo
through healthy scepticism and
systematic doubt for the claims of other
people
somatic doubt towards our own thoughts
this way we can avoid self jeopardy in
research we also do this by
appropriately applying the scientific
method which I think can also be applied
in personal life as well now as I've
said it before good thinking skills are
not a given it's thinking like any other
skill is developed through deliberate
practice and to develop your thinking
and to grow your mind I
besides these suggestions that I made
I'd also recommend you read the book of
Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman which
is Thinking Fast and Slow and next time
you get yourself finding patterns faces
and meaning in meaningless information
or in randomness try becoming aware of
your bias this is one of the first and
probably most important steps to to
become better thinker okay so this is it
for pareidolia please hit the like

the next video on becoming a better
thinker thank you for taking the time to
