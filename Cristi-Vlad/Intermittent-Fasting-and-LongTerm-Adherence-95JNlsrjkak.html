happens
investing strategy for the long term
same as with ketosis I would advise that
intermittent fasting should be adopted
as a long-term strategy not only that it
elicits many more benefits than it would
as a short-term strategy but it is also
easier to adhere to and make it part of
a better lifestyle one of the possible
advantages is the control over your
feeling and fasting behavior with I f
you know that you're only going to eat
during your feeding window whatever that
is this will minimize for unplanned
intake of food and inefficient snacking
all throughout the day you will have
better control over the amount of food
you consume and you can easily plan your
day according to your meal intake of
course from time to time you can allow
for exceptions such as dinner with a
friend dinner that is not in your
feeding window if you're free feeding
window occurs during the first part of
the day but these exceptions are what
they are exceptions and not the rule
long-term intermittent fasting will
allow for increased satisfaction when
you consume food especially if you fast
for 20 hours and then try to consume all
your calories within a four hour window
most of the times you will not be able
to do that because you will reach the
diet and satisfaction somewhere below
your required daily caloric intake I
experienced this almost every day
another possible advantage is that this
is a fairly fixed strategy that will
allow your body to efficiently adapt to
the protocol and also burn more fat one
or a couple of hours into a fasting
window now if you can seem food every
three to four hours you may never be
able to efficiently tap into your body
fat and you may constantly be hungry due
to the fairly increased insulin
secretion
the fixed strategy can also be seen as a
disadvantage because you will not be
able to eat whenever you want you will
only consume food during your feeding
window with the few exceptions that I
discussed above personally I've been
doing intermittent fasting since january
2014 almost every day I have never been
more satisfied and adherent to the way I
eat I achieved my physiologic goals ever
since the very beginning so I've been in
maintenance mode almost all this time I
consume comfort foods everyday foods
like dark chocolate cheese nuts and I
will discuss about them in more detail
in a future lecture in our next lecture
I will tell you about the killer
combination of ketosis and intermittent
fasting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
