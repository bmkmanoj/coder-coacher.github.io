becoming a better thinker today I'm
going to discuss question 10 the last
question of the baloney detection kit
which is a set of 10 questions created
by Paul Sagan and Michael Shermer to ask
oneself or the person who makes a
certain claim the ultimate purpose of
these ten questions is to improve
critical thinking so question 10 do the
claimants personal beliefs and biases
drive the conclusions now the majority
of us do not know that many of the
decisions we make every day are in great
part based on personal biases and
ideologies on heuristics and habitual
thinking and they have little to do with
rational thinking it is not only the
decisions but also the thoughts we have
in the actions we take or make modern
humans that is Homo sapiens sapiens have
evolved over the last two hundred
thousand years earlier in the hominid
species so earlier hominid species
traced back to about two million years
ago think of Homo erectus for example
throughout this entire time which is a
lot of time we have developed automatic
decisions that would prevent us from
falling prey to predatory animals or
getting cast out of the group or inborn
flaws that have been shaped and polished
by evolution they have in part provided
as put a safe place in the group or in
the tribe you can think of herd
mentality for example so herd mentality
you don't want to be the one going
against the consensus within the group
otherwise you may risk getting thrown
out and in a tribal based society
getting around all alone
be difficult you are safer if you stick
to the group herd mentality is part of
our inner biases you apply it
unconsciously even if sometimes it is to
your detriment another one is cognitive
dissonance or what happens when you hold
contradicting ideas and thoughts in your
mind cognitive dissonance great mental
unease and spend more energy when you
are being confronted with ideas and
claims that are contradictory to your
own beliefs your tendency is to avoid
dissonance by disregarding the beliefs
and staying loyal to the ones you
already hope you already have this is
how in part the confirmation bias works
in general not everything about logical
and cognitive fallacies is bad we should
pay tribute to some of them as they
helped us get around and as they help us
get around even even in this society of
today which is much more different than
what we being used to from an
evolutionary perspective this doesn't
mean we shouldn't educate yourself
educate ourselves about cognitive biases
being aware about your inner Mental
Floss is one step to better thinking
however do know that awareness does not
provide complete safety you can think of
the bias bias irrational and critical
thinkers may also fall prey to these
biases however it is better knowing
about them than living your life in
complete mental darkness if I can put it
that way a good application of critical
thinking for the purpose of minimizing
personal blass is the scientific method
and I think it should not only be useful
for people doing scientific research I
think it should be included in the
decision-making tool kit or repertoire
of each and every one of us
I assume would become a better society
we can learn from the way in which the
peer review process is conducted in
research so peer review has been around
ever since the first science journals
that were about 300 years ago so
according to elsevier and I'm going to
pull here peer review helps validate
research establish a method by which it
can be evaluated and increasing it with
networking possibilities within research
communities the scientific method and
the peer review process are not without
flaws they have critiques and critics
and they have been brought criticism
nonetheless they are some of the best
tools we have for validating prevail
dating research and for minimizing bias
and of course they can also help you
spot the potential deceptive intentions
of others whether it be the media
whether it be I don't know your friends
gurus everyone who makes and everyone
over anyone who makes an extraordinary
claim now as an ending thought I think
there should be no place for ideology
and politics and science to be objective
in your approach you have to stave them
off and look into the data you have at
hand either good or bad so here's how
michael shermer elegantly elegantly puts
it so I'm going to hold science deals in
fuzzy fractions of certainties and
uncertainties were evaluation and Big
Bang cosmology may be assigned a point
nine probability of being true and
creationism and UFOs a point 1
probability of being true in between our
bordel borderline claims we might assign
that we might assign superstring theory
8.7 and cryonics 8.2 in all cases we
open-minded and flexible willing to
reconsider our assessments as new
evidence arises so never fixate on a
theory this is undeniably what makes
sense so fleeting and frustrating too
many people yeah because you always have
to be willing to update your arguments
it is at the same time what makes sense
the most glorious part of the human mind
I guess he says it all all right and
with this I conclude my interpretation
of the baloney detection kit I hope it
makes us more prepared to facing
extraordinary and sometimes deceptive
claims from that come from others the
series of becoming a critical thinker
continues though as there are many other
subjects that I need to touch upon so
I'll see you in the next one please give
me a thumbs up and subscribe if you
