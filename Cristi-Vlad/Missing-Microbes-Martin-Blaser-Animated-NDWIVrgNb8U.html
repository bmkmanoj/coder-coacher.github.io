totally dominated by forms of life too
small to be seen by the naked eye
for about three billion years bacteria
were the sole living inhabitants on
earth they occupied every tranche of
land air and water
driving chemical reactions they created
the biosphere and set conditions for the
evolution of multicellular life
they made the oxygen we breathe the soil
we till the food webs that support our
oceans without microbes we could not eat
or breathe without us nearly all
microbes will do just fine Martin Blaser
in this video I discussed some of my
highlights from martin blazers book
missing microbes microbes not only
inhabited world around us but also that
within us we are populated by families
of cooperating and competing bugs that
make up our microbiota which we acquire
early in life these microbes play
important roles in our immunity and our
ability to fight disease here are some
items on their to-do list breaking down
fibers and digesting starch production
of short chain fatty-acids
immuno regulation production of vitamin
K and other vitamins and so on up to 15
percent of the calories present in your
food are extracted by the guest bacteria
in your colon and used to feed you and
if quote more interesting other microbes
known to live in new guinea Highlanders
allow their hosts to live on a diet that
is 90% sweet potato which is low in
protein and of code according to blazer
the gut microbes in these people are
basically able to produce proteins from
potatoes by fixing or converting
nitrogen to make amino acids which are
the building blocks of proteins in short
it is your microbiome that keeps you
healthy and parts of it are disappearing
food allergies are everywhere a
generation ago peanut allergies were
extremely rare more and more children
suffer immune response
the proteins in foods not just in nuts
but in milk eggs soy fish fruits you
name it someone is allergic to it and
the quote another more commercial facet
that this is that the pharmaceutical
companies found that they could make big
profits by selling antibiotics to
farmers by the ton rather than by the
milligram to physicians and if goal as
per blazer about 70 to 80 percent of
antibiotics in the US are used to fatten
up farm animals this is a double-edged
sword because it also contributes to the
development of antibiotic resistance in
livestock and the leakage of residues in
our food and water science and modern
medicine have progressed tremendously in
the last 200 years millions of lives
have been saved and despite the
potential negative consequences of
c-sections and of high antibiotic use
childbirth is much safer than it used to
be but with this incredible progress has
come a silent hazard that we are just
beginning to understand high rates of
cesarean sections and the overuse of
antibiotics and mothers and newborns are
altering the types of microbial species
that mothers have always passed on to
their newborns end of quote now what
happens in c-sections compared to normal
birth instead of travelling down the
birth canal picking up lactobacilli the
baby is surgically exerted from the womb
through an incision in the abdominal
wall end of quote
so the infant is not populated by the
beneficial bacteria from the mother on a
more cynical note it takes less time at
first to do a c-section than to wake up
a vaginal birth and most doctors and
hospitals make more money from
performing operations like c-sections
than from natural births and if both
according to plays are the most urgent
issues that need solution involve the
over prescription of antibiotics and
over-reliance on c-sections
additionally he think that
additions should be paid sufficiently to
thoroughly evaluate each case the
government could put more effort into
the oversight of antibiotic use I do not
wish to ban antibiotics for cesarean
sections any more than anyone would
suggest banning automobiles I ask only
did they be used more wisely and that
antidotes to their worst side-effects be
developed and if quote pleasure is a
realist and remains positive we have
made so much real progress in combating
and eradicating terrible diseases but
now perhaps our efforts have peaked and
the fruits of discovery have left their
seeds indigestible and toxic
we must act for the consequences are
beginning to swallow us and stronger
storms a lie ahead
many types of solutions are available
for the future of our children and
theirs it is time for us to begin
implementing them in earnest thank you
