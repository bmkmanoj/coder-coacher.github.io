by testing the completed application but
first let's make a few small tweaks as a
reminder in this series we've learned
how to implement voice search with dk
enter in Python by using the speech
recognition module and by working with
Google's speech recognition API the
speech recognition module can use other
api's such as bangs as API Sphinx IBM
Watson tzas and so on and for more info
on that I'd recommend reading the
documentation now to be more specific
we've created a new voice search button
let me run this so this is what we've
created this voice search button to work
with the functionality of the app and we
also integrated the button with the rest
of the application now one thing that I
want to add is to have a pre selected
engine when we open the app as you can
see there is nothing selected for the
radio for any radial button right now so
I don't want to have to select I want to
have something that's already selected
to say I want to have Google selected as
default so whenever I open up the app
the radio button for Google is selected
so I don't have to do this so how do we
do this well it's quite simple now
scrolling down at the end of the
application there's this one line that I
have to add so right before running the
main loop I'll say button to set
Google so this is the value that's set
for button 2 and button do is our string
variable it's a string variable so it
encodes the value for the radio button
okay now let's see how it works first
I'll close this and this
save and run it again and I'm not sure
if you can see but the Google button is
selected all right another thing I want
is to restrict the application from
searching if the entry window is empty
let me show you what I'm talking about
so if Google is selected and I hit
search or enter it will open up a empty
search result or if I hit duck and put
my cursor in the query window and hit
enter or the search button let me just
hit enter here it will open up a result
with no query so how do I prevent this
well I will just add a conditional for
the get and callback functions the
callback function is invoked when
hitting the search well the get is
invoked when hitting enter so over here
if button to get equals Google and
entry 1 get is not empty so if our
button if our selected button is Google
and our entry whatever is in the entry
field if the entry field is not empty
that's basically what this means so let
me just copy paste this for the rest of
the function and for the gate function
and entry 1 get is not empty ok let's
save and run this now the entry field is
empty and I will hit search we'll click
search
nothing happens let's click on Amazon
search nothing happens
duck duck hit enter nothing happens so
that's how you prevent it for from
searching so if I if I run a query say
today and I hit enter it will pop up a
search result for today so that's how we
do it
now let's test the voice search
capability of the application which is
basically what we've been calling along
throughout the series and I want you to
please notice the sound effects that
we've added at the beginning just before
speaking that will prompt the user to
speak and after speaking acknowledging
that the message has been processed
please volume up if you don't hear the
prompts so
what are the morning routines of
celebrities
all right okay cool so that's the
application basically it works just fine
it works as we want it to and I guess
this is it for now for this video series
I hope you enjoyed it and I hope you
learned something on your way out please
hit that like button and subscribe thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
