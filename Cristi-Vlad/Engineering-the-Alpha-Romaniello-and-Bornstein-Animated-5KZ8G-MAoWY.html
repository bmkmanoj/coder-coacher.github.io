producing much more estrogen than you
should be and that extra estrogen can
have some pretty depressing side-effects
how depressing
how about man boobs man love boobs
just not on their own body you can grow
a beard or a manly moustache but if you
have moves is hard to feel like a guy
when you look like a chick Romanello and
Bornstein in this video i talk about
some of my takeaway messages from john
Romanello and adam Bornstein this book
men 2.0 engineering the alpha most of my
highlights relate to nutrition and
training you know the practical stuff so
that's what I'm going to focus on here
leaving the philosophical part of
becoming an alpha male to philosophers
let's start with something that's boring
to most of you asleep
lack of sleep both in terms of quality
and quantity is associated with higher
adiposity increased hunger higher
irritability and I can anecdotally
confirm this more stress smaller muscles
and even earlier death seriously most
people underestimate the importance of a
good night's sleep I know I did how I
feel after a night of 9 to 10 hours of
sleep cannot be put into words Romanello
and Bornstein suggests sleeping at least
6 hours per night and to improve your
sleep they recommend to make your room
colder and darker to eat more carbs at
night to eat protein before bed to have
a cheat day to restore leptin if you're
dieting and to avoid caffeine before bad
now getting back to those man boobs to
prevent higher estrogen and to promote
higher testosterone here's the laundry
list
take a pen and paper and write them down
most of these suggestions also hold for
better growth hormone secretion which
helps to make better use of the protein
you consume that is for muscle building
purposes additionally for better growth
hormone levels you should also fast
during the morning and eat pig before
bad growth hormone secretion is
negatively influenced by cortisol stress
enhanced cortisol keeps your abs covered
in flab because it's cortisol that
prevents all people from losing belly
fat even if you've been crushed by
cortisol for years adding in certain
exercise and diet strategies can reduce
the impact of cortisol strategies like
lactic acid training and intermittent
fasting also produce growth hormone
which further reduces cortisol and if
quote as you can see these are all
connected to each other
fasting also increases the secretion of
growth hormone offsets cortisol
production helps control leptin and
ghrelin levels to keep you satisfied and
even facilitates a healthier environment
for testosterone production end of quote
fasting and intermittent fasting receive
their well-deserved attention and a book
and I'll let you discover this yourself
all just throwing this little teaser
though as you'll discover after the
initial phase you are able to eat carbs
fats proteins and even dessert you can
eat breakfast or skip it you can drink
alcohol with the right approach and you
are even required to eat desserts on
cheat days and if quote now what about
that lactic acid training lactic acid
training is a difficult progression that
increases the amount of time your
muscles remain under tension time under
tension is one of the most overlooked
components of muscle growth and it's
important because this type of training
has been shown to drastically increase
output of growth hormone and of quote
you predominantly produce lactic acid
during the
concentration phase of your weight
lifting exercise so when you're actually
lifting the weight think about squeezing
a weight at the top of a bicep curl
you're producing a lot more lactic acid
than when you're lowering it and if go
for higher lactic acid production
modifier exercise to spend more time in
seconds on this concentric phase
Romanello and bernstein adopt a
non-discriminatory approach when it
comes to nutrition they don't bash or
demonize any macronutrient in fact they
are sensical over the importance and
timing of each I'm talking about carbs
protein and fats here and I hope you got
the message by now this book is very
practical Romanello and Bornstein
provide a progressive approach for males
to better themselves physically and also
from a mental or attitude standpoint
they split this transformation into an
alpha male in four phases prime adapt
surge and complete and each of them
gives you a blueprint for nutrition
training and not only you know the
philosophical part the illustrations of
how to do certain exercises
significantly improve the understanding
of their message now we've reached the
end of this video and I guess it's time
to let in a little bit of alpha male
philosophy if you're never willing to
take a risk you have almost no shot of
building anything worth mentioning there
are no statues built of those who lived
lives of mediocrity and on the thumb of
no heroes will you find the words he
played it safe thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
