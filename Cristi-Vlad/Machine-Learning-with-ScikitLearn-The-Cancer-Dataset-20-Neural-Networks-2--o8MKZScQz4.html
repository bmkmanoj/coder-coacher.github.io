neural network on the cancer data set in
scikit-learn now let's start with the
imports so from a scalar neural network
import MLP classifier and then from SK
learn data sets we're going to import
load breast cancer and finally from a
scale urn models selection we're going
to import train tests split which we're
going to use to split the data into
training and test subsets
now let's instantiate our cancer data
set so load breast cancer and then let's
split data Xchange X test y train Y test
train against splits so cancer data
cancer target and we're going to have a
random state of 0 now I'm not going to
go over explaining this because I've
already done this in the first few
videos in these series so I'm just going
to rush through the entire process
so now let's instantiate our MLP
classifier with a random state of 42 and
let's fit it to our data so and I'll be
fed to the
training data extreme white rain and
finally let's print the accuracy on the
training subset with we're going to have
three fixed points format MLP score the
score on the training subset X train
white train and the accuracy on the test
subset with the same three fixed points
format MLP score X test y test now let's
shift enter to run this alright so the
accuracy on both the training and test
subsets seems to be not so good compared
to the rest of the algorithms that we've
trained and tested in previous videos so
far and as suggested by Mueller and gato
in their machine learning book this may
be due to the scaling of the data the
fact that the features of each cancer
sample are not that the same scale and
this is basically what we're going to
try to fix in the next video and see if
the performance of the algorithm
improves okay so if you enjoyed this

I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
