perceptron based classifier as a
reminder we're following the code that's
in the artificial intelligence book
which is a length in the description so
proceed shall we
so the perceptron is a neuron which
receives input computes it and then
pertly produces an output it is
basically the building block of an
artificial neural network so let's build
one we're going to start by importing
numpy as NP we'll also import matplotlib
by plot as PLT and the library that
we're going to work with so import
neural lab let's say as an L and the
magic man mat block lib in line so that
we can display the plots within the
notebook all right let's run this now
let's create a very simple data set for
classification so let's say num data say
it's going to be a numpy array of the
following so let's say 0.22 0.34 this is
going to be 0 another sample 0.21 0.34
let's say 37 this is also going to be 0
a few more so let's say 0.25 0.35
and so 3 0.76 0.19 this is going to be
in the one class and the last one 0.84
0.14 and one so the first two values
will present the features and the third
one is the label in this array let's
make let's make sure we do that
separation so let's say features is num
data set all of them all the way up to
two and labels is going to be num data
set all rows and only the second column
and we're gonna do a reshape num data
set dot shape zero one so we have to
convert it into a column vector before
proceeding further so this is kind of a
pre-processing okay now let's briefly
look at this data using MATLAB so let's
say PLT we're gonna do a scatter plot of
the features all of them zero features
all of them one so our two features and
I wanna say PLT X label we're gonna
label the accesses as dimension one and
the y axis as dimension you could not
guess too so PLT title we're going to
name it our input data and since we
input data since we we've asked to
display our plots in line we don't have
to specify PLT show
okay so this is how our data looks like
pretty simple just a few points on a
plot now we're going to set the maximum
and minimum values for each dimension so
let's say them one men then one max then
two men then to max it's gonna be so 0
the minimum 1 the maximum 0 the minimum
1 the maximum okay so we have our input
data now our output is going to be just
a single neuron because our output is
gonna be either 0 or 1 so let's say num
output equals labels dot shape 1 this is
basically so where this is what this
means is actually that num put is equal
to 1 okay now our data set is made of 5
samples or rows and two dimensions or
features or columns so our perceptron is
gonna have two input neurons each one
for one dimension so let's say dim one
is dim one men and then one max and them
two is gonna be
dim two men dim to max okay and finally
we're creating the perceptron using
neural lab so let's say perceptron
equals neural lab net new P so this is
the methods or new perceptron and we're
gonna feed it our dimension 1 dimension
2 and the output so our output neuron is
gonna be numb output
so new P is for single letter
perceptrons in neuro lab alright we'll
stop here so we have the framework for
our perceptron and in the next video
we'll train it and do some visualization
of the training process please make sure
