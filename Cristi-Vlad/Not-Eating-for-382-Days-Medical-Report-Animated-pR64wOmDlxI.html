every few hours some of us even wake up
at night for a little snack we consider
this a normal behavior by modern day
standards however we can do otherwise
most healthy people can go for longer
periods of time without consuming food
provided that they have some body fat
and we all do and that they consume
water as a species will be used to
period the fasting or not eating because
earlier hunter-gatherers are thought to
have not had the availability of food we
have today that is 24/7 some researchers
think that fasting and feasting was more
characteristic of these fellow humans
fasting for five to ten days is not much
of a challenge and can be achieved by
many of us yes people fear of dying of
starvation if they skip a meal or two
now longer fad that lasts for more than
a week may need more preparation they
may be more challenging and may require
more strict supervision we can read
about such longer fats in medical
journals and in research articles one of
them that caught my attention is a
medical report from 1973 that was
published in the Post Graduate Medical
Journal it reported about a patient
Angus Barbieri who fasted between June
1965 and July 1966 yes for more than a
year to be more precise this guy fasted
for 382 days at the time of this check
in at a hospital in Dundee in Scotland
he weighed 456 pounds or about 207
kilograms
he had a lot of food stored in his
body-fat if I may by the end of his
staff he lost all his extra body fat and
weight around 180 pounds or about 82
kilograms
he reached normal weight and he
maintained his weight in the five-year
follow-up period of his experiment
during his past a bee only consumed
water coffee tea and some supplements
researchers took blood samples urine
samples and made notes and observations
of his progression you can find a link
to an in-depth technical review of this
in the description now not that this
would be interesting to know but his
fecal evacuations were very infrequent
the average time between stools was
about 37 to 48 days imagine that with
his fast
Angus lost 276 pounds or about 125
kilograms and these 382 days fast is to
my knowledge the longest medical is
recorded facts there are people from
different religions to go into a fascist
for longer than that but their claims
cannot be put under rigorous scientific
scrutiny on the other hand there are
other numerous reports studies and
experiments of long fasts that are
documented in medical libraries you can
read many of them yourself on Google
Scholar or PubMed some of them were
successful while others let the
complications and even death so make
sure not to try this at home unless you
really know what you're doing and this
video is not to be taken as medical
advice moving on the main focus of
prolonged fasting as therapy was to
treat obesity no studies have been
conducted in the myth of the 20th
century
today's such experiments are considered
unethical and are not approved by an
institutional review board now you'd
probably ask yourself how can someone
survive or even thrive when they don't
eat for longer periods of time aren't
they like hungry well the irony is that
contrary to what most people think the
least to worry about when undergoing
prolonged fasting is hunger hunger seems
to go away after about 48 hours and it
only returns when body fat becomes
critically low and your metabolism
cannot efficiently derive energy from it
anymore but this usually doesn't happen
take me for example I'm a lean person
and I could easily fast for a few dozen
days without reaching the critical low
body fat if I could do that what about a
person who is overweight isn't this like
the ultimate form of dieting to conclude
Barbieri's voluntary self experiment is
testimony for the physiologic potential
of human beings
it should also serve as mythbuster for
the illusory imminent starvation that
many of us fear when we don't consume
food every couple of hours
I'd recommend reading the medical report
