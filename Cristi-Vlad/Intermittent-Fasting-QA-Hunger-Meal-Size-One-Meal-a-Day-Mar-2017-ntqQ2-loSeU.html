received via social media on
intermittent fasting okay so before that
please understand that this is my
current March 2017 personal perspective
on things which may change in the future
because I do not hold beliefs and rigid
or fixated opinions if I encounter new
good evidence that is against my
arguments I'm very open for
consideration and personal
experimentation now let's jump in oh and
I'm going to try to answer these
questions with what I would do in such
an such situation so please don't take
this as general advice or any other
advice for that matter now with all
these caveats I really hope you can take
something good out at the next few
minutes so question is it okay to be
constantly hungry on intermittent
fasting she's been kiddo for over two
and a half years and she started
intermittent fasting about three weeks
ago she eats between 1300 to 1,500
calories 90 grams of protein and 100
grams of fat so this is a very low
carbohydrate approach I don't know what
type of is feeding fasting window she
uses or any of her body and or metabolic
measurements so there's little room for
assumptions but the simple answer is
that no it's not okay to be hungry
what's the purpose of life if you are
constantly hungry joking aside I would
increase daily caloric intake by 200 to
300 calories most of them coming from
fat and protein since a ketogenic
approach is preferred and I would
measure or track body weight progression
as well as a subjective measure of
hunger over the course of two to three
weeks
I think is the timeframe in which not
much can go wrong if this does not seem
to work I would also try not to consume
any calorically significant food or
beverage during the fasting window most
importantly if caffeine is allowed I
would consume black coffee as it has
often be reported by many and also by
myself as having hunger blunting effects
I hope this helps next question would it
be better to have a bigger meal at lunch
than a smaller meal at dinner or vice
versa now should I assume we're talking
about two or three meals per day
regardless and there may be a few
arguments in favor of a bigger lunch one
argument is that the circadian
rhythmicity of insulin secretion is
favourable earlier in the day which
would not cause huge spike / crashes
after meals so a better glucose
carbohydrate management another argument
is that eating glass or not consuming
food a few hours before bad can improve
sleep quality now the counter-argument
is one counter argument is that I
experimented with both these strategies
and to extend a little bit on that there
have been times when I consistently that
is for weeks at end I ate one to two
hours before that large meals and
actually slept like a rock so there also
have been times when I ate larger meals
earlier in the day and I still do that
especially during the days when when I
consume alcohol during these days my
last meal is around I would say five to
seven pm which is four to six hours
before alcohol consumption so i guess a
short answer
this is I would experiment with both and
or variations of them bigger lunch
smaller dinner small smaller lunch
bigger dinner and see which one works
best for you question would it be okay
if I eat once a day yes why not I mean I
guess however it would be it would be
challenging to try to meet your daily
vitamins minerals and micro nutrient
requirements as well as total caloric
intake in one single meal is it possible
I think it is is it hard definitely
would it be pleasurable definitely since
you figure out for one to two hours
trying to back in that much food and I
think I will answer this one about one
meal a day in much more detail in
another session okay so that's it for
now if you have similar questions make
sure to leave them below and if you
