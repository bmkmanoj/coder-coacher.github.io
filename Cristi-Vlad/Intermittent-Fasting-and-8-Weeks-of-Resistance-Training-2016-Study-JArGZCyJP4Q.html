earlier in October 2016 and the Journal
of translational medicine and it came
out as a collaboration of researchers
from universities in the United States
Brazil and Italy and they wanted to
determine the effects of intermittent
fasting for eight weeks on resistance
trained athletes they wanted to see how
intermittent fasting impacted their
metabolism their strength body
composition and different blood
biomarkers so what did they do they
randomly assigned the 34 resistance ly
resistance trained athletes into two
groups the time restricted feeding group
that is the intermittent fasting group
and the normal diet group those in the
time restricted feeding group ate meals
between 1 to 8 p.m. I assumed that at 8
p.m. they started eating their last meal
and then fasted for the rest of the
24-hour period so they basically had a
16-8
intermittent fasting regimen while the
normal diet group ate normally between 8
a.m. to 8 p.m. so these groups were met
for calories and macronutrients they had
basically similar 2800 vs 3000 calories
calories plus or minus something it was
these books followed a higher
carbohydrate diet 53 respectively 54% of
the macros came from carbohydrates 24%
from fats and the rest from protein so
they measure the strength body
composition and blood biomarkers I'm
going to post a link to to this study in
the description all right so what did
they find
first well let me get back to this in a
second let's see so there wasn't any
significant difference in fat free mass
that isn't muscle in lean mass between
the two groups the intermittent fasting
before the intervention 73 after the
intervention 73 plus or minus something
well the normal diet 73 74 plus or minus
something the intermittent fasting group
though experienced a statistically
significant decrease in fat mass while
the normal diet did not markers that
were more statistically significantly
affected were adiponectin testosterone
igf-1 insulin-like markers and to weigh
some alluring standards the respiratory
ratio the decrease in testosterone
levels they said that there was a
significant decrease in testosterone
levels for the intermittent fasting rule
I converted the values
so 21 plus or minus something nanomoles
per liter versus sixty point eight plus
or minus something and they intermittent
fasting group this is kind of
statistically significant Wow the normal
diet group did not experience any
decrease in testosterone levels so this
would mean going from 610 nanograms per
deciliter and average to an average of
490 nanograms per deciliter well this is
kind of significant but they say that
there was no observable negative in fact
anecdotally I've been testing my
testosterone since early 2014 and I've
been doing it admit him fasting with 18
to 22 hours of fasting and 2 to 6 hours
of eating most of the time so I've seen
my testosterone levels all over the
place
as I've been testing it for several
times but most of the times I've seen it
in the 700 to 800 range well there have
been times when I've seen it in low 60
low 600 and 500 as well so maybe diet
composition because I was following a
lower carbohydrate diet may have
impacted this I don't know researchers
also found a decrease in igf-1 levels a
significant decrease in i g f1 levels in
the intermittent fasting group let's see
how significant that was yes so 216 to
188 verses 20 215
to 218 so no change in the normal diet
group while a significant decrease in I
G of 1 in the intermittent fasting role
what else as they say interestingly all
the reductions in the anabolic hormones
testosterone and igf-1 were observed
dist did not correspond to any
deleterious body composition changes or
compromises of muscular strength over
the duration of the study well the fat
free mass doesn't seem to have been
compromised
in the intermittent fasting group there
was a lower d3 but no significant
changes in TSH and the intermittent
fasting group 83 to 74 and TSH remained
approximately the same the intermittent
fasting group also expressed a higher
adiponectin which could have been
correlated with the decrease in fat mass
and as they say while fat free mass
muscle area of the arm and thigh and
maximal strength were maintained in both
groups another thing to point out was
the resting energy expenditure or er
wasn't changed between the groups but
respiratory ratio decreased slightly in
the time restricted feeding group that
is in the intermittent fasting group
reflecting a minor very minor tendency
toward higher fat oxidation so
Oh point 83 2.81 this is a very very
minor change so a restoration that's in
the low point seventies marks a higher
oxidation of fat while a respiratory
ratio that is towards one marks a higher
oxidation of carbohydrate well there
have been some limitations and as they
say different meal timing could have
affected subjects responses to
resistance training differently like for
example if they had a an earlier feeding
window and training later they trained
at between 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. so if they
would have a feeding window that was
earlier in today and training later and
today this could have led to different
results while they could have also seen
different results if they have done
fasted training in the morning while
having their feeding window later and
day so this is indeed a potential
limitation and probably the biggest
limitation to this study is that macros
and energy intake were assessed based on
interview so they actually asked the
subjects what did you eat and this
served as as the assessment for macro
nutrients and energy intake so this is
far from being accurate
and as they say because of the
limitations of this method it is
possible the difference is an energy or
nutrient intake between groups could
have existed and played a role in the
observed outcomes well you don't say of
course that additional studies are
needed to confirm their results and to
see if their results can be replicated
so I wouldn't say this I personally try
to take something good out of this study
one is that lean mass doesn't seem to be
affected negatively even though these
subjects experienced significant
decrease in testosterone levels fat mass
seems to be positively affected I mean
the subjects in the intermittent fasting
group seem to have lost higher fat
higher fat mass compared to the other
subjects and of course a decrease in
igf-1 levels should be preferable
because igf-1 levels higher i GF on
levels and higher signaling of mTOR has
so very often been correlated with
progression and development of cancerous
tumors but igf-1 and anthro is also
needed if a subject or an individual
wants to increase their muscle mass so
higher igf-1 higher insulin and higher
mTOR these heart
almost always needed to see a
significant increase in muscle mass so I
think it depends on what one this goals
are and as well as it also depends on
the context I mean do you wanna focus on
maximizing the increase in your lean
mass do you want to maximize fat loss
with as little intervention from the
outside as possible
it depends anyway I'll have a more
in-depth review of this study with more
quotations from it and references and on
my blog and in a couple of days so stay
tuned and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
