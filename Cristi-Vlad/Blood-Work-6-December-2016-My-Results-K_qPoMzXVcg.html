my recent blood tests a few days ago and
I decided to do a video version as well
so this month that is December 2016 I
took the tests twice the reason for the
second draw was dead and my first
results my testosterone was about 315
nanograms per deciliter and my fasting
blood glucose was about 90 milligrams
per deciliter so I waited for a couple
of days did not make any significant
lifestyle changes so I tried keeping
constant as many variables as possible
and I me talking I'm talking here about
diet sleep lifting etc but these are the
most important so five days later my
testosterone was 572 nanograms per
deciliter as you can see in the table
and my fasting blood glucose was 86
milligrams per deciliter i posted about
i posted a video about this last week
which I link i'll link to it in the
description the point that i wanted to
make was that blood tests are snapshots
of your biochemistry at a certain point
in time and if one biomarker is
extremely out of its normal range mine
were not though so if any of the
biomarkers is extremely out of their
normal range further tests should be
taken to confirm whether or not we're
talking about pathology or a diseased
state otherwise it wouldn't be
reasonable to take a very important
decision based on one blood test at a
certain point in time anyway even though
as you can see
even though my blood glucose was a bit
higher than the last time glide lies
hemoglobin hba1c was lower and I'm not
really sure what make out of it um
triglycerides look good are well within
their normal range I think this is an
ideal level I've seen my triglycerides
even lower than that I think I had like
27 or 29 milligrams per deciliter a
couple of months ago tokus the total
cholesterol looks good HDL LDL both look
good c-reactive protein highly sensitive
c-reactive protein is extremely low and
yeah my triiodothyronine t3 is in the
normal range now and I suspect that
higher carbohydrates and frequent
overfeeding has influenced its
concentration because it was it was
lower a few months ago I remember that
that's at one of the tests it was so
right now is point 75 but i also had it
like point for point five so extremely
low which does not necessarily imply
that something it's something is not
normal lower t3 is usually seen without
any say without actually implying that
there is a disease you can see lower d3
in people consuming low-carbohydrate
diets or people fasting they usually
have a lower t3 because from what I've
seen
the literature d3 is correlated both
with carbohydrate intake and with and
with a calorie intake so anyway in terms
of my current nutrition and training
I'll try to put it as 16 succinctly as
possible so I eat a lot of vegetables I
eat egg and dairy I eat meat rarely but
when I do I enjoy it and there are 12
days every week when I don't consume
animal products these are also today's
when I do a more intense caloric
restriction my current intermittent
fasting is 19 to 22 21 hours of fasting
with three to five hours of feeding and
I usually try to go for 17 hours of
fasting but recently I end up going for
19 to 20 hour to 21 hours on most days
while the remaining three to five hours
is my feeding window now the narrowness
of this feeding window so three three to
five hours makes caloric restriction
extremely effortless and over feeding
for that matter extremely Pleasant in
terms of training I usually I mean
almost always there are rare exceptions
when I don't lift fasted so I lived in
the fasted in a fastest a four to six
times a week period icing and changing
as many variables as I can so I'm
talking here about volume frequency and
mode so I try to play with these
variables at every workout and I try to
emphasize keeping the intensities in the
intensity high so whatever the pattern
or whatever
the workout or the the way that I change
these variables the constant is a higher
intensity I don't go for higher
intensity when I when I have a deal
oding workout or a few subsequently
loading workouts that's when intensity
is not high supplements worth mentioning
or fish oil magnesium and alpha lipoic
acid so nothing different from my last
report and I'll end this video with two
recently physique photos okay so on your
way out please hit the thumbs up button
and subscribe this is it for today thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
