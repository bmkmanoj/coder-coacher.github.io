arrived so for those of you who don't
know these nuts are probably the lowest
in carbohydrates out of all the nuts
that I know so let me see if I can focus
on this one so they have about 4 grams
of carbohydrates per 100 grams and they
are actually like most nuts super high
in calories so they have about 750
calories per 100 grams so super high in
calories and super high in fats out of
which so 75 grams of fats out of which
33 are saturated fats and they have a
very good protein content I would say
for a nut so it's like 40 grams so yeah
these cost about these were like 5 or $6
more towards $6 so $6 per 125 grams
that's about 4 ounces I guess they are
more expensive in the US I saw something
from a company they were selling these
billina's for I think it was five
dollars or four dollars per ounce or for
2 ounces something like that okay here
goes
so like others have said they have a
very buttery taste they are softer than
macadamia nuts so they are not as
crunchy and in terms of flavor I'd say
is it is something between a peanut and
a cashew but I don't know this is my
subjective experience of it given their
current price I'm not actually gonna eat
many of them on a daily basis but I'm
expecting to see the price go down as
the demand and the awareness of these
nuts increases anyway thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
