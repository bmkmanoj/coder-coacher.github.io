Select percentile on to our data set for
which we've generated additional noise
features the Select percentile reduce
the feature space by 50% so it went from
80 to about 40 features this can also be
translated into a reduction of
complexity the first thing we're going
to do is to see exactly which features
have been selected or which features
remained after the selection to do this
we're gonna apply a boolean mask on top
of all features so first we're going to
do some imports we're gonna import numpy
as NP and we're also going to import mat
plot lip by plot as PLT and also the
magic command matplotlib in line to
display the plots within the notebook
itself then we're gonna apply and view
the mask so let's let's run this so now
let's create the mask so same mass
equals select get support this is the
method that we use for the purpose then
we're gonna print it so let's say print
mask and to get a visual idea of the
mask we're also going to a PLT mat show
mat shona drop mask dot reshape 1-1 and
we're gonna have a color map of gray our
let's run this
okay so true means that the feature is
selected so it remained after this
election while false means it's not and
this figure the black ones are the
selected features or those that are true
and the white ones are the false ones or
the ones that have not been selected we
could observe that most of the selected
features are the ones in the original
cancer data set and a few of them come
from the noise that we generated all
right now let's train a logistic
regression algorithm to compare the
performance on all features versus the
performance on the select ones
so first we'll also gonna have to do
another import so from SK learn linear
model we're gonna import logistic
regression okay let's run this and this
one again and then we're gonna first do
the same thing for our test set so X
test let's say it's selected equals
select so we're gonna transform it the
same way we did with the training so
transform X tensed then we're going to
instantiate a logistic regression so
let's say log Rag equals logistic
regression and fit it onto the data so
log Rag dot fit onto X train and white
train and we're going to print it score
so this is for the original features so
let's say print the score of logistic
regression on all features equals we're
going to use three fixed points format
log rag that score on X test and Y test
and then we're gonna do the same thing
for the selected features only so let's
say log rank dot fit X train selected y
train and then print the score so print
the score of logistic regression on the
selected features so three fixed points
format a log rank dot score dot X test
selected and white test all right let's
run this so as we can see there is a
slight increase in performance with the
Select percentile method applied onto
our data set which we've used for a
feature selection and we should note
that the performance is better despite
the fact that some of the original
features have not been selected or have
been left out so you can consider this
method when you need help in reducing
the dimensionality and the complexity of
your data okay now in the next tutorial
we're going to look at another method of
feature selection which is model-based
feature selection so please make sure to
