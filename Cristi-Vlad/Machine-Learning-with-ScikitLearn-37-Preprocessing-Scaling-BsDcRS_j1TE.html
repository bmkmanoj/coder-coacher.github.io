scaling which is another method of
pre-processing for a machine learning so
when you're working with raw data sets
it often is that features are at
different levels of magnitude that is
they are at different scales and when
you train algorithms like support vector
machines or neural networks which are
sensitive to the scaling of the data
these algorithms might not perform
correctly that's one of the cases when
you'd have to scale your data so that
you can properly train your algorithm
now there are a few methods to do this
kind of pre-processing in scikit-learn
you have the standard scaler which
brings each feature to a mean of 0 and a
variance of 1 then there's the min max
scaler which shifts the data into a 0 to
1 range and there is also the normalizer
which adjusts data in a way in which
each feature vector has a Euclidean
length of 1 now here we're gonna look
into the min max scaler which as I said
brings each feature in to a zero to one
range now for convenience we're gonna
use the same dummy data set that we've
created in our previous few tutorials as
a reminder let's see how it looks like
so we can see that it's not in a 0 to 1
range which is what we want to achieve
with our scaler so the first thing we're
gonna do is to instantiate the scaler so
let's say minimax scalar is
pre-processing min max scalar and a
feature range of 0 to 1 and then we're
going to apply it to our data so data
minimax is min max scaler and we're
gonna use the fit transform method onto
our data and then we're simply gonna
look at the output so let's say print
mimics scaler applied on the data new
line data min max now shift enter to run
this alright so as you can see each
feature has been brought into a zero to
one range making the maximum initial
value equal to one for each row and the
rest of the values which are relative to
it and as I said previously this is
really important for correctly training
some machine learning algorithms which
are sensitive to the scaling of the data
now in our next tutorial we're going to
look at another method of pre-processing
