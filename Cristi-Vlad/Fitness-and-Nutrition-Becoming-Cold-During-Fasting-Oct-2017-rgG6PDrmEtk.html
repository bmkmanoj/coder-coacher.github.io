question from social media which was
about becoming extra cold when you fast
so three major driving points
carbohydrate intake the three levels or
triiodothyronine which is the active
thyroid hormone and protein intake now
the first two go hand-in-hand and I'll
discuss them together so from a couple
of studies I read and also from my
personal experiments carbohydrate intake
seems to be directly associated with t3
levels meaning that reduced carbohydrate
intake is associated with lower t3
levels so when people fast for longer
periods of time or even during
intermittent fasting when people people
do not consume anything but water or
black coffee or unsweetened tea for at
least 16 hours everyday it is likely
that their 24-hour total carbohydrate
intake is lower compared to when they
consume multiple meals a day you know
spread across their waking hours now the
same could go for protein and for fat
intake and in such circumstances t3
levels are lower and we know that d3
affects almost all physiological
processes such as metabolism heart rate
growth body temperature and so on and
lower t3 most likely induces a lower
body temperature and a reduction in
metabolic processes now if you think of
it this is a normal physiological
response evolutionarily speaking a
growth and development cannot happen in
scarcity that is caloric scarcity such
in the case of fasting or intermittent
fasting eating or trying to eat two
maintenance calories and consume a
nutritious diet that's not restrictive
during the feeding window is less likely
going to adversely affect health
however the discomfort of feeling cold
is actually something to get used to it
it basically means that you're doing it
right now from a personal standpoint I
was for a long time restricting
carbohydrates and practicing
intermittent fasting at the same time
every day and I also took blood samples
frequently my t3 levels were always
below the normal range however other
markers of thyroid health that I tested
for were in their normal range and I was
kind of asymptomatic so there was no
both illogical condition I have to point
out that and all this there's a big
confounder variable which is caloric
intake so restricting calories also
impacts t3 levels and most often than
not and studies of carbohydrate
restriction we're also dealing with
carbohydrate restriction so I'd say more
literature study has to be done before I
have a strong point about this now the
second or third aspect of becoming cold
during fasting or if' is about protein
intake now in short we know protein is
thermogenic meaning that consuming
higher amounts of protein can lead to
elevated body temperature protein intake
also has an effect on t3 levels so when
you fast or when you practice
intermittent fasting if you're eating
all your food for for the day in an
eight-hour window
many people use six or even four our
feeling windows this means that even if
you consume adequate protein during your
feeding window all that would be
metabolized after or when you are a few
hours into your fast so it's kind of
normal that when no dietary protein is
actively metabolized and when no food or
anything of caloric significance is in
the system the system's this temperature
goes down and processes other than
digestion take priority and I'm talking
about processes like cellular repair and
maintenance auto AG and so on now I
personally got used to becoming cold in
my intermittent fasting and in my
prolonged fasting practices and after a
while I even took it as the new normal
however some people might not tolerate
it especially if they are in colder
climates okay so I guess that's it for
this video I hope it was helpful so
again three main driving points
carbohydrate intake t3 levels and
protein intake that's it
