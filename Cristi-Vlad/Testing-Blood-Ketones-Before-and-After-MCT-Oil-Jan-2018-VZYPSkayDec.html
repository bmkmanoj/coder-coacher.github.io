MCT oil to see how it impacts my blood
ketones so here's an outline of what I'm
gonna do so I had one meal today which
was about four and a half hours ago and
it was a meal very low in carbohydrates
so it had about two grams of total
carbohydrates it was relatively high in
fat so about 40 grams of fat and
moderate in protein like 30 grams of
protein so right now I'm gonna test my
ketones first then I'm gonna add about
10 grams or 10 milliliters of MCT oil
into 100 milliliters of unsweetened
almond milk and have it and then after
about 40 minutes 40 minutes 45 minutes
I'm gonna test my ketones again to see
if anything changed I'm only gonna have
like so 10 10 milliliters or 10 grams of
MCT oil is almost a tablespoon so I'm
I'm starting with this small dose
because this is the first time I'm
actually trying it and as I've heard
from many people there may be some
stomach disturbances if you dose it too
high the first time we're trying it so I
don't know let's see how it goes okay so
baseline levels first I'm gonna check
the blood glucose
prepare the ketones trip
okay 76 let's see the ketones
okay so the countdown
one point one okay so this is baseline
now I'm gonna have 100 milliliters of
almond milk with about 10 milliliters or
10 grams of MCT oil which is almost a
tablespoon so a little less than a
tablespoon now the MCT
here goes
okay see you in 40 minutes so it's been
about 45 minutes since I took the MCT
oil let's see if anything changed in
terms of blood glucose and blood ketones
okay so first it's going to be the blood
glucose
I'm not expecting much difference to be
honest 71 so it was 74 I guess
and now the ketones so this is the
ketone strip
okay moment of truth
one point one so no change so
blood-glucose went from 76 to 71 while
the ketones remained unchanged I'm not
really surprised at this result a few
days ago I tried the same experiment
with coconut oil and actually I saw a
decrease in ketone levels after about 40
minutes after taking some coconut oil so
my blood ketones went from 0.9 to 0.7
and that was in the fasted State now I'm
not really sure maybe if I try upping
the dose of MCT oil maybe I'll see some
results I may do that in the future I
don't know one thing though is that so
far so it's been kind an hour kind of an
hours inside to the MCT also it doesn't
seem to have any impact on my stomach I
hope I don't experience these side
effects that many people talk about in
the following hours we'll see
so bottom line about a tablespoon of MCT
oil does not seem to have an impact on
my ketone levels but I should point out
that there's too little data so this is
only one experiment so there's not
enough data to have a strong conclusion
or any conclude conclusion for that
matter so maybe if I increase the dose
I'll see some impact some positive
impact on my ketone levels maybe we'll
try that experiment in the future
I decided to repeat the blood test and
the MCT oil experiment in the morning in
the fastest day so when I woke up my
blood glucose was 86 and my ketones were
1.4 then I took a little over 1
tablespoon of MCT oil so that was like
15 milliliters with some almond milk
unsweetened almond milk which is like
less than 1 grams of carbohydrates per
100 milliliters and then I waited for
about an hour and took the blood tests
again with my ketone meter and I was a
little surprised because my blood
glucose went from 86 to 76 and my blood
ketones went from 1.4 to 1.7 so there's
not much of a difference in terms of the
change in blood ketones but there is a
difference
so from 1.4 to 1.7 but I was surprised
of the change in blood glucose so from
86 to 76 that's about that's 10 points
which is which is off the error rate so
it's not within the I wouldn't I would
say it's not within the error rate of
the device so this might be interesting
testing with this stuff even further</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
