which I usually do every couple of
months all the biomarkers I tested for
the seemed good except for my blood
glucose being 90 milligrams per
deciliter while my hba1c was five point
two percent so that's interesting I
thought my testosterone levels were 340
something nanograms for this leader or
3.8 nanograms per milliliter without
going into all sorts of interpretations
and scenarios I decided to do nothing
and repeat some of these tests after a
couple of days in the meantime I tried
keeping everything in terms of
controllable lifestyle factors somewhat
consistent so I'm talking here about
nutrition sleep and exercise basically I
tried controlling for these variables I
repeated the tests five days later and
here's what I got blood glucose 86 plus
1 was 90 HDL 84 the last one was 86 so
this is consistent and discussed on
levels 572 nanograms per deciliter while
the reference range for my age group is
between 72 and 853 the point that I'm
trying to make is that you can increase
your testosterone levels one hundred and
sixty-five percent just by doing nothing
no seriously what I want to say is that
blood samples are snapshots of your
circulating biochemistry at a certain
point in time if one biomarker is out of
whack in this case I wouldn't consider
my 300 something nanograms per deciliter
testosterone levels being out of whack I
would have been worried if they were one
hand
nanograms per deciliter or less anyway
if one marker is out of its normal range
the test should be repeated to increase
the level of confidence that it may
indeed be indicative of some unnormal
condition I'll probably write a blog
post with the full details of my blood
work in the next couple of days so
please make sure to subscribe and thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
