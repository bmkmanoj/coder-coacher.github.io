about and working with tensor flow the
reason why we're focusing on tensor flow
here is that this library is one of the
most if not the most popular in deep
learning projects so tensor flow is kind
of a new kid on the block its initial
release being in late 2015
since then it literally exploded an
applicability as it's being widely used
academically and in industry as well now
with this open source library
computation is done through or as a or
as data flow graphs and I'll explain
that shortly but first why the name
white dancer flow now the textbook
definition of tensor flow is that it's a
framework for numerical computation
based on data flow graphs
okay now dancers are basically multi
dimensional arrays now let me back it up
a little let's think of geometry in
planar geometry a square is a
two-dimensional object well in special
geometry we have a cube which is a three
dimensional object
likewise in computer vision let's say we
use grayscale images so for example
we're working on a computer vision task
like for object recognition and our
images that we use for the training
purpose are grayscale images now we
could represent these images as tables
of pixel values so in the other case if
we're working with colored images so
let's say in RGB you'd have known
one but three tables each pixel having a
corresponding value for red green and
blue in this case you could think of an
image or you could perceive the image
like a volume so in this case our
colored image would be a tensor or a
three-dimensional array that flows
through the computational graph so
that's why the name tensor flow so data
flows through the computational graph
now this computational graph is made up
of nodes and edges the nodes are
operations while the edges are either
data or control dependencies
now tensor flow was written in C++ but
it's mostly used through a higher-level
language which is Python and probably
the most developed side of tensorflow
is with respect to deep learning if you
build your own deep learning
architecture in plain tensorflow
you have tremendous flexibility of
design however you could also work with
even higher level libraries built on top
of tensor flow which provide another
layer of abstract ization and come with
built-in modules and methods for a much
easier and much more convenient design
of deep learning architectures and two
of these libraries are Carris and TF
slim which we will probably get into any
further tutorials when we're going to
start coding now some advantages of
working with tensor flow are that it's
open source and it's heavily
continuously developed it also has tools
like tensor board for visualization and
and
advantage is that its nature like for
example the use of place of placeholders
allow it to be very scalable portable
and applicable across projects some
disadvantages are that it requires much
more time to learn so it has a steeper
learning curve and get better at
compared to simpler frameworks that are
used in machine learning for example not
in deep learning and this also implies
that you would have to be very
knowledgeable of calculus and linear
algebra just the name of fuel and this
is if you're working with plain
tensorflow
and not higher level libraries which may
not require deep knowledge of math
because you'll be working directly with
methods and functions now leaving Theory
aside if you'll be coding along the
instructions to install tensor flow on
your system can be found at tensorflow
org I'm not going to go into the details
of installing it here I'll be using
tensor flow enjoy your notebooks like
this one and Windows 10 with Python 3.5
installed all right in the next video
we're finally going to get into some
coding and we're going to perform some
basic operations in tensorflow please
