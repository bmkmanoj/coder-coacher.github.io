respond to a few social media questions
about intermittent fasting I have to
point out that this is my current
perspective which is non generalizable
and subjective to change in the future
as I experiment with different protocols
and arguments that are contrary to mine
so the first question I love dairy
products I heard that if you consume too
much then it can push you out of ketosis
is this true well I guess it depends
from person to person first of all it
depends on the level of carbohydrate you
are able to consume and maintain ketosis
that is basically your tolerance level
then it's about the total carbohydrate
that you have in a day so let's say that
you drink a glass of milk which is about
eight to nine grams of carbs if you do
that and if you are lactose tolerant and
if the rest of the carbohydrate you
consume from for the day comes mainly
from vegetables I would say you're
likely to remain chaotic but individual
differences are important here
especially genetic and metabolic it's
always used to say that one should
experiment and see how it works for
themselves in this case a drink milk or
consume dairy quantify how much you're
having take account of the overall
caloric and carbohydrate intake for the
day and measure ketones observe and
adjust a few if you prefer consuming
dairy products now another question from
the same person secondly I usually
survive the first day or two of eating
low-carb then I get massive carb
cravings I literally become the kooky
car
monster is there a strategy to overcome
this so this is basically another very
broad one for which I can't be specific
what I could say though is that the
bacteria in your gut can be somewhat
reflective of your diet so if you're
used to eating a lot of refined foods
you may be feeding a certain type or
family of bacteria which could
predominate in your gut now the existing
evidence about this still begs a lot of
questions at least to me I could say
it's also the whole idea of carb carb
cravings is also a matter of habit so if
you force yourself to consume two or
three additional big servings of
vegetables every day for a couple of
weeks you may not only have improved
your diet but you could also be able to
influence the predominance of bacteria
in your gut possibly favoring the
prevalence of more beneficial or these
are called commensal bacteria I hope
this helps now moving on another
question from someone else for weight
loss what's the best window or it
doesn't matter now I guess you're
talking about the feeding and fasting
windows from my personal experience and
for my specific case it seems not the
matter I've experimented with different
variations eating only during the first
part of the day eating only during the
second part of the day and in the
evening having my feeding window
concentrated for the midday and to be
honest I haven't noticed subjective or
easily quantifiable differences
wait variations on the scale day by day
so once again this solely applies to me
and I'm kind of very active during most
days but if you think of the people of
different ages with different metabolic
and genetic profiles they respond
differently to different feeding windows
according to some research in zark alien
biology there could be a tendency for
people in general to be more insulin
sensitive during the first part of the
day which could mean to focus your
feeding window in that time frame I'd
recommend looking that up next question
once fat adapted do we actually have to
concern ourselves with BMR lower ring
that is basal metabolic rate as may have
an in traditional calorie deficit
dieting my assumption is that one
started at that we're capable of
stepping into fat stores much more
efficiently so a caloric deficit
wouldn't affect us in the same way and
this question well I guess that's an
assumption you will hear a lot of people
in favor of low carbohydrate and
ketogenic diets using this type of
argument but I want to be convinced or I
wouldn't use it as my mantra where I on
a weight loss progression I would be
more concerned with better and more
accurate tracking of calories in and
observing how it effects my weight loss
progress and I guess the same advice
goes for weight maintenance our
metabolism and our overall daily energy
picture if I can put it that way these
are extremely adaptable
so even making estimations like this
could be inaccurate we just don't know
exactly which is why it's always better
to personally measure observe and adjust
rather than taking someone else's
arguments and guesses and going with
them alright that's it for this Q&amp;amp;A if
you have similar questions make sure to
