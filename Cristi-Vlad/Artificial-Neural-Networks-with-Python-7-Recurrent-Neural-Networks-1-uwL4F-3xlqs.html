data and recurrent neural networks
sequential data is the opposite of
static data you can think of static data
as being data at a certain point in time
while sequential data is more dynamic
and as per the name implies it deals
with multiple points in time now
examples of sequential data are weather
forecasts
traffic analysis video data or video
feeds stock market prices stock market
performance and so on some of these
examples can be considered time series
data or a sequence of data points
ordered by time now when working with
this type of data we could not use
simple machine learning models and
neural network architecture is like we
did before we need to use more complex
models that can deal with the temporal
dependencies of the data and one model
that we're going to look at today is the
recurrent neural network now we'll start
by generating some data to be more
specific we're generating waveforms I
have to remind you that we're following
the code in the artificial intelligence
book linked in the description all right
now we'll define a function to generate
sine waves so let's say def get data
non-points let's say wave 1 is equal to
0.6 times and piece n and be a range 0
and num points ok now wave two is gonna
be three point five times the same thing
over here
let's copy two more of them so three and
four and we'll name them accordingly so
wave 3 is gonna be lets say 1.2 and the
wave 4 is gonna be 4.6 so this is kind
of random data then we'll create
amplitudes for the overall waves so
amplitude 1 is gonna be NP once so a
matrix of 1 non-points okay now we'll
copy this three more times so it's gonna
be 2 3 &amp;amp; 4
let's name them accordingly so a 2 is
gonna be NP this time we're gonna use
zeros and we'll say 2 point 2 plus and P
zeroes because there is no use of having
a 0 matrix okay so and for a 3 is gonna
be lets say 3.1 times MP ones numb
points okay and for a for let's say a 4
is gonna be 0.9 plus and P zeros so
zeros okay and then we're gonna so let
me make sure these are correctly
specified so NP ones to 0.23 point one
times MP ones 0.9 + NP zeros okay so the
overall waveform is gonna be wave NP
array is gonna be an array of wave 1
wave
- wave three and wave four okay and
we're gonna reshape this as non-points
times four and one and for the amplitude
is going to be the same thing so NP
array of a 1 a 2 a 3 and a 4 and we're
gonna reshape it non-points times 4 and
1 and since this is a function will
return this wave and the amplitude okay
now we're gonna define another function
to view the output of the neural network
so let's say def visualize output it's
going to take an end as parameter and
non-points test okay so we're gonna have
the wave and the amplitude as our
previous function so get data non-points
test okay and the output is going to be
so output is gonna be an end the same
method for wave and ultimately we'll
gonna PLT plot amp dot reshape numb
points test times 4 and another PLT plot
of output dot reshape the same thing now
points test times 4 okay now shift enter
to run this
and actually let's just run the main
function as well so to create a wave so
let's say if underscore underscore name
underscore underscore equals equals main
we're gonna have non points 59 points
and we're gonna have a wave and a MP of
get data num points okay so we'll stop
here for now and in the next video we're
going to build a recurrent net we're
gonna train it and watch how the
learning process goes okay so if you
enjoyed this video please like it and
subscribe thank you for watching and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
