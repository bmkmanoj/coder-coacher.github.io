support vector classifier on the cancer
data set and we didn't touch any hyper
parameters so everything was with their
default value and after being trained we
observed that our classifier was
overfitting because it led to 100%
accuracy on the training subset one of
the reasons for this poor performance
could be because of the scaling of the
data and as VMS are sensitive to the
scaling of the data now in our case as
of now the data is not scaled so let's
try and see how each feature currently
looks like or where exactly the minimum
or the maximum of each feature is and
for that we're going to use math log lib
and once again my inspiration comes from
Euler's is a machine learning book which
is linked in the description so we'll
import matplotlib by plot as PLT and
we're going to do the magic command
matplotlib in line to display our
graphics within the notebook and then
we're gonna PLT plot X trained minimum
on the zero axis or on the y axis we're
going to use OHS and we're going to
label it minimum the same thing PLT plot
X train max on the same axis we're going
to use these and we're going to label
max
right now PL T X label is going to be
our feature index now our PLT y label is
going to be featured magnitude magnitude
and logarithmic scale this is important
so PLT while scale is going to be
logarithmic and finally we're going to
display the legend
PLT legend on the upper right so
location upper right okay now shift
enter to run this okay now once again
the y scale is logarithmic so there is a
kind of big difference between the
minimum and maximum of each value and
also all a difference in orders of
magnitude between or in between features
now clearly this is one factor that
leads to the low performance of our
support vector machine and in the next
video we're going to bring the features
or we're going to try to bring the
features to the same scale and
re-evaluate our classifier I hope this
video was helpful thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
