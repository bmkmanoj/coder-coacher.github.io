network that will serve as our optical
character recognition on top of the code
from the previous tutorial so here we do
some mandatory processing the VAR
features and labels and we're gonna
start with the imports first so let's
say import numpy as NP so I'm just
regarding this these imports okay and
then we're also going to import neuro
lab as an L and define our input file
the same as we did before so letter data
and then set the number of data points
we want to load so let's say num data
equals 50 then we're gonna define the
string containing all distinct or
different characters and extract the
number of classes that there are so
we'll say a reg labels equals om and d
YG and how many they are so numb or reg
labels
equals the length of a reg labels now
let's use 90% of the data for training
and set aside 10% of it for testing
so we'll say num let me make some space
here so we'll say non-trained equals
integer of 0.9 times no data and num
test is gonna be numb data - num
training and then we're gonna work on
the data set extraction parameters so
we'll have the start at 6 and will end
at minus 1
and now let's run this invalid syntax
non-data - okay so we're gonna have two
lists one for the features and one for
the labels so data for the features and
labels another list and then with open
our input file in the reading mode as F
for line so for every line in F read
lines we're gonna list so we're gonna
split tab wines so let's say list valves
equals line split tab wise so T so if
the current label is not in the list of
labels we'll just continue
so how do we do this if list vowels one
not in a rig labels continue the wonders
of Python it's so explicit and then
we're going to have a label equals NP
zeros num a rig labels and one and the
label which is at the index of a rig
labels so index list valves one
is going to be equal to one and then
we're gonna append it so to the labels
list so labels append label okay next we
need to get the character vector and add
it to the list
so we'll say current character equals a
number array which is float X for X and
list
Vale's from the start to the end okay so
this is yet another list comprehension
and we're gonna add it to the data list
so we'll just say data append current
character and we're gonna exit the loop
as soon as the data set is created so if
Len data greater than or equal to num
data we're gonna break okay so what we
now need to do is to convert our data
and labels so the features and labels
into numpy arrays okay so I've got an
error here so it's just single arm so we
have to convert our data and our labels
list into numpy arrays and then we're
gonna create the architecture of the
neural network we're going to train it
and do some predictions on it
and we're going to try to compact all
these in the next tutorial thank you for
