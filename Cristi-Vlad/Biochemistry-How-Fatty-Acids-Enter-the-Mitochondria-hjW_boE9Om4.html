look at how fatty acids travel from the
cytosol into the mitochondria where they
will be oxidized for energy according to
lenninger is principles of biochemistry
textbook fatty acids that have twelve or
fewer carbons do not require help from
membrane transporters to enter the
mitochondria
now those fatty acids that have 14 or
more carbons most these are most dietary
fats and also the fats released from the
adipose tissue
they require help and they undergo
enzymatic reactions of the carnitine
shuttle this is a step by step process
the first step takes place in the
cytosol where fatty acids are activated
is terrified to coenzyme a or cocaine
and trans terrified to carnitine fatty
acyl carnitine or acyl carnitine is
formed the reaction is catalyzed by
carnitine acyltransferase 1 also known
as carnitine for methyl transferase 1 it
is also known by other names as well and
this takes place at the outer
mitochondrial membrane number 2 or step
2 is when this preparation allows for
the passage of acyl carnitine into the
intermembrane space this is denoted with
number 2 and in step 3 a soul carnitine
esters will then move into the
mitochondrial matrix by facilitated
diffusion through carnitine acyl
carnitine translocase in the matrix the
fatty acyl goes from quarantine to
coenzyme a or co a and the enzyme that
facilitates this reaction is carnitine
acyltransferase 2 also known as
carnitine palmitoyl transferase 2
then carnitine is released and can
diffuse back across the membrane via the
same transporter that is carnitine acyl
carnitine translocase and then the
entire process can be repeated all over
again important to point out is that
acyl transfer is 1 or CPT 1 in red
exerts a negative feedback mechanism
would Melanie Alcoa the first
intermediate in the synthesis of fatty
acids and this prevents the simultaneous
synthesis and breakdown of fatty acids
