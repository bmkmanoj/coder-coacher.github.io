yesterday on social media so she's been
doing the 18 six that is 18 hours of
fasting and six hours of feeding two
meals per day all week and felt great
circumstances made that yesterday she
fasted for 24 hours as such he only had
one meal in the evening come it was a
steak and shrimp fajitas with a lot of
condiments cheese and guacamole
she was under her daily caloric
allotment so she was calorically
restricted and also under 50 grams of
carbs so she's practicing nutritional
ketosis but despite that she felt
stuffed and bloated and gained one pound
on the scale in the morning now she
feels like she had a cheat day she's
discouraged and she thinks that 24-hour
fasts was one big meal are not for her I
briefly replied suggesting her to do
nothing that is to keep doing her 18-6
routine and she should be back on track
in two or three days and I'm gonna
elaborate now I suspected because she
was not used to consuming such large
meals in one sitting she practically
overloaded her digestive system with
food that means that you may not have
been prepared physiologically and I'm
talking about the up regulation of
enzymes higher activity at digestive
juices and so on and logistically her
mention of being stuffed and bloated to
deal with this type of nutritional
stress and her response the response of
her body looks quite normal to me you
should know that there are people who
ate much more than the assumed your
assumed 1000 calories in one meal and
they do it on an ongoing basis
report having no trouble whatsoever I
myself experiment with overfeeding quite
often most especially when I do 24 to 36
plus hours fast and like her when I did
it the first few times I experienced
similar symptoms but you know our bodies
are these wonderful adaptive organisms
and as of such we can adapt to this type
of feeding and frequency now like
anything else it takes time I'm not
saying that she should keep doing this
if she doesn't like to but I think
there's no need to feel discouraged
especially since the one-pound gain
means practically nothing it's a mere
reflection of the food she had and it's
least likely that it will have an impact
on her body composition in any
significant manner now if you're in a
similar situation you may consider what
what I just said here if you have
related questions you can leave them
