so in your average machine learning
classification project you use features
and labels to train your algorithm now
features provide unique representation
for your samples while labels are used
to assign the samples to different
classes let's take for example the
classical iris dataset and which flowers
are labeled into three classes so Tosa
versicolor and virginica in this case
our labels are in the form of words but
they can also be numbers however
algorithms are trained more efficiently
when these labels are numerical so in
our case we could encode the three
classes in the following way so let's
say Soto's is gonna be zero versicolor
is gonna be one and virginica is gonna
be two and this would actually make the
training process more efficiently now
what we've done here is something called
label encoding and scikit-learn the
machine learning library we've mostly
used in these tutorials there are
modules and methods that can take care
of the labeling now let me show you
so from SK learn we're gonna import
pre-processing pre-processing okay and
let's create a few samples so let's say
labels is set OSA
versicolor and virginica
okay let's run this one now what we're
actually gonna do is I'm actually going
to show you how we can use a label
encoder so let's say encoder
pre-processing label encoder this is how
we instantiate it and then we fit it on
to our labels so encoder set labels okay
now let's actually see how the encoder
mapped these labels so let's do a for
loop for eye items in enumerate encoder
classes we'll gonna print item
I now shift enter to run this for I item
okay my bad
so it actually encoded them the same way
I've encoded them up here now we could
test this on new samples so I could say
more labels let's say versicolor
versicolor virginica
so Tosa and another one versicolor okay
and we'll transform these new labels
according to our encoder so let's say
more labels encoded encoder so we'll use
our encoder to transform more labels and
then we'll actually print the output but
first we're gonna print how our more
labels look like some more labels equal
equals more labels and then we'll print
more labels encoded equals
let's say list more labels encoded okay
now we're gonna shift enter to run this
one so we can see that the actual
labeling has been performed correctly so
versicolor is one so first the color one
versicolor one virginica to soto so zero
and versicolor one now in your machine
learning project in your generic machine
learning project you'd usually have X so
big X for the features and Y for the
labels and you'd perform this type of
encoding only on the Y now in an
upcoming video we'll look into another
slightly more complex type of encoding
