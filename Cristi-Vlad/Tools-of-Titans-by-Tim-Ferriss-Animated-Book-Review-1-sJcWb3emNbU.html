video I'm going to discuss my top
takeaway messages from the first part of
the book the Health section so let's
jump right into it point number one
according to the book some people cannot
only survive but they can thrive under
conditions of no food intake that is by
fasting or consuming nothing but water
provided that there's sufficient body
fat to support metabolic needs and the
example that Timothy gives is Dominic
d'agostino a professor at the University
of South Florida and a researcher at the
Institute for human and machine
cognition ihmc quote don has done seven
days fast before while lecturing at the
university of south florida on day seven
he went into class with his glucose
between 35 and 45 milligrams per
deciliter and he's ketones around five
millimolar done before breaking the fast
he went to the gym and dead listed 500
pounds for 10 reps followed by one rep
of 585 pounds and the cult of course
please don't try this at home unless you
really know what you're doing don't take
this or other information from the video
as medical advice now with that out of
the way let's move on point number two
the five things or strategy Dominic
would implement where he diagnosed with
late stage cancer one follow a ketogenic
diet to use intermittent fasting one
meal a day three supplement with
exogenous ketones for usenet Foreman
fine used I chloroacetic acid or dca
point number three comes from Peter idea
and VA Francis services here are some
supplements he would not take
multivitamins
as they may contain too much of what you
don't need and too little of what you
need vitamins A and E vitamin A and
vitamin C however idea is in favor of
the following supplements magnesium love
those lycium as well as calcium in the
form of calcium carbonate point number
for the slow carb diet cheat sheet now
this is a boil down version of Timothy's
most important dieting principles to be
followed six days a week the seventh
being a cheat day rule number one avoid
white starchy carbohydrates all things
possible add rice potatoes you know the
thing rule number two eat the same meals
I'm not sure if I agree with this one
but anyway Service recommends splitting
your plate into thirds protein
vegetables and beans or legumes rule
number three don't drink calories rule
number four don't eat fruit again this
should be contextual don't be a blind
follower rule number five use body
composition tools like texture to
measure body fat definitely agree on
this one rule number six take one day
off and go nuts eat whatever you want
this is a cheat day moving on point
number five even though this is not a
one of my interests I know that some of
you may want to know about it Tim did
both extensive paper space to the
subject of psychedelics and the
potential therapeutic uses he openly
supports scientific research for this
Tim goes personal and provides an
insightful details from his own
experimentation he also discusses about
DMT or 5 m EO DMT something that's often
known as the God molecule this is
another psychedelic substance often used
for treating
addiction and not only extensive detail
is provided for the use of iboga or
ibogaine point number six comes from
Kelly Starrett a performance coach he
says quote men if you wake up and you
don't have a boner there's a problem yes
or no one or zero boner no boner and
first arrest this is a very good
indicator of sleep quality hormonal
health as well as arcadian with mrs
eeyore how well your internal clock is
synchronized to daily light-dark cycles
point number seven comes from one of my
favorite researchers Adam ghazali a
neuroscientist I'd recommend reading his
region book be distracted the disrupted
mind because they all he talks about the
method of us using only ten percent of
our brain capacity in his own words
quote the most complex structure in the
entire universe doesn't just have a
vacant parking lot waiting for someone
to drive in and start building it's all
used all the time and in complex ways
that we don't always understand and I'm
going to end with point number eight or
Timothy's five morning rituals that help
him have a great day ritual one make
your bad doing this you will have
accomplished something for the day it's
like self-administering a small squirt
of reward which may provide fuel for
harder tasks and challenges that you
will face for the rest of the day he
also shares a quote from Marcus Aurelius
meditations which is one of my personal
favorites as well take a moment pause
the video and read it it's a good way to
start your day ritual number to meditate
for 10 to 20 minutes
to be honest I haven't tried this yet
ritual number three do five to ten reps
of something for example 5 to 10 burpees
or other high intensity exercises could
crime you with a good attitude for the
rest of the day or you might just try 30
seconds to 1 minute cold shower like
Tony Robbins ritual number 4 prepare
some tea well I personally like coffee
sometimes decaf it tastes just about the
same and ritual number 5 eternal for 5
to 10 minutes I personally do this in
the evening when I scheduled for the
following day all right so these are
some of my takeaway messages from the
first section of the book if you enjoyed
