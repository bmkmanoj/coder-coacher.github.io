open-ended question can we tune in the
parameters of the cannon algorithm to
improve how well it can predict whether
an image is of a malignant or benign
tumor so we're going to focus on the
number of neighbors most specifically
we're going to test this machine
learning algorithm using a range of
neighbors from 1 to 10 to see which
number of neighbors yields the best
results in terms of prediction we're
going to do this using a loop now onto
the code first we want to reflect the
data with different randomization and
this has been inspired by Andrea's
Muller and Sarah guy dozes machine
learning book which I'll link to in the
description so once again X train X test
Y train y test equals train test split
cancer data cancer target stratify by
the target and random state is going to
be 66 this time okay
now we're going to create two lists for
holding the training and test accuracies
so training accuracy and test accuracy
now let's define a range of one to ten
neighbors ten included as I said before
and these are going to be tested in the
for loop so let's say neighbors settings
equals range 111 so if we want to loop
through ten inclusively we have to
specify the range to be from 1 to 11 now
let's actually write the loop so for n
for the number of neighbors so for n
neighbors in neighbors settings now what
we're actually going to do is create
terrain and test a canyon classifier for
each of these neighbors so as you might
already know the first thing we we
create our K neighbors classifier and we
have to specify n neighbors as being n
neighbors so whatever the neighbor is
looping through now we're going to fit
or train the model on X train y train
and now we're actually going to record
the accuracies first we're going to
record the accuracy of the of the
training the training subset so training
accuracy AB and so we're basically going
to assign the accuracy to the training
accuracy list so see how that's score so
the score of the classifier on the
training data extract Y train and now
we're actually gonna do the same thing
for the
test accuracy AB and C LF so classifier
score X test Y test ok this should be it
for the loop and now we're going to
basically do a data visualization so we
can observe which neighbor works most
appropriately and for that we're going
to use a mat plot live so PLT plot first
we're gonna need the neighbors settings
then the training accuracy and we're
going to call it accuracy of the
training set and now the same thing for
the test set for subsets so neighbors
settings test accuracy label accuracy of
the test set
okay now our Y label is going to be
accuracy so our y axis is going to
display accuracy and our X label or x
axis the number of neighbors you'll
understand this better in a moment when
we're actually going to see it so the
last thing we have to block is the
legend okay now let's run this cell all
right so recall that the default number
of neighbors of cannon is 5 however in
this case we can observe that the
algorithm seems to work best when six
neighbors are used for decision-making
so
the accuracy of the test set is best
when using six neighbors so I guess
this is one of the reasons why I think
it's important to know the specifics and
how each algorithm works so that you can
tune in its parameters to to yield
better results to optimize its results
and that's also why knowledge of linear
algebra and probabilistic statistics is
a plus anyway in the next video we're
going to test a different algorithm
against this cancer data set in
scikit-learn so if you enjoyed this
video please give me a thumbs up and
subscribe thank you for watching and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
