were working on top of an application we
previously created I wanted to make this
a different series because I'm giving
another direction to the application so
it kind of makes sense not to combine
them now let me show you what I'm
talking about
and what we're working we're going to
work on in the next couple of videos so
here I have the universal search bar
that's been built and a previous series
and I'll link to it in the description
if you want to catch up and in short
this minimalistic app stays on top of
your windows and you input text hit
enter or click the search button and you
can conveniently switch between search
engines Google and doc go calm in this
case and here is the app that we're
going to build I already built it but
I'm going to do it again for the sake of
showing you how I did it as you can see
that there are some visible differences
but there are some more differences more
major differences under the hood now let
me explain first I added more options
you can search for books on Amazon and
for videos on YouTube then I added an
icon over here and also a voice search
button that's probably the most
important feature that we're working on
it's going to be cool and I'm sure
you're going to like it too now let me
demonstrate how this search
functionality works
let's select Google and click the search
bioinformatics research
okay all right
now let me close these so under the hood
you can see that the first application
that we've previously created has only
45 lines of code so it's kind of
simplistic and anyway it serves its
purpose well this one that we're going
to work on has like 120 lines of code so
there's a lot of work to do in the next
few videos so anyway this is what we're
going to work on to be more specific in
the next video we'll discuss the
additional modules that you have to
install to be able to follow along with
coding so that's just about it for this
one if you enjoy the video please give
me a thumbs up and subscribe and stay
tuned thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
