first one has to do with the ketogenic
diet and it goes like this
can I drink a protein shake with skim
milk while on a ketogenic diet it's
probably going to be 50 grams of carbs
daily is it too much my answer is that I
don't know is it too much for wide if
your concern is about remaining in
ketosis with consuming 50 grams of
carbohydrates per day which includes
having protein shakes one of the best
ways to find out is to test and see so
to be very accurate measure your blood
ketones at the beginning of the day
before consuming anything make sure you
are in ketosis to start with then go
about your day have your allotted
carbohydrates and shakes then at the end
of the day measure your blood ketones
again and see if you're still in ketosis
there's no reason for me to make
inaccurate guesses about this when the
best way probably the best way is to
test and see I hope this helps ok the
next question
thoughts on green tea consumption during
intermittent fasting non eating window
so in other words what about drinking
green tea during your fasting window
well why not I think this is a matter of
preference and a follow-up question to
that any data to show it increases a
blood sugar or insulin well not that I
know of I suspected healthy people doing
intermittent fasting and drinking plain
green tea
during their fasting window would not
experience negative effects on their
blood glucose levels especially if the
drinking or the if the drink or the tea
is unsweetened however I have no direct
or solid evidence to support my
assumption another question with two
pieces of gum break my fast total for
both for carbs and calories now looking
at the labels of the average chewing gum
I see that most have 5 calories per
piece and one about one gram of
carbohydrates so this is kind of in line
with your statement seriously I would
not worry about the insignificant amount
of calories you're getting from chewing
some gum in your fasting window
especially if you're a healthy person
and you don't consume any other food or
beverage of caloric significance in your
fasting window so kind of this is an
advice or suggestion to please be
reasonable now another question along
the same lines apple cider vinegar is
zero calories one break of fast right
tastes ok thinking of drinking some pre
ending my 22 - so that's a intermittent
fasting protocol with 22 hours of
fasting and 2 hours of consuming food
now I say it won't break your fast in
fact it could even potentiate it but
don't quote me on that because research
is all over the place and I haven't
looked into greater detail on this
specific matter personally I do consume
normal vinegar very often as part of
my salad dressing not because of some
alleged good effect it may have on
health but because I really like to
tasted it and how it kind of intensifies
the flavor of the food I'm eating plus
you wouldn't worry too much about it if
you're on point with with the rest of
your protocol or for the most of your 22
our fasting window all right I guess
