history is by making myself aware of the
fact that I was not programmed to learn
from it in a textbook format nassim to
lab here I'm going to go over a few of
my highlights from Nassim Taleb this
book fooled by randomness in it he seeks
to defend science as a light beam across
the noise of randomness and to attack
the scientist when he strays from his
course most disasters come from the fact
that individual scientists do not have
an innate understanding of standard
error or a clue about critical thinking
and a quote we are designed to recognize
and seek patterns in everything that
occurs in our daily lives this may have
been advantageous from an evolutionary
standpoint it might have helped us get
to today but the world as it is now is
more chaotic than whatever the patterns
we try to perceive randomness in events
or in our surroundings is much more
prevalent than we are aware our minds
are not quite designed to understand how
the world works but rather to get out of
trouble rapidly and have progeny and the
quote this rationale makes sense when
you put the survival of human species as
a purpose essential to life when we look
at the past it is deterministic because
we have only one observation of it so
events from the past are certain that is
the probability of them is 100% but as
pointed out by to lab for most people
probabilities about what may happen in
the future not events in the observed
past and this quote which in my
translation means that inferring
predictions about the future from past
events may not be such a good idea
rare events are always unexpected
otherwise they would not occur and if
quote it is common that such
events have more often than not
something bad or negative attached to
them think of market crashes accidents
calamities you being cheated and so on
but would you think that it is possible
to benefit from such rare events well
for that I suggest reading anti fragile
things that gain from disorder which is
another great book from the same author
and I might make a video about it in the
future now back to randomness when does
the decision looks at the data to test a
given relationship say to rat out the
correlation between the occurrences of a
given event like a political
announcement and stock market volatility
odds are that the results can be taken
seriously
but when one throws the computer at data
looking for just about any relationship
it is certain that spurious connection
will emerge such as the fate of the
stock market being linked to the length
of women's skirts and just like the
birthday coincidences it will amaze
people and if gold now that's a good
illustration of being fooled by
randomness how would you protect your
brain against it well my suggestion is
to become literate in statistics
mathematics and human irrationality to
lab recommend looking into the works of
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky their
specialty was to uncover areas where
human beings are not endowed with
rational probabilistic thinking and
optimal behavior under uncertainty and
this quote Carl Sagan an astronomer who
promoted scientific thinking looked at
cure rates for people who visited
Lourdes in France some claimed
miraculous cures by simple contact with
holy waters Sagan found the interesting
fact that of the total cancer patients
who visited a place the cure rate was if
anything lower than the
Mystikal one for spontaneous remissions
it was lower than the average for those
who did not go to wards what happens in
this example of randomness well on one
side you have the blast few ones
shouting out in all corners of earth
that they have been healed while the
rest of the majority all the cursed ones
perish in silence it would be odd to
hear the evening news about the masses
who visited the place and weren't healed
that would be boring instead the focus
is always on those few ones the outliers
which by statistical means are
insignificant and this is a form of
survivorship bias which I Curtis Lee
invite you to explore yourself I'm sure
many of you don't like to hear this it's
easy to allow yourself to engage in
magical thinking
it gives caller purpose and meaning to
your life
while the bland and unattractive and
cold reality of statistics and random
events can be repulsing yes it's one of
the few ways in which real scientific
progress is made of course you always
have the privilege to decide between
self delusion and hard sciences I want
to end this video in a positive note but
which contradict conventions and that is
that small can be a very sought after
ambition it is better to have a handful
of enthusiastic advocates then words the
people who appreciate your work better
to be loved by a dozen than liked by the
hundreds this applies to the sales of
books the spread of ideas and success in
general and runs counter to conventional
logic the information age is worsening
this effect and if quote reprocessing my
highlights from this book three years
later I realized that I have to reread
it in its entirety we
they suspect I will generate additional
affirmative insight to the ones that I
already have now if you think that my
depiction of the lapses book resonates
with you I'd recommend you to pick it up
and voraciously read it slowly and if
