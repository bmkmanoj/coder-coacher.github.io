question that I got via email which goes
like this have you heard of very low
carb or low carb causing the type of
insulin resistance and if yes any
thoughts well Albert the answer is yes
I've heard of it and I also read a
couple of papers which kind of hint
about this mechanism I don't know of any
study that would investigate this on
purpose though and if any of you
watching this video know of any study
please link it in the comments below
okay so physiologic insulin resistance
induced by a low carbohydrate or very
low carbohydrate diet could make sense
in light of the evolutionary argument or
to be more specific how an organism
responds to stimuli from the environment
we're talking about stimulus and
adaptation here now in this case
adhering or remaining on a low
carbohydrate diet or a ketogenic diet
strictly for a long period of time could
lead to physiologic insulin resistance
through many possible factors to
exemplify one of them would be the down
regulation of different glut receptors
or gluts receptors Glu T which are
responsible for transporting glucose
inside cells because glucose is not
provided through the diet as much as it
is under a moderate or higher
carbohydrate diet the activity of these
gluts receptors may not be as in a
higher demand now following this
rationale the body adapts to
it's environment why would it maintain
the transcription of genes responsible
for good receptor proteins if there is
not as much need of them for metabolic
efficiency I suspect it would adapt by
up regulating factors that have to do or
that support fat metabolism since fat
would be the primary metabolic substrate
for energy in this case now this example
of down regulating glute receptors is
only one of the possible mechanisms that
could promote diet induced physiologic
insulin resistance okay so if this
really happens is it a bad thing I guess
it depends on how you look at it in part
it would promote metabolic inflexibility
and more reliance on a primary substrate
fat in this case then glucose for the
bulk of energy but I think that the same
could be said if one would follow a
higher carbohydrate very low fat diet
over the long term now what's the
takeaway I don't know if there should be
a takeaway message from this rudder I
try to view things can contextually and
I think healthy people could experiment
with different variations of macro
nutrient partitioning this way they kind
of they would avoid the boredom of
monotonic diets and they could promote
metabolic flexibility if I could put it
that way
but some people actually like this type
of boredom as in eating the same foods
every day now what are this
good or not it probably boils down to
the individual and their unique way of
living
what about unhealthy people now first of
all I don't think they're that everyone
should be doing the same thing following
the same diet exercising protocols and
so on and this is even more important
when there is an underlying disease
now as boring as it may sound this would
require an individual approach making
sure to consider as many unique
variables as possible from that person's
life
all right so we'll stop here with this
