very recent think it was released in
July 2015 and its author is a professor
at hambridge university so interestingly

very similar to line the saucer boy but
it's different from my book and that it
focuses more on providing knowledge and
talking about scientific experiments
regarding pathologic conditions on
testosterone so as genetic mutations
that can influence were disruptive
production of testosterone in sight of
green body while my my pro/con
testosterone is more action-oriented
mean there are nine steps that are given
my book and how to increase testosterone
levels so anyways is it was very good
book you want to know more about him
