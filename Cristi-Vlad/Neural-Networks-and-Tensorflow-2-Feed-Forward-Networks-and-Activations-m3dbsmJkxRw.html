feed-forward neural networks now in the
last video we've seen the artificial
neuron now a feed-forward neural network
is basically a bunch of these neurons
connected together the bottom layer is
where the inputs enter into the network
so we have the axes then they go through
the middle layers one or more and these
are the hidden layers and finally
reaching the output now as we've
discussed in the first video the inputs
are x weights to which we then add a
bias which is really important to have a
efficiently trained algorithm and the
same goes for these layers so you
multiply the output of one layer with
the weight and then you add the bias and
that goes into the next layer so the job
of the network is basically to learn or
find the best weights to compute the
output and I'm talking about supervised
learning here where we know the outputs
now the reason for which this is called
a feed-forward neural network is because
the connections only go one direction
and that is forward there are other
types of connections which make other
types of neural networks which we'll
discuss later also important to say is
that not all neurons in one layer have
to be connected to all of the neurons in
the next layer
in fact some good neural network
architectures selectively choose how
connections are made and in some cases
there are neurons that can be left out
altogether so even entire neurons can be
taken out of the computation
now I've mentioned in the previous video
that neurons are defined by a function
neurons that do simple computations can
use linear functions however in most
situations this is not the case and we
need to use nonlinear functions and the
three most you the the three most used
or the sigmoid the hyperbolic tangent
and the Rayleigh Oh or the rectified
linear unit now let's look at each so
the first one the sigmoid function or
the sigmoid neuron is represented by the
following so f of Z is 1 over 1 plus e
to the power of minus Z so in this case
when we have a small log it the output
of the neuron will tend towards zero
while when the log it or the Z of the
neuron is large the output of the neuron
will approach one so in between 0 and 1
the neuron assumes this S shape all
right now the second function the
hyperbolic tangent has a similar ass
shape but it doesn't range from 0 to 1
it ranges from minus 1 to 1 in this case
the f of Z is the tangent the hyperbolic
tangent of Z or d-10 H of Z which is
basically this equation so 2 over 1 plus
e to the power of minus 2 Z minus 1 and
in many machine learning and deep
learning problems
this is preferred over the sigmoid as it
is centered on 0 as we can see here so
the last one that we're going to talk
about here is the rectified linear unit
or Rayleigh oh and in this case the F of
Z is the maximum between 0 and z
as you can see its shape is rather
different than the previous two
now despite having a few drawbacks this
function has become probably to go to
choice for many problems one of which is
applied a lot is in computer vision and
we'll see more about that later as well
all right so these are the activation
functions that are most used and that
we'll be implementing when we start
coding
now let's in the next video briefly look
at the softmax output that being said
