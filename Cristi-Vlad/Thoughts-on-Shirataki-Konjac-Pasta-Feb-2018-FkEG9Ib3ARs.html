shirataki pasta or cognac pasta now
these products have been receiving a lot
of interest in the past couple of years
probably because of the popularity of
low carbohydrate diets now regardless of
your diets these are actually very low
calorie products and contain only two or
three ingredients or they should contain
only two or three ingredients if your
label says more than that you should
probably avoid them so they come and at
least three different shapes fettuccine
rice and noodles or angel here's the one
that I'm having here is a local brand
and the ingredient list says purified
water organic cognac flour and organic
oat fiber so the reason purified water
is the first ingredient is that many
producers claim these pasta are 97
percent water the rest of the rest being
the fibers so cognac fiber or flour is
highly water absorbable also this is the
reason why these pasta are super low
calorie since they contain so much water
now the taste well it depends so they
come packaged in water and when you open
the bag they may have a slight repulsive
order which is from calcium hydroxide
and which is why many people are put off
by that and that's why on the on the
instructions it says to rinse them under
cold water after which the order is
mostly gone then you can just use them
directly or you can cook them I usually
use them in both salty and sweet
combinations so I guess this is a matter
of your imagination
now despite the other when you open the
back which is like I said from calcium
hydroxide to me they have a pretty
neutral taste and these these actually
don't have an aftertaste which is great
because this way you can add a lot of
bulk to your diet with almost no
calories now for reference this bag
contains 9 calories per 100 grams and
zero carbohydrates this is a European
product which is why the labels has zero
carbohydrates and below that it says 5
or 4 grams so this is entirely fiber if
you're in the u.s. it would probably say
4 grams of carbohydrates and four of
them are fiber now in terms of shape
preference I actually like all three of
them and I cycle between using them and
probably I also should mention that they
don't seem to have an impact on either
my blood glucose or blood to Tom's but
I'm a test and do a video specifically
for this purpose in the future ok so
that's it thanks for watching please hit
the like and subscribe if you enjoyed
this short review and you'd like to see
more of these videos coming catch up
with you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
