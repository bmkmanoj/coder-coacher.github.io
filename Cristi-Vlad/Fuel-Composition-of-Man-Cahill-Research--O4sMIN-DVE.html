reviewing this study from the 1970s by
George Cahill and upon a closer look I
decided to share this table and talk a
little bit about it so this is an
estimation of the fuel or energy
available in a healthy normally
proportion 70 kilograms men with a basil
energy expenditure of 1800 calories per
day so in tissues most of the energy is
in the form of stored fat that is 15
kilograms in this reference man which
totals for a whopping approximately 140
1000 calories so there's a lot of energy
value there's a lot of energy value
stored in this tissue alone think of how
many days does normal over normal weight
so not overweight but normal weight
person who consumes 1800 calories per
day could go could like survive using
its adipose tissue alone and water of
course given that other metabolic
parameters are considered normal but
even so we usually eat at least three
times a day and if we skip a meal here
and there we we think that we're gonna
starve moving on there's also a lot of
energy value stored in
and as protein in tissue but as per
Cahill most of it it's already serving a
certain function so it usually it is not
used for for energy purposes for direct
oxidation purposes so liver and muscle
glycogen or stored glucose or in trivial
amounts compared to the energy you have
stored as fat or protein now in terms of
circulating fuels here's a better view
of Cahills perspective which was
provided and is provided by alex yard
set from deranged physiology calm so the
fuel that's usually in the circulation
of the reference man accounts for a very
little caloric value according to Cahill
and yard safe here the circulating fuels
account for 113 calories out of which 20
would be glucose three would be three
grams would be in the forms of
triglycerides and point three or ten
times less than that would be in the
form of free fatty acids we are
discounting protein here because of its
primary purpose not being for fuel
oxidation especially if we talk about
circulation but even so I'm not sure how
how they got the value for 20 grams of
glucose being in the circulation because
I couldn't find the details for that in
the paper so
let's do a simple calculation and if you
find some inconsistencies please do
point them out so let's assume a
circulating blood glucose level of 80
milligrams per deciliter that is 100
milliliters of blood times about 5
liters which is 50 times 100 milliliters
we have a value of a total up a total
value of 4,000 milligrams or four grams
please excuse my artistic capabilities
or four grams of glucose so then this
would account for 16 calories from
glucose alone for free fatty for unbound
free fatty acids a conservative estimate
would be 0 point five million molars per
liter or two milligrams per deciliter
doing that like we did for the glucose
two milligrams times 50 would be 100
milligrams of unbound free fatty acids
by more modern estimates or that would
be point one grams of free fatty acids
in circulation remember we are
discounting protein the caloric value
that's in circulation would be much
higher if we account for protein but as
said protein has the protein in
circulation has a different used other
than for direct oxidation purposes
and for triglycerides the estimates done
by Cahill would be approximately correct
so 27 kcals from triglycerides so then
you'd have 16 plus 27 plus this is x 9
would be x 9 so point 9 this is the
caloric value from from free fatty acids
you'd have a 43.9 calories in
circulation discounting for protein of
course so my point was not to find
inconsistencies in these calculations
but that in storage there's about
166,000 calories as energy while in
circulation there's there are there's
much less energy value in terms of
calories one of the points that Cahill
tried to to make with his study was and
here goes in summary man has only two
major fuel departs fat and protein
protein is serving as his machinery and
efforts are made to spare it that may
serve more minor function such as
insulation or mechanical padding but its
function as an energy depart being its
primary razon daughter or reason of
being I guess turns out that the
function
the adipose tissue is not as minor as it
was considered back then not only that
it that fat has endocrinology chol
function but it has other functions as
well and this may be the subject for
another time anyhow if you enjoyed this
