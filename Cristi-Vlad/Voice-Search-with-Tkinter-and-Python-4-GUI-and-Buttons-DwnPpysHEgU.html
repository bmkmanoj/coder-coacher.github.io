search capability of the application and
I want to do this before actually
getting into the coding of the voice
recognition and voice search functions
because it makes sense in terms of the
workflow so additional to the ability to
search on google and duck duck I also
want to search for videos on YouTube and
books on Amazon and will also code the
button for voice search so let's get
into it
that button it's probably gonna be
placed over here so back to the code
let's just move this binding before
button one
good now we'll keep adding buttons over
here below button three and for
convenience I'm gonna copy paste these
two so the two additional buttons are
gonna be for YouTube and Amazon since
they are radio buttons it makes sense to
just copy paste and then modify the code
so the first one this one is going to be
button for the text it's gonna be a MZ
the short for Amazon the value MZ the
variable remains the same my button
fourth we're gonna place this on the
grid Row one column this is gonna be
column three and it has no sticky
property the next one the one for
YouTube button five is gonna be a radio
button the text is gonna be YT be the
value of the button is gonna be white t
be the variable remains the same and
this one is gonna be on Row one so my
button five Row one column five
or call them four and we'll let it stick
to the east of the application okay now
let's do the voice search button but
first as so our voice search button is
gonna be the sixth button so since we
have six buttons or first button the
search this one has to be on the last
column so instead of column two we will
have to put it on column six so it's
gonna be column six
as for the voice search button we wanted
to display a microphone instead of text
so it would be intuitive that its
purpose is for voice input or voice
search and since we use an image for
this we have to appeal to the photo
image constructor and you already know
how to do this for my Python
intermediate series so let's go here
right below the style and do photo photo
image and the path to the file
microphone dot PNG it's gonna be a sub
sample of 15 by 15 now I have this file
in the same folder with the code so I
don't have to specify the full path to
it and this file is gonna be in the
github of the project which you'll find
a link to in the description now let's
go to button sex the voice search button
so it's gonna be my button six and this
is not gonna be attk
a themed DK but a TK enter button it's
gonna link to the root application and
we're gonna use our photo as image so no
text the command is going to be a
function called button click
let's have a placeholder for it over
here so death button click and we'll
just pass it for now back to the button
we'll have a border of zero an active
back round active background and I
already have the color code it's hash C
1 bf bf quite simple it's gonna have an
over relief with the value of groove and
a relief with the value of sunken
alright we're gonna place my button 6 is
gonna be on the grid it's gonna be on
row 0 and call them it's immediately
before our search button so it's gonna
be over here since the search is on
column 6 this is gonna be on column 5
okay another thing that we should modify
is this entry field it's I think it's a
bit too wide so let's go to the entry
field over here let's have it instead of
50 it's gonna be 40 what else it's gonna
be on row 0 column 1 and we'll have it
span over 4 columns so column span
equals 4 now let's see how it all fits
together see how many errors we get so
hit f5 save and run
oh no error but it doesn't look right I
mean these are not aligned properly so
let's see what we can do to fix it or to
make it look better
so the duck duck button I think the duck
duck button should be a little bit to
the right
okay so duck duck this one we're gonna
put it on column two and stick it to the
west of the application the west side of
of its its location over here okay
let's modify this as well a slight
detail now
let's run this again to see if it looks
better and there you go I think it looks
better and here's the The Voice Search
which does nothing for now but it's
gonna do in the next videos okay
I think this should be it for the video
and the next one will gonna work on
expanding the functions get and call
back to include these additional buttons

thank you for watching and I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
