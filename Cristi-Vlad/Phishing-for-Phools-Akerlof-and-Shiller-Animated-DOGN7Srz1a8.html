arrest or an especially serious problem
in the casinos the emergency crews could
not get through finally the casinos
created their own specially trained
defibrillation teams one surveillance
video shows why such special training
was necessary in the video as the squad
from the Casino defibrillate the heart
arrest of a fellow player the
surrounding players play on their trends
unperturbed even though the victim is
literally at their feet Akerlof and
Schiller this is a relevant case of
manipulating the human psyche driven for
the most part by financial greed in this
video I share a few insights from George
Akerlof and Robert Shiller this book
fishing for fools
the economics of manipulation and
deception with the right tactics
employees we are easily suggestible to
put it so gently our evolution enabled
us to react unconsciously to stimuli
from the environment and from the others
around us clicking the right buttons
allows other entities to control your
behavior as they exploit innate human
psychological flaws and biases without
your knowledge of course and you can
fill in with your desired agent here
beat the media Big Pharma the food
industry the supplement industry your
diet guru your friends the government
extraterrestrials and so on social
psychologists / marketer Robert Cheney
has written a book full of impressive
evidence of psychological biases
according to his list
we are fishable because we want to
reciprocate gifts and favors because we
want to be nice to people we like
because we do not want to disobey
Authority because we tend to follow
others in deciding how to behave because
we want our decisions to be internal
consistent and because we are adverse to
taking losses end of quote now to scare
you even further
this list is by all means a short list
there are so many ways to take advantage
of your volleyball nature let's look
into a quick example most customers go
to the showroom with an ideal car in
mind they have been primed by the
commercials it's got the four-wheel
drive the backup camera this Gizmodo
that gives moto when the customer
discovers that this fully gizmo towed
car sells for ten thousand in excess of
the models manufacturer's suggested
retail price the salesman's job is to
push back against the customers
reluctance you just have to sell them on
the benefit of those things anyway and
turned a blind eye to the high
probability that they won't need these
things later on end of quote
now you can safely replace showroom with
any other place you find yourself within
a given day and you can replace car with
any other product or service that you
buy or to put it more directly that
you're being successfully sold into and
another much more complicated example
which involves multiple agencies with
different levels of power like
publishing houses bringing out a
best-selling book the pharmaceuticals
carefully orchestrate the rollout of a
blockbuster drug the principal audience
for the rollout are the doctors who are
the intermediaries between patient and
build intern scientific articles in
refereed medical journals are a critical
link between doctor and prescription and
thus quote thus the drug companies
carefully select authors who will be
receiving data from their experiments
the sella tees are given easy access to
the randomized control trials required
by the FDA
they are also typically given at
toriel support less graciously known as
ghostwriting
for the article it is thus no
coincidence that a higher fraction of
journal articles sponsored by
pharmaceutical companies are favorable
to the drugs reviewed then articles
funded by other sources and the quote
Big Pharma is only one of the many
examples of entities to engage in such
practices I safely say that this happens
within the food industry including all
types of diets as each has their own
market within the supplement industry
with books selling and with basically
everything under the Sun so this is kind
of a game of everyone else against you
which is why I want to end this video in
a practical and potentially positive
note our nature makes us vulnerable to
exploitation by others you can blame one
or more of these agents all day long and
by the end of the day you'll probably be
the one that's losing the most throwing
the blame is not the way to go instead
learn about your innate flaws and to be
more specific to prevent being fished
for food educate yourself with respect
to cognitive biases critical thinking
and human irrationality it will take
time yes and thanks to the internet you
have all the resources available so you
have no excuse do this or you can keep
playing the victim card you get to
choose thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
