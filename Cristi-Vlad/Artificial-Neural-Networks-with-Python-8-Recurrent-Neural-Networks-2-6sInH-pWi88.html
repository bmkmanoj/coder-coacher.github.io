recurrent neural network with two layers
in neural lab so we'll call it an N and
we're going to access the neural lab
library net new ALM and I'm gonna
explain this shortly so minus two to ten
one for the neurons and I'll
thought-trends dot ten sig and and L
don't trans dot pure land okay so this
is an ailment recurrent neural network
so the minimum and maximum for the input
the number of neurons in the two layers
and the two transfer functions the
hyperbolic tangent and the linear so
pure Lin not line let's run this to make
sure there are no errors now we'll set
the initializer functions for each layer
so let's say and and dot layers 0 in it
F and we're going to access the neural
lab and l dot in its dot and it R and
from minus point one to zero point one
and another parameter WB and the same
thing for the second layer so a random
initialization and n layers one and at F
and L in it and it rent minus 0.1 0.1 WB
and then initialize will actually
initialize the net so and and dot
Annette and then we're going to train
the network
let's run this first so we'll use the
same notation like in the previous
videos so let's say error progress
equals and and the Train we're gonna
give it our wave the amplitude and it's
going to run for 1200 a box it's gonna
show one hundred and the goal of
learning is going to be point zero one
then we are going to run the training
data through our net using the same
method so let's say output equals and n
dot same wave okay now we're gonna look
at the results so we're gonna do some
plotting so PLT subplot we're gonna call
it two one one and we're gonna PLT plot
the error progress the X label is gonna
be the number of epochs so e box the Y
label is gonna be the mean squared error
so error ms e and another subplot let
make some space here so let's say PLT
subplot two one two we're gonna PLT plot
m dot reshape num when it's times for
the same thing is going to be for the
output so PLT plot output dot reshape
non-points times four and we're going to
also add a legend so PLT legend for d
original versus the predicted now before
we run this let's also test out the
recurrent neural network performs on
unknown
data so we'll say PLT that figure
another's sub want penalty some plot on
the two one one we're gonna actually
call the visualized output function
which we've defined here so this is a
helpful helper function so visualize
output and we're going to give it our
neural network and 82
remember 82 here denotes the number of
points for the get data function to
randomly generate and also we're going
to set an excellent so PLT dot axe lamb
is going to be 0 to 300 and another one
so the same thing so PLT that subplot
now for the two one two we're going to
call visualize output and this time
we're going to give it 49 points and the
same thing PLT excellent 0 to 300 and
ultimately we're gonna PLT dot show
alright so finally let's run this one so
it's going to run for 1200 key box
specified here
okay now so and the first plot here we
see how the training goes and then as
specified earlier we ran the train net
on the training data which is why we
have the predicted versus the original
now the third and the fourth plots show
how the recurrent neural network
simulates or predicts on unknown data
first for a wave of higher lengths so
our 82 there and then for a waveform of
decreased length okay so I know this may
be a bit too abstract because we haven't
talked about many components or many
component concepts for this topic at
hand but I promise we'll get back to
this in the future in much more detail
and probably using a different framework
we might as well do it in plain numpy
we'll see now in the upcoming video
we'll do some work with respect to
optical character recognition so please
