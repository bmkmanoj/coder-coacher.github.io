regulated depending on fuel availability
so when there is enough energy coming
from dietary carbohydrates there is no
need for ketogenesis to occur under
conditions of excess carbohydrate
consumption there is when there is more
than enough to satisfy energy needs and
more than enough to fill glycogen
storage capacity some of this glucose is
stored or converted for storage into
fatty acids conversely when there's not
enough carbohydrate for efficient
glucose metabolism such as in conditions
of low calorie diets carbohydrate
depleted diets under conditions of
fasting or dietary deprivation or in
pathologic conditions like uncontrolled
diabetes for example that is type 1
diabetes adipose tissue releases fatty
acids and these are broken down into
acetyl co a some of these acetyl co a
molecules power up ketogenesis as we've
seen in detail in a previous video but
there is more to that in severe energy
deprivation or during starvation
gluconeogenesis depletes TCA cycle
intermediates leading to the diversion
of acetyl co ways into ketogenesis now
in type 1 diabetes in the context of
lack of endogenous insulin glucose
cannot be taken up by tissues
hence Melanie Ocoee levels decrease and
this is used for fatty acid synthesis
and as a result acyl transferase one
inhibition is relieved which allows the
entry of fatty acids into the
mitochondria
they will be degraded to acetyl co way
and this is important here the Sirocco a
may not be able to pass through the
citric acid cycle or TCA cycle because
TCA cycle intermediates are mostly used
for gluconeogenesis
thus acetyl co is power-up ketogenesis
which in pathological conditions may
lead to acidosis where circulating
acetyl acetate and Delta beta hydroxy
butyrate decrease blood pH and this is
something to be avoided especially in
type 1 diabetes when endogenous or
self-regulation of insulin is not
possible and as I pointed out earlier
and the other situation when we talk
about individuals on restricted
carbohydrate diets those on very
low-calorie diets or people engaging in
prolonged fasting they also show higher
levels of ketone bodies in circulation
that is in their blood and also in their
urine which they should monitor to avoid
potential acidosis which is not as
likely to occur as in situations of type
1 diabetes because self regulation of
insulin is possible here alright that's
it for the video I hope it was helpful
