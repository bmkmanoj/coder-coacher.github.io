exercising and intermittent fasting I'm
going to tell you where can we do and I
secondly because I constantly modify my
eating and exercising strategies as for
intermittent fasting I try to pack all
my calories in a three to four hour
window so it's in my case this is I f21
with three or 20 with for 21 hours of
fasting three hours of eating so it's a
challenge and I often kind of end up
calorically restricting anyway in terms
of exercise I usually go to the gym
between 10 to 12 a.m. so i wake up
around seven and the gym i do resistance
training and i'm usually 15 to 17 hours
fasted when when i hit the gym I've
gotten used to this faster training ever
since 2014 to be more precise and I can
hardly him recall a time when when I
went to the gym being out of a fasted
state so this might not be easy if
you're doing it for the first time
especially if you consume a normal diet
that is not the void of carbohydrate and
that requires you to consume food every
few hours to meet your caloric needs so
if you go to the gym if you're in this
case if you find yourself in this
situation and you go to the gym you may
feel low energy if you try to work out
faster because you're not used to it and
that's kind of normal but if you're
doing intermittent fasting routinely for
a few weeks and try exercising in
exhausted state you should have bitch
weight and it might come easier now I
want to highlight that there are way too
many variables to be accounted for to
give someone a cookie cutter protocol
without knowing anything about them so
that's why I'm not going to make
recommendations I'm just telling you
what I do another thing as a pre-workout
I use one scoop of c-4 which has about
five calories so that's insignificant
and i also have creatine monohydrate
sometimes immediately after work out
most of the times a few hours later just
before I'm about to have my first meal
if I drink coffee before my workout
which would give me additional gasoline
from the one that's already in the c-4 I
have it blessed and Sweden or sometimes
it's sweetened with a with a stevia pill
which is non-caloric okay that's it if
you have questions let me know in the
comments below and please give me a
thumbs up if you enjoyed this video
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
