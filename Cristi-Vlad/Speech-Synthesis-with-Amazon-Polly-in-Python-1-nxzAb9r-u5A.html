learn how to use them as on Paulie for
life like speech synthesis in Python now
you may recall from my previous videos
that I've used ivona which was also an
Amazon product to create apps for speech
synthesis now ivona has been deprecated
and integrated with Amazon Pali as it
recent so even though some users and
developers who have there who still have
their API credentials with ivona may
still be able to work with it this may
not be for long
due to the discontinuing of this service
they kind of already stopped allowing
new user registration and that brings us
to Bali now let's look at a quick demo
of what it can do so we'll look into the
Joana voice which is an English American
voice now remember that I've used Emma
in my previous tutorials which is a
British voice and Emma is luckily is
still available in Pali but I'm not
really sure if we're going to use them
mom because I kind of like the sound of
Johanna anyhow let's listen to this
hello do you speak a foreign language
one language is never enough okay and so
in these two videos were going to build
the basic code for speech synthesis with
Bali in Python and we may later use it
to build different applications with it
as same as we did with with ivona now to
back it up a little bit and make it
clear if this is the first time you've
heard of Bali know that it is a system
that synthesizes or creates natural
sounding or lifelike speech from the
text you provided with so it basically
reads in lifelike voice the text
you're giving to it and Amazon which is
behind this allows registered users for
a limited amount or free use of Bali
every month for 12 months which is
enough time for us to him to practice
then after the free tier is off so after
12 months their current payment says
that it's somewhere at $4 for 1 million
characters which is incredible if you
ask me now back to the main thread today
I'm going to briefly go through the
prerequisites if you will be coding
along so first you go to aws.amazon.com
and sign up for a free account and make
sure you apply for the 12-month free
tier of AWS services which will allow
you to use a certain quota of different
services for free including Amazon Poly
and now as a side note I'll be working
in the Windows 10 with Python 3.4 3.5 or
later versions and so I'm also assuming
that you have Python installed on your
system
and you are not a beginner ok once your
account is set up you have to create API
credentials so that you can use Bali in
python and you'll be following the
instructions in this official
documentation to help you create your
credentials and make sure you allow
Amazon poly read-only access and Amazon
Pali full access to be used with your
credentials when you get to the point of
creating an API key make sure to store
it or download it because that's the
only time when your secret key is
visible if you don't have your secret
key you can't use the API credentials
now in case you forget
do this just delete the key you created
and create another one and make sure you
save your secret key this time so after
you have your account up and running and
you have your API credentials you'll
open up a shell or command prompt and do
tip install AWS CLI which I already have
installed AWS CLI is the command-line
interface for Amazon Web Services when
that's then you open up another command
prompt and do AWS configure and you're
going to basically configure with your
access key with your secret key and the
region name okay and now the last thing
to do is to pip install borrow 3 which
allows for pythonic interaction with
Amazon Web Services now you could also
set up your API credentials and region
name within boto 3 but we'll do it
through the AWS command-line interface
as I've specified over here now it's
always good to lecture the official
documentation and the one for boto 3 can
be found at moto 3 redox i/o and the
developer guideline for Poli is over
here now I provided these links in the
description so finally the test that
everything went ok we can simply open up
a Python shell and try to import boto 3
and then we'll create a poly instance so
Bali is boto 3 client poly
okay then we'll do the following Polly
described dog voices which requires your
API credentials to execute this command
so let's run it if you get something
like this and if there are no errors
we're kind of good to go to the next
step so in the following video we'll
create a basic code for speech synthesis
with poly in Python which is a bit more
complex than it was with ivona and the
wonderful Python wrapper Bivona anyway

thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
