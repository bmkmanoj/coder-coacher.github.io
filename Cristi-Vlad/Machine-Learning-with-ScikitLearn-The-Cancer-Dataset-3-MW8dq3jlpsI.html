set let me load its description so
uncomment this shift enter to run the
cell so this cancer data set contains
569 samples and these are digitized
images of fine needle aspirates or fna
or breast cancer tumors so this is
labeled data there are about 30 features
that describe each sample and each
sample is labeled malignant or benign so
let me let me show you so let's say
print cancer features feature names and
print cancer target names so these are
the features that describe each sample
so each sample has a mean radius mean
texture mean parameter and so on and
these are the labels so based on the
samples based on these descriptions each
sample is labeled malignant or benign
so in machine learning we feed this data
into the algorithm telling it hey
algorithm look a sample with this mean
radius mean texture and so on this is a
malignant tumor or this is a benign
tumor and this is how the algorithm
learns after we train the algorithm we
can test it against new data of where we
only specify the features and we require
it or we ask it to predict whether we're
dealing with aim
malignant or benign sample I told you
that this data set comes pre-loaded with
scikit-learn meaning that it's already
clean and pre-processed ready to be fed
into the classifiers or
ml algorithms let me show you how it
looks like so print or just simply call
cancer data so this is a let's check its
type this is a number array and its
shape or how it looks like so cancer
data shape so it's a number array and as
we already know 569 rows and 30 columns
so think of it like a table now let me
show you how the real data looks like so
once again uncomment this and show you
how the data that's cleaned and
pre-processed looks like so this is the
data that from which the algorithm
learns and I already have the raw data
this is this comes in CSV or comma
separated value form and this is
available on the internet and I also I'm
also going to post a link to it in my
github so please see the description of
this video so each sample has an ID a
diagnosis which is our target and these
are the features from column C all the
way to column a s so these are B the
features that describe each sample and
the let the target or the diagnosis
and 569 samples ignoring the header so
there's a lot of ugly data in here data
scientists have to clean it and optimize
it based on whatever the machine
algorithm they use in this case we'd
have to convert everything to two numpy
arrays but in this series we're going to
work with the clean data and we're going
to basically focus on machine learning
algorithms and how to do machine
learning and maybe I'll do another
series on data processing in the future
anyway in the next video we're going to
use train and test the first algorithm
on this data which is Canon or K nearest
neighbors so if you enjoyed this video
please give me a thumbs up and subscribe
thank you for watching and I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
