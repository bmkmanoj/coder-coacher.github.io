actually train it on our data now this
is as simple as one line of code so
we'll say error progress it's gonna be
perceptron
so our perceptron train and we're gonna
train it on our features and our labels
which are right here so features labels
will gon use 100 epochs and we're gonna
use show 20 and a learning rate of 0.03
okay let's do some visualization of this
process so let's say PLT plot error
progress PLT our x-axis is gonna display
the number of epochs and our y-axis so
while label is gonna be our training
error so training error right now our
PLT title is gonna be the training error
progress and we're gonna use a grid
display so PLT grid right now shift
enter to run this
I'm gonna run this one too so alright
and as we can see here the perceptron
our algorithm has learned data in only 5
epochs well we have a small and very
simple data set so that's kind of
obvious it actually learned it so fast
now we'll do something that's not
covered in the book and that's about
predictions so once our perceptron has
learned the data we can test it for
predictions using the simulation
function in neural lab which is similar
to the predictors I could learn so when
we call the sim method we'll have to
specify the same format for for this
sample we want to predict the class for
so we know that our features or samples
are two-dimensional like this one so
point twenty two point 34 this is in the
zeroth class or 0.72 six and point 19 so
these are the features the two
dimensional feature vector and this is
the labels of one so we'll provide a
sample that we want prediction for in
this same format now let's say that our
sample we want to predict for is point
eighty one and point twenty three so
we'll simply do perceptron perceptron
sim and we'll just say point eighty one
and point twenty three shift-enter
so it predicts that as in the one class
so this sample point eighty one point
twenty three looks like
point eighty four and point fourteen
which is in our training data and this
is classified as one okay let's predict
another one that resembles class zero so
we'll say perceptron SEM point twenty
seven point forty two and it correctly
labeled it as the zeroth class okay so
this is relatively simple and during or
throughout this process with a we've
kind of ignored some important aspects
of training data and of assessing the
performance I'm talking about things
like splitting the data scaling
cross-validation using metrics of
evaluation and so on but for the sake of
a greater comprehension it's okay if we
start things simpler like with the
perceptron over here now in the next
tutorial we're gonna start working on a
single layer neural network which is
quite similar to what we've done here so
and I'm talking in terms of the overall
process and thereafter we're going to
work on something a little bit more
complicated a multi-layer neural network
