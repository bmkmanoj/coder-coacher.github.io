good and bad and most importantly I
would say for me after many self
experiments I came to think that if this
dosterone levels are below normal the
two most important things that can be
done fairly easily and are likely to get
you 90% of the way or more and these two
are good sleep and resistance training
now I'm not going to go into the details
of what good sleep means and or what
type of resistance or anyone should be
doing I think that if one suspects under
normal testosterone levels probably the
first thing to do would be to make an
assessment like in the form of a blood
test testosterone levels fluctuate in a
circadian fashion with higher levels in
the a.m. and progressively lower
thereafter so because of this the most
appropriate time to draw blood for a
testosterone assessment would be I say
between 8 to 10 a.m. now in an ideal
situation I repeat the test once or
twice a few days after the first
assessment just to make sure they are
consistent or to find an average at best
but I guess that's ok is it's not
possible so as soon as one knows they
are under normal the first thing or the
first two things I'd focus on or I would
try to improve would be sleep and
implementing some form of resistance
training so in my current IR key I would
say the number one is a good sleep
then resistance training then a better
diet and only thereafter all the
supplements and strategies that are
being sold or packaged in one way or
another which I think they only kind of
very marginally contribute to improving
a deficiency now of course if there is
no serious underlying pathology to
prevent normal testosterone levels and I
guess this type of rationale can be
safely extrapolated to improving other
aspects of life as well because it's
generic and kind of nonspecific and yes
I've been talking a lot in the past
about strategies like cold exposure some
form of supplementation some alterations
in the diet etc but like I said what
appears to be more important is a good
sleep and then doing some form of
resistance training I hope this is
helpful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
