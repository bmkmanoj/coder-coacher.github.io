questions 5 and 7 from the baloney
detection kit which as you may remember
is a set of 10 questions created by Carl
Sagan and later polished by Michael
Shermer to ask when you're faced with
claims arguments and the potential
deceptive intentions of others the
people media your even your friends now
the ultimate purpose of the baloney
detection kit is to help you become a
better more critical thinker we humans
are irrational creatures of habit by
default to consider yourself a thinker
you have to deliberately practice and
build your critical thinking skills
otherwise and I'll put it bluntly you
are at the mercy of your senses and if
other people's is agendas be them good
or deceptive so back to the main subject
questions five and seven referred to
whether or not someone has been trying
to disprove a claim and whether or not a
claimant has been playing by the rules
of science let's be more specific so
question 5 has anyone gone out of the
way to disprove the claim or has only
supportive evidence been sought I'll use
this I'll use this image to exemplify so
let's assume someone says there is a
monstrous creature in the lake close to
where I live if this is wrong it is only
because of lack of evidence and this may
not convince true believers or fanatics
or those who make the claim against the
statement so they could for their own
peace of mind keep fabricating
statements like the monster is invisible
to detection or it could not be seen
because it was hiding in the mud at the
bottom of the lake
or similar statements and let's see keep
asking questions and a here is one
question that you might ask if you are
facing such a claim you can say can I
see the creature with my own eyes and
they would answer no because it really
rarely makes appearance it knows when
it's being watched now in this type of
situation you are facing an
unfalsifiable claim a claim that by its
construction cannot be tested and
unfalsifiable claims and theories those
which cannot be put under rigorous
scrutiny or not scientific you hear
these types of claims from faith healers
from religious fanatics from
pseudo-scientists quacks and the like
now don't get me wrong I have nothing
against religion each person has their
own right to care for for their own
beliefs religion is simply not
scientific and it doesn't even have to
be for that matter moving on to question
7 is the claimant playing by the rules
of science so pseudo-scientists quacks
and people with deceptive intentions
most often do not use good science and
valid research and statistics tools when
they make their claims they could use
statistics for manipulative purposes but
to be able to identify that you have to
train yourself in skills you have to
train your skills like math and
statistics which are not easy and are
not pleasant to learn again I'm going to
use one of the simplest and probably the
most inoffensive cases to to exemplify
this so I'm going to compare UFO
fanatics or you apologists with SETI
which is an organization that searches
for extraterrestrial intelligence
so you f ologist seeeeee start by
automatically assuming that UFOs and
aliens exist and to support their claims
they fabricate theories they present
obscure and blurry pictures which I'm
certain you've seen pictures depicting
UFOs and they engage in utmost
conspiracy theories now all of these are
non-scientific unlike the ridicule of UF
ologist or UFO fanatics SETI starts with
the premise that et is do not that is
extra extraterrestrial intelligences do
not exist so this is the premise that ET
is do not exist and that day that is
setting must prove concrete evidence
before making the extraordinary claim
that we are not alone in the universe so
you know all of us engage in magical
thinking it's in our nature and I'd be
very excited myself if we could find and
positively interact with intelligent
life-forms outside of Earth we can get
closer to such a scenario using science
and the wonderful tools provided by
technology not using conspiracy theories
and fairy tale thinking so in the end
and to repeat myself examples like the
one from above are harmless quacks and
Machiavellian individuals often engage
in more sophisticated and stealthier
strategies to exploit your logical
vulnerabilities and as I've said
arguments become stronger as they cannot
be disproved not proved disproved
through rigorous testing so that is why
the scientific method is all about
verifying re verifying reproducing
replicating and trying to falsify claims
thus proving them wrong not proving them
right
and spotting an unfalsifiable claim and
being aware of that tools science and
technology have to offer are a few of
the weapons we can fight pseudoscience
and quackery becoming scientifically
literate is a pursuit that should be
high on the priority list it is on mine
especially today when there's so much
misinformation okay so this is it for
