voice assistant and Python you can find
the link to my github in the description
the readme file contains links to all
the modules that you have to install and
links to the modules that you need API
access like Wolfram Alpha and iPhone
these are free by the way so looking
into the code I think it's pretty
exploitative you have to replace these
with your API keys with your own API
keys
you're not going to provide mine here um
I posted a showcase of this a few months
ago but I'm gonna run a couple of
commands so you can see how it all works
it's going to take a few seconds to
initiate at first hello for a list of
commands please say keyword list who was
the fifth President of the United States
the answer is James Monroe from the 4th
of March 1817 to the 4th of March 1825
how many centimeters are in seven miles
how many centimeters are in seven miles
the answer is 1 dot 127 times 10 to the
power of 6 n centimeters what is the
distance between the Earth and the moon
I'm not sure if you got this one
maybe not but we'll wait a couple of
more seconds
well Google results for the distance
between the Earth and the moon so if you
got this one
what is the 25th day of the year
this is an obvious one
Google results for the 25th day if a
year is an obvious one
what is the 240 third day of the year
the answer is Tuesday August 30th 2016
who is the president of Saudi Arabia
do they have a president Saudi Arabia
Syria relations refer to diplomatic and
economic relations between Saudi Arabia
and Syria diplomatic ties between these
two countries of the Middle East have
long been strained by the major events
in the region stop listening stop
listening stop listening
I am shutting down well as you can see
the code needs a lot of improvement but
it works in its essence it kind of works
once again let me know if you have
questions or if you need help but I
think that you should be fine given that
I provided links to hello to all the
modules that you have to install here is
another link to the video that I posted
about this a few months ago so thanks
