through 100 books this year i want to
make a couple of practical points why do
I say I went through well it is because
I'm getting the information from this
these books in two ways by reading and
by listening by listening to audiobooks
so first of all I read most of my books
on the tablet and this stylist helps me
make highlights annotations and all that
stuff and the the reader that I have on
the tablet is his extremely
user-friendly so it doesn't affect the
experience that I'm getting from reading
it on the tablet compared to what I
would get if i read a physical book I
also read physical books but I mostly do
it when I'm in New York and I get them
improve the public library it is more
convenient for me to read the books on
the tablet because I can carry eat and
unlimited number of them in there the
second point that I want to make is that
I also get my information from books and
audio format so most of the books that
are reading audio that I audit that I
listened to our psychology books so
looks like Thinking Fast and Slow by
Daniel Kahneman 59 seconds by Richard
Wiseman innovators by walter isaacson
does not like psychology but it's like
more a
an overview of the biggest innovators in
the past 100 years another book would be
the biography of Richard Feynman that is
surely you're joking mr. feynman anyway
another important point I want to make
is that I don't speed read since since
most of the books that that I read or
scientific that's kind of nonsense I
mean how could you speed reading a
programming book or a medical textbook I
think it's nonsense another practical
point with respect to the audio books is
that i use my media player on 1.3 x the
speed so sometimes the narrator reads
the book kind of slow at a slow to
medium slow tempo so if i increase the
speed or the temple to 1.3 de is thirty
thirty percent faster it doesn't
actually impact the quality or d the way
that i can get the information from the
book so i have no trouble with that and
that basically allows me to go through a
psychology or a biography book faster
when i do it in audio format so that's
it if you have questions with respect
this let me know in the comments below
