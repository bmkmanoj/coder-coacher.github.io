gonna build a speech synthesis
application using TK inter and Python
and by calling the ivona API so what is
ivona iPhone is a text-to-speech
technology that mimics natural language
let me show you over here so let's go to
voices hi my name is Brian and I'm one
of the ivona Tech's just okay and my
favorite hello I'm Emma
and I've earned a text-to-speech voice
developed with bright voice technology
once you listen to me you won't believe
my voice isn't human I could not okay so
they basically allow developers limited
testing and use of the technology and
you can get your free account to access
the API keys that were gonna use by
going to developer ivona comm so you go
here and register for for a free account
we're gonna call the API through Python
and for this you're gonna have to also
install the PI vona package so open up a
command prompt and install so it should
say requirement already satisfied yeah
so now opening up the app I'm gonna show
you basically this is the final
application that we're gonna have once
we code along in the next few videos so
let me grab some text and show
how it will work going to my blog here
copy this paste it over here I posted
three videos in which I show you how to
do visual recognition in Python by
making calls to either and Watson's API
Watson is a supercomputer a specific
form of artificial intelligence there
you go
so why would you want to build this type
of application well you can do a lot of
testing and playing with the quota
that's provided to your ivona developer
account say for example you want use to
be ran to you from a certain website or
blog while you're doing something else
around or say that you're not a native
English speaker however you could use
ivona in 47 other languages as it says
47 47 voices and 24 languages and
Counting so but say you want to create
video tutorials or YouTube videos and
instead of you speaking if you're not a
native you could just have iPhone and
speaking for you you could also do this
for anonymizing purposes I think I
personally used it to build my Python
assistant which I'll link to one of the
video showcases and in the description
and you'll be able to access the the
free code to my github from there anyway
this is what we're going to focus on in
the next few videos so please make sure
to hit the like and subscribe and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
