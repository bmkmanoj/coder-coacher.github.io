discuss about lactate as brain fuel it
might get a bit technical as you
progress through the presentation so I'd
recommend checking the references at the
end for a better comprehension of the
information provided now if you enjoyed

I followed the work of dr. Rhonda
Patrick she's a very knowledgeable
researcher she's been the mentee of
Professor Bruce Ames who's been doing
science experiments for more than 60
years yes 60 years during one of her
interviews dr. Patrick invited dr.
George Brooks who researchers exercise
physiology and metabolism at UC Berkeley
to talk about lactate as brain fuel to
better understand his write-up
I'd recommend listening to the interview
few people are aware that lactate can
serve as efficient brain fuel especially
in situations like fasting strenuous
exercise or traumatic brain injury to
name a few while listening to the talk
between dr. Pratt Patrick and dr. Brooks
I made the connection
I remembered the mental clarity that I
always get after a hard weightlifting
workout in a fasted state now I would
like to introduce the concept of brain
metabolic flexibility which refers to
the ability of the brain to run on
various different fuels rather than 100%
on glucose which happens in people who
do not go on a very low carb diet or
fast for more than 30 hours that is
under normal conditions as seen in the
graph it is known for more than 60 years
then in that in the normal fat state the
brain derives its energy solely from
glucose however when metabolically
challenged during long periods of
fasting for example fuel dynamics of the
body and the brain change now please do
not confuse fasting with starvation many
people may make this
take and use them interchangeably they
talk about the starving body if no food
has been consumed for a couple of hours
to put it mildly
this is naive fasting is when your body
derives its energy from its own reserves
that is fat stores has no food or
calorically significant nutritional
components are consumed starvation the
real one happens when body fat is so low
less than 3% I would say that it cannot
be used efficiently for fuel and to
survive your body starts catabolism
green tissue which was spared up to this
point to make a case in point
lean individuals like me for example
could go several weeks without food
while mostly preserving all lean mass
given that they're healthy and that they
consume decent amounts of water
overweight and obese people could run
several months on their own fat allowing
their bodies to take a breath of fresh
air from digesting food stuff hunger is
the list of problems one could think of
in prolonged fasting it mostly doesn't
exist rather there is a psychological
edge meant to food that may sometimes
become problematic for the faster in
fact during the 60s one of the
approaches to obesity was prolonged
fasting some of these fast would last
for dozens if not hundreds of days and
the longest medically recorded fast was
a 382 days it was a success however some
of these fasts led to death and I would
suspect that those subjects his bodies
were not prepared to handle such a
stress and I would also suspect that
some of them suffer from additional
diseases of the metabolic syndrome but
this is a totally different story and it
highlights the complexity dual nature
and implications of fasting but what
about lactate as brain fuel as it can be
seen in the graphic during fasting
two-thirds of the brain fuel is to write
from ketones while the remaining is
provided by lactate pyruvate amino acids
with
and under gluconeogenesis
gluconeogenesis which is endogenous
glucose production may also come from
the following reaction and you can view
some absolute values for these
substrates in an older article now in
the medical community it was known that
fatty acids cannot be used as brain fuel
because they cannot cross the
blood-brain barrier however that may not
seem very accurate in fact fatty acids
do cross the blood-brain barrier but
they do it so slowly that they are not
efficiently metabolized you can see the
study and when it comes to lactate
communities opinions are all over the
spectrum there are some proponents who
claim for its potentially positive
effects while others only discuss its
downsides now let's see some facts I
searched for lytic brain fuel on Google
Scholar and I randomly picked some
results from the first page then I
limited my research for studies that
have been conducted since 2013 I'm not
sure if this can be called
cherry-picking since we will see
opinions from both sides but if you want
to discuss this further please do it in
the comment section below
one of the studies that I found fails to
account for alternative brain fuels
describing the aspects of hypoglycemia
brain failure and brain death but as you
can read I would like to ask you a
question is this lying by omission
or lack of knowledge due to poor
background research now the purpose of
this study is not to discuss alternative
brain fuels though but a suggestion to
avoid procedures that lead to
hyperglycemia in the context of profound
hypoglycemia an inexperienced reader may
may fail to grasp a bigger picture due
to the nature and the perspective in
which this study was written glucose is
indeed required by the brain at all
times but the brain can thrive and even
function better with only twenty to
thirty percent of its fuel coming from
glucose compared to when it's using 100%
glucose in fact several in vitro
studies and also in vivo studies show a
necessity for lactate as brain fuel
after episodes of brain injury that is
strokes for example and dr. Brooks also
talks about this in his interview with
dr. Rhonda Patrick now another study
number two states and please pause this
video to read what the study says we can
also see a different perspective here
okay
now several other studies are worth
mentioning
once again please hit pause and read
their findings but what about healthy
people or lactate doing an or after
workouts in healthy humans in vivo
experiments show that circulating
lactate is used by the brain at you
glycemia that is normal blood glucose
levels with sparing of glucose then
another study of healthy adults
researchers observed rising
beta-hydroxybutyrate and lactate in the
brain during fasting induced ketosis
that is after two or three days of
fasting they proposed that lactate
increase may result from ketones
displacing lactate oxidation without
interfering with glycolysis and glucose
phosphorylation
we know that lactate is produced at rest
by many cells in the periphery and in
the brain however our plasma lactate
induced by exercise increases the update
of lactate in the brain in a
proportional fashion as you can see in
the graph and in the quote from the
study now you may be wondering how can
you benefit from this well I'll tell you
how I can benefit for this first while
these may not serve as solid evidence
for the short-lived boost in mental
clarity and overall increased well-being
post exercise that I feel this does not
prevent me from sticking to my protocol
that involves
ketosis intermittent fasting como
Genesis etc even though this may only be
surface level research that was
triggered by my spark interest in
alternative peripheral and brain fuels
I believe the research on the subject is
extensive
now following dr. George Bruce's work
and reviewing similar studies on the
topic could be a good exploratory path
and I may do it in the future you can
also do it but our interesting venues
would include studying lactate as a
signaling metabolite as well as his
implications in muscle hypertrophy now
to make a long story short
I'd rather have my brain be able to run
on multiple fuels than relying solely on
glucose which may be detrimental in some
cases and people adapted to a ketogenic
diet after a couple of months of
constant extra ketosis or people who
engage in long-term fasting could be the
living testimony for this but I may be
biased now my brain running on lactic
acid made me keener too visiting the gym
more often and train even harder my
quick recovery allows for that I suspect
I recover faster because of my
testosterone protocol because of cold
thermogenesis this rhetoric use of
phytochemicals fasting and because of
other possible interventions which you
can read about on the blog you know
please make sure that you have a look at
the references and try to find your
personal opinion on this subject if you
are really interested in collected as
brain fuel and I also like to remind you
