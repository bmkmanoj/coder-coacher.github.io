pre-processing methods for machine
learning in the last video we talked
about binarization today we're going to
delve into another method which is mean
removal and this is also known as
standardization we use mean removal on
the feature vector when we want features
to be centered on or around 0 and in
this way we remove feature bias now to
better understand the method we're gonna
use the dummy data set from the previous
tutorial and first we're going to look
at the mean and the standard deviation
of our data so within the same notebook
we're gonna print let's say mean before
equals and we're just gonna apply the
mean method on the data data set on the
zeroth axis and the standard deviation
so standard deviation before equals data
STD on the same axis now shift enter to
run this so as you can see the data is
not centered to Center it we're gonna
use the scale method from pre-processing
and we're gonna apply this to our data
so scaled data let's call it scaled data
and we're gonna use the pre-processing
the scale method on our data and now
we're gonna do the same prints like
before so
and mean after equals and we have the
data the scaled data mean on the same
0th access and for the standard
deviation
after equals scaled data STD access
equals 0 again shift enter to run the
cell and as you can see data is now
centered meaning that we have a mean
that's close to zero and a standard
deviation of 1 we need to perform this
type of operation in many machine
learning projects because if we use an
algorithm that assumes that all data is
centered around 0 and has a variety in
the same order of magnitude such as in
the case of let's say support vector
machines and if one or more features has
a variety at an order of magnitude much
larger than the others our algorithm is
likely not going to be able to learn
from the data please keep this in mind
in your machine learning projects when
working with unprocessed
or uncleaned data all right now in the
next tutorial we're going to deal with
another pre-processing method if you
