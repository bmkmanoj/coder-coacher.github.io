short case for a very basic and still an
efficient voice search bot that I wrote
in Python it uses your computer's
microphone and it's activated by
different keywords the bot is built on
Google speech recognition API but you
could use other speech recognition
engines if you want it has a few
dependencies as you can see and pie TTS
X was the most challenging to deal with
for me web browser and time or easily
installed the Apep and speech
recognition as far as I can recall I
didn't have too much trouble installing
it the code is inspired by the examples
in the speech recognition git repository
but is modified to a large extent which
is why I suspect it can be written in
fewer lines with more efficient output
so if you have suggestions please be my
guest and write them below now let's run
a test so Python Jarvis 3 yeah inspiring
search for the latest news about
Thailand ok so it does a Google search
for it it opens a window and I don't
have to go back to the program again I
could just say search for
what's the weather in Austria right now
so I could do my own stuff and just use
the magic word and it listens it
searches and it displays search for the
first emperor of China okay all right so
whenever I wanted to stop listening I
just said the magic word so whenever I
wanted to stop I just say stop listening
okay so that's it
well if you want to get the code please
see the link in the description and I
also wrote a few thoughts about it and
there that's basically a short blog post
and I know there is a lot of potential
for development this clunky code can be
optimized in multiple ways the speech
recognition the speech recognition speed
could be optimized it could be added
different triggering keywords with
different actions attached to them so I
think the only limit is the imagination
that you can do with there so if you
have suggestions for different keywords
and different activities that I could
add to it please let me know below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
