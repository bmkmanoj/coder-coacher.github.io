the forms of my udemy course and it goes
like this
why don't you advocate eating breakfast
before lifting weights
I cannot sustain a proper session on an
empty stomach
Enrique first of all I don't advocate or
preach and I don't consider myself an
expert what I've been presenting and
what I've been talking about and
illustrating are merely strategies and
protocols that I created followed and
modified for myself and I've been
talking about them thinking that with
proper individual adjustments it might
work for others as well and they seem so
and I want to emphasize on the word
adjustment now getting back to your
question
I hardly ever have food in the first
part of the day it's not that I'm
against that it's just a matter of habit
and convenience for me more importantly
I do my lifting in the first part of the
day in a fasted State and it doesn't
seem to have an impact the fact that I
don't eat would I not be able to perform
well in the gym with my current strategy
I would definitely try to adjust it so
in your case if you think that eating a
good solid meal before your workout is
something that would be helpful by all
means try and see how it works now what
I'm trying to emphasize is that you can
emulate stuff that I do but wherever and
whenever you find inconsistencies in the
strategy that are incompatible with what
you do once again try and adjust be
open-minded
don't be a copycat
I guess that if there's something to
preach or advocate I would preach
open-mindedness all right I hope this
helps so if there are similar questions
that you think I could provide some
insight on please leave them below other
than that I'd be grateful if you hit the
like button and subscribe thank you for
