to the temporary conclusion that and I
asked of 18 6 that is 18 hours of
fasting with six hours of feeding is one
of the most efficient for me because six
hours is sufficient time to consume my
maintenance calories without actually
filling over stuff for causing like
stomach trouble because if I would try
to consume the same amount of calories
in a shorter period of time like four
hours or two hours which is
characteristic to other I have
strategies it would be difficult and
probably unpleasant I would most likely
end up calorically restricting and that
would be good if I want to lose weight
but if I want to maintain it seems like
I can have two meals in about six hours
with this type of caloric intake and
actually try to get all my
micronutrients vitamins and minerals
with with the meals of course I could
always like consume 5,000 calories and I
don't know one hour but that wouldn't be
efficient and I would most likely be
under the daily recommended allowance
for daily recommended allowance for
vitamins minerals and so yeah probably
sort of feeding windows that I've
experimented with are great if you want
to lose weight if you eat normal food
cook it's hard to consume like
2000 to 2500 salary and in a short
feeding window in one or two meals okay
so that's basically what I wanted to get
out of my mind and this this short video
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
