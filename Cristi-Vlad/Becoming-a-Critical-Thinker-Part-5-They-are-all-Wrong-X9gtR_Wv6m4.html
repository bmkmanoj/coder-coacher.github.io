questions eight and nine from the
baloney detection kit which as you may
know by now is a set of 10 questions
devised by call segun and michael
shermer to ask when you're faced with
claims arguments and all the potential
deceptive intentions of others the
purpose of the baloney detection kit is
to help you become a better more
critical thinker I'm gonna keep
repeating myself we humans are not born
with solid reasoning we are creatures of
habit with irrational behavior reasoning
is developed through deliberate practice
now we think we are good thinkers but
very few people can be included in this
categorization or category so if you do
not develop your thinking skills you may
be highly susceptible to the potential
deceptive intentions of others and I
assume you don't want that so let's see
what questions 8 and 9 have to do with
so question 8 is the claimant providing
an explanation for the observed
phenomena or merely denying the existing
explanation so a strategy that is often
employed by many when engaging in
debates is to criticize opposition or
the person instead of providing strong
support for their own beliefs so this is
often known as argumentum ad hominem and
it's one of our logical fallacies to
reformulate an example of Michael
Shermer to provide you some context for
this question hardcore creationists
cannot explain how life emerged on earth
they only maintain that God did it and
when you come up with science facts
about how earth was created live leaving
little room
for interpretation they start engaging
in personal attacks once again don't get
me wrong I have nothing against religion
of any kind each one of us has the right
to hold any beliefs we desire problems
arise when non-scientific arguments are
pushed as if they were supported by
science another step further from
hardcore creationists or those who
support an intelligent design theory as
Michael Shermer says they are no better
as they try to cherry-pick weaknesses in
science theories or parts of theories
that have yet to be found explanations
for but which may eventually be
elucidated some supporters of
intelligence intelligent designer
scientists with great track records in
their careers it is it is a wonder to me
how they can isolate their creationists
and often reductionist beliefs and
thoughts from their scientific thinking
but we know from behavioral psychology
that people have no trouble maintaining
dissonant thoughts in their minds you
may find yourself in a very tricky
position when exposed to such arguments
he attend to give credibility to a
person's is erroneous beliefs just
because they have proven themselves good
thinkers and other domains of life my
suggestion is to stay away from a
fixated impression you have a person
just because they have been good at
explaining or doing something in the
past take every argument and put it into
its appropriate context and be ready to
update your opinion of someone when
necessary so it's like always having a
blank slate since this is against our
natural tendency you have to understand
it takes effort to spot and act upon one
when you're in such a situation now
moving on to question 9
if the claimant prefers a new
explanation does it account for as many
phenomena as the old explanation did um
so science and the scientific method are
not without flaws and they don't purpose
to be arguments and theories may often
be incomplete or inconsistent scientific
arguments are always up for updates and
for scrutiny as good evidence becomes
available so anomalies and
inconsistencies may be part of good
science theories like the theory of
evolution for example scientists do not
refrain from acknowledging that however
pseudo-scientists will focus on these
inconsistencies by taking them out of
context twisting them to fabricate new
and often innovative arguments you can
often hear claims like Newton was wrong
Darwin was wrong Einstein was wrong and
I'm right my new theory explains the
world to paraphrase Michael Shermer so
when you face someone making such claim
ask them well if your theory holds
through true and if you're right about
the barely existent inconsistencies in
Einstein's theory can your theory
explain everything else that Einstein's
theory explained and for which we have
undeniable evidence like for example
general relativity I suspect they will
not be able to provide a good scientific
answer but are you skillful enough to
know and to ask such a question in the
end can you see how difficult it may be
not to fall victim to deception maybe
even more difficult to spot a quack or
charlatans because it did they often
repeated themselves their own
fabrications of reality until they
cannot make a distinction between fact
and fantasy
so thus they appear more genuine more
dangerous than a quack is a
self-absorbed quack dead who believes in
his own theories so like I always say
you need to develop solid critical
thinking skills to stay away from the
ception thus I remind you once again
train yourself in cognitive fallacies
which we're trying to do with with this
series of becoming a critical thinker
train yourself and learn about human
irrationality learn but behavioral
psychology math and statistics otherwise
you may not be able to safely make it
out of the flood of misinformation we're
being bombarded with twenty-four seven
and with this we had the video for today

thumbs up and subscribe thank you for
