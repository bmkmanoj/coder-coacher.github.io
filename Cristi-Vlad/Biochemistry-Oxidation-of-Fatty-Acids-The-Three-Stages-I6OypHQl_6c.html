picture view of fatty acid oxidation as
per Section 17 point 2 of lenninger
principles of biochemistry textbook so
mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation takes
place in three major steps as
illustrated in the graphic on the left
in the first stage we have our
long-chain fatty acid the 16 carbon
palmitate which is being removed two
carbons at a time in the form of acetyl
co a it is important to note that in
step one the formation of each acetyl co
a molecule will require dehydrogenase
enzymes or dehydrogenases to remove four
hydrogen atoms from the fatty acyl
moiety so after all cycles of beta
oxidation are completed there will be an
acetyl co ways to progress into stage 2
in stage 2 these as acetyl co a czar
oxidized to carbon dioxide in the crab's
or citric acid cycle or TCA cycle
whatever of the three forms you prefer
and this step also occurs in the matrix
of the mitochondria nadh and fadh2 are
reduced electron carriers that result
from these first two stages of oxidation
and in the third stage they will donate
electrons to the protein complexes of
the electron transport chain or
respiratory chain so electrons will pass
through these complexes to oxygen and
ATP will be phosphorylated to ATP at the
same time more or less so this is how
the energy from the oxidation of fatty
acids is turned over or transferred to
ATP I hope this video was helpful if you
