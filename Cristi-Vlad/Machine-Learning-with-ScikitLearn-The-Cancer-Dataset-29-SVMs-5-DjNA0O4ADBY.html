algorithm changes as we scaled the data
now for this purpose we could simply use
methods or scalars that are built in
scikit-learn like for example the
standard scaler the minimax
scaler and so on which could be found in
the pre-processing module now this would
be very convenient because you kind of
bring your data to scale in one or two
lines of code but we're not going to do
this actually we're going to do it by
hand to kind of better understand what
data scaling means so in short we're
trying to bring the values as each
feature so the values of the feature of
each sample within a certain range like
zero to one in this case we can see that
they are on a logarithmic scale and
there there is kind of a big difference
between the minimum and maximum values
so ordered we're talking about orders of
magnitude here so all right the first
thing we're going to need is going to be
the minimum value for each feature so
men train is going to be X train the
minimum on the y axis so X is 0 and with
this we'll find the range of each
feature by subtracting this minimum from
the maximum so range train as X train -
men train ok and the maximum on the y
axis so we're talking about the biggest
value for each feature within the set of
samples and now probably the most
important part of this is to once again
subtract the minimum for each feature
and divide by the range and this kind of
allows us to bring the data within 0 and
1 so we're
going to call it X train scaled once
again thanks train - men train and now
we're going to divide it by range train
okay now let's just print the minimum
and maximum of each feature to make sure
they are into 0 and 1 while the rest of
the values reside within this range so
print minimum for feature new line
format X train scaled minimum on the
y-axis and the same thing for the
maximum so print maximum for feature
online format X train scale max axis 0
all right now shift enter to run this
alright now that we brought the data to
scale let's feed it to the algorithm and
see how it performs compared to
previously but first let's just do the
same thing the same scaling thing for
the test subset so X test scaled X
that's - men train over range train so
it's kind of basically the same thing
apply to the test subset and then we're
going to create a new classifier so as
VM SVC we're going to live all the
defaults so this classifier is going to
have all the defaults without so we're
not actually going to modify any hyper
parameter
and then we're going to fit it or train
it onto our scaled data so X train
scaled Wine Train now we don't have to
scale the labels I believe that makes
sense without further explanation all
right now let's just print the
accuracies again so I'll just copy paste
from here and modify the X ring with
xtreme scaled and X test with XS scaled
so these are their scaled versions and
shift them to run this okay now the
performance compared to this one looks
better then so the performance looks
better than on beyond scale data so we
can see the biggest difference it makes
to CD as VMs with scale data it learns
better however despite this we are now
in a situation of underfitting so in the
next video we'll see what we can do
about it and we'll work on adjusting
some hyper parameters as always if you
enjoyed this video please give me a
thumbs up and subscribe thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
