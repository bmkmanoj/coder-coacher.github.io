about nine of the strategies that I use
to keep my discussed iran levels high so
i began testing my testosterone levels a
couple of months after starting with
ketosis nutritional ketosis which is the
metabolic state where fat becomes the
primary source of energy for your body
it was March 2014 and my levels were
about 400 nano grams per deciliter and
that's average too low for a person of
my age
I suspect my pre ketosis levels were
even lower because from what I've
researched if well formulated a
ketogenic diet can improve testosterone
levels in a matter of months I've been
able to raise my testosterone levels to
about 850 nanograms per deciliter and
they've been mostly constant ever since
I documented this experiment and its
results in my book that testosterone
protocol but I want to re-emphasize the
nine major interventions that I made to
improve my tea levels so sadly of the
last few decades there's been a
declining trend in testosterone levels
in men and this is not due to the aging
process and a simple way to know what
we're dealing with is to do this
whenever you're in a public location try
to spot man that do not have bellies
can you abdominal fat has been shown
numerous times to be inversely
correlated with testosterone levels that
is bigger belly lower tea levels in men
anyway my first strategy involves a very
well formulated very low carbohydrate
low calorie killer genic diet without
carb loading it should be self
exploitive so ever since I started with
ketosis in September 2013
I purpose to maintain the state
constantly the benefits of keto
adaptation have made me become
kind of addicted to nutritional ketosis
and carb loading would kick me out of
ketosis besides I don't need it my
lifting performance has never been
better however it took me more than six
months of constant ketosis to recover my
pre ketosis performance when I back then
I was on a higher carbohydrate nutrition
so it took a couple of months until I
recover my performance in the gym and in
my kickboxing practice and very few
folks are willing to do this for such a
long period of time
my second strategy involves a
combination of a heavy lifting protocol
and a high interval intensive training
protocol I personally began doing heavy
lifting immediately after starting with
ketosis I was training once a week by
following gave a very high intensity
strength training protocol with slow
repetitions the name of the protocol is
the big five and it's been widely
promoted and created by dog McGough so I
was training once a week with this
protocol but ketosis allows me and
allowed me to recover faster between
workouts ketosis and called
thermogenesis in fact then I started
training more frequently and currently I
go to the gym multiple times per week
and I'm doing higher volume training but
I try to maintain the intensity as well
as the slow slow movements some research
shows that compound movements which
involve multiple joints and bigger
muscle groups are positively correlated
with testosterone levels so what this
means that if you lift and you want to
have higher testosterone levels make
sure you don't skip light days
especially squats and deadlifts ok my my
third intervention is intermittent
fasting
so intermittent fasting is a meal timing
strategy where you condense all your
meals to a specific time frame which is
you're feeding window basically
intermittent fasting has two major
components fasting a fasting window and
a feeding window you fast for a number
of hours every day and then you consume
food during your feeding window most
folks who practice AF are using the 16-8
method that is 16 hours of fasting with
eight hours of feeding while my personal
protocol is a bit more difficult i do
the 18:6 which is i fast for 18 hours
every day and i consume all my food in
the remaining six hours that is my
feeding window and I usually have two
meals on one side I find it very
convenient because I'm never hungry
possibly in part due to Kiro adaptation
and its aggressive hunger suppressing
effects and secondly it's most
convenient because I don't think and/or
obsess about food every two to three
hours and it helps me be more productive
my fourth intervention is called
thermogenesis which is also known as
cold exposure or cold therapy and this
is something that most people will not
engage in for the long term because if
it's done right it makes you feel kind
of miserable so that's a deal-breaker
for many it requires you to remove
yourself from the coziness of your
comfort zone you may really get a good
grasp of the boundaries of your comfort
zone when you deliberately expose
yourself to cold real cold not face
dumps in moderate temperature water but
whole body called immersion now for me
as for many people it was really
uncomfortable at first I remember I
started with 10-minute cold showers back
in December 2012 and in December it gets
really cold here in Rome
then I continued with longer cold ice
showers and then I progressed into
taking ice baths I also experienced with
cryotherapy but that seems child's play
compared to a long ice bath for some
reason I pushed myself through CT which
is called thermogenesis until I started
enjoying it the immediate effects I
usually get after a good bout of cold
exposure are the adrenaline rush hunger
suppression increasing energy levels
better mood as well as increased
alertness the fig is nerve might have a
word or two about this now research is
somewhat trivial and inconclusive on the
connection between C T and T levels
though some folks swear by it anyhow
I've included this strategy in my tea
protocol now my fifth intervention is
supplementation and I wrote about my
supplement stack in a very detailed and
recent article the supplements that I
think that helped me with keeping my two
levels high or cod liver oil zinc
selenium and a few others that I
mentioned in the book however
supplements are what they are they
should supplement a well formulated diet
and not replace it that's why for my
nutrition I focus on consuming
sufficient healthy fats to provide for
the substrate from which testosterone is
made that is cholesterol but this
doesn't mean that I eat sticks of butter
and or oil enriched coffee though as
it's widely promoted out there I don't
find it rational and I think it's a
waste of calories there's no matter
Bullock magic attached to oil coffee
from what I know but I may be wrong
though my six intervention
be to fix the circadian rhythms or the
circadian clock if you did not notice
option like many other hormones is
released or secrete in a circadian
fashion with peaking levels between 7 to
10 a.m. and lower levels later in the
afternoon having a disturbed like dart
cycle that is being constantly exposed
to bright light at night from your TV
from your phone laptop house lighting
etc effects the way of hormones are
secreted first of all exposure to light
when it's dark outside destroys
melatonin production inside your eyes
and affects your suprachiasmatic nuclei
SCN inside your brain and the
suprachiasmatic nucleus is the master
circadian regulator this is one of the
triggers for disturb hormonal signaling
growth hormone is no longer secreted as
it should be
leptin secretion is affected the softer
on secretion is also affected insulin
secretion is affected as well and I
could go on and on
now some possible fixes would be to
reduce or eliminate exposure to light at
night which many of us cannot do or
won't do you can also use blue light
blocker glasses software that filters
blue light and most especially turning
off devices when it's dark outside my
seven intervention would be lowering the
exposure to non-native EMF and EMF
stands for electromagnetic field
radiation studies are just starting to
be conducted on this topic since
electricity has only been with us for a
century and a half or so you may imagine
we're not adapted to being bombarded
with this level of radiation you may
want to check out the insightful
research that Nora Volkov from the
National Institutes of drug abuse is
conducted and has been conducting on
this now it may not seem obvious to you
but keeping your phone in your front
pocket
will affect you
sperm production fertility as well as
sperm cell motility there have been
folks out there conducting experiments
and research studies about this topic so
try to keep your phone away from your
phone
front pocket my eighth intervention
would involve no masturbation there are
a few controversial studies showing that
jerking off can negatively impact the
levels while making love and not
meaningless sex can positively affect
the levels but in a indirect fashion I
discussed about this correlation in more
detail in the book and my ninth
intervention would be would involve
alcohol consumption now you know the
saying that the dose makes the poison
even though I didn't find solid research
on this I considered that small very
decent doses of low-carb alcoholic
drinks may have positive effects on our
tea levels
I think the mechanism is more indirect
and direct same as with the no
masturbation intervention and by small
doses I mean once two glasses of red
wine or one to two spirit drinks that is
whiskey vodka or any hard alcohols once
or twice a week higher doses may not
only negatively affect your tea levels
but your overall health and well-being
and I'd recommend staying away from
mixed or sweetened alcoholic beverages
such as cocktails and/or beer please
remember that higher belly fat means
lower testosterone levels now I went
into more detail about this than I
initially purposed but I've given you a
short version or prescription for what I
do to keep my testosterone levels
constantly high from this post you
should not conclude that if you use the
same interventions and strategies that I
use you will experience the same results
because we are all genetically and most
especially epigenetically different so
you'd better test and see what works for
you
individually and if there is anything I
can help you with please don't hesitate
to send me an email or leave a reply
here I will do my best to help it
because this way indirectly I serve for
the perpetuation of our species and if
