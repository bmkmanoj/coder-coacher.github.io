to discuss about uncertainty estimation
in scikit-learn I'll keep using the code
from the previous support vector machine
videos for convenience so what do I mean
by uncertainty estimation well we know
that our classifier is able to predict
that a specific tumor sample is benign
or malignant but we want to know how
certain our classifier is with making
that choice thereby we want to make an
estimation of its uncertainty and most
classifiers in scikit-learn can do this
using two methods one of them is the
decision function and another one is
predict proba so we'll start with the
decision function here very simply put
the decision function given a point find
the distance to the separating plane or
to the separating hyperplane in this
case to our support vector machine so
the distance to our support vector
machine now let's look at the decision
function for our latest trained
algorithm for this one so let's print
the decision function is and we'll have
two new lines okay format SVM decision
function and we're going to look at it
on our X test scaled subset and we
specifically want to look at the first
20 samples so this would be for the
first 20 values on our
test subset okay now shift enter to run
this
now what does this output mean well
these represent the values for how
strongly our SVM quote-unquote believes
a certain point is one class or the
other malignant or benign here positive
values are associated with one class
while negative values are associated
with the other class more negative
values would be associated with our SV
answers confidence that the point
belongs into the negative class while
more positive or high positive values
would be associated with the algorithms
greater confidence that the point is in
the positive class so these raw values
can be quite useful however for
simplification we could just do a
boolean statement like the following so
print and we'll say
thrash hold the decision function and
again two new lines format
as the M decision function the same X
test scaled the first 20 values and the
boolean statement whether or not is a
greater than zero and this would
actually compare each each of these
values so we'll do a boolean statement
on each of these values so shift enter
to run it so like I said here we asked
if the value is greater than zero that
is if it belongs into the benign class
now our malignant and benign classes are
encoded as 0 &amp;amp; 1 0 being the malignant
and one being the benign and we could
access our classes by looking into SVM
classes so shift enter so we could see 0
&amp;amp; 1 these are the classes 0 being the
malignant and one being the benign and
this statement answers our question in a
more abstract way than this one so is
this tumor sample from the test subset
benign false is this tumor sample benign
true and so on so these are kind of just
a few ways in which the decision
function can bring more clarity into the
decision-making process of our algorithm
all right in the next video we're going
to look at the predict probe method
which is another way to deal with
uncertainty estimation in scikit-learn
