brownies so the ingredients are almond
flour some butter some walnuts to give
them a little bit of a texture an egg
erythritol and cocoa powder so the first
thing we're gonna do is to melt the
butter the stevia and the cocoa since
this is gonna be a kind of a small
recipe so it's going to yield a small
quantity of ant product we're only gonna
use 40 grams of butter about 15 grams of
erythritol and 15 grams of cocoa powder
now we're gonna melt this let's also add
a dash of salt
okay so right now it's kind of well
incorporated so we remove it from the
heat we let it sit for a while until
it's cooled a little bit then we add the
egg and stir to incorporate it alright
so one said that is well incorporated
once the egg is well incorporated we're
gonna add the almond flour and finally
we're gonna add the walnuts for texture
so let's add the almond flour not all at
once
and the rest of it and the walnuts so I
chopped the walnuts into very small
pieces now the oven is preheated at
about 180 degrees Celsius and we're
gonna turn we're gonna put this mixture
into a pan which is lined with baking
paper
and now this is going to go into the
oven at 180 degrees Celsius for about 20
to 25 minutes and 20 minutes are over so
this is what we've got let me take it
out of the pan we're gonna let it cool
down for a while now look at this
it actually slices pretty well and there
you have it all sliced you can actually
see the walnut inside I'm going to
sprinkle some unsweetened coconut flakes
on top to give it a better look done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
