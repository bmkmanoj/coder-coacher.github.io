variations of intermittent fasting and
one that doesn't seem to work so well is
one meal a day with a heavy lifting
routine in the first part of the day so
I would have my meal my big meal in the
second part of the day so in the evening
and I would actually work out around
11:00 a.m. to noon so I would keep
fasting after the workout and it doesn't
seem to work well especially if you use
like caffeine as pre-workout I know
maybe other people share the same
experience so I would say it doesn't
work well due to the fact that if you
lift heavy you're actually soliciting a
lot of from your body and you should at
least replenish or nourish your body
with some amino acids after the workout
or I know maybe none use some stimulants
like caffeine or have a small meal which
is which would be higher in protein I
know maybe I'll experiment with that in
the future but this one doesn't seem to
work well one which worked well for me
was an intermittent fasting routine of
18-6 in which I would still work out in
the morning like in the first part of
the day 11 10 11 12 p.m. 12 noon and I
would have my meal like half an hour
after and I would have like a big meal
then and another meal in a 6 hour time
frame so that would
work quite well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
