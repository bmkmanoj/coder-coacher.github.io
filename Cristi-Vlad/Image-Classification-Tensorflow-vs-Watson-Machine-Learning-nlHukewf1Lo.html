better at image recognition or image
classification is it denser flow with
its powerful support from Google or is
it IBM uses Watson supercomputer now
there are many ways to classify images
with machine learning and in this video
we're only going to test these two so
tensorflow versus IBM Watson so I'm
going to make API calls to IBM Watson
using Python obviously this requires an
internet connection and API keys and to
get your keys you can register for free
at console bluemix.net and you'll be
able to make a limited number of free
API calls every day
I think it's two hundred and fifty calls
per day which should be enough for
testing purposes as for tensorflow I
simply install the tensorflow
module for python on my Windows 10 so
this is open source and it runs locally
which means you can use it as much as
you want and the Python version that I'm
using as you can see here is 3.5 so
after you've installed tensorflow
you'll have this file called classify
image dot py and this class of our uses
a deep convolutional network called
inception which has been trained on the
image net 2012 challenge data set and it
can classify images into about 1000
classes or categories so I have three
images and this folder on my desktop
broccoli image a castle image and a swan
image and I want to classify them so I
already have things set up for this task
we're going to try to classify them
either with Watson or with tensorflow
I have an extended tutorial on visual
recognition with Watson so make sure to
check the link in the description
because I'm not going to go over these
commands here in detail but I basically
imported visual recognition from the
package I'm using prettyprint
to have a better more visible or more a
better visualization of the output and
I'm basically creating an instance where
I an instance of Watson where I log in
with my API key which is stored in
another file called keys because I want
to keep them private and for tensorflow
over here I'm just going to have to
specify the path to the image file which
would be quite simple you can explore
the code for classify image yourself to
see how it works under the hood and I'll
post the link to to it in the
description as well now let's classify
these and see which algorithm performs
better so we're going to start with with
Watson over here and first we have to
open our file so open I think it's so
it's broccoli jpg and when we're going
to open it and read binary mode okay now
I will classify will try to see what
Watson sees so let's say image CL as
equals so we're going to use our
instance to classify and we'll have our
images file to be the image and that's
it that should be it
okay so it classified it now to
visualize the output we're going to use
pretty print so we're going to pretty
print image to see LS so what's in is
eighty eight point nine percent certain
that this is broccoli okay let's see
tensorflow and like I said we only have
to specify the path to the image so I
think it's image file let's start
without quotations and it wanna throw a
bunch of messages but we're gonna ignore
those and you can see the result here so
that's a flow is 99.9% certain this is
broccoli so it's got a better
classification compared to Watson now
let's try on the what else we have in
there this one picture so we'll have to
open up this one image Swan jpg in read
binary and we're gonna do the same thing
image CLS and we're gonna pretty print
it
so it is 77.6% well actually is 97%
certain that it's about a swan now let's
see what about tensor fall so this is
Swan dot jpg
okay so tensorflow sees a black salon
but there is no Black Swan over here
actually it's kind of white it also sees
a flamingo with fifteen percent
certainty well anyway let's see our last
image the castle image or the palace or
whatever you want to call it so the same
thing we'll gonna replace here with how
did I call this what's the name so it's
castle
jpg okay
classify it and display the results so
Watson is 86.5%
this is a palace 93 percent this is a
building seventy-four percent it's a
castle so I think these are pretty good
classification scores now what about
tensor fall so the file is Castle dot
jpg
seem to be taking a while
so tensorflow is 95.4% certain this is a
castle which i think is quite accurate
more accurate than then was and over
here which only thinks which is only
seventy four point five percent certain
that this is a castle so i think both of
them did well for this one and not as
good for the swan while the broccoli was
quite easy to classify so which one of
these two would would you think is
better what would be the final decision
I personally think I don't know should
it be a final decision I think both are
good and I could see the case for using
them together or along with other
machine learning image classifiers to
get better results you don't have to be
exclusive okay that's it for this video
