email and I'll try to answer - with with
the best of my current knowledge so here
goes what's your take on those coffee
studies currently in the news given how
can seeing this Serbs sleep efficiency
and increases estrogen beyond healthy
levels and most coffee contains
aflatoxin B is this a case of hormesis
or a faked study the effect of coffee
are immediate and strong at least for
non addicts a bit too strong for me to
think it's beneficial one gets too
anxious and aggressive to think this is
healthy okay so we know that alongside
tobacco and alcohol caffeine is one of
the most used and probably one of the
most abused substances worldwide now
subjectively speaking though I put
caffeine in a different category than
the other two and it's not only for
today but caffeine has been extensively
consumed historically speaking now would
you think that a few hundred years ago
people would carefully clean and purify
caching or their coffee before consuming
it I guess we don't really know the
answer to that question but I'm inclined
to think that no now following the
rationale and applying it to the present
day I'd say that aflatoxins care is more
of a marketing gimmick to differentiate
one product from another and to provoke
some sort of Appeal now I mean you may
not be cool if you consume a banal
unlabeled coffee and I'll give you an
analogy here the same could be said for
creating consumption now creatine
monohydrate is dirt cheap and most of
the scientific research involving
creating consumption has been done on
creating monohydrate and has invariably
founded safe
or consumption but navigate to any
virtual supplement store and you can buy
dozens of brands of creating selling
different chemical formulations of it
one more sophisticated we presented to
you than the other
getting back to coffee you can get the
ultra queen toxin free mold free
everything free whatever you name it of
coffee today and there are hundreds of
them the difference compared to the
plain old coffee will probably be mostly
in your pocket now this is not to say
that some batches of coffee products
could be more contaminated than the
others but it's not like they they can
get in the market like easily and if
you're a healthy person with a healthy
lifestyle and you consume coffee in
moderation
you'd probably not be worrying too much
about this especially you know the
basics of marketing apply to human
gullibility also I would mostly ignore
what's being pushed by the media because
those in charge of making viral messages
have literally no intent in presenting
unbiased information to you and on top
of that whatever piece of data that
comes out of one research study is
rarely replicated multiple times and you
can call this a curse of modern science
now I would start paying attention when
findings have been independently
replicated for at least a few times now
that aside if you're someone who's not
able to get the benefits of caffeine
consumption simply just leave it for
others to drink it there are multiple
other legal ways to get you aroused and
focused now personally I enjoy consuming
coffee there are times when I cycle it
temporarily or completely with some or
no consumption of decaffeinated coffee
meanwhile I've experimented with
tolerance build-up Andry sensitization
for caffeine as I learned more about
physiologic stressors and adaptation and
currently I'm still trying to figure out
whether or not I'm more on the positive
side than on the negative side with my
caffeine consumption so I guess I share
your uncertainty about this anyway I
guess that's it for this video if you
