we have a working app let's at a bit of
aesthetics to it to make it more
good-looking so to speak so what do I
have in mind okay so this is the current
version of the app over here on top and
this is what I have in mind the main
differences are this speak button as you
can see this one uses a custom image the
background color of the entry field as
well as the font and the text size in
the entry field so let me show you say I
won't testing over here
I won't testing as you can see they are
different okay so now let's work on the
code for this one to make it look like
to actually transform it in this one
let's close this first we're gonna
disallow the resizing of the app we do
this by using the resizable
functionality of TK enter so place it
just below the root over here so it's
root resizable zero zero this prevents
the the main window application to be
resized then to use a custom image for
the speak button we'll first have to run
our custom image through the photo image
functionality of decay enter so just
below the tunnel we'll do image is and
the path to the image in my case
see users desktop my username desktop
and the name of the image file is speak
yeah that's the one
alright okay this doesn't actually
change the button we have to work inside
the definition of all of our button to
change how it looks so over here first
since we don't have it display on it
that's for just delete this and we'll
have image the image that's gonna
replace the text or the image that's
gonna be used by the button is marked
image and we also have will also do a
border of zero and an over relief with
the value of sunken okay these these two
options add some effect the way the
button acts and responds so now the last
GUI aspect that will we want to modify
is within the entry field
we'll add background color and a
different font and font size so after
the wrapping around the word we'll do
background equals and I already have the
hex code color written down as a six
f-4e seven and also the font that's
gonna be called Vatika hold very kawaii
alright so that should do it
let's save this and run it hit f5 ok
over relief something is wrong here
ok so actually the theme the DK doesn't
have the over relief option so we'll
have to modify the text by having it
used the native TK not the thing with TK
so let's try it one more time
okay well the button doesn't show up
which is not good
another mistake is over here it's
actually you have to specify the the
file option to add the path let's try it
one more time okay so seems to be
alright for now but let's test it and
make sure it actually works
let's grab some text from my blog over
here control C control V and click the
speak button
I decided to make an animated review of
the first section of Tim Ferriss book
tools of titans alright so a few
careless mistakes but it seems that it
works and as it is right now you can
find a github link to the code and the
image for the button in the description
