theory about denser flow let's see how
this library works in practice
so we're gonna do this in a jupiter
notebook and first we're gonna import
the answer flow as DF and what we're
about to do is to write the HelloWorld
program like it's used to whenever
you're learning a new language
now even though denser flow is not a
language in itself
I've seen many educators do this for
their students so we'll do that as well
even though this might seem by now
writing hello world intensive flow will
introduce you to many important elements
of this library first what we have to do
to write the hello world is to define
two variables or two constants in this
case and join them together to print the
hello world message so let's do it in
another cell here so we'll just say a
equals TF constant hello and B is gonna
be TF constant not concat constant world
notice this space over here
okay now simple enough right so C is
gonna be a plus B you could now say that
this is not too different from Python
aside of how we define these constants
so instead of just saying a equals hello
and B equals world we set a equals TF
constant so we access the constant
method and tensorflow
but it is different because if you try
printing C here's what you get so let's
say print C
remember from the previous tutorial that
we define tensorflow as being a
framework so a framework based on data
flow graphs so this is exactly what it's
doing here first in tensor flow first we
define the variables or constants and
the operations and then we execute them
so in this case C equals a plus B is in
doing the operation itself but it adds
it to the computational graph and to run
the operation we will execute it in a
session so to do that we'll just say
with DF session as success so with this
one line we're basically instantiating a
tensorflow session as a SAS variable and
we'll just going to say run up so from
run operation says run C so this will
run our C a equals C equals a plus B and
then we could just simply print run off
run off okay so now this is the result
we want so hello world now as you can
see there is a big difference on how
things are working in terms of flow
compared to simply doing some operations
in plain Python like I've said you first
have the variables constants operations
etc defined for your computational graph
and then you would run them within a
session doing this brings a whole level
of efficiency to the process so once
again with tensor flow we first
construct the graph and then we executed
within a session oh yeah
another thing instead of C equals a plus
B here we could do things to be more
tensorflow ish if I can put it that
way so we could just say C equals D F
add a and B and then we could rerun this
whole thing again so with TF session as
SAS run up equals SAS run C and then
print run up okay and we actually have
the same result now aside of adding
things we can perform many more types of
operations and not just simple
operations like addition subtraction
division multiplication logarithms
Exponential's etc which are element wise
math operations but also operations on
arrays and matrices which are very which
are very often used in constructing
neural networks as well as more special
methods for operating on neural networks
so here we don't have to actually write
the whole sigmoid function from scratch
because we have a method and we can just
call the sigmoid or the rail you or we
can even do convolutions on neural
networks and there are many more
operations aside of these mentioned here
now for the sake of exemplification
let's do a matrix multiplication and in
this case we'll use 3-dimensional
tensors according to the official
documentation so let's just say matrix a
equals DF constant it's gonna be and B
numpy so since we're using numpy we're
gonna have to import numpy as MP and run
it so it's gonna be NP a range
from 1 to 12 and the data type is gonna
be NP it's gonna be an integer and we'll
give it a shape so we're already using
one of these operations so it's gonna be
a shape of 2 to 3 and we're gonna have a
mat B D F constant and B a range from
let's say 12 to 24 and the data type is
gonna be and be integer 32 and the shape
is gonna be 2 3 2 okay now we're gonna
multiply them so let's say Mall C equals
TF mat mall so we're using another
operation mat mall mat a and mat B and
again we'll also have to create a
session so let's say with DF session as
SAS run up equals SAS run mole C and
then we're basically gonna print the
result most often they're not we're
gonna close the session after we run it
so we're just gonna call SAS close but
we will see we'll see how we do this in
a in a more advanced example in a future
video because we can just run the
session here and it's not gonna cause as
many it's not gonna cause any problem
because it these are simple operations
so print run off and that's how matrix
multiplication is done in tensorflow
okay let's stop here for now
in the next video we're gonna this
a bit about the computational graph
about placeholders operations and
sessions after which like I said we'll
do an implementation of the EM nest
dataset for recognizing handwritten
digits we worked with Amnesty in a
previous tutorial but with another
machine learning library not with tensor
flow okay so if you enjoyed this video
