physiological applications that occur
when following an intermittent fasting
routine for a certain period of time so
why do i say potential well because i
don't think there's enough good evidence
to make solid claims about it so when
you do intermittent fasting routinely
and rigorously for a few weeks and you
fast for at least 16 hours a day there
are some metabolic and hormonal changes
that may take place inside your body
here's my rationale so as your blood
glucose levels decrease several hours
into the fasting window insulin
production will decrease as well lower
insulin and higher glucagon levels allow
or permit triglyceride hydrolysis in the
adipocyte the fatty acid oxidation
increases is not from glucose energy has
to come from somewhere so lower insulin
and an ongoing oxidation of fatty acids
may reduce hunger why well first of all
this may promote ketogenesis or the
production of ketone bodies and when
your brain can primarily use ketones for
energy instead of glucose there's
reduced panic or hunger meaning that
there is no urgency for for glucose
gluconeogenesis can satisfy most of the
needs anyway this may not happen if you
do intermittent fasting with a
high-carbohydrate diet because you may
not reach glycogen depletion during your
fasting widow to keep boost ketogenesis
plus what I'm saying here are mere
assumptions with some scientific support
moving on some other claims adaptations
of AF includes substantial increasing
growth hormone levels even up to 20 fold
I have not seen replication of this but
if you know of any be sure to leave a
comment below linking to the study
higher growth hormone levels may be
beneficial in some situations
additionally igf-1 which is another
growth factor is reduced with is igf-1
is tissue-specific so situationally it
may be good to have it higher like for
muscle protein synthesis or having lower
and circumstances of cancerous tumors
this is also the case for m4 which is
another growth factor that is
characteristic of cell proliferation it
is thought to be reduced with
intermittent fasting and with with
prolonged fasting as well moving on
gralen is a hormone released near
mealtime which increases your appetite
and prepares your body for taking in
food its secretion goes down after you
eat if you practice I am and have your
feeding window around the same times
every day grayling will likely increase
near your meals so for example if I fast
for 20 hours and I only eat within a
four hour timeframe say beef between
three to seven pm grayling is likely to
be secreted around those hours to
increase my appetite and prepare my body
for food intake lower grayling levels
outside of this window that is during
the fasting window may add two other
appetite suppressing factors that occur
when adapting to is to be honest in my
case I'm mostly never hungry but I seem
to have a little spike in
appetite right before my first meal
anyway there are other factors
contributing to the physiologic
adaptations to intermittent fasting
these include leptin CC k or
cholecystokinin pomc or pro Opio milano
Courtin these are just the name of you
but to keep the video short and straight
to the point I'll stop here so that's
kind of it for for the video if you
enjoyed it please give me a thumbs up
and subscribe thank you for watching and
I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
