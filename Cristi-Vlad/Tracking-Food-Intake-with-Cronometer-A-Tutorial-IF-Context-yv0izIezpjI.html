of the tools that I use to track my food
intake it is called chronometer and it
is a web-based application with a lot of
user-friendly features for life logging
purposes you cannot only use it to check
your food but also to track your
exercise routines though for that
purpose I use another tool you can use
it to enter notes to track water coffee
and alcohol intake to track your weight
and it has many other features there is
also the smartphone app version of
chronometer which is available for both
iPhone and Android users I have the
android version but I mostly use the web
version the link for this application is
in the transcript now here's how you can
use it in rectangle number one which I
highlighted in red you have the option
to add food when you click on that you
will be given a list of thousands of
foods and products that you can add when
you click on one particular food item it
will give you a short description of its
caloric and macro nutrient content you
will be able to add the serving size
they're all simple foods are found in
the table most packaged foods are also
found here now if there is a packaged
food that you consume and you cannot
find it in the list you can simply add
it permanently to the list to do this
close the add food menu and go to the
upper part of the website where it says
food and use the option to create new
food to enter the caloric content and
macros for your new food please look at
the labels of that food but in most
cases you will not have to do that the
database of this app is very inclusive
you can see the entries
I made for this example now in the red
rectangle number two you have the option
to add your workouts like in the example
with food if there is an activity you
cannot find in the list you can simply
use the custom section to add it to know
how many calories your custom exercise
will burn in a specific amount of time
you can simply do a web search you can
see that for this example I created a
custom exercise entry called gym where I
burn approximately 400 calories for my
60 minutes section I do not necessarily
have to burn all those calories in 60
minutes heavy lifting workouts may
increase your metabolism for up to 48
hours after completion so I may be
burning more than 400 calories as a
result of my work out moving on to the
red rectangle number three you have the
option to add biometric measurements you
can track your height weight blood
glucose levels body fat waist size total
cholesterol low density lipoprotein
cholesterol that is LVL see HDL and even
ketones I only use this feature to track
my weight though but the availability of
options makes it so convenient moving on
to the red rectangle number 4 here you
have the option to add notes to your
daily log I recommend using this feature
it helps you really quantify your life
and it's very useful and insightful when
you revisit your notes at a future time
I personally use this section to track
my supplements intake but supplements
can also be added through the add food
option it may be better to track your
supplements with the add food option
because this way you include them in
your max
nutrient and micronutrient analysis for
that specific day but for me I simply
got used to adding my supplements as
nodes the fifth red rectangle is one of
the Settings button I mostly use this to
copy entire days of logs it's convenient
for me to do so because there are many
days when I eat basically the same foods
and I have the same entries so I would
not have to add them manually it saves
me time I have to tell you that I do not
track my intake of water coffee alcohol
and other beverages I just add a note
entry whenever I consume something
different than water for example when I
consume two glasses of red wine I just
add a note entry of two glasses of wine
at night six hours post mail I could
also add this through the ad foods
option but once again I got used to
adding it as note right below your entry
list you have a summary of your calories
and macros you can set daily target that
is goals for each of these groups before
below that you have a more in-depth
analysis of the macro nutrients vitamins
and minerals you consumed with your food
clicking on a specific food entry in
your list will give you the in-depth
analysis of that food
the calendar on the right and also the
way to change progression truck right
below are two important features to
consider this web or smartphone
application has much more attached to it
that I can describe here I also pointed
out to you some of its most basic
features and all of them are available
with the free version like I said
there's also the paid version which
gives you some more options and features
the major advantage to the paid version
is that it gives you access to the full
history of your entries with which you
can do many types of data analyses I
believe the price for the base version
is approximately five dollars per month
anyway you will do just fine with the
free version only and i'll let you
reserve the privilege of discovering the
rest of the features of this app for
yourself another very similar
application if you don't want to use
chronometer is my fitness pal you have
the link to this application in the
transcript many people use my fitness
pal it's probably the most popular food
tracking application chronometer is not
as popular but I got used to it which is
why I'm describing it here now in our
next lecture I will review the three
most use methods for tracking ketone
levels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
