this strategy called car back loading or
carbohydrate backloading and I decided
to share and extend my response by a
video so the initial question goes
something like this
I wonder what you think of carb nite and
CBL protocols any suggested
modifications well not knowing about the
specifics of these protocols I asked for
further clarifications so I got this
back standard CBL is based on late
afternoon or evening workouts so that
the carb loading meal is shortly after
the workout and not too long before
sleep both good times for cards now in
my translation and after a little
superficial web search on this CBL so
you're consuming high carbohydrate meals
and the later part of the day after a
mid to late afternoon training so for
the first part of the day you consume
very little carbohydrates then you
workout say after 3 p.m. and then you
have higher carbs for the rest of the
day makes sense
ok now the person who send me the email
said that their schedule doesn't allow
for later in the day workouts and ask
what is the best time for carb loading
on a morning workout schedule after the
workout before bath time now the
motivation that's put behind this CBL is
that raising insulin in the morning by
he eating god forbid more than 30 grams
of carbs will seriously impair the
ability
of your body to burn fat for the rest of
the day and that you will get fatter
because higher cortisol secretion
combined with higher insulin secretion
promotes fat storage now that's a very
scare mongering or fear-mongering tactic
if you ask me but it doesn't surprise me
anyway to extend my answer it may be
more efficient in terms of absorption to
kind of have higher carbohydrate
consumption post-workout if your workout
is earlier in the day and your circadian
rhythms are not disrupted by like
erratic or abnormal sleep-wake cycles it
is likely that you are indeed more
insulin sensitive in the first part of
the day and until later afternoon so
kind of the peak insulin secretion is
between or until later afternoon so
timing your carbohydrates around your
workout can be a good thing however
making some claims saying that you will
get fat because of insulin and cortisol
is inappropriate signaling if you do not
stick to a rigid fixated protocol kind
of renders little trust if you ask me
and if we talk about healthy people it
kind of really is not that important if
overall you're consistent with a good
diet which is sufficient in vegetables
fruits and adequate protein and some
healthy fats if your workout and if your
sleep are are good now these are likely
to get you more more than 95
and of the way and are likely to keep
you on track with good health much of
the rest is kind of marketing alright
