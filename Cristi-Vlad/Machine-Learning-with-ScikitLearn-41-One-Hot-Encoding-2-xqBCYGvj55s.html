data let's separate the features from
the labels and training machine learning
algorithm on it so in the previous
tutorial I said we're going to convert
this data frame into numpy arrays onto
that so let's say features is going to
be data dummies I X and X everything and
columns age up to occupation underscore
transport moving so this one here okay
and we're going to extract the array so
first for the features X equals features
values and for the labels is going to be
data dummies and the column income this
one income underscore greater than 50k
and the values for this one as well so
that's kind of all we have to do before
feeding the data to a machine learning
algorithm in scikit-learn so next we're
gonna pick up a psychic learning
algorithm that we're gonna train on this
data so we're gonna train a logistic
regression or a logistic regression
algorithm on it first we'll do the
imports so from SK learned linear model
linear model import logistic regression
okay and from SK learn model selection
we're gonna import train tests split to
split the data and then we're gonna
split the data so X train X test y train
white test why do you want to train so
train dust split we're gonna use X Y so
the features and the labels and a random
state of zero for reproducibility
purposes now we're going to instantiate
our logistic regression so let's say log
rank is logistic regression all the
default parameters now we're gonna fit
it on to our data so let's call the fit
method so X train we're gonna fit it on
to our training data so X train white
train and ultimately we're gonna print
logistic regression score on the test
set is let's say two floating points
format log rank score on the test and
the white test
okay now let's run this and we have a
score of 81 percent on the test set
which I'd say is decent to say the least
given the amount of pre-processing we've
done okay now moving on in the next
video we're gonna look at a method of
feature engineering more specifically
feature selection so please hit the like
button and subscribe if you enjoy the
video and you want to follow along thank
you for watching and I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
