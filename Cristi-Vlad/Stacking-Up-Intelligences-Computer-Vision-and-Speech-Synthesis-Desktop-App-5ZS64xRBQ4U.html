application I made it's a GUI
application in Python and it combines
two forms of artificial intelligence
computer vision and speech synthesis for
both of these I'm using pre-configured
models or algorithms by making API calls
to their surfaces for computer vision
I'm using the Watsons is powerful visual
recognition API and for speech synthesis
I'm using ivona API which is going to be
included in the Amazon poly beginning
next month so it's being discontinued as
iPhone app but you can still use it if
you have API credentials at the moment
when this field is uploaded both of
these services have three tiers which is
what I'm using and as with most api is
you have to register for free to get
your api credentials and i'll provide
links to them in the description now
about the application what to do as you
can see it maintains a minimal design
and if you've been watching my videos
you know I like to keep things quite
simple in short it takes an image URL as
input
it applies visual recognition and then
it speaks using the natural sounding
ivona
what it sees now we're going to do a
quick demo here and then I'll later
publish and explain the code line by
line on my blog and also on github where
you could fork it and modify to your own
preference so let's go to Google Images
and search for a picture let's say
conveyor belt
grab this one I'm going to copy its
location paste it over here and then do
recognize there is a 93% chance you're
looking at conveyor belt okay let's try
another one
so cruise ship I could definitely use a
vacation right now let's take this one
copy image location and then paste it
over here and then recognize there is a
90% chance you're looking at passenger
ship alright so please keep in mind that
this is extremely minimalistic and there
are unlimited number of functionalities
and features that can be added to it I
could instead have to take a bunch of
pictures from local storage and input
like having them as input and classify
them into categories then organize them
into folders I could also do the same
thing with images from the internet
anyway the purpose of this video was to
provide a quick demo of the application
and I'll have the explanation post and
the code up soon so stay tuned for that
and if you like this video please hit

you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
