asking about coffee intake my coffee
intake and intermittent fasting in short
and as a separate 2017 I usually drink
black coffee and sometimes I put a
stevia pill in it which is non-caloric i
SAT for about 20 to 21 hours and I have
most of my coffee intake in the fasting
window do I put oil butter or other fats
in my coffee no i don't i did that a few
times some years ago but i didn't stick
to it first of all because i wanted to
lose fat and I wanted to compensate with
my own body fat for the calories that
are restricted added fat especially in
my coffee made no sense if I want to
lose fat used in ketosis the requirement
is to appropriately select carbohydrates
so I don't need to eat fat to be in
ketosis open up a bio chemistry textbook
if you want to know more second of all
when i started doing intermittent
fasting it made more sense to me to try
to have my coffee as simple as possible
anything of caloric significance would
break my fast i thought what if I mad
maintenance or I want to gain body
weight well it could make sense to try
to be in a court surplus by adding fat
here and there even in my coffee but I
would still not do it because I drink
most of my coffee in the fasted state
and it would break my fast plus I'd
rather compensate for a caloric surplus
with nutrient-rich foods that would
provide additional vitamins minerals and
phytochemicals
to my diet instead of adding fat which
is least likely to provide those
benefits that said sometimes I put milk
in my coffee about an ounce or so which
is very little i usually do this near my
feeding window so it would minimally
interfere with the fast more importantly
I like the taste of coffee when it's as
simple as possible with almost nothing
in it will I change this in the future I
don't know I always try to experiment
with new strategies so I don't know okay
