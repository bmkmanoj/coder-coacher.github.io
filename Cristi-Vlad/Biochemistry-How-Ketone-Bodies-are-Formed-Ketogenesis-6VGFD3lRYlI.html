bodies are produced in the liver
according to lavenders principles of
biochemistry textbook the sixth edition
so recall from a previous video that
there are three ketone bodies acetone
acetoacetate and delta beta hydroxy
butyrate or beta hydroxy butyrate their
production occurs in the liver acetone
is decarboxylated and does not
contribute to energy metabolism
acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate
can serve as energy substrates in extra
hepatic tissues by being oxidized to
acetyl co a so let's see how ketogenesis
occurs or how ketone bodies are created
the first step is when two acetyl co a
molecules condense to form acetyl acetyl
co a and this direction is catalyzed by
thiolase
so i said that ketogenesis occurs in the
liver but to be more specific it takes
place in the mitochondrial matrix of
hepatocytes or live ourselves in step
two acetyl acetyl co a condenses with
acetyl co a and leads to the formation
of hmg-coa and this reaction is
catalyzed by hmg-coa synthase then
hmg-coa is acted upon hmg-coa lyase and
this leads to the elaboration or
formation of zero acetate and acetyl co
a so we have our ketone acetyl acetate
which can decarboxylate into acetone or
it can be reversibly reduced to delta
beta hydroxy butyrate by Delta beta
hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase so beta
hydroxy butyrate or Delta beta hydroxy
butyrate to tell its full name can
travel to extra organic tissues like the
brain
or the muscles or the heart etc where it
is converted back or oxidized to acetyl
acetate by the same enzyme delta beta
hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase acetyl
acetate can then be activated to its go
away after so the zero was heat Alcoa in
a reaction catalyzed by silo forays one
to zero acetyl co a is formed it can be
cleaved by sideways to form two acetyl
co ways which can then enter the krebs
cycle for energy production notice how
it all starts and ends with acetyl co
way I could get philosophical here but
let's not divert from the main point
alright so that's it for ketogenesis I
