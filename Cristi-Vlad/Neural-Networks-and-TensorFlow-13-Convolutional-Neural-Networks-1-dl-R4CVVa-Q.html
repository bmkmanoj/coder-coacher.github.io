convolutional neural networks these
types of networks have become very
popular in the recent years probably
because of cheap computational power and
their broad applicability in computer
vision and all all related fields since
we're talking about computer vision
these types of networks are very
efficient at taking image and video
input and they are different from simple
feed-forward nets which we've discussed
in the previous videos well how are they
different
first they are similar or they are alike
and the fact that they contain inputs
hidden layers and outputs what makes
them different is the hidden layers
which typically so these hidden layers
typically consist of convolutions fully
connected layers pooling layers as well
as normalization layers just to name a
few here we're not going to insist too
much on the theory but we're going to
focus more on implementation now in the
description of this video I'll link one
of the most popular courses of on cnn's
from stanford university so it's cs2 3
1m and the lectures are freely available
on youtube and the materials on their
website so make sure to check them out
if you want to dive deep into the
mathematics of cnn's also a very
insightful course on convolutional
neural network is Professor Andrew in
this fourth course in the deep learning
specialization at Coursera now
personally I learned a lot from this
course especially when it comes to
convolutions filters padding stride as
well as how the information flows within
Network what I enjoy most was or were
the projects because we had to work on
these notebooks and the browsers so in
the browser to build cnn's for different
purposes what's funny to me is that
Professor Inc has something about cats
since they appear a lot in the materials
anyway not to diverge in our previous
lesson we've implemented softmax
regression on the amnesty data set so we
used a simple neural network now here
we're going to work on the MS dataset
for handwriting recognition but this
time from the perspective of a
convolutional neural network and since
we're using tensorflow
our job is going to be very much
simplified tensorflow in itself has some
implemented methods for applying
convolution between layers libraries
built on top of tensorflow
make implementation even easier so you
don't have to build the architecture of
the network from scratch unless you want
to do that to better understand how
things work on the fundamental level but
I guess you won't be doing too much of
that in your projects because you'll
probably focus more on the purpose of
your project like for example when
building a facial recognition model
you'll be focusing more on the data at
hand and designing the neural network by
piecing together building blocks and
operations and not by creating the
building blocks and defining de the
operations from scratch because that
would take too much time it would
probably be unnecessary most of the time
and it would beat the purpose okay so in
convolutional neural networks the hidden
layers are connected to each other by
convolution operations now in tensorflow
you you'd be using for example the TF
and then come to the method for
computing a 2d convolution given a 4d
input and other parameters so let's say
we're gonna take this example from the
textbook which I linked in the
description so TF n and come to the XW
the strikes and the panning so X is the
input like an image for example and W is
a filter in this case and then you have
the strides and the padding's so simple
as that so for our Emnes data set for
example X is going to be of shape non
28:28 one okay so none means that we can
have as many samples as we want then 28
by 28 is the size of the image and 1 is
the color channel so these are great
images so it's gonna have one color
channel now W our filter our so this is
the filter or the weights so this is
gonna be of shape 5 5 1 32 meaning that
we have a 5 by 5 filter one channel for
our gray images and 32 for the feature
map meaning that we have 32 sets of
weights for the convolutional layer now
the strides here control how the or the
stripe controls how the filter W moves
across the image so here it simply means
that the filter is applied in intervals
of 1 pixel for each dimension right and
as for the padding the same padding
means that the borders of our input
image are bad so that the sides of the
result of our convolution operation is
the same as the size of of the input
okay now that was a lot in one sitting
so we'll stop here in our next lesson
we're going to discuss about activations
pooling dropout and we might probably
start implementing the model itself that
