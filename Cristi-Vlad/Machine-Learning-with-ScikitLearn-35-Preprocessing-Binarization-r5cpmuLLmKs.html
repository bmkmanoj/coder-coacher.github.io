discuss and Perkis some pre-processing
methods for machine learning but before
we kick in with the first method what do
I mean when I say pre-processing well in
machine learning we feed data to
algorithms and depending on the type of
our project and the type of learning we
use that is supervised and supervised
reinforced we expect or look for
different objectives invariably however
data must be fed in in a specific format
in the real world more often than not
raw data is uncleaned and unprocessed
and actually have to prepare the data we
need converted in one word we have to
pre processes before feeding it to a
machine learning algorithm and this can
be a laborious and time-consuming
process but we need to make sure the
data is pretty processed appropriately
otherwise the training of our algorithm
might not be done successfully I guess
you know the saying get junkie and junk
out and in this case it would be junk
data in worthless algorithm out so
depending on the data the scope of the
project and other variables
pre-processing methods could include
binarization scaling normalization mean
removal etc and today we're going to
start with one of the simplest which is
binarization as a side note I'll be
working through and with another book
alongside the to machine learning books
that we've been getting inspiration from
so far and this new book is on
artificial intelligence with Python and
you can find the links for all of these
three books in the description of this
video now back to binarization let's
work through a specific example because
this is how you understand
everything better so from a scale earn
will import pre-processing and will also
import numpy as NP then we'll just
create some fake data here so let's say
data is NP array so we'll have a 3x3
matrix let's say two point two five
point nine minus one point eight another
five point four minus three point two
minus five point one let's make it look
pretty okay and the last one minus one
point nine four point two and let's say
three point two okay so in binarize in
this data will basically turn the
numerical values into boolean or' and
into ones and zeros but first we need to
set it threshold and let's say our
threshold in this case would be a one
point five for example and whatever is
going to be below 1.5 will be turned
into zero or false and whatever value is
above is going to be converted into one
or two but let me just run this cell
first to make sure everything is okay so
shift enter okay so now let's binarize
the data so then data is pre-processing
binarize err and we'll set our threshold
to one point five transform transform
our data
okay and now we'll just print what we've
pre-processed here so we'll simply say
print binarized data we'll create two
new lines then data now shift enter to
run this okay so as I said whatever
value is above 1.5 is turned into one
and whatever value is below our
threshold is turned into zeros so 2.2 is
greater so it's going to be one five
point nine one minus one point eight is
smaller so it's going to be zero and so
on and so forth
so this is actually binarization and
maybe this example was not the most
assertive but think for example about
the cancer data set we've worked with so
far in previous tutorials say we use the
unprocessed data set where the column
for the type of tumor has values
let's save em for malignant and B for
benign a type of pre-processing in this
case would be to set all the malignant
values to zero and all the benign values
to one and only thereafter feed the data
to the algorithm now many algorithms of
machine learning would work better with
numeric values and/or with boolean x'
instead of strings or words
interconversion or converting the data
back and forth into numerical and non
numerical values can be done at many
steps during the process and I think a
skillful practitioner should know the
appropriate timing of this anyway this
is it for binarization
as you can see it's a relatively simple
pre-processing method that may enable a
better and more efficient usage of the
data and machine learning projects in
the next video we'll get into another
method of pre-processing thank you for
