quick update on my voice search bot
coded in Python if you didn't see my
last video please go and check it out
that video I talked about the first
version I present the first version of
the code which is basically 60 lines and
it responds to only two commands that is
search for and stop listening that
version uses Microsoft sappy for speech
synthesis and the code is quite slow and
makes it impractical but it's and it was
the minimum viable version so like a
Minimum Viable Product so I had to post
it so that I would have something to
work on
now this version one point one point two
is about 370 lines of code
I changed the speech synthesis engine to
ivona which sounds quite natural you'll
see about it in a minute I was able to
restructure the code and this this had
led to major improvements in speed and
right now it's quite it's quite
efficient quite convenient to work with
I edit quite a few functions so
analogous ponds to a lot of personalized
commands it can update my stuff save
things to cloud you'll see about it in a
minute it also responds to different
general knowledge questions by working
with different api's so right now I
still have to work on
the fact that it freezes from time to
time I was able to attest it for I
tested it for like 40 to 50 minutes and
it worked without crashes but there were
a few times when it froze after a couple
of minutes so I have a few suspicions it
could be because of hardware issues um
the microphone I guess it could also be
because of communication with Google's
is API or I don't know I have to keep
investigating and see why it is crashing
so anyway I'll work on that right now
let's see what's what's in the current
version hello for a list of commands
please say keyword list search for books
on big performance Google results for
books on peak performance who was George
Orwell
Aric Arthur Blair the 25th of June 1903
the 21st of January 1950 who used the
pen name George Orwell was an English

how long did George were well the answer
is 46 years 6 months 26 days what is the
distance between Mars and Saturn Google
results for the distance between Mars
and Saturn
what is the value of the force of
gravity on earth
the answer is gravitational force five
hundred and eighty nine point nine n
Newtons equals one hundred thirty two
point six lbf pounds force equals zero
point five eight nine nine kilonewtons
kilonewtons how many grams of
carbohydrates are in 100 grams of cheese
the answer is 3.6 grams carry two grams
squared how many grams of carbohydrates
are in cheese how many grams of
carbohydrates are in cheese the answer
is 1.1 grams update my list mail list is
updated read this test other biases may
provide rationale behind personal
development bevel one of them the focus
of this write-up is the priming effect
it caught my interest and it made me
read a few scientific papers about it
over the last few decades the priming
effect has received a cocktail of
appraisal and criticism on behalf of the
research community save this text
