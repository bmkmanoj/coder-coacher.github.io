following how long it would take and at
what level of glucose ingestion would
one eventually lose the enzymatic Kido
adaptation and D the answer is by no
means simple or short but I'll try to
give some thoughts here I've looked into
a few studies randomly cherry-picked
from google scholar and you can find
them in the description of this video a
general idea of what I got is that it
can take a lot of time for optimal
adaptation to an increase metabolism of
fatty acids to support ketosis a period
that goes well beyond two weeks which is
often implemented in many studies of
ketogenic diets now sustain higher fatty
acid metabolism may involve the
upregulation of transcription factors
and enzymes to support it additionally
if you consider exercise so this would
happen in healthy people at normal
weights in athletes for example there
are also intramuscular enzyme
adaptations to ketogenic diets provided
that these diets are follows strictly
over the long term however if so if
these diets are sustained I suspected
there are many more systemic so this is
at the whole organism adaptations to
support the use of the fuel that's most
abundant and that fat in this case and
also to possibly down regulate
glycolytic metabolism with many of its
aspects I suggest spending time looking
into this study on how lie pollicis is
regulated in the adipocyte
like I said the answer for the question
so how long would it take tools and the
Medicaid Oh adaptation is unsurprisingly
complex since the human body is highly
adaptable now I'd suspected following a
strict diet on other side of the
macronutrient spectrum so I'm talking
about oxidizable fuel here so either a
high-carb low-fat very low fat diet or a
low carb ketosis promoting diet you may
be well adapted to oxidizing the fuel
that you're providing and you would also
be kind of metabolically inflexible by
definition which can be good or bad
depending on the context now to get back
to the idea of losing a long term
adaptation to ketosis I think that it
would require much more than a high carb
cheat meal here and there or even every
once in a while provided at your katonic
for most of the time I don't want to be
more specific because to be honest it
would be difficult to exactly quantify
in terms of grams of glucose and the
frequency of ingestion required to lose
the enzymatic and metabolic support for
ketosis so I guess I'll leave some room
for interpretation and most importantly
for a personal experimentation here and
