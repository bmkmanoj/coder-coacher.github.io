what are some negative consequences
associated with bad or poor asleep here
i will discuss historical examples of
sleep disturbance in extreme
environments as they have been presented
by emma barrette in her amazing book
called extreme why some people thrive at
the limits sleep loss may be acute as in
a single episode of staying awake for
many hours or chronic as in repeatedly
gagging only a few hours of for quality
sleep every day either way that sleep
has corrosive effects on mental and
physical well-being it undermines the
ability to make good decisions and
perform critical tasks which makes it
dangerous as well as unpleasant and if
quote let's look at a few examples
astronauts in orbit experience 16
sunrises every 24 hours you'd imagine
that there's Arcadian prisons are quite
disturbed hence their sleep is too in
one of captain's causes expeditions to
the Antarctic the crew was exposed to
heavy demands of work often going from
five in the morning until midnight their
fatigue was such that if they sat down
even for a few moments they immediately
fell asleep end of quote in harsh
environments sleep can be disturbed by a
multitude of factors including heavy
work unusual working hours cold heat
altitude noise and humidity moreover
some situations imply sleeping in odd
positions or in the close proximity to
other people the members of Shackleton's
is 1908 Antarctic expeditions slept in
specially designed three men sleeping
bags which meant that each time one man
moved the other two
were disturbed and of quote I remember
one time during my mid-teens when we
went to this two-day trip and I had to
sleep with two friends in a tiny bad I
could say we were privileged because in
the entire room there were like 15
people we tried to sleep but it was
impossible I don't want to imagine what
it's like to be sleep disturbed in an
extreme environment moving on what about
life at sea the travel writer Eric new
be recalled his deep fatigue during a
long sea voyage in 1938 I had never been
so tired in my whole life he wrote far
too exhausted to appreciate the
beautiful pyramids of sale towering
above me in the watch below I would fall
into a dreamless sleep so profound that
for the first hour of our next watch on
deck it would be like a somnambulant but
without the happy facility of avoiding
obstacles when the ship was hit by a
massive storm the sailors were not on
watch were so tired that they slept
through it even though their compartment
was inches deep in water so you can
imagine how important sleep must be if
your body ignores the outside world in
such situations of prominent danger in
another historical recollection emma
refers to the participants of a
transatlantic yokte competition from the
1972 who were studied by psychiatrist
Glenn Bennett unsurprisingly he found
that they all suffered from extreme
tiredness which they variously like him
to be being drunk high or simultaneously
asleep and awake one solo sailor managed
to wake himself every half hour day and
night for 38 days and if quote
these sailors made a lot of minor and
some not so minor mistakes one of them
leading to a collision they experience
vivid dreams and they hallucinate it
frequently so I come to ask what is it
with sleep that makes it such an
integral part of our existence what do
you think what are you supposed let's
share some interesting theories and
arguments in the comments below and if
