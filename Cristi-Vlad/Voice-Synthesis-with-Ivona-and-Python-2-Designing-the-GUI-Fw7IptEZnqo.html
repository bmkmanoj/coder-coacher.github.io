a showcase for the voice synthesis app
we're gonna create so make sure to check
it out if you want to follow along with
coding you have to register for free
with iPhone which only takes a couple of
minutes to get your API keys so that you
can make calls from within Python so
let's start coding we want to import
everything from TK enter and we also
specifically one import ttk so from TK
enter import t TK we import scroll text
so take a enter anymore scrolled text
and we're gonna import thread from
threading we import by vona
this is a package that you have to
install so make sure to check the first
video to see the prerequisites and from
the last one is from keys we're gonna
import everything once again you will
understand this better when when we get
to that point now let's create our GUI
and we do this as you might already know
what is DK all right we'll give route a
China
which is let's say I've owned a speech
synthesiser speech alright we're gonna
create two functions so define call back
alright and this is where I've Ono will
speak from just putting the placeholder
here and let it pass we're gonna create
another function or reading so we're
gonna use threading so that our main app
will not freeze while it's speaking the
text we gave it as input you'll see when
when we get to that point so there's not
freeze this is also gonna pass for now
and to design our buoy it's gonna be
quite minimalistic same as the universal
search engine that created that we
created in a previous series so we're
gonna have an entry field which is gonna
be scrolled text scrolled so capital
pass capital T we're gonna attach it to
the route application we're gonna give
it a width of 30 and the type of flat
say 10 and we're going to wrap around
word so wrapping is gonna be done around
word now using the grid geometry man
we're gonna place this 0-0 okay the
second thing that we want to do is
design a button which is gonna be from
the themed TK button we're gonna attach
it to the route we're gonna have a
display speak alright and we're gonna
have it work with the command threading
so whenever we click the button it's
gonna do whatever it's inside the
threading function we're also gonna use
the grit geometry manager to put buttons
on row 0 column one row 0 column 1 and
we'll stick it to the north of its
location I'm gonna show you what happens
if we don't stick it to the north once
we once we run the app here I'm gonna do
an atoll another place holder for ivona
to define to define a voice and a coldie
to sign in with the keys and we're gonna
finish with putting our focus in the
entry field so that once we start the
app we can immediately start typing
without having to place the cursor
inside the entry field so this is for
convenience and we're gonna run the main
okay so let's run this I saved it as
ivona 1p dub py w so it won't display
the console window when it runs and run
it within 5 ok so we didn't get any
error here so the focus is in in in the
entry field so we don't have to like let
me run it once again to show you so f5
and I can already start typing in but if
I wouldn't have the entry focus and now
I'm pressing the keyboard and it doesn't
happen it doesn't display the keys that
I'm pressing so I have to click in the
entry and start typing
ok so we'll leave it here run it again
fine and you see I've made this speak
the button to stick to the north of its
location if I wouldn't have done this
let me show you what happens so if there
is no sticky button we'll run it and
it's gonna place it centered with the
entry field so we have to specify I
think it looks better if we stick it to
loo to its north to the north of its
location ok sticky equals
so yeah this is it for this video I hope
to see you in the next video please give
me a thumbs up and subscribe and thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
