functions to help us with the
implementation of a convolutional neural
network which we'll do in the next
lesson so we are following the
curriculum in the deep learning textbook
linked in the description now we'll
begin with defining a weight variable so
let's say def weight variable and we'll
pass it a shape parameter so we'll say
initial equals TF truncated normal and
it will take the shape and a standard
deviation of 0.1 and this function will
return a TF so I'll return a TF variable
initial
okay let me just run all the cells above
so we don't get this error okay now
let's make some space over here so what
this function will actually randomly
initiate waits for the fully connected
or convolutional layers now it uses like
I said a truncated normal distribution
with a standard deviation of 1 which
generally gives good results right now
we'll also define a bias variable which
is gonna take the same shape okay and
we'll say initial equals T of constant
it's gonna be point 1 with the shape as
a shape and ill return ATF variable
initial so with this function will
initiate the bias in the layer with a
value of 0.1 now we'll define a comp 2d
which is gonna take X and W as
parameters so the way the the input and
the weights and it will return ad fnn
come to D X W the strides are going to
be 1 1 1 1 and the padding is gonna be
the same so with this function we set
the type of convolution that we use and
the output size
is going to be so we we've selected the
pairing the same which means that the up
size is going to be the same as the
input okay now we'll define a max pull
two by two which is going to take X and
it's gonna return ADF and and max pool
okay with X case size is gonna be a 1 2
2 1 the strides are the same like the K
size so case I is over here okay size
the strides are 1 2 2 1 and the padding
is same let's make sure to capitalize
that let me make sure everything looks
good here so a natural truncated shape
bias do you have constant initial count
to D so these functions call methods
within the tensor flow and then library
okay so what this max pool does is to
set the max pool to half across the
width and the height and overall to 1/4
of the feature map okay now let's also
define a conflate
which is gonna take input and shape so
we're gonna have the weights so now
we're actually going to use the
functions that we previously defined so
weight variable shape and now the bias
is going to be biased bias variable
which is gon be shape
three okay and this is gonna return a
tfn and rail you so it uses the Rayleigh
activation function one come to D which
is gonna take the input our input and
the weight that we've just initiated
plus plus what plus the bias of course
okay so this is for the layer we'll use
so a linear convolution comes to D that
we defined above like I said with the
weight and the bias and the Rayleigh
activation which is for our
non-linearity okay so come to D I'm not
really sure yeah so come to the input
plus bias this might also work if we
just instead of plus say comma but I'm
not really sure maybe I'll try that
later okay so finally we're gonna define
our full layer which is gonna take the
input and the size and we'll say we'll
say n size equals int and put get get
shape
so and input get shape 1w is gonna be a
weight variable of the N and size size
and the B is gonna be a bias variable
which is gonna take size and we'll
return in this case will return a TF
Matt Moll matrix multiplication of the
input the weight plus the bias okay so
here we only need the input we use the
weights the bias and we return a matrix
multiplication of the input and the
weight plus the bias now we'll also be
using this layer for for the output in
which case we don't need a non-linearity
okay so with these functions defined
next we'll will actually begin
implementing the convolutional neural
network one thing that I want to point
out is that sometimes you might need to
create functions like these if your
architecture is complex or if you cannot
apply a generalized model to your
problem however many times you'd be
using higher-level libraries on top of
tensorflow and you won't be needing to
do such anyway thanks for watching and
let's begin building the CN n in the
next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
