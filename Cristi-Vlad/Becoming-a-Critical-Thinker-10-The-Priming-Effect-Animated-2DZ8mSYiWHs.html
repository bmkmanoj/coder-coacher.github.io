average of the five people you spend
most of your time with allow me to
extend this by saying that you are the
average of the top few thoughts you
spend most of your mental energy on more
simply put the things that you think of
the most define who you are and this is
not about self-development small talk
studies in behavioral economics and
cognitive psychology have explored this
over the past few decades of scientific
research now let me back up for a moment
you see we humans are creatures of habit
not of careful reasoning we often see
and look for patterns even where there
are none every day we fall prey to a
whole host of cognitive biases which are
like inborn traits of the human brain
that may have allowed us to survive over
our historical past but which may be
detrimental in many situations in the
world of today
which looks quite different than the
savanna we've been used to for so long
one such bias or logical fallacy is the
priming effect and this is what I'm
going to talk about in this video a
short definition of the priming effect
is that it represents an implicit memory
effect in which exposure to one stimulus
influences the response to another
stimulus end of quote and simple
practical translation the thoughts
feelings and people you are immediately
exposed to will likely have a profound
influence on your physiologic and
psychological makeup now you might say
well isn't this kind of obvious it is so
obvious that we never really take time
to think about it enough and it has such
a big impact on who or what we become in
life as Darren Hardy puts it in his book
the compound effect
everyone is affected by three kinds of
influences input what you feed your mind
associations the people with whom you
spend time and environment your
surroundings and of quote so feed
yourself with junk stimuli and you can
guess what happens the beauty of it is
that you can at any moment determine the
direction of your life
you can stop or limit the time you spend
with toxic people you can increase the
time you spend with people that help you
grow and this doesn't necessarily have
to be in person you can follow their
social feeds watch their videos
interviews and lectures and so on then
you can start implementing good daily
habits one at a time wake up earlier
exercise and go to sleep earlier etc
this is all about deliberate practice
and being consciously aware of yourself
and your current progress in life now to
give you an example from my life I tried
teaching myself programming on various
occasions and I failed every single time
looking back I could say I was
inconsistent I did not invest enough
time and enough practice I did not
expose myself to programming often
enough and by exposure I mean reading
about reading programming books actually
coding watching live demos of other
people programming talk taking online
courses talking to other programmers and
so on this is how I would have primed
myself to programming hence I would have
further promoted the development of this
skill but things change recently as I
got more aware of the situation and of
these innate cognitive biases of hours
so in my latest attempt to learn
programming I started breaking the chain
of
consistency and it was very challenging
the first two or three weeks because I
had to go through the frustration of not
understanding much plus it was very
time-consuming being exposed to so much
programming every day led me to dreaming
about code at night which I know may
sound ridiculous but that's what kind of
happened my efforts have started to pay
off though because with more exposure
and more practice I become more familiar
with programming and I primed myself to
it so to speak
I developed a daily habit for
programming now I have to spend at least
one hour every day exposed to code in
one way or another by coding by watching
the video or by reading from a
programming book and programming at the
same time and as I become better I have
to keep challenging myself with harder
problems otherwise I may steal my
progress so it's a never ending game but
I feel it's more like a neverending joy
once you force yourself through the
intense and frustrating initiation
period now in conclusion my example
about coding can be extrapolated to all
sorts of other life experiences if I
spend most of my time with five or fewer
people that are better than me it's kind
of common sense to think that I'm likely
to experience some sort of improvements
in my life and again spending time
doesn't necessarily mean to be with
those people physically or in person it
may often be convenient to spend time
with them by reading their books
watching their videos or even if we can
get their social profiles it's all about
awareness self-awareness and deliberate
practice you move in the direction of
the top view stimuli you expose yourself
to
be the people information media your own
thoughts environment etc so be careful
to make wise choices you really become
what you choose to think of consistently
and this is it for this video now be
sure to look up the priming effect to
learn more about it my hope is that I
have nudged you to do it and if you
enjoy this video and you'd like to see
