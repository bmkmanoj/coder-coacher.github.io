tell you how I combine ketosis and
intermittent fasting which my desire
weight and to maintain it effortlessly I
would say I've been doing this for
almost two years now what you're about
to see is the introductory video for my
recent course well you don't have to
take the course just enjoy the video and
hit subscribe if you like
welcome to ketosis and intermittent
for fat loss in this course I will teach
you about the two strategies that have
been very helpful to me in my fat loss
and ever with these protocols that
you'll learn about I've been able to
maintain a lean physique over the course
of the last two years so let's start
with a bit of a background story it was
the summer of 2013 at that time I was a
fit person but my satisfaction my abs
were not visible enough I've been trying
for three years to lose the last few
inches of fat from my abdominal area but
my efforts did not pay off by the way
the picture on the left was taken back
in 2008 that was a different me while
the picture on the right was taken just
before starting with ketosis I started
with nutritional ketosis in late
September 2013 in a two-month period I
went from nineteen point six percent
body fat to about fourteen four fourteen
point four percent body fat
I used a dexter scanner to measure my
body composition so ketosis or
nutritional ketosis is the metabolic
state where your body predominantly uses
fats and ketones for energy instead of
sugar this state is not easy to sustain
in early 2014 I started using the second
strategy that you learn about in this
course which is intermittent fasting if'
is a protocol that promotes food
consumption during a feeding window of
eight hours or less and uses a fasting
window of at least 16 hours so with AF
you fast for 16 hours every day and then
you consume food in the remaining 8
hours my personal approach is that I
fast for at least 18 hours every day
and consume food in the remaining six
hours since 2014 I've been using these
two strategies together and I've been
able to maintain my body composition as
you can see in the following images this
is a picture that I took a few days ago
so in this course you will learn about
ketosis ketogenic diets and the process
of keto adaptation you will also become
familiar with intermittent fasting and
my personal 18 with six protocol that is
I fast for 18 hours every day and
consume all my food in the remaining six
hours throughout the course I will use
my journey as an example and I will show
you how to combine ketosis and
intermittent fasting for enhanced fat
loss which is the major theme of the
course then I will provide some meal
examples and I will start with the ones
that I use you'll be able to design your
own meals as you learn the underlying
principles I will teach you how to
exercise with weights and with your own
bodyweight then you will learn about the
tools that I'm using to track my journey
and constantly improve my results last
but not least I will provide further
directions so that you can tailor this
approach to your individual needs so
