throw in some thoughts on the aging
process and I want to thank operate the
grave for providing inspiration for this
as always if you enjoy this video please
share like and subscribe below my almost
holistic approach to improve my
well-being is focused around increasing
longevity I'm trying to lower
inflammation and reduce oxidative
processes as much as possible but not
too much to fall into the other side
because zero inflammation is not
desirable either as far as I'm concerned
there is not a single way to reduce
weight build muscle and live a healthier
life some people can lose weight on high
carb diets while others can build muscle
on ketogenic diets there are tons of
variations and approaches and those who
preach the only efficient way or the
one-size-fits-all are delusional context
is key please remember that but what
about aging before getting into the
details let's let Aubrey de Grey who is
a biomedical gerontologist define aging
he says that the lifelong accumulation
of damage to the tissue cells and
molecules of the body that occurs as an
intrinsic side effect of the body's
normal operation that is aging the body
can tolerate sun damage but too much of
it causes disease and disability now in
this context Aubrey solution focuses on
periodically clearing damage and waste
accumulated within the body as well as
addressing each issue that promotes
damage inside the body through different
specific interventions on the other hand
but in line with the same principles
increasing longevity is about increasing
your redox potential the same redox
potential that Jack crews extensively
talks about on his blog the redox
potential is the ability to dispose
waste accumulation inside the body which
over the long term leads to faster or
accelerated aging higher redox potential
would be better a high redox potential
would include minimum
or lower but not zero reactive oxygen
species production those are the free
radicals that you produce and higher
antioxidant potential within the cell
that means more coenzyme q10 increased
activity of the enzyme superoxide
dismutase as well as catalase etc now a
certain amount of reactive oxygen
species production is needed by our body
to have a normal thyroid activity to
kill different bacterial pathogens etc
while lower redox potential translates
into higher Airways production which
will bend to unstable molecules from
your body stealing electrons from them
disrupting DNA as well as protein
structure the human metabolism by itself
is oxidative whenever macronutrients are
broken down inside your body they
ultimately reach the electron transport
chain yielding the bulk of energy as ATP
which is needed by the body to meet your
daily total energy expenditure and
different macronutrients may have
different output inside the electron
transport chain you can see the
references for a few studies on this now
from a personal standpoint i prefer
consuming a high-fat nutrient-rich
ketogenic diet which i believe it
promotes a better redox output and also
fewer reactive oxygen species as well as
higher mitochondrial efficiency because
more ATP are produced per carbon atom
when comparing fatty acids to glucose
you can see the third studying the
references section now my dad Harry
approach is similar to all the spare
wheel plus i think that ketogenic diets
consisting of eighty percent or more
calories coming from fat alone may not
be preferable for people unless a
certain medical condition implies it I
think these types of diets are nutrient
deficient but energy rich and many folks
do this under keto diets and experience
negative effects over the long term
now I'm mostly interested in maintaining
my q adaptive status because of the
flexibility and the benefits that it
gives me such as it helps me consider
food not my most important concern of
the day I usually eat in a six hour
timeframe from ten a.m. to four p.m. I
have no cravings i also have
long-lasting mental clarity and stronger
focus and they are not disrupted by
hunger and i have higher energy levels
compared to the non-adaptive state now I
can do intermittent fasting for more
than 36 plus hours which is very
convenient when traveling moving on
caloric restriction through a
well-formulated intermittent fasting
protocol can increase lifespan as well
as life quality because your body does
not have to constantly stress with food
digestion and nutrient absorption it can
produce energy from endogenous sources
that is your own adipose tissue and most
of us do not lack of it and that's why I
think you don't have to obsess about fat
consumption when you're following a
ketogenic diet and please I encourage
you not to believe me I really do please
do your own research and draw our own
conclusions besides I do not imply that
my strategy works for you and for
everyone else the same way it works for
me try it on your own expense this is
merely what I currently do and I believe
and it should be taken as such this is
my own N equals one that is my personal
experiment so basically I try to eat and
not eat to increase my redox potential
but the approach to increase lifespan
and life quality has much more to do
with than just food what about exercise
while I'm currently training according
to a modified version of the big five
work out of dogma graph that is I focus
on high intensity heavy lifting I do
full body workouts multiple times per
week where I do moderate to slow
repetitions with moderate to high
weights heavy weights I spent 35 to 40
minutes
the gym with each session now I wouldn't
go as often to the gym had I not have
the ability to recover faster I suspect
this is due to my cold thermogenesis
protocol to my Kido adapted state and
also to the nutrition and supplement
protocol that I'm using I find that very
high intensity training short duration
is much more beneficial for me compared
to other means of training that I tried
in the past plus it promotes lower
oxidation as it mostly uses the first
two energy systems that is adenosine
triphosphate creating phosphate and
anaerobic glycolysis I talked about them
in my book heat on power right now I'm
in maintenance mode I don't in for hire
muscle mass or for lower body fat it
would be much more demanding for me to
maintain an increased muscle mass as
this is the most expensive tissue of the
body which is very difficult to build
and very easy to lose now increasing
longevity includes other important
factors which I will only mention here
and talk more about each one of them in
later videos as I get more knowledge and
experience on the subject one of them is
focused on improving sleep and the
circadian function both qualitatively
and quantitatively it involves improving
the circadian clock and this also
implies fixing hormonal signaling
secondly maintaining a healthy gut is
another factor if your body cannot
absorb the nutrients from what you put
in your mouth then all your dietary
efforts are in vain I'll recommend
seeing the walls approach here thirdly
reducing non-native EMF radiation is
another crucial factor non-native EMF
radiation that is electromagnetic field
radiation comes mostly from the
electrically powered devices around us
including wireless and radio waves you
could check the research of Nora Volkov
robert becker as well as clint ohbert
get more insight into this subject then
it's also
about reducing artificial light exposure
you have to know that when the Sun Goes
Down we should not disrupt the circadian
cycle by exposing ourselves to light
coming from TV tablets mobile phones etc
this way melatonin and hormonal
production are heavily affected
basically melatonin production is
disrupted when you is destroyed when you
expose yourself to artificial light at
night now all of these are called
environmental mismatches and they have a
powerful damaging effect to the human
body they contribute to the equation of
Aging and some of the interventions that
I mentioned here plus some others Oh
thermogenesis is one of them may help in
mitigating many of these negative
effects another theory that I consider
misconceived is the lower active thyroid
hormone that is d3 is bad even in the
context of normal TSH and t4 production
I as well as Ron rossdale think that
lower t3 is good in the context in this
context because its purpose when
secreted in higher levels is to speed up
chemical processes throughout the entire
body it increases metabolism and it also
increases oxidative processes I
personally think lower t3 is very
protective and it is a promoter of
longevity again context matters
centenarians for example there is people
who live beyond 100 years of age have
markedly lower d 3 levels I have written
about this in the past on my blog now
all these are my current thoughts and
beliefs and they should be taken as such
I am NOT making generalizations or
suggestions and I'll get into more
details on each of these interventions
in later videos now once again if you
