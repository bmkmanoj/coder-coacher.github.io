about one of the strategies that can be
used to enter into ketosis which is the
metabolic state in which your body
predominantly uses ketones and fatty
acids for energy so number one reduced
all carbohydrates to less than 50 grams
per day this may be challenging if this
is your first time trying to get into
ketosis number two on the second day
measured ketones now you can use blood
ketone meters urine ketone strips and
ketone breath analyzers you don't go by
subjective feelings you want to be as
precise as possible otherwise you you
don't know whether or not you're into
ketosis now the cheapest way to do it is
by using urine ketone strips which you
can find at your local pharmacy these
are not the most accurate but they are
good for starters if you're not into
ketosis further reduce total
carbohydrates by 10 grams so you'll be
at 40 grams of total carbs per day again
measure ketosis if you detect ketones
good if not keep reducing carbohydrates
by 10 grams each day once you're into
ketosis and it is detectable for a
couple of days in a row maintain the
level of carbohydrates that allows you
to sustain ketosis if long-term ketosis
is your goal now I'm not getting into
diet specifics here because
possibilities are unlimited to do it
right and to do it wrong by depleting or
depriving your body of vitamins minerals
micronutrients I may discuss this in a
future video so in review start with
consuming 50 grams of total carbs per
day and if you're not into ketosis after
one or two days keep reducing
carbohydrates in 10 grams increments
until you're getting consistent measures
of ketones so yeah that's it for this
video I hope you find it useful on your
way out please give me a thumbs up and
subscribe and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
