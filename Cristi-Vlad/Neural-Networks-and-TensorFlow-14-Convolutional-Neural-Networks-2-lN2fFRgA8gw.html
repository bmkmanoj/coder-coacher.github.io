discussion on convolutional neural
networks previously in this series we've
touched upon activations from a general
perspective now when it comes to
convolutional neural nets we'll be
applying nonlinear activations such as
the sigmoid or logistic the hyperbolic
tangent or 10h and Rayleigh or rectified
linear unit and we'll be applying these
two fully connected or convolutional
layers you'll see exactly what I'm
talking about when we get to that point
now after the convolutional layers or
layer we often use pooling or pooling
layers for the purpose of reducing the
size of the data and this can make the
downstream computation of the network
much more efficient because it can
significantly reduce the number of
parameters required by our model there
are several types of pooling that we can
use but for the sake of exemplification
this is how max pooling would be
implemented in tensor flow so we have
the n n max pool method now in this case
the max pooling operation will output
the maximum of the input in each 2 by 2
block of feature Maps so K size is the
size of the pooling so 2 by 2 here and
the Strides argument is how we move
these pooling grids these two by two
grids over our input X we've discussed
the padding in the previous video now
the last thing we need to discuss before
starting the implementation of the model
is dropout so we use dropout for
regularization and this will force the
network to spread or to distribute what
it learned across all neurons by turning
off
a certain number of neurons or units in
any given layer now in tensorflow will
be a-prime will be applying dropout as
shown here so we have the N n dropout
method and we'll specify the layer and
also the number of neurons or units to
keep okay now with this minimum of
information will be proceeding to
implementing the model so to reiterate I
didn't go into too much detail and
theory because there is a lot of good
free information out there for all of
these concepts either in video or text
format or both what I would recommend
though if you want to dig deeper and
understand these concepts of
convolutional neural networks at
fundamental level is to take a free
online course on it and as I said in the
previous video my suggestion would be
the fourth course of Professor Inc in
the deep learning specialization at
Coursera which is not too low level to
be very abstract in the next lesson
we're going to build some helper
functions to aid us in the
implementation so we do this in tensor
flow as it allows us to work at a
relatively low level of representation
but like I said there are higher level
libraries built on top of tensor flow
which makes it even easier to design the
architecture thus letting us focus on
rapid construction of the network
instead of having to define everything
at granular level anyway so in the next
one we'll do the help of functions and
then proceed with the implementation of
the model which is going to make use of
these functions I have to specify that a
big shout-out or credits for inspiring
this example go to Tom Hope and the deep
learning textbook linked in the
