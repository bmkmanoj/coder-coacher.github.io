looking into optical character
recognition and we're going to build an
OCR engine to recognize handwritten
characters over the next few tutorials
so if you want to follow along with the
code please go to the following link to
download and extract the lettered data
file which is like 10 or 15 megabytes
I'll remind you that we're following an
adaptation of the code from the textbook
that's linked in the description alright
so first we're going to load the data
and then we're going to look at it so we
start with a few imports so import OS
and import sis
these two are utilities from the Python
standard library then we're also gonna
import CV 2 which is open CV a very
popular library used for computer vision
then we're also gonna import numpy as NP
now assuming you've downloaded and
placed the letter dot data file in the
same directory we're defining the input
file so let's say input F equals letter
datum so we don't have to specify the
full path because it's in its in the
same directory and then we're also gonna
need to define some parameters for data
visualization let's run this first to
make sure there are no errors ok so now
for data visualization we're gonna need
an image resize factor which is going to
be 12 we're going to define start and
as 6 and minus 1 and we're gonna define
height and width which is going to be 16
and 8 now we're going to iterate through
the lines in letter datum until the
escape key is pressed we read and scale
the line to 255 so let's say with open
input input F reading mode as F for line
and F dot read lines we're going to
define data as being a numpy array and
like I said we're gonna multiply it with
255 times float X for X and aligned dot
split dab
from start to the end okay so if you
don't know this this type of definition
is like a list comprehension which is a
more convenient way to run a for loop if
you don't know about it
there are many tutorials on youtube so
you can look it up now we use line split
here because each line is step separated
and specified here okay now we are
reshaping this one dimensional array
into a two-dimensional image so we'll
say image equals NP dot reshape data and
we're gonna reshape it with height and
width okay and then scale it so let's
say image scaled equals computer cv2 so
from OpenCV resize image none FX is
gonna be image resize factor FY is gonna
be the same thing and then we're also
gonna display the the letters of the
character so let's say print line and
finally we're gonna view the image so
we're gonna use em show from cv2 and
we're gonna say image and we're gonna
look at image scaled ultimately so when
the user presses the Escape key we break
from the loop this not might work well
and cv2 I'm not sure what's the reason
so we'll say C equals CV to weight key
if C equals equals 27 so escape break
from the loop okay now we hit shift
enter to run the cell and here we have
our result so this is this first
character is an O as specified here and
if we press the spacebar
it's going to display the next one so
the next one should be an M but it
doesn't really look like an M another M
this is more like an M an a an N and so
on and so forth so this is what makes
our data set we have the features and
the labels in the next tutorial we're
going to start building an optical
character recognition system using a
neural network in neural lab so a please
like the video and subscribe if you
enjoyed it and you want to follow along
thank you for watching and I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
