this end in the next videos we are going
to learn discuss and most importantly
work on artificial neural networks we
are going to follow the curriculum from
pratik Josh's book artificial
intelligence with Python you can find an
Amazon link to the book in the
description of this video so in the
following tutorials we are going to
briefly introduce neural networks then
we'll create a perceptron based
classifier then we're going to build a
single layer and multi-layer neural
networks it is also likely that we're
gonna go into analyzing sequential data
with recurrent neural networks and also
work on something related to optical
character recognition but before we go
into all that we have to install a
Python library that we're gonna work
with which is actually based on numpy so
in your command prompt or in your shell
do the following tip 3 install neuro lab
so this is the library that we're gonna
require now don't try installing it in
your Jupiter notebook to be accurate and
also for reproducibility I'm using
Python 3.5 on a 64-bit Windows 10
machine ok now in the next video I'm
going to go into some very basic
concepts of artificial neural networks
and probably start working on a
perceptron based classifier so if this
seems interesting please make sure to
subscribe and hit the like button thank
you for watching and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
