about a few insights that I got from
Evan Carmichael's this book you're one
word now let me go through them one at a
time so number one quote if you're doing
something just to make money it's easy
to quit most people do but if you're
doing something because it makes you
calm alive then removing the
restrictions life throws at you clears
the path and the quote I can easily
relate to this one to be honest I need
money just to go by so that I can
completely immerse myself into things
that I enjoy doing like putting up this
animation for example I'd recommend
looking for studies on income levels and
satisfaction you may notice that while
up to a certain point money can
definitely improve the quality of life
after that threshold is met the gains
may be marginal and that threshold
appears to be much lower than you might
think the irony is that if you
deliberately do something for long
enough and you improve money will come
eventually for Evan that something is
entrepreneurship and most of his
strategies rely heavily on his one word
which is hashtag believe point number
two please sit down and let's have an
honest talk most people leave mediocre
lives you're living for the evenings and
weekend and hope that time spent working
just doesn't suck too much and of quote
well I don't have anything to add here
just that I have to remind myself every
day to avoid this quote the people you
hang out with the website you visit the
media you consume everything in your
environment holds you exactly where you
are it prevents you from taking steps
forward being mediocre has not only
become acceptable but is the norm
because it's comfortable because it's
safe because it's limiting you end of
quote
there's something in psychology called
the primary thing and it has a lot to do
with how stimuli that is your
environment friends your own thoughts
keep you exactly where you are this also
has to do with neuroplasticity which
I'll talk about in a future video
but until then you can check out the
video I did on the priming effect number
three quote don't talk with others more
talk with yourself more this is your
purpose and only you get to the side you
need to stop living their versions of
your life and start living your version
of your life and it's quote nobody knows
you better than yourself not your family
not your friends nobody doesn't it make
sense then that whenever you decide
something in your life you listen to
yourself more then you listen to others
think about it now I'm going to switch
the theme here for a moment this is very
specific to entrepreneurship and
personal branding so point number four
quote for example tech giant Hewlett
Packard was named after its founders
Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard the name
is ambiguous and doesn't have any
intrinsic meaning other than its
relation to two people - they sell lawn
equipment are they a dog kennel
do they manufacture pianos they didn't
call themselves
computer for you which would have been
much clearer and more limiting and of
quote emphasis mine you may notice that
my channels is name is mining it
represents my current interests and as
of my current life you may also notice
that my videos are on a few limited
topics like biochemistry computer
programming psychology and aspects of
finis and nutrition from my daily life
should I have named my channel Chris
Fitness or Chris biochem lessons or
learn Python with Chris what if next
week I want to tackle C++ instead of
Python what if I develop an interest in
art and I might just do that
should I rename my channel I don't think
that's possible should I open a new
youtube channel for each aspect of my
life I hope you see how impractical this
may be so a good advice from Evan is not
to limit yourself think about it if you
have several interest and you'd like to
talk about them on YouTube it may be
more practical to make a playlist for
each one of them the people who like
what you do will follow you
regardless of the fact that you post on
various topics in creating and expanding
your business
Evan provides numerous examples from his
own life he talks about mindset having a
story doing the artwork for your brand
creating powerful employer-employee
relationships
selecting your client yes you can do
that finding mentors crafting
high-quality products and services and
much more moving on to point number five
I want to end proactively instigating
you to take action
quote sure if you grew up in Somalia and
had to deal with civil wars
prolonged drafts and pirates it will be
much tougher for you than for someone
from a middle-class family in New York
City but so what that's the hand you
were dealt what are you going to do
about it continue to blame other people
forever or take some responsibility for
your own life the fact that you picked
up this book means you can
Ede you understand English it likely
means you have internet access you have
a roof over your head and you have many
other advantages that others don't the
people who change the world understand
it it's never about how many resources
you have it's about how resourceful you
are end of quote so do something about
it like right now not tomorrow not later
but right this moment take action now
period all right so if Evans book looks
appealing make sure to pick it up and if
you enjoyed this video and you'd like to
see more please give me a thumbs up and
