hopefully with a parachute then it is to
change your mind about an opinion love
it and Dubner in this video I present
some of my highlights from Steven Levitt
and Stephen Dubner this book think like
a freak these authors not only discuss
practical ways of upgrading how you
think but I also get into unconventional
tactics to persuade others like a
double-edged sword these strategies can
be used for the good or for the bad I'm
gonna assume you're in it for the former
a growing body of research suggests that
even the smartest people tend to seek
out evidence that confirms what they
already think rather than new
information that would give them a more
robust view of reality and of court this
is one of the greatest barriers of
critical thinking a lot of people talk
about it you hear about the confirmation
bias from scientists and diet gurus
researchers it is very tricky though
because awareness of it doesn't in early
project it from this bias it amuses me
how so very often I tend to fall prey to
it another barrier to thinking like a
freak is that most people are too busy
to rethink the way they think or to even
spend much time thinking at all when was
the last time you said for an hour of
pure unadulterated thinking if you're
like most people it's been a while end
of quote
this is known as metacognition or
thinking about thinking I know it sounds
boring but if you want to stop being at
the mercy of your senses urges people
and the environment around you if you
want to reclaim some stake into your own
thinking I'd suggest to look that up and
practice metacognition
approach and experience the world with
curiosity instead of assuming that you
know the impulse to investigate can only
be set free if you stop pretending to
know answers that you don't because the
incentives to pretend are so strong this
may require some bravery on your part
and of court to be a better thinker you
have to be able to say I don't know and
then do the best you can to find out
what you don't know thinking like a
freak also means thinking small rather
than big why you may ask well big
problems have been thought of endlessly
by very smart people Isaac Newton
couldn't have said it better to explain
all nature is too difficult a task for
any one man or even for any one age it
is much better to do a little with
certainty and leave the rest for others
that come after then to explain all
things by conjecture without making sure
of any thing and of quote
so why you should think small first
small questions receive less attention
than bigger ones they are opportunities
second big problems are composed of a
multitude of smaller ones so you can
approach a bigger problem if this is
what you're really in for by dealing
with the smaller problems comprising it
number three
since change is hard and bigger problems
may imply a bigger change you get a
better shot at change by dealing with
smaller problems number four smaller
problems may be solved quicker making
the reward more immediate now what about
that persuasion game one if you go for
the unpersuadable note that his or her
argument is likely based more on
ideology and herd mentality than on
logic and critical thinking number two
don't make your arguments perfect allow
for some flaws show us a perfect
solution and we'll show you our path
unicorn if you make an argument that
promises all the benefits and no costs
your opponent will never buy it nor
should he
and if quote number three tell stories
this is one of the most important
weapons in your persuasion arsenal why
are stories so valuable one reason is
that a story exerts a power beyond the
obvious the hole is so much greater than
the sum of the parts the facts the
events the context that a story creates
a deep resonance and if quote to make a
good story portrayed a bigger picture
emphasize on the passage of time show
how things change or remain constant
stories also appear to the narcissist
and all of us as a story unspools with
its cast of characters moving through
time and making decisions we inevitably
put ourselves into their shoes yes I
would have done that too or no no no I
never would have made that decision and
if quote we are evolutionarily wired for
storytelling make sure you know that
I'll end by letting the author's tell
you more about letting go which is a key
principle at the core of thinking like a
freak letting go of the conventional
wisdoms that torment us letting go of
the habits of mind that tell us to kick
into the corner of the goal even though
we stand a better chance by going up the
middle letting go of the artificial
limits that hold us back and of the fear
of admitting what we don't know thank
