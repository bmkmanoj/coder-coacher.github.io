considered unethical to conduct fasting
experiments in humans researchers like
Cahill and his colleagues observed obese
people usually as they go through the
phases of fasting they wanted to know
what happens metabolically and
physiologically once you stop eating so
I'm gonna try and clearly and briefly go
through these phases and this video so
the first few hours after you stop
eating if you are on a normal diet most
of your blood glucose comes from
exogenous sources that is from
carbohydrates so most of your blood
glucose comes from dietary carbohydrate
the same goes for most of your tissues
are using glucose and the major brain
fuel is glucose as well as you progress
through fasting as you go into the next
stage that is 4 to 16 hours after you
stopped eating the origin of your blood
glucose is from glycogen that is stored
glucose and this is when also your body
starts the process or up regulates the
process of gluconeogenesis that is
creation of new blood glucose the
glucose oxidation rate and in phase 2 as
per Cahill and his colleagues who is or
was 7 to 8 grams per hour which is much
less than what it was when the body's
major source of whew all was was glucose
metas
the first phase it was 40 grams per hour
now in phase 2 your body also starts of
regulating the process of fat oxidation
as I've said in this post the body's
primary fuel is still glucose but at
this point you may I mean by the end of
the phase 2 you may have depleted your
body's exogenous and hepatic sources of
glucose that is the glycogen which is
why goo-goo neo Genesis is upregulated
so in this case the major substrates for
gluconeogenesis are massive muscle
catabolism recycled pyruvate and lactate
glycerol to a certain extent and other
substrates your body tissues all except
liver are still using glucose while the
muscles and your adipose tissue uses
glucose at a diminished rate the fuel
for your brain
the major fuel for your brain is still
glucose now I'm talking in the context
of a normal carbohydrate sufficient diet
this may not be the situation when
you're following a lower carbohydrate or
a restricted carbohydrate type moving on
to phase 3 which is between 16 to 32
hours after you stopped eating the
origin of your blood glucose comes from
gluconeogenesis and the remainder of
glycogen the tissues that are still
using glucose seems to be all except the
liver while your muscle and adipose
tissue oxidizes fat
and intermedia rates between stages two
and four so in phase three
gluconeogenesis is progressively
upregulated until the end of this pace
while this is when your glycogen stores
are likely to become depleted now as we
move into phases four and five that is
at their 30 hours once you stopped
eating the origin of your blood glucose
comes from both the paddock and renal
gluconeogenesis while and and these
phases and phase four the tissues that
are using glucose is your brain red
blood cells renal medulla and some small
amount is still used by the muscles this
is when your brain starts relying less
on glucose and more on ketone bodies so
the major fuel even though the major
fuel of your brain may still be glucose
ketogenesis and brains is oxidation of
ketones is upregulated so at this point
you oxidize glucose at a rate of 3.5 to
4 grams per hour this is not well I
assume this is not difficult to be
provided
through gluconeogenesis which is why
your body stops or diminishes the rate
at which muscle catabolism occurs while
gluconeogenesis starts relying more on
other substrates then muscle and then
through muscle catabolism and as I said
here you start officially using fatty
acids and ketones for energy Wow
even though ketones may not be in phase
four they may not be the major the major
fuel for the brain as you progress
through fasting and they start becoming
the major fuel and spark a whole ketones
provide between 60 to 70% of the energy
that's required by by the brain so as I
said muscle catabolism decreases
significantly since there is not much
meat for glucose all right so I'm not
sure if I've been very clear about this
and by the way if you have questions
about what happens to your body from an
energy metabolism perspective once you
stop eating please let me know in the
comments below
