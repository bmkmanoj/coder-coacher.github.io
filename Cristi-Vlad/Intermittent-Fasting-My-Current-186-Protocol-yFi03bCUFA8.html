still got a lot of work to do but I
definitely enjoyed the ride hey folks in
today's video I want to briefly
introduce you to the intermittent
fasting strategy that I'm using so for
those of you who don't know intermittent
fasting is a meal timing strategy where
you restrict your food intake to a
certain amount of hours every day my
current strategy is 18 with six that is
I fast for 18 hours every day and
consume food in the remaining six hours
I usually have a breakfast at 10 a.m.
and the snack at 3 p.m. which lasts for
an hour until 4:00 p.m. so this is my
feeding window of six hours in which I
have two meals then I fast from 4 p.m.
until the next day at 10 a.m. so that is
my 18 hours of fasting in which I
consume nothing but water and
non-caloric beverages such as coffee or
unsweetened tea so this is basically the
type of intermittent fasting protocol
that I'm currently doing there are other
protocols like 16 with 8 which is the
most popular that is you fast for 16
hours and consume food for 8 hours and
there are other more difficult protocols
like 20 with 4 in which you fast for 20
hours and consume food in the remaining
4 hours and even more difficult
protocols of 24 hours of fasting with
one meal or more than 24 hours of
fasting I'm going to discuss about my
current protocol in more detail in
future videos so please make sure you
