of visual recognition with IBM Watson
and Python in the first video I showed
you how to set up an IBM Watson account
and also how to set up Python so that
you can run visual recognition and so
that you can follow along with the
tutorial now I'm not going to go over
through the whole process again so if
you want to follow along make sure to
check out the first video and in that
video I went through image
classification so for example say you
have an image with winter scenery and
you have trees and snow and different
objects if you run IBM Watson through
the image it will display confidence
intervals with the objects or things
that it sees like for example there's a
99% chance that the image contains snow
anyway you can check the first video to
see how it goes in this video I'm going
to go through text recognition with
Watson and Python so without further ado
let's jump right into it after all it's
only three or four lines of code so it's
quite simple so I have an idle shell
over here Python shell so from Watson
developer cloud we're going to import
visual recognition version 3 as VR and
then we're going to create an instance
of the visual recognition so VR we're
going to authenticate
API key equals I already have it on the
clipboard and we're going to use the
version from May 2016 20th of May 2016
should be good now we're going to pass
on an image so we're going to use
instance to recognize text and the
images file so I'm going to use a file
from the web in this case this is a
written tutorial for for this purpose so
I'm gonna pull link to it in the
description so let's pick any image from
here and see what Watson sees view image
let's grab a link copy image address and
see the job that Watson doesn't trace
back so images file name images URL so
it's images URL images URL my bad so it
should be good we're just gonna see what
this variable holds so
once again the the results are displayed
in a JSON file and as it as one can see
it wasn't able to detect the text
because it gotten an undefined server
error let's try and use another image
say this one view image copy image
address now image instance recognize
text images URL equals or URL enter
let's see if it did a better job this
time so image yep so we got some results
here let's try and see if we can access
the results in a better way by going
down the JSON tree so I already have the
whole command or I think I have it over
here so images this is how we go down
the JSON tree so it's image image images
0
and text so South Carolina - n which is
a new line
ABC one two three new line travel ABC so
South Carolina abc123 travel so it
didn't get the s see comm anyway in just
a few lines I think it did a good job so
in the past you'd have to use to do this
kind of thing in the past you have to
use optical character recognition
libraries and write a whole bunch of
code just to get an even poorer result
than this one so this is quite decent
and what else can you use this for a
side of license plate recognition here
you could use it to recognize text in
PDF files which are in images files you
can do a whole transcription of the text
from from a PDF file and you can do all
sorts of stuff with it I may do another
video tutorial using a different way to
do text recognition with say modules
like open computer vision or simple
computer vision that is open CV or
simple CV in a future post but the next
one in this series with IBM Watson and
python is on facial recognition so if
you have questions with respect to this
leave them in the comments below don't
