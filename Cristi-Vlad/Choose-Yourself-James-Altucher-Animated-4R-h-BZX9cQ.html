that somewhere in the future I will find
something that will make me happy
and that until then I will be unhappy I
still don't know what my purpose is I'm
afraid I will never know that makes me
very happy maybe I can have lots of
adventures between today and the day I
die maybe I can do lots of different
things and if I don't if I die even
tomorrow that's fine also
what does purpose mean when we are dead
we might as well choose to be happy now
James all teacher in this video I
discussed some of my take-home messages
from James all teachers book choose
yourself rejection and the fear of
rejection is the biggest impediment we
face to choosing ourselves someone
rejected you poor baby
now after your morning is over ask why
you're going to be rejected all your
life in every way it never hurts to
understand why and of quote choosing
yourself is also about saying no to the
vampires in your life it's important to
avoid people who bring you down not in a
cruel way but avoid engaging or overly
dwelling on people who are constantly
draining you of energy when you catch
yourself residing not in the now most
people obsess on regretting their pasts
or anxieties in their future I call this
time traveling the past and the future
don't exist you don't need to
time-travel anymore you can live right
now when I walk around New York City
everyone seems to have glazed eyes they
are walking around in the past or the
future
they are time-traveling one exercise
they try look at the roofs of buildings
finding the art in the city around me is
a good technique to keep me right here
when everyone else is in the time
machine and the quote now here are some
of James's daily practices
for better physical and mental sanity
most importantly practice gratitude if
you are in the middle of a rainstorm
there is abundance of water if you are
in a traffic jam there is an abundance
of cars think of the human achievement
those cars represent in our short
history of this planet turn this bear on
its head be grateful for end to the
people in your life tell them or if you
don't want to just experience the
feeling of gratitude do this as often as
possible especially during hard times
choosing yourself is also going for
financial self-sufficiency the book is
loaded with step-by-step practical
guides to make money like
self-publishing
for example I've sold many books on
Kindle for almost nothing I've given
away books for free to people who showed
up at my talks or sign up for my
newsletter does that sound stupid maybe
but it got my name out there I've now
given out more than 100 thousand copies
of my books
on top of the sales this will have
lifelong effects on me I feel them every
day end of quote
I did this with all my books as well of
course not at that level the
after-effects are in connections with
people and opportunities far heavier
than keeping the books behind a high
price if you're not into self-publishing
James offers other guides for making
money online in this flourishing
ever-growing job market ideas compound
have many ideas more importantly take
action people have lots of ideas but
they are mostly bad ones the way you get
good ideas is to do two things one three
two hours a day and to write ten ideas a
day by the end of the year you will have
read for almost 1,000 hours and have
written down 3600 ideas one of these
ideas will be a home run
end of quote choosing yourself is the
opposite of egoism look the only way to
improve society is to comment it from a
place of deep individual satisfaction
the only way to do that is to spend long
periods of time just being silent find
out who the real you is and then you can
save the world
end of quote the following is one of my
favorite quotes because it fires up
curiosity of the world around you
instead of approaching reality with the
illusion that you know when you're a kid
everything is a question mark at the end
of it only later do they turn into
periods or even exclamation points will
I get over this becomes it's too late
because I can get over this my only hope
for my future is I learned to dot the
landscape of my life once more with
question marks instead of periods thank
