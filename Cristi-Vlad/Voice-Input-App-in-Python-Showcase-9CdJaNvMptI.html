useful program that I quoted a few days
ago which basically helps me whenever I
don't want to use the keyboard on my
laptop for typing and instead I use
voice for input conveniently so I use
this program in social media replies
like Facebook Twitter and all that stuff
as well as when I update or post
something on different channels I also
use it in email replies and whenever I
want to write something down in my notes
and I want to do it quickly without I
think so let me show you how it works
so this is it and it's very minimalistic
in design like other programs that I've
created let's say I want to post
something on my Facebook page over here
so I click speak the recent study in
neuroscience makes me excited about the
field
so i just right-clicked and paste how
does it work well under the hood it
simply uses the speech recognition
function or the speech recognition API
of Google which kind of makes very few
mistakes it's pretty accurate if you ask
me and once the input is received from
the microphone it copies it on the
clipboard so I can easily paste it using
the mouse alone like right click and
paste or the keyboard by hitting ctrl +
V but I want to rebel and not use the
keyboard because it beats the purpose
anyway I'll post a link in the
description to my github where you can
get the code and I'll probably make
another one or more videos explaining
the code line by line so make sure to
subscribe if you want to know more and
if you enjoyed this video please hit
that like button on your way out
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
