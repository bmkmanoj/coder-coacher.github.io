in the existence of ghosts psychic
powers and a lot of paranormal stuff it
didn't matter to me if there was good
scientific evidence to support my
beliefs I knew nothing about that and it
didn't matter because I was to absorb
lucky for me or not as I grew up and
became interested in science in the
scientific method those beliefs started
being dispelled one by one now it is in
our human nature to engage in magical
thinking at some level but I think we
shouldn't do it or at least I shouldn't
do it if you're interested in good
thinking or critical thinking which
which we are not born with we are
inherently irrational so if you're
interested in critical thinking and if
you want to be able to identify or
detect the baloney and the potential
deceptive intentions in other peoples as
claims and arguments let's explore some
more of the baloney detection kit which
is a set of 10 questions to ask yourself
when facing dubious claims and arguments
from other people the media so in this
third video of the series we're going to
go into questions number four and number
six from the baloney detection kit
leaving the rest of the questions for
future videos in the series so questions
four and six referred to how claims fall
into the bigger picture and were the
majority of evidence for a claim points
to let's be more specific so question
number 4 goes like this how does the
claim fit
what we know about how the world works
I'll outline an example presented by
Michael Shermer so some people enjoy
discussing about the potential mysteries
behind the Egyptian pyramids they like
to think that the pyramids were built by
an intelligent along gone civilization
by the inhabitants of Atlantis a
fictitious continent or even by aliens
they couldn't have been built by
Egyptians pyramids are so complex
structures of course they are complex
when you see it in retrospect but as
michael shermer says they're just a pile
of rocks Egyptians had a lot of free
time a lot of cheap labor it never rains
they had centuries to build these piles
of rocks come on it's not that
complicated and if quote so you can
always sniff the nonsense of such claims
by looking at the bigger picture if
those amazing pyramids were built by a
higher above human intelligence let us
ask some pertinent questions and again
I'm sighting from schirmer so where are
the rest of their marvelous artifacts of
the higher intelligence where are their
clothes where are their thumbs where is
their trash and where are the tools they
used and the quote of course current
archaeology does not support such
preposterous claims but but people
engaging in deception conspiracy
theories and magical thinking can be
more harmful dangerous and cunning than
those making such harmless and naive
claims so you have to be
put every claim in its appropriate
context I've said this before I'm gonna
say look at the bigger picture look at
how the world works look at the sobering
hard facts and make your interpretation
of everything try to use multiple
sources multiple independent sources to
build your argument now moving on to
question 6 which goes like this where
does the preponderance of evidence point
so in a discussion with someone I argued
that whatever belief theory or claim you
wish to make you can always find a few
published studies to support your claim
there are at least approximately there
are at least two million studies
published in peer-reviewed journals
alone every year so make your claim find
one or more published studies chances
are you will and full the uneducated
masses of course a trained eye will not
fall for it so easily we know that most
of the published scientific research has
some flaws it's not easy to conduct good
research and it's not easy to detect and
interpret good research you need to
skill yourself in math statistics and
logical fallacies and other hard
sciences to name just a few and people
usually hate these topics we are
internally leaning towards in numeracy
which with means that we are bad with
numbers humans are creatures of reason
instead we're creatures of
rationalization by default so detecting
bunk in claims is therefore challenging
for most people
now here's how trimmer exemplifies point
six the theory of evolution for examples
for example is proved through a
convergence of evidence from a number of
independent lines of inquiry no one
fossil no one piece of biological and
paleontological evidence has evolution
written on it instead tens of thousands
of evidentiary beats add up to a story
of the evolution of life creationists
conveniently ignored this confluence
focusing instead on trivial anomalies or
currently unexplained phenomena in the
history of life and the quote so good
science does not make extraordinary
claims and last backed by extraordinary
evidence and I've said this before so
pseudo-scientists quacks and people who
wish to deceive you will often make such
claims exploiting your cognitive biases
and your lack of mathematical skills and
as schirmer puts it and I'm gonna quote
from him once again here goes in a way
science is like solving a crime the guy
never confesses right so you have to
piece together the evidence that's
available is it this guy or is it that
guy did this happen or did that happen
the way criminologists work is they try
to look at the mass of data they have
and see if they can build a case against
one individual or another and if both so
educating oneself in science is probably
the best way to understand the world in
which we live unless you choose to be
ignorant ignorant becoming literate in
math statistics brain science and
critical thinking is not easy
but it will arm you with one of the
strongest Arsenal's to steer through a
world of nonsense and this is it for
