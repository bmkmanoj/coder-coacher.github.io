the speech recognition function that
will be used when clicking the voice
search button so this one for that we'll
use the speech recognition module and
work with Google Cloud the speech API so
to get your API keys otherwise you
cannot use this go to cloud.google.com
forward slash speech and you can use the
api for free for a limited number of
calls okay now into the code I added a
bank to the top of the application to
specify the version of Python that I
want to use because I have multiple
versions of Pi Python on my system okay
so let's import speech recognition as Sr
and we'll also need the mixer from PI
game to play sounds or more specifically
to play some effects that will prompt
the user to speak after clicking the
voice search you see what I'm talking
about when we get to that point so from
my game import mixer and to keep my
Google Cloud speech API keys private
I've added them to a file called keys
and I'm importing them here so from keys
import everything you don't have to do
this you have to specify your API key
when we get to the point of
instantiating the recognizer all right
now let's briefly get into the body
take a function which is invoked with
the click of the voice search
so whenever we'll gonna click the voice
search this is the function that that's
invoked so we'll gonna initialize the
mixer from PI game and we'll also create
an instance of the recognizer with a few
optional parameters that I found useful
to be specified so I'll delete the path
and first we have to initialize the
mixer mixer in it then we'll GaN a load
or music file and the file is called
chyme 3 dot mp3 and I'll include this
file and the github repo of this project
which will find a link to in the
description and once the file is loaded
we're gonna do mixer music play that's
it let's how you you play mp3 files and
Python next we want to start the voice
recognition so we're going to create a
variable called R and we're gonna have
our speech recognition recognizer
recognizer instantiated and the optional
parameter is no you don't have to
specify them but I found them useful as
they work well with my configuration so
our pause underscore thrush all equals
0.7 and energy threshold equals 400 all
right in the next video we're going to
finish defining the function and we'll
try to test it and see how the app
behaves so if you enjoyed this one
please give me a thumbs up and subscribe
thank you for watching and I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
