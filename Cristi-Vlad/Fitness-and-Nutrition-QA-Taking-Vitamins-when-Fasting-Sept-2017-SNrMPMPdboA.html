that was asked on one of my Facebook
groups so here goes I get super sick
when I take vitamins on an empty stomach
I'm wanting to do a 48 hour fast should
I skip the vitamins any tips first of
all I'm no doctor and I don't play one
either so whatever comments follow or
just what I would do or what I did in
similar situations okay so this question
is very nonspecific and my tendency
would be to ask at least a couple dozen
more questions to get a better idea of
the context but I guess we'll have to go
with what do we have so I assume you're
taking vitamins because you suspect you
may have some deficiency or
higher-than-normal requirement for that
vitamin or for those vitamins whatever
the case may be it is very important to
run some blood work to accurately
diagnose if you really require
supplementation with those vitamins
otherwise a healthy non-restrictive diet
which contains plenty of vegetables and
adequate protein is likely to keep you
away from becoming deficient in vitamins
and nutrients assuming that you have an
overall good level of health so I'd say
food first now for the second part for
the fasting part I personally not start
with a 48-hour fast if this is the first
time you're doing it I'd start with
something on the order of 18 to 24 hour
fasts with adequate water consumption
as soon as that becomes easier
I would progress further now on the
background of a healthy diet I would not
worry about supplementing with vitamins
during a short fast but I have to repeat
myself so if there's a suspicion of
deficiency I'd run some blood work and
if that's the case if that validates the
suspicion I correct the deficiency
according to the recommendations of my
doctor okay I hope this was helpful if
you have similar questions you can leave
them in the comments below thank you for
