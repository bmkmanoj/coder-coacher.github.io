and the following minutes I will tell
you what are some of my takeaway
messages from this 400 page book let's
start with number one James says that
reinvention is about defining your
freedom by multiplying your sources of
income in my view today it is easier
than any other time in history to do
that you have the Internet the
possibilities to make money are
unlimited of course if you're able to
narrow your focus and shut down all the
media noise that's captivating your
attention and most importantly your time
which is probably the most invaluable
resource that we have reinvention is
about improving relationships and
finding mentors ok let me clarify this
your mentors don't actually have to be
in person you can learn from them by
reading their books watching their
videos and lectures following their
social profiles you get the point then
you can become a mentor to others start
teaching one of the best ways to learn
something is to start teaching about it
when we try teaching something to
someone we become more aware of what we
don't know and this forces us to review
our information concepts or materials
now don't trust me on this try it grab
your phone record yourself open up
YouTube and hit upload make the internet
work for you instead of against you
reinvention is then also about habits
James says and I agree for the most part
quote you are not just the average of
the five people around you you're the
average of the five habits you do the
things you eat the ideas you have the
content you consume etc end of quote
for more of my thoughts about this see
my video on the priming effect which
I'll link to in the description
point number two comes from louis c.k
this is what he says quote what happens
after you die lots of things happen
after you're dying
they just don't involve you and of God
so what is the practical value of this
as for James at the end of each day you
should ask yourself who did I help today
instead of wondering about existential
questions
point number three in James's words we
now have non-stop entertainment unlike
any other time in history and my kids
will still tell me they're bored heck I
get bored but then I take a walk and
breathe when I was a kid I used to
complain I was bored to my grandparents
I could have been more curious about
them then they died and of course the
point is that time passes and you have
to be aware of that time is precious so
spend it wisely
moving on to point number four James
says we often daydream and think and
plan but the only thing that gets
results is action not a single ounce of
greatness in history ended with thoughts
it happened with hands with action end
of quote
this goes hand in hand with what I said
earlier everyone has ideas and plans
they are worthless they don't mean
anything stop theorizing stop imagining
stop idealizing and start doing
something start solving a problem for
someone and you can do that right now so
many people need help and you can reach
them over the Internet there are forums
there are Facebook groups there are your
friends over there at least someone
needs help make your time count point
number five quote a friend of mine is
writing a novel but is afraid to publish
it maybe it will be bad he told me
fortunately we live in a world where
experimentation is easy you can make a
30 page novel publish it on Amazon for
I think use an assumed name and test to
see if people like it and of quote you
don't even need to publish under your
name take this as another call to action
point number six the following questions
and answers are in my opinion some of
the best pieces from the book
reinvention is at the center of them all
time it takes to reinvent yourself five
years here's a description of the five
years year one you're flailing and
reading everything and just starting to
do your - you don't know who you need to
talk to and network with you're doing
every day you know you finally know what
the Monopoly board looks like in your
new endeavors you're three you're good
enough to make money it not might be a
living yet you're for you're making a
good living you're fine you're making
wealth end of quote
the bad news is that if you're in it for
the quick buck you're never gonna make
it being good at or mastering from
something requires time deliberate
practice and comfort with discomfort if
you fall for hacking that 10,000 hour
rule or mastering something in two weeks
you're in it for a big delusion when can
I start doing X today if you want to
paint den by canvas and paint today
start buying 500 books one at a time and
start painting what is it how do I know
what I should do whatever area you feel
like reading 500 books about go to the
bookstore and find it if you get bored
three months later go back to the book
store there is no rush
you will reinvent yourself many times in
an interesting life you will fail to
reinvent many times that's fun also I
can't read 500 books what one book
should I read for inspiration give up
what if I'm shy make your witness your
strengths introverts listen better focus
better and have ways of being more
endearing and if quotes now this entire
set contains more than 60 questions and
answers that should be your faithful
guide if you consider trying something
