neural networks for those who don't know
this is not a new technology in fact it
dates back to the 40s and 50s when the
first models for neural networks have
been created now they didn't catch up
though until much later because running
complex models requires extent extensive
computational power and also to
efficiently train a model you need
relatively large data sets now if you're
interested in the history and how this
field developed the Wikipedia of
artificial neural networks is probably a
good way to start and I'll link to it in
the description now in short an
artificial neural network is made up of
artificial neurons and the basic goal of
a neural network is to solve problems
like a human brain
now these neurons are stacked in layers
the same as in this illustration so we
have the input layer where our data goes
in the hidden layer or hidden layers and
then the output layer now this is
probably the most basic form of an a n n
the number of hidden layers
differentiates between shallow and deep
neural networks so a deep neural network
is comprised of multiple hidden layers
and that is the case for deep learning
which we'll probably go into in another
tutorial series now same as other forms
of machine learning an ends can be used
for supervised and unsupervised learning
and for tasks like speech recognition
computer vision medical diagnosis
commander systems and many more you can
think of the recommender system behind
Amazon's engine now the data that's
going to go in for these tasks can be
different in terms of its type so you
could have like text data imaging data
voice data and so on and so forth but
ultimately it has to be numerical before
feeding it to the neural network so this
involves some kind of pre-processing now
how does a typical training look like
let's say for a tasks for a task of
classification so first you'd need your
training data that is your data set
which is labeled so we're talking about
supervised learning
you'd convert it to numerical data and
then you'd feed it to your neural
network and here's the important thing
each neuron will act like a function
which you decide upon when you'll when
you model the network and the goal of
the training of the neural network is to
get below a certain error rate so the
goal is to minimize error now this error
rate is basically the difference between
the value or D output predicted by the
network and the actual output which is
the label it usually starts with larger
error rate so the training process
starts with larger error rates and it
adjusts itself during training to reduce
or to minimize this error rate now I
also discussed an example find a neural
network model in another video series
which I'll link to in the description so
there are like five or six videos on
neural networks with the cycle urn
library so I won't go into further
details here
because I could spend hours just talking
about the theory behind these models but
let's rather start getting practical so
in the next video we're gonna build a
perceptron based classifier which is one
of the simplest neural network
architectures now please hit the like
button and subscribe if you enjoyed this
video thank you for watching and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
