according to the Lenin Jers principles
of biochemistry textbook the sixth
edition so MCAD deficiency or MCA D D is
a genetic defect that impairs fatty acid
oxidation more specifically the
inability to break down fatty acids of 6
to 12 carbons into acetyl co a this
mutation takes place in a gene that
encodes the medium-chain a CoA
dehydrogenase enzyme or MCAD and the
health consequences of this can be very
detrimental this is one of the most if
not the most common genetic defects in
the catabolism of fatty acids in
European populations the frequency of
individuals who carry one mutant allele
so having one of the two copies of this
gene mutated making it a recessive
mutation is about 1 in 40 people while
those who carry two mutant alleles
making it a dominant mutation and
leading to the full-blown manifestations
or Consequences of the disease is about
one in 10,000 people so the gene
responsible for this is AC a DM and AC a
DM codes for the medium chain a SoCo ad
hydrogenase enzyme so what are the signs
and symptoms of the disease
well these include fatty liver or
accumulation of fat and deliver higher
circulating levels of octo Noack acid
which is an 8 carbon fatty acid
hypoglycemia a vomiting sleepiness and
in some situations it can lead it can
even lead to
kkoma one of the ways to diagnose it is
by looking at the patterns of organic
acids in urine and more specifically
looking for high levels of 6 to 10
carbon dicarboxylic acids and lower
levels of ketones now it is important to
know that as soon as this condition is
diagnosed the individual is put on a
high carbohydrate low fat diet why you
may ask because since fatty acid
oxidation is impaired the individual has
to avoid periods of catabolism such as
fasting or longer periods between meals
in this situation even overnight fasting
which is normal in healthy people can
become a serious issue so a high carb
low fat diet and supplementation with
simple and or complex carbohydrates that
would ensure a continuous supply of
metabolic substrates to be oxidized for
energy is often the prescription and
with early detection and appropriate
management this can be a condition with
good prognosis
thus something one can live with now
there are other genetic mutations that
impair fatty acid transport and
oxidation but they are not as prevalent
as this one so there are not touched at
length and the textbook alright I hope
