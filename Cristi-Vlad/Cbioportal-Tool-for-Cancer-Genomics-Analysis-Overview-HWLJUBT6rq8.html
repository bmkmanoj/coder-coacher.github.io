portal which is a platform that helps
you analyze and visualize and download
cancer genomics datasets which i think
is convenient when you want to conduct
research through publicly available data
so let's go through an example here as
you can see there are currently 147
cancer genomics studies and you can
download the genomics data for each one
of them so we don't want to download it
now we just want to let's say we wanna
see the frequency of mutation of a
certain gene in a sim type of cancer so
let's search for breast and there are
currently nine studies with cancer is
genomics data and I'm gonna select them
all here I'm going to select mutation
and copy number alterations for the type
of data that we want to have and I'm
gonna search for the D p53 gene which
codes for p53 a tumor suppressor protein
I'm gonna hit submit
okay so we can see this gene is highly
mutated in many of these studies many of
these nine studies like for example and
this one you can see it is altered in
55% of 29 cases well the sample size
isn't too big but if we look at this one
well this one isn't either but this
one's bigger so 38% of the samples have
the b50 p53 mutated and 38.6% is 400s
183 cases and this one is 36% out of 20
51 cases which is like p53 d p53 is
mutated in 714 samples which is quite a
big frequency we can also select to see
the absolute counts this is for the made
of brick study and the paper let's click
here and see a summary of the available
data
so 36% frequency of mutation here's a
summary the type of cancer in this this
refers to only to the mutation not the
copy number alterations let's look at
mutations it's going to take a while to
load
and apparently it froze hopefully not
for long
so there are a lot of things that you
can do with on CIO portal let's just
wait you can also see the survival rates
in each individual sample the data is
anonymized so you only so you have a
sample ID not the actual name of the
person which wouldn't be appropriate you
can also select for other columns that
you want to see but there is another
thing that I wanted to show you side of
this I think it was the co expression so
what other genes are co-expressed Wendie
p53 is mutated
the reason it takes a while to get data
I think is that it has to query the
database which is big and it contains a
lot of information
okay
it wasn't here I think it was the
network and network visualization
all right so here is p53 and you can see
the network of other genes that are
related to it let's try and see other
genes that are mutated in at least 10%
of the samples we're gonna hide drugs
you can also show all drugs and it will
show you which drug either approved or
not approved acts on a specific pathway
but we're gonna hide the drugs for now
so p53 is mutated in 36 percent of the
cases others that are highly mutated or
Nick 26 percent MDMA for and PR kab
you can see the different shades
suggesting how mutated each of these
genes are and also you you have a list
of them right here you can go even
further and look for genes that are
mutated in at least 15 percent of the
cases mostly the same so yeah you can do
a lot of stuff with the data available
on Siebel portal this was just to show
you some of what you can do here so if
you have questions or if you think I
could help you with with this let me
know in the comments below thanks for
