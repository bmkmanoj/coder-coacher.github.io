of creating a graphical application with
dk inter and Python we have come full
circle and I think the app as it is now
can be used as an end product or
finished application of course you can
always add more features and
functionalities but let's leave it as it
is for now
so in review the app stays on top of
your windows it is minimal in aspect and
it doesn't interfere with your workflow
and it conveniently switches between
search engines which is probably its
main feature so it switches between
Google and DuckDuckGo so let's run the
app one more time have five so you can
immediately start typing once the app is
is opened
let's select duck hit Search
see how it goes ok so it works as we
expect it to now what we want to do is
to build an executable out of this
application so an exe file that you
could conveniently run in Windows in my
case I'm using Windows 8 64 bits so to
do this we'll use a module called PI 2
exe and there are many other modules
there's another one part installer that
I know of that builds executable windows
files out of Python
code so in our case we'll use PI to exe
so to you open up a command prompt and
if you don't have point to exe just tip
3 install fine to exe and I already have
it installed on my system so it should
say that the requirement is all already
satisfied ok it takes some time to run
this command probably because my command
prompt is initializing so yeah
requirement already satisfied now
another important thing that we want to
do is to save our dot py file as dot dy
tappable
from this dot dy or dot byc it might
open a console window along the
application but we we only want or a
root application to run so we don't want
to have the console application on the
side so that's why we we're gonna save
it as dot dy w before making it an exe
now back to the command prompt we'll
just gonna navigate to our application
folder in my case is desktop and we're
gonna build it as exe with the following
command so by 3 minus M by 2 e XE dot
build Exe
and the script so it's TK ab v dot p YW
let's write this should take about I
don't know a minute or less than a
minute to to run once this is completed
there is going to be a folder on and in
my case on the desktop a folder called
dist and it's gonna have the TK app dot
exe as well as its dependencies why do
you want to build it as an exe well you
can conveniently further pack it as zip
and send it to two others that have a
system thats similar to yours and they
would be able to use the app without
having to have Python installed on on
their system so the command completed
and there's the folder dist I assume its
distribution and inside the folder there
should be r TK as e XC so if we double
click it it should open our application
and it does and let's run our query one
more time illusions or illusion quick
duck hit enter and it does what it has
to do
okay I guess this is it for this series
though I have some other ideas in mind
which I might use and another in other
series so stay tuned there there are
some some there are many functionalities
that you can further add to this
application so one that comes to mind
would be using voice search would be to
have a button over here that you would
use to for voice input instead of text
and plus you could also add other other
options here a side of Google and dark
duck but we'll lift this for for other
series so I guess
stay tuned and that's it for for now on
your way out please hit the like button
