abdominal fat progression visually and
by Texas scanner between 2013 and 2016
so it all started with a two-month
experiment between october and december
2013 when i used a ketogenic diet to
lose some stubborn abdominal fat i'll
link to that to the post for that
experiment in the description now to
increase the accuracy of my approach i
used a texas scanner i wanted to measure
the progression of my body composition
but I kind of got hooked by it which is
why I kept doing DEXA scans every few
months ever since earlier this year I
decided to make some sense out of the
piles of papers from the DEXA scans in
my drawer the plot you see on the screen
is a trunk fat mass progression trunk
fat or the fat in your midsection is one
of the outputs of your typical dexa scan
the initial fat loss the one during the
experiment so between october and
december 2013 was the most significant
as you can see during that time I lost
the bulk of fat that was on my abdomen I
lost almost 5 pounds of fat from the
trunk area alone and a total of
approximately 10 pounds of fat from the
entire body in basically two months to
note is that I was fairly lean at the
beginning of the experiment so it wasn't
like I was 30 pounds overweight or I
don't know I I was fairly lean but I had
some stubborn fat that I wanted to lose
so thereafter from late 2013 what after
reaching my goal to mid-2015 I was
maintaining as you can see in the
image and then since July 2015 I lost
additional fat from the abdominal area
alone here's a physique depiction of my
progression I took these photos or
around the time of each dexa scan I
could attribute the subsequent fat loss
that between july 2015 july 2015 and
april 2016 to too many factors some of
which could be a refinement of my
intermittent fasting approach the use of
ketosis caloric restriction significant
increase in my consumption of plant
foods and several other variables
including better sleep however it
wouldn't be appropriate to a certain one
or more of these factors as being more
contributory than others because I
cannot know for sure so and they aren't
very objective measures because I didn't
accurately test or control for each of
them and I'd rather not speculate I'll
end this video with a photo that I took
earlier today that is December
eighteenth 2016 if you enjoy the video
