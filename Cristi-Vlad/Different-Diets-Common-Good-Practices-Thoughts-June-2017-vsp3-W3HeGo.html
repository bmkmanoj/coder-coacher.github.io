the idea that certain diets could
progress into nutritional deficiencies
and they asked what would be the best
way to kind of remain healthy regardless
of the diet one is following now I don't
know about the best way but I know of
some common-sense suggestions that may
be followed whatever the dial you're on
so let me just give you an analogy from
a very recent paper published by the
International Sports science and
nutrition with regards to their 2017
stance on diet and body composition and
it goes like this when ranking
nutritional factors by importance or
impact on body composition a cake
analogy is simple vivid and memorable
the cake is total daily macro nutrition
and my friend nutrition the icing is the
specific timing and distribution of
nutrients or nutrient intake through the
day and the sprinkles or supplements
that might help trainees clinch the
competitive edge now following this
rationale the success of a diet for
weight loss
specifically relies upon sustained
energy deficit and you can do this by
focusing on one or both sides of the
energy equation once you know this you
may choose the diet of your preference
now going back to the main question when
you know what time you'll be using for
your physiological goals one of the most
important aspects to keep in mind at all
times is to make sure you're getting
sufficient micro nutrition or sufficient
micronutrients I know this may sound
counterintuitive but believe it or not
different diets can be
restricted and that they may severely
restrict one or more macronutrients and
indirectly restrict the consumption of
micronutrients that are exclusive to
this macronutrient and there are also
restrictive diets that emphasize only
certain foods like meat only diets or
plant only diets and so on which can
have a direct impact on a macro on
micronutrient consumption and of course
there are many diets in-between that
employ restrictions in one or both ways
or more ways now common sense tells us
that micronutrients are important to
health even more important in light of
the recent research that's done on the
human gut microbiota or gut flora which
is a key modulator of the immune system
and it also has important brain health
implications among others with respect
to the brain think of only the gut brain
axis so yes I think microbes are very
important and one should have that in
mind whatever the diet they are on so
knowing this how can you ensure you're
on a good track
now I stated using a health tracker
application on your phone or any other
device of your preference is a very good
starting point plugging in all your
foods will will allow you to detect how
how much or how little vitamins minerals
and microbes you're getting from your
food and when you know that you kind of
have the ability to self-correct now the
caveat is that you have to track
accurately and not under report now
believe it or not our tendency is to
under report and don't think you are not
included in this statistic now a
scientist tracking
which also allows for better control of
energy in and out one can also do
regular blood work and try to look into
as many biomarkers as your doctor or
your pocket allows you and some
situations and countries you can do
blood work privately or without
prescription and you'll probably have to
pay in fold so having these every once
in a while could be another strong point
in your ability to make sure you're not
developing nutritional deficiencies okay
