to a few questions about intermittent
fasting now let's start with the
obligatory caveat these are my April
2017 thoughts they are non generalizable
and subjective to change in the future
now with that in mind proceed shall we
so question if I were to eat the same
amount of calories as I do with I have
spread over the duration of the day
would it have the same effect as I f
does I have cause a physiological
response in your body resulting in
quicker weight loss now my translation
of this question is I F advantages
compared to a normal feeding frequency
and the short answer is that it can be
if done correctly but it depends because
there are so many ways to do it wrong
now does I have caused a physiologic
response anything that interacts with
your body causes a physiologic response
our inner me leo is constructed to
respond to stimuli from its exterior
whether we're talking about food drinks
temperatures stimuli and so on can it I
have resulting quicker weight loss well
I believe it can once again if you do it
in a right way in fact most people who
prays I have they do it claiming it on
its weight loss effects so they praise
it for its weight loss offense now I
made a longer video version of the
physiologic responses to intermittent
fasting which I'll link to in the
description I also touched upon this
subject
at extensive lengths and my book
stressing adaptation in physiology which
are also linked to in the description
okay next question what is your that is
mine take on the no carb diet or no
plant or a zero carb diet I did it I did
try it for a few weeks and actually
liked it but would still like to do more
research on it and find more info end of
question now from my understanding this
type of that is mostly an exclusive a
meat exclusive diet and I'm going to
quote from their website many longtime
practitioners express a preference for
beef because they find it to be the most
satisfying of all meats but zero
Carver's may also eat pork bacon sausage
lamp poultry fish eggs hard cheese they
askew milk and yogurt because these
dairy products contain significant
quantities of carbohydrates end of quote
hmm so dairy is significant in carbs
come on a glass of six ounces of whole
milk or even skim milk without added
sugars has roughly eight to nine grams
of carbohydrates you can say so you
actually can say that this is considered
significant as long as you compare it to
the relatively very low content of
carbohydrates in meat and cheese for
example but you cannot generalize anyway
I like you and many other people
following many other types of diets the
followers of this zero carb approach I
mean those who have been successful they
swear for its benefits and that's fine i
guess i think it could it could make
sense in some circumstances especially
now i'm talking about my case
it would make sense in some
circumstances if I would be so
metabolically damaged that I would have
food and environmental sensitivities
that would require me to follow an
extremely restrictive and exclusive diet
like this one now would I do it how no
not at this moment and not for the long
term and I don't want to talk about the
potential undiscovered nutritional
deficiencies as well as the
impracticality of this type of approach
with my current emphasis I'm trying to
get as many vitamins minerals micro
nutrients and phytochemicals from my
diet as I can and that requires me to
eat significant amounts of vegetables
and plant foods now I eat both plant and
animal foods I hope this helps anyway
next question I saw a lady that was
fasting for seven days is that
beneficial or even safe is it a the
longer the better thing now in this case
we're talking about prolonged fasting
which is a totally different game
compared to the much convenience 16 28 I
have protocol many people use now the
meaning of the word beneficial and safe
the meaning of these towards has to be
applied in in context in fact for many
metabolically disturbed people I suspect
this could be dangerous and detrimental
I don't know about the existence of the
same the longer the better but I
wouldn't cling to it however in certain
circumstances and I'm at least trying to
be balanced here and for certain people
doing a prolonged fasting could be
beneficial and even safe in fact I did
it myself and
I wrote about my prolonged fasting
experiment end and my book periodic
fasting what else there are many
subjective and anecdotal reports all
over history for people undergoing
complete that every restriction so I
can't like be or say that it doesn't
work it can work but it can also be
doing and dangerous now there is there
is medical literature on the topic but
myself being an author of a book on
prolonged fasting I would say good
research is hard to find and it still
seems inconclusive to me I guess we're
going to stop here for now if you have
questions about these and similar topics
to throw them in the comments below now
