discuss about some of the interventions
that we can currently use to increase
our healthy life span now if you enjoyed
this video please make sure to subscribe
below this question has been bugging me
for more than a year now what is it that
we can do to slow down the process of
aging this is one of the reasons I wrote
my third book periodic fasting in which
I start by telling stories about people
who used calorie restriction in the
Middle Ages to live past 100 it's also
one of the reasons for which I don't
obsess about protein intake especially
in light of the recent research showing
increased healthy life span when protein
is restricted but what are non expensive
strategies can we implement to make it
work until we have the technologies
available for prolonging life
indefinitely do we really want that
anyway as far-fetched as it may sound
this may be possible in the not so
distant future there are a few
researchers whose work I follow closely
last week I received an alert that one
of them has released a new paper that
was in April 2015 in collaboration with
25 plus other researchers now let me try
and translate it into simple language so
that everyone may understand what it
implies the article is free so if you
want to take a closer look and don't
want to take my words for granted which
I would encourage you not to here it is
30 researchers have put their name on
this paper and the 4 i'm mostly familiar
with our David Sinclair Luigi Fontana
Valter Longo and nir barzilai the four
major approach is proposed by them
referred to dietary interventions
mimicking chronic dietary restriction
now this can be seen as periodic or
prolonged fasting or fasting mimicking
diets protein restriction
etc the second one would be drugs
inhibiting the growth hormone igf-1
access the third one would be drugs
inhibiting mtor Syrian threonine kinase
pathway and the fourth one would be
drugs activating ampk or specific
sirtuins i'm not sure why they focus on
drugs to reduce or increase the activity
of these pathways when most of the
outcomes could be achieved by fasting
and or caloric restriction of course
fasting and caloric restriction or
uncool because they make you feel hungry
I'm being ironic at least that's what's
been promoted out there now as I wrote
in my book I am able to eliminate hunger
and I've been doing them with
intermittent fasting for almost two
years now with 18 to 20 hours of fasting
and six hours of feeding there are times
when I deviate from the rules such as
this when I have four to six meals and I
over consume calories then there are
times when I fast for more than 20 or 30
or even for more than 40 hours my
current approach focuses on a
low-calorie very low carbohydrate
ketogenic diet rich in plant foods and
vegetables healthy fats and low in me my
dad is low in me because I don't enjoy
consuming it so much but I do consume
other animal products such as eggs and
dairy my strategy is to consume a
nutrient-rich ketogenic diet that over
the long term is very likely going to
eliminate food cravings and hunger this
allows for calorie restriction without
feeling hungry timing that is eating
force Arcadians synchronicity plays an
important role as well this strategy
along with other interventions works
wonders for me and I'm not sure how we
may work for others now getting back to
the research study as you can see data
restriction has been shown to elicit
health effects in monkeys but also in
humans such as metabolic and molecular
changes
which in turn protect against
age-related pathologies such as type 2
diabetes hypertension cardiovascular
disease cancer and dementia but tell
that to someone who obsesses about food
every three to four hours intermittent
fasting that is AF or prolonged fasting
as mentioned by researchers have been
seen two down regular tour s6k pathway
and rest adenylate cyclase PKA which are
glucose sensing pathways in yeast
similarly observed in worms and mice
these changes increase resistance to
toxins and extend longevity further
research support the benefits of
combining vegetarian diets and periodic
fasting now I would be careful when
promoting drastic Dietary Approaches
because they may fix things on one side
while disturbing processes and bodily
functions on other sides that's why I
don't advocate for eighty percent plus
fat diets or for full vegetarian or
vegan diets and less severe medical
conditions would call for that now what
about protein restriction or selectively
restricting certain amino acids as you
can see this often leads to the
down-regulation of mtor and the
activation of JC n2 while overall
reduced protein intake seems to elicit
positive effects on longevity reducing
particular amino acids is beneficial as
well especially if we talk about
reducing methionine serine threonine
valine there have been studies showing
positive results with the restriction of
these amino acids in yeast while there
have been studies showing positive
results while restricting methionine in
flies and in mice but as you can see
it's not easy to quantify the changes
that result from protein restriction in
humans yet which is one of the possible
limitations of the current study but we
do know that increased activation of the
igf-1
insulin and mtor pathways are invariably
seen in numerous tissues now should we
wait until research proves it
unequivocally I will personally not in
the second part of the paper the
researchers focus on pharmacological
interventions that would mimic caloric
restriction say what again I would not
use drugs that could possibly most
likely lead to additional negative
effects when I can fast and or use
caloric restriction for significantly
better results researchers discuss about
increasing the activity of ampk which is
an energy sensing pathway and sirt1 in a
background of caloric restriction or
fasting which is considered to increase
autophagy DNA repair and overall improve
cellular and subcellular health now I
discussed these processes in detail in
periodic fasting I am not completely
against using drugs but why use them
when you can do it naturally with mostly
no side effects some of the most potent
compounds that activate the sirt1 and
the certain means pathway come from the
plant world and as mentioned by the
researchers was very tall which is a
compound found in red wine is still
considered the most potent without
mentioning all the drugs that have been
developed to activate ampk i would say
that long-term calorie restriction and
or practicing i F and periodic fasting
may be the most effective approaches
curiously enough recent research show
that ketogenic diets increase the mpk
activity even when calories are over
consumed that is in hyper caloric diets
it is also interesting that metformin
was shown to activate ampk however as
researchers point out we have to be
cautious
I know that several healthy folks from
the bio hacking community use it for
life extension purposes but I would be
more prudent about that in the light of
these recent findings in the end of the
paper the authors give a few suggestions
and all reminders on what we may
implement for the purpose of increasing
life and health span now dimension using
the following five strategies but I
would say that if the first two or
followed appropriately the last three
may come as a result so we would not
have to use drugs to inhibit or activate
these pathways of course nobody would
gain anything financially if they tell
you to restrict calories or not consume
food at all except of course maybe for
me by selling a couple of copies of my
books supplement companies especially
protein supplements would go out of
their businesses if the average brother
finds out that muscle loss is minimized
with fasting and it could be reduced to
zero under certain circumstances now
until further research gives us safer
approaches and until some wild
technology would allow us to download
our consciousness and transcend simply
and cheaply restricting food and
practicing intermittent fasting or
prolonged fasting may make you healthier
and help you live longer for keeping
things simple you can find the
additional studies in the references
