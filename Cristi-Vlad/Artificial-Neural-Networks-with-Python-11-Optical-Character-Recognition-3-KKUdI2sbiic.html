two lists so the features and the labels
list into number arrays so we're gonna
start saying that data is NP as f array
of data and labels equals NP array
labels which we'll have to reshape
according to num data and numb or egg
labels all right now we're gonna set the
number of dimensions we need so let's
say num DIMMs equals Len data 0 okay now
we're gonna create the feed-forward
neural network and train it with
gradient descent so let's say an N
equals neural lab net new feed-forward 0
1 4 don't care and range Len data 0 okay
128 16 numb or it labels these are for
the dimensions and then we're gonna set
the training algorithm to gradient
descent so and n the Train F equals and
L train dot train GD and then we're
actually finally going to go through the
training process so as we've gotten used
to we'll define an error progress which
is how we're gonna end up train our
neural network so data all the way up to
num train all of them the same thing for
the labels all the way up to none train
all of them
and we're gonna train this for 10,000
bucks and will display the output at
every 1000 epochs because if we display
it at every 100 epochs we're gonna have
too much output and the goal of learning
is gonna be 0.01 which may actually be
reached before reaching 10,000 epochs
but we'll see alright so now let's
actually do the training so shift-enter
to run this
so we start with a relatively large
error and hopefully it decreases as we
go through the epochs a very large
decrease over here so from 10 to 0.6 t4
and it decreases even further it might
reach the goal
or it might just get very close to it
because as we can see we had an increase
in error and then a decrease over here
and another decrease
just a few more epochs a few thousand
more epochs
so it hovers below 0.5 which is not that
good but anyway
will actually try and see its
performance with this large error
because I would say this is a large
error so it reached the number of epochs
but it didn't reach the ball now let's
see how it performs so we're gonna
predict the output for the test data so
what we're going to call it prat test
equals and and out sim data num train
from there on all of them and for I in
range num test
well gonna print will start with the new
line and say original okay so a rigged
labels and P art max of labels I and for
the predicted so print predicted or reg
labels so the same thing and P Arg max
but this time on print test I okay now
shift enter to run this so as we can see
it correctly predicted one two so two
out of five this like I've said this is
not even decent and to improve the
performance of the of the algorithm
two of the first strategies that should
come to mind are to train the algorithm
for longer or for more a box and another
one would be to use a larger data set so
both of these are likely to increase the
accuracy of prediction now I believe
this concludes our fourth incursion into
artificial neural networks with neural
lab and another series we're going to
the
cuz en ends and deep learning and we're
going to use more popular frameworks to
help us build our models so please make
