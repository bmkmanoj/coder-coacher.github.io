godin zis book tribes that i wanted to
share with you it simply says that the
world is ruled changed and advanced by
doors you know anyone can talk in fact
anyone talks but very few do something
as Gooden says the world is jam-packed
with books and manuals on how to do the
trick it has nothing to do with knowing
how to do the trick and everything to do
with the art of doing it so every person
you meet in a particular day has ideas
about the next best project to start
they can rationalize on the positive
outcomes the potential pitfalls
everything under the Sun and many of
these folks read personal development
books but never take a step further by
developing their skills you don't do
that reading personal development books
you do with reading books that are
specific on the skill you want to
develop do you want to become a Python
programmer for example then go and read
20 books on the programming language
meanwhile spending a couple of hours on
coding every day so this is a call to
action this is we progress and this is
what Godin talks about in his book
tribes for more book bits to come please
