work our way through another
capture-the-flag challenge this time
we're going to try to penetrate and
obtain root privileges on the gist
vulnerable machine which is on Vaughn
hump so I guess it's called Jordan info
sack or something like that so the
difficulty is beginner and the purpose
is to get all the five flags of the
machine and actually I don't think it
took me 1.5 hours because I found it
quite easy to go through so anyway I
started the vulnerable machine in
VirtualBox and as always we're going to
start with enumeration I'm not sure if
we're gonna be able to cram everything
in one video but if not this is gonna be
a two or three part video series so my
focus here what this video is to at
least get a yet a low privileged shell
on the server so let's start with
finding out the IP of our target so just
do a net discover okay so is 0 102 and
then we're gonna start with an and map a
simple as V and map if we don't get a
lot of output with this quick scan we
can do a more advanced scan or a more
aggressive scan using the aggressive
flag and t4 and all that stuff but let's
see I don't think we really need that
and so we have the SSH port open and D
we have an Apache server running so
let's just navigate to 192 168 0 102 ok
so the first thing that I do is look at
the source of the page okay so at a
first sight at a quick glance we don't
see too much here so why not why not
just do a deer buster or a simple Derb
on this one to check for the directories
or we could also try and see if if it
has robots.txt ok let's see what there
tells us so 192 168 0 102 so it's kind
of basically the same thing so we did
the Derb with the common words list so
keep that in mind because I'm gonna come
back to it in a moment okay so all of
these should be checked out we can see
that it hasn't uploaded files I'm not
sure if dirt told us that so derp didn't
CD uploaded files but anyway let's first
navigate to backup
so back up nothing in there let's go to
admin nothing in there let's go to admin
area okay let's also see the page source
so we have the user and this these are
probably the logins for the
administration panel so and we also have
the second flag here so the first flag
is probably in here but let's open up a
leaf bat and write these down so we have
the username the password and the second
flag
so let's see what resides in that flag
directory okay so we have the first flag
here so out of five flags we have we
have the first two of them which which
we got them really easy okay now let's
try logging into the administration so
it was at the root so the username admin
and the password
okay so once your once you have the
ability to upload files the first thing
you should try is to upload the shell to
get some sort of access inside the
server so a simple PHP reverse shell and
that I have let me actually show it so
we have the IP so we have the target our
target and we should also look at our
our local IP here so let's do an F
config so that we can be able to
configure our reverse shell so let me
navigate to downloads okay let's go to
Jordan info sack and let's move wrath 8
PHP into Rev 11 PHP okay now let's edit
it so wrath 11 PHP so we need a
connection back to the localhost so it's
gonna be 192 168 0 what was it again 103
0 103 ok let's save this and let's try
and upload it to the server
okay it's a success but we actually
don't know where it uploaded it so over
here we have on the robots.txt we have
the uploads and the uploaded files so if
we go to let's navigate to uploads
there is nothing in here and they are
probably in uploaded files but I want to
get back to dirt Buster's so we saw that
Derb didn't give us the the uploaded
files directory so and it was using the
the common words word list so what I did
here I'm not really sure that I'm not
sure that I I saw this while I was
trying to find the place the files have
been the PHP shell was uploaded so I
said why not try a Derb with a bigger
word list so I tried Derby with Xero 102
with user share wordless Derb with the
big dot txt which gave us a little more
output okay this this might actually
take or it shouldn't take that long so
we can see the folders that we already
have through through Derb with the
simple common text word list and we can
also see that it found uploaded files so
in case you don't have too much of a
success with the simple word list with
the common txt you might want to try
another word list or you could also try
using their Buster or go Buster instead
of the plain old Derby some people think
that their Buster or go Buster or better
at enumerated directories on a server
but anyway I'll just with this
and goto uploaded files so there is
nothing in here they don't list the
files inside the folder but we can
simply try and execute our file as we
think it is it resides in in this folder
so before that let's just open up a
listener a netcat listener over here so
let's clear this and do one LVP to the
four four four four port and now let's
execute or Rev eleven dot PHP so since
it's still connecting it kind of says
that the file is in there and we have a
shell on the server now this might be
this might be a so this is actually a
low privileged shell but it's kind of a
boggy shell so you can see that it
doubles all the input that that I'm that
I'm typing you can work with this type
of shell or you could try getting a
shell through Metasploit or you could
try getting a better PHP reverse shell
but I found that this was this was okay
for for actually trying to to have a
place to start escalating our privileges
so right now we are inside the server so
I've already won through this this
vulnerable machine once as you can see I
have quite a few reverse shells uploaded
on this folder so I guess we'll stop
here with this video and in the next one
we're gonna work on escalating so
we have a-440 linux and we are we are
dub-dub-dub data so we're gonna try and
escalate our privileges to so the point
actually of this capture-the-flag
challenge is to get all the five flags
it doesn't say anything about routing
the box but we'll probably do that as a
bonus as well in in the upcoming videos
okay so I guess this is it for this
video if you enjoyed it please hit the

I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
