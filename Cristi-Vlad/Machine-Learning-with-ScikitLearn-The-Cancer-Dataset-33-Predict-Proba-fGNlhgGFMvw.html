method of uncertainty estimation in
psychic learn and that was the decision
function in this tutorial we're going to
look at another one which is about
predicting probabilities and it's
intuitively called predict proba so we
learned that the decision function finds
the distance from a given point to the
separating hyperplane predict roba and
my view is much more easily understood
as its purpose is to output the
probability of an instance in our case a
tumor sample so the probability of it
being in each of the classes so how
likely it is for a tumor sample to be
malignant
then how likely it is for it to be
benign now let's be specific and do some
coding as you may better understand this
like in the previous video for
convenience we're going to keep on using
our support vector machine model now to
be able to call predict proba on the
model we have to set the probability
parameter to true which by default is
set to false and scikit-learn so let me
just show you if I call SVM we can see
the probability is false so we're going
to train another support vector
classifier so SVM is SVC we're going to
keep the c2 1000 so the regularization
parameter and we're going to set
probability probability to true okay and
then we're going to fit it on the scale
data so SVM fit X train scaled Y train
and then we can call the predict robot
on this classifier again for
praval will tell us the probability of
the sample ended in the desk subset in
this case of belonging to each class so
since we're dealing with a binary
classifier it will tell us the
probability of the sample of being
malignant and then as it being benign so
we'll just going to print predicted
probabilities for the samples malignant
and benign and we're going to add two
new lines
okay so format SVM and here we're going
to call predict proba on the x test
scaled first 20 samples okay now shift
enter to run this alright so the first
entry tells us the estimated probability
for the first class so malignant in this
case I assume and the second entry tells
us the probability for the sample to be
in the second class benign so as in
probability estimation the sum of these
probabilities adds up to 1 or 100% but I
guess this is not clearly visible here
because we've called it on the scaled
data so let me just output the
predictions for the XS scaled for more
clarity so svm predict X test scale
shift enter all right so like I said
each row adds up to 100% so in this case
for the first sample our trained model
is like ninety nine point eighty six
percent certain that the sample belongs
to the malignant
class and zero point
so roughly 0.13 percent of it it belongs
to the second class so we've got a zero
so the malignant in the sect so for the
second one it is like six percentage it
belongs to the first class so the
malignant and roughly ninety four
percent that it belongs to the benign so
we've got one and the value that's
higher than fifty percent that's the one
that's being predicted over here in the
method alright so this is basically
uncertainty estimation for binary
classification in scikit-learn
but what happens if we're doing a
multi-class classification and we'll
talk about that in the next video thank
