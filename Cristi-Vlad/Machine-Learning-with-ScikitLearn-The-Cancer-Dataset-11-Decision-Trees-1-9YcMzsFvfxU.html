learning how to work with decision trees
for machine learning in Sai could learn
and in other platforms they are used for
supervised learning for both
classification and regression tasks
decision trees are basically IRR Jesus
is else questions and that ultimately
lead to decision-making depending on the
depth of branching as well as on some
other parameters here is a simple
illustration of a decision tree for the
Titanic data set which is often used for
example fication in machine learning so
we can see how the branching progresses
based on how you apply buoy and
conditionals to be more specific to so I
could learn let me now show you a
platform from the mg learn library which
I'll give credit to Andrea's Muller and
Sarah Godot and I'll link to their
machine learning book over here so we're
going to import import mg learn mat
blood Lib and we're going to use the
magic command mat blood Lib and line now
from mg learn we're going to plot
something so plot plot tree not monotone
to show you an example of decision tree
in scikit-learn okay so this is
basically an example of a tree with the
depth of two and these two lines denote
the decision boundary now the top over
here represents the root these are
intermediate nodes or split nodes and
these are the leaves
of the tree overall this describes the
the branching of the tree now it is
important to mention a term which is
used in decision tree classifiers and
this term is the pure leaf or the leaf
that contains points that all share the
same target values so if you build them
branch trees until all these are pure
you're basically overfitting your model
so and your model becomes very complex
and we'll discuss this in a later video
now let's turn to applying a decision
tree classifier to our cancer data set
and we're going to start doing the usual
imports so from SK learn we'll start
with the data set import load breast
cancer we're going to import the
decision tree classifier from SK learn
tree we're also going to import from
model selection train test split to
split our data now let's start with
instantiating the data set and then
splitting the data in to train and test
subsets the usual cancer data cancer
target we're going to stratify by cancer
target and the random state is going to
be 42 now we're going to instantiate or
create our classifier with a random
state of zero
in this case and we're gone a training
or fit it into our data onto the data so
tree fit on to the Train subset and
we're going to finish off by printing
the accuracy on the training subside so
accuracy under tuning subset we're going
to use three fixed points so score X
train y train we're going to do the same
thing for our subs test subset accuracy
on the test subset three fixed points
format three score X test wine tests now
hopefully everything is written
correctly now let's run this with
shift-enter
okay so the accuracy on the train subset
is 100% because all the leaves are pure
so the branching of the tree basically
went all the way down until the
algorithm could memorize and fit all the
labels so we're clearly dealing with
overfitting here now in the next video
we'll learn how to tune in the
parameters of the decision tree
classifier to prevent this from
happening and also to optimize its
accuracy so if you enjoyed this video
please give me a thumbs up and subscribe
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
