org which is a platform that allows
security researchers to assess their
penetration testing skills in a safe and
legal environment so why would you want
to be a security researcher well first
of all the world needs security
researchers and it needs them urgently
because as more devices join the
internet of things the internet of
vulnerable things they need for security
researchers and penetration testers will
increase and I'm very confident about
this
so to start up you would want to read as
much as possible on this topic and
there's a lot of it there is a lot of
information on this online a lot of free
information so I don't have to tell you
how to search for stuff once you get
yourself familiar with the concepts and
what penetration testing is I think I
think you can also find a lot of good
information on the forums here it's
categorized based on different topics so
once you get yourself familiarize with
what penetration testing you can start
doing the challenges you can start going
through the challenges which currently
which are more than 200 or so challenges
right now so you can start with the easy
ones and make your way through through
them as you progress and as you become
more familiar and as you increase your
skills I think the ultimate goal here
would be to get into the capture the
flags
um challenges which are these live
virtual machines that you have to get
into they are online live targets so
these are more complex challenges
because you have to adopt a systems
approach to your plan tests you have to
scan scan the target look for open ports
find vulnerabilities try to get into the
system try to escalate your privileges
once you have the route you have to look
for the validation flag wherever that is
supposed to be so there's a lot of stuff
that you can do on this platform which
is why I'm excited about it because I
also I only recently learned about it so
just a few days ago so yeah this is it
hope you enjoyed the video and thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
