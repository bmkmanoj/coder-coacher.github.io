our first machine learning algorithm on
the cancer data set I want to reiterate
the big picture of machine learning
particular to this case so how does the
process look like from a 10,000 feet
perspective well first you got to have
the data in this case the cancer data
set then you have to select an algorithm
or classifier that you're going to train
on the data set and usually this this
type of process outline applies to most
machine learning projects then after you
have selected an algorithm or classifier
that you're going to train on the data
set you'll train the algorithm so that's
number three and you'll check its
accuracy and optimize its parameters
whenever it's possible if you are not
satisfied with the results that yields
so for this you've got to know how the
algorithm learns and you should also
know some linear algebra in this case
then number four is the actual
predictions so this is when you're going
to make predictions which are trained
algorithm on on new data ok so I wanted
a bit deeper into how the algorithm
usually learns so in our case I just
opened the raw data set here not the one
that's already loaded which I could
learn but the wrong one and let me just
print out the last ten values for that I
use the tail and then the last ten
values because I found that the data is
more homogeneous at the end okay so we
have the features for each tumor so
radius mean texture parameter and so on
and the labels
which is benign or malignant so features
all of these all the way up to the last
one about 30 features and the targets
the diagnosis this is what we're looking
for
so the algorithm the one that we're
going to select will look at these so at
the features and targets or labels for
each for each sample and we'll try to
generalize it will learn to associate a
certain pattern of features with a label
whether it's malignant or benign
once it's accurate we can use it on new
data so we'll show it a new set of
features descriptive of a new sample and
ask it to classify or predict a sample
as being malignant or benign based on
what it learned during its training now
hopefully this gives you a more accurate
view of the entire process which as I
said applies in many machine learning
projects in the next video we'll use the
K nearest neighbors classifier on our
data so if you enjoyed this video please
