specific machine learning example would
scikit-learn once again I'm on Windows
then with Python 3.5 installed and we're
going to use ipython or Jupiter
notebooks for this tutorial series if
you want to follow along make sure you
live install so I can learn and you do
it correctly and also fit install math
block Lib which we're going to use for
plotting other dependencies may come
along as we get deeper into this series
also I'll post these ipython notebooks
on my github so I'll link them in the
description now let's do our imports
first we're going to import data set so
from SK learn data sets import load
breast cancer okay then the first
classifier or machine learning algorithm
that we're going to test or use is K&amp;amp;N
so K nearest neighbor so from SK learn
neighbors import' k neighbors classifier
then the train test split which is used
to split the data into training and
tests as you might remember I said in
the previous video that we cannot train
and test the classifier on the same
subset of data as it would yield 100%
accuracy and it may be inaccurate
since it's not exposed to new data so
from SK learn model selection import
train test split and finally for now
we'll import matplotlib pipe lot SPL T
and we'll specify the display the graphs
within the notebook with the magic
command mess blood lab and line okay now
shift enter to run the cell so no error
everything went okay now let's load our
data set into a variable say cancer is
load breast cancer then I think about
Queens and pre-processed scikit-learn
data sets is that some of them have
descriptions which we can access in the
following way so let me just print
cancer des C on and run this and we get
a nice overview and some some details of
this this data set so the references for
the papers and descriptions summary
statistics for each sample as well as
for the entire data set and we're going
to look into this clean version of the
data set compared to a raw CSV version
in the next video and that raw CSV
version is available on the internet you
can also use that one so the raw version
this data set would thank you learn but
you can use it with other machine
learning libraries and programming
languages as well one thing is that
you'll have to clean and ready the data
yourself so I guess that's it for this
video please hit the thumbs up and
subscribe thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
