tutorial with scikit-learn
in the previous video we scaled our
cancer data set and set it to a support
vector classifier now the performance is
improved compared to that on the
unscaled data as you can see here but
right now we are in an under fitting
scenario we use our classifier with all
its default parameters now the question
is what hyper parameter should we try
adjusting first and see if we can
improve the performance of the algorithm
and one of the possible answers is that
we could easily try adjusting C or gamma
which both control the complexity of the
model now how about we increase C to
1000 and we can see its default value
here is 1 now increasing C to 1000 will
lead to a more complex model right so
how do we do this once again we simply
define an SVC and the only thing we're
doing here different is that we set C to
1000 and then we fit it or train it onto
the scaled data so x-raying scaled white
train and then evaluate its performance
so let's just copy paste these over here
we don't have to modify anything and
shift enter to run this cell okay now
the performance is much better
we are not overfitting and we are not
under fitting and there is also a small
but good discrepancy between the
accuracies on the training and test
subsets now at this point we could use
the curve
settings and the current model to
evaluate new data should this be further
improved is just a matter of preference
now if you ask me I think we're good to
go with what we have here all right
in the next video we'll recap some of
the strong and weak points of support
vector machines and probably move on to
other concepts of machine learning as
