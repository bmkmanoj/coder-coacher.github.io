to install modules by a bit so let's say
we want to install speech recognition
which is a voice and speech recognition
engine that works with different API
it's like Google Bing W width AI and
also IBM once in any way so to install
this by app it you open up you open up a
command prompt and just go pip install
speech recognition hit enter and it
usually installs I mean not usually but
it installs window when using this
command it installs the latest version
of the of the module so uninstall it so
pip uninstalled speech recognition yes
so I uninstalled it and let's say we
want to install a custom version I know
that speech recognition as a version
three point four point six so how do we
do this it's bit install speech
recognition equals equals three point
four point six
okay so to check to check and see the
modules that you have installed for your
Python you just go and run the command
bit list and it it outputs a list of
commands and the versions of the mod a
list of modules and their versions so in
this case we have speech recognition
three point four point six now let's say
we want to upgrade to the latest version
so instead of uninstalling it and just
doing to install speech recognition I
could just do pip install speech
recognition and the option is upgrade
and now we do a big list and it has the
latest version installed now to check if
the installation went okay you open up a
Python shell so in this case just do PI
and try to import the module import
speech and in this case speech
recognition is imported as underscore
speech underscore recognition import
speech recognition as US arm I think
yeah so if nothing goes wrong this is
the output that that you're going to
have you know execute Python shell so
yeah that's how you install upgrade
uninstall and check the versions of the
modules that you have with your Python
installation by a pet if you enjoy the
