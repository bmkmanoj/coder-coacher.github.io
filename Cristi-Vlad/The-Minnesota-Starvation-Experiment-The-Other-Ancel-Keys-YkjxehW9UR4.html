to talk about the Minnesota starvation
experiment which was conducted by Ansel
keys and his colleagues in the 1940s now
if you enjoyed the video please hit the
subscribe button below we live in a
world today that is supersaturated with
food eating every couple of hours is the
norm for most folks no wonder there are
more people dying from food trigger
diseases such as type 2 diabetes obesity
and other diseases of the metabolic
syndrome then of starvation food
saturation became reality only in the
past few decades in fact one of the
checkpoints of food scarcity if I may of
the 20th century is represented by the
years during an immediate World War two
during the 1940s and selkies who was a
scientist with degrees in economics
political science and zoology started
conducting experiments in human
physiology he was studying
semi-starvation to gain insight into the
physical and psychological effects of
starvation and the problem of refeeding
civilians who had been starved during
the world it was for a good cause from
what I see Ansel keys and his colleagues
wanted to determine efficient strategies
for the victims of famine of World War
two their studies and experiments ended
into voluminous books of 1,400 pages
most folks know Ancel Keys as the
villain who misguided the whole world
through his seven countries study where
he examined the diets of 22 countries
for a better insight on the link between
cholesterol intake and cardiovascular
disease so far so good but the events
followed a wrong way when Keyes
published the data only from seven
countries and not the 22 this data that
would prove a linear
apparently causal relationship between
cholesterol intake and cardiovascular
disease meaning that higher cholesterol
intake would lead to more chances of
developing cardiovascular disease when
other researchers wanted to see if the
data Keys presented was legit
they accessed the same databases and
when they introduced the data from all
the 22 countries their findings were
different from cases they found our
relationship between cholesterol intake
and cardiovascular disease but the harm
was already made and everybody started
following a fat phobic dietary approach
this is the Ancel keys you may have
heard of recently but now let's meet the
keys of the 1940s a different one so in
November 1944 Ancel keys and his team of
scientists recruited 36 male subjects
who were between twenty and thirty three
years old they were to participate in a
study that would last for approximately
a year the study would try to mimic the
conditions of people affected by the
global conflicts of those times
so these subjects were first put on a
controlled diet that lasted for three
months
this was faced phase one did that aim
for about 3500 kilocalories and included
as exercise approximately 20 miles of
walking per week the researchers led by
Keyes wanted their subjects to lose 25%
body weight during this initial phase
it's interesting how they could lose
this much while overeating anyway the
interesting part follows in the second
phase of the experiment this second
phase lasted for six months and the
subjects had to follow a semi starvation
diet from February 1945 until July the
very same year another interesting note
is that the semi-starvation protocol
included 1570 kilo calories or calories
by personal reference this is nowhere
near what I would call a semi starvation
so if you're in nutritional ketosis you
wouldn't consider yourself semi starved
by consuming 1500 or 1600 kilocalories
provided that you have given enough time
to adapt to this metabolic state now
back to the study the foods they
consumed in this phase were similar to
the ones of people who experienced the
negative effects of World War two and
they included potatoes cabbage sugar jam
bread oatmeal jello and macaroni they
very rarely consumed minute amounts of
dairy and meat so very small amounts of
these food products the third part of
the experiment was the rehabilitation
phase and it lasted for three months
between July and October 1945 during
this time the subjects consumed between
2500 and 3500 calories and they were
assigned to different intake groups some
of them consumed more to the lower and
while others consumed more to the upper
end of the kcals spectrum finally the
last part of the experiment was an
uncontrolled rehabilitation phase I
didn't mention it in this slide where
the subject could consume as much food
as they wanted and some of them went
even as high as 10,000 calories per day
now that's very difficult if you ask me
and it will most likely involve force
feeding but it it could also be because
of impulsive eating triggered by the
fear of hunger from the semi-starvation
phase now kids and colleagues reported
that the most dramatic changes they've
seen in these subjects were during the
semi-starvation phase as weight went off
the physical aspect degraded with lower
core body temperature a poor diet and
poor rate heart rate variability
they lost their sex drive and stamina
and became disengaged and this
interested in many
specs of their lives I suspect this may
not have happened had they been put on a
low-calorie well-formulated ketogenic
diet but I may be wrong they may have
not felt hungry at all instead with
their strategy many of the subjects
developed obsessive thoughts about food
as you can see in the quote and they
tried substituting foods with consuming
enormous amounts of water excessively
chewing gum excessive consuming coffee
and tea and smoking heavily some of them
consumed as many as 40 packs of chewing
gums yes packages every day they would
chew gum until they felt the last bit of
sweetness and flavor and then discharge
it now the researchers had to limit
chewing gum used to two packs a day
others consumed approximately 15 cups of
tea or coffee per day that is 15
researchers had to input additional
restrictions it's interesting that they
weren't allowed to use sugar to sweeten
their drinks but they could consume
white sugar with their meals I would say
this contributed to their insulin
triggered hunger pangs and also to their
obsessive food thoughts anyway I think
they consumed a poor diet altogether at
the beginning of this semi starvation
phase which is the second phase of the
experiment they could spend time alone
whenever they wanted but as their
situation got worse researchers had them
accompanied by someone a body when
attending events outside the research
facility this was to keep them under
observation most of the time now I
refrain from judging the ethics of this
experiment which is why I don't want to
go into too many details about the
contents of what they ate but it seems
to me that the purpose of the study
deserves more importance and insight it
may be laudable to try to find efficient
strategies to help the victims of
war now I will only briefly get into the
specifics of what they ate because I
want to provide some reference for
better alternatives as we can see their
diets seem to focus on refined
carbohydrates as the major macronutrient
to be consumed I'd say there is nothing
wrong with having your diet focus on
carbohydrates but not refined so they
could have emphasized on the consumption
of complex carbs and high-fiber foods
but then they wouldn't have mimicked the
conditions of war probably now eating
bread jam macaroni and plain sugar I
don't know the control phase of the
study reveals that their satisfaction
and satiety point with this dietary
protocol is somewhere at 3,500 calories
imagine what these subjects experienced
when they were put at 1500 calories per
day during the semi-starvation phase now
similarly I usually consume between 1400
and 1700 calories per day with many
exceptions and alterations my diet is
very low-carb ketogenic moderate to low
protein i eat many plant foods and
little meat i consume eggs and some
dairy and I'm never hungry though I'm in
a caloric deficit most of the time and
I've been doing this for more than two
years at this point as for these
subjects eating 1570 calories per day
with emphasis on refined carbohydrates
this would most likely stimulate their
hunger tremendously insulin is one of
the primary drivers of hunger along with
its interplay with other hunger
regulating factors these subjects were
not efficiently tapping into their
adipose tissue they most likely never
entered ketosis and they may have also
catabolized muscle mass as a result this
could explain their significantly
low-quality physiologic and
psychological states sadly this
experiment is the opposite of
prolonged fasting experiment will lead
to the subjects of the Minnesota
experiment felt much hungrier than an
average person would undergo water only
fasting for days at length in fact
during prolonged fasting which is more
than 48 hours hunger is the least of
problems
most people don't feel hungry as long as
they are in ketosis and as long as they
have sufficient body fat to fill this
state now the study ends by saying that
it took the subjects a lot of time and
force-feeding
which is prolonged overconsumption of
food to return their physiology to
baseline many of them developed lifelong
food convictions and habits I wrote
about this study in my book periodic
fasting as well now if you want to know

fasting as well as experiments similar
