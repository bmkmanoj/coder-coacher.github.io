low-carbohydrate and a ketogenic diet
someone asked us on Facebook and I'll
try to answer this briefly and somewhat
technically so a low carbohydrate diet
is a diet that restricts carbohydrates
to less than 150 or 100 grams of
carbohydrates per day it depends on who
you're asking a ketogenic diet on the
other hand would restrict carbohydrates
to the point where ketogenesis or the
creation of ketone bodies takes place in
the liver now for some people this means
consuming no more than 50 grams of total
carbohydrates per day or even less for
people who may be more metabolically
damaged or for obese people or for
people who suffer from different
conditions like type-2 diabetes for
example so they would probably have to
restrict carbohydrates to less than 30
grams or so now on the other hand there
are people who could sustain the state
of ketosis where the body uses ketone
bodies primarily for energy with
consuming even 100 grams or sometimes
more carbohydrates per day so this
depends on an individual basis now to be
sure that you are in the state of
ketosis you'd have to measure these
ketone bodies and you could use
different measures for that purpose like
blood measurements like urine
measurements and even breath
measurements so in review the difference
between a low carbohydrate and a
ketogenic diet is that a ketogenic diet
implies ketogenesis or the creation of
ketone bodies while low-carb does not I
