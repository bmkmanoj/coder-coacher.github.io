replacing the default icon of our
application with a customized one let me
show you what I'm talking about
so I have the application already here
and I'm going to use it for reference so
that you can see how the difference is
in aspect are changing as we modify and
build on this code so here's the default
feather-like icon that that's in the
title of our application so this is the
default decay enter I can but since
we're building a voice search
application this doesn't make sense so
let's add a bit of a personal touch to
it what I'm going to be using is the
Nikon or an image of a microphone and
the extension of the custom icon has to
be dot IC o----
or dot ICO now I have it on my desktop
folder as NIC dot ICO and I'll provide
it along with the code in the
description of this video so how do we
use it okay
and the code right below the title of
our application we do the following code
so it's rude we are calling the main
application and we are doing icon bitmap
and the path to the ICO file so in my
case is C users Christie desktop
and I see that I see oh okay now let's
see if it worked
hit at five save it right okay so you
can see the difference
it changed now another thing I'm going
to close this
another thing or aspect of the GUI that
we want to improve is the style of the
widgets right now as you can see it over
here it has the default style that
that's in TK enter now if you check the
documentation of DK enter and most
specifically the styles available for
the themed decay or TDK you will see
there are quite a few and the one that I
want to use here is the windows native
or when a native scene so how do we do
this first we have to define a style by
doing let's just do it over here so
style equals we are calling the themed
TK style so we have a style instance
over here and then the style that we're
going to select or the seem better set
the theme is C muse and I said we want
to use when native and let's see how
this turns out once again hit f5 save
and run and you may not notice
but there is actually a difference in
the widgets as you can see this search
is a little bit different so this is the
when and T and this is the default TK
enter style so I say this one looks
better and this is the one that we're
going to go with we'll start here with
this video and and the next one we'll
start working on the microphone and
speech recognition functionalities so
please hit that like button and
subscribe to stay in touch thank you for
