looking into one heart encoding which is
one of the most common methods to
represent categorical variables the one
heart encoder basically replaces a
categorical very valuable with one or
more features that can only have or that
can only take the value of zero or one
now this type of processing or
pre-processing as you can imagine
increases the amount of data and the
data set but it also increases the
efficiency of the process as it converts
non numerical values into binary zero
one values so what exactly are these
categorical values now let me explain it
using the adult income data set which
you'll find a link to in the description
so we've imported pandas and we read our
CSV file containing the data set the raw
file or the raw data set has no header
and we also have to name each column now
we're not going to need all of these
columns for our one heart encoding so
we'll just limit it to a few columns so
data as data let's say we'll need age
work class education gender
hours per week occupation okay and
income so income so age were class
education gender hours per week
occupation and income and we'll use
ipython display which is a very neat
function to view our data so we'll just
say display our day and shift enter to
run this UK so invalid syntax over over
we're over here alright okay so we can
see that the work class feature can have
a few possible values so state of
self-employed not Inc private and so on
and so forth when we use one hard
encoding the encoder will add a new
feature for each of these possible
values of the work class feature so
let's say one person from our sample is
a state gov employee or a government
employee first the first thing the
encoder will do is it will create a new
feature for each value and then it will
assign one to the state gov feature and
zero to the rest of the newly created
features like self-employed private and
so on let's see that in action so first
we look at the original data let's say
print original features
let's add a new line here and we're
gonna list the data columns okay and
we'll also add a new line to the end of
it right and then we won how to encode
the data one hard encoding is also
called dummy variables so we'll just
suggestively name it data dummies is
pandas get dummies data and then we look
at the one hut encoding data so let's
say print features after one hot
encoding we'll also add a new line here
and now we're gonna list data dot data
dummies dot columns all right shift
enter to run this okay so as you can see
not only our work class feature has been
one hot encoded but also the other
categorical features like education so
education here has multiple new features
a gender occupation non categorical
features or continuous features like age
and hours hours per week have remained
the same so they were not hot encoded
the column for income is going to be
separated because that's our target
variable our label but we'll deal with
that in a future video
all right now in the next tutorial we're
going to transform this data frame so
this is actually
dataframe into a numpy array which we'll
use to train a machine learning
algorithm on so please be sure to LIKE

follow the series thank you for watching
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
