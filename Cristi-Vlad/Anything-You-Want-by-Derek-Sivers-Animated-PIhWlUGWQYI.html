won't give them the time of day
it's a strange law of human behavior
it's pretty universal if you set up your
business like you don't need the money
people are happier to pay you when
someone's doing something for the money
people can sense it like a desperate
lover is a turn-off there are exhibits
this is a somewhat idealized view of
business startup but is it in the
following minutes I'm going to detail on
a few takeaway messages from Derek's
verses book anything you want so how can
you operate a business if you don't
focus on money I think it's not easy to
get away from this mindset probably
because the first thing that many people
associate with business is money I agree
with Derek and I think that money should
be a byproduct of a good business
something that helps people something
that satisfies an unmet need which is
the core of entrepreneurship so the
obligatory comment that I have to make
is that in this context I'd rather start
a business when I have at least one
recurring source of income this will
allow me to divert my attention from
money to the customer along the same
line most business owners I knew will
tell you about their businesses by
talking about their second round of
funding their fancy encrypted replicated
load-balancing data server their 21st
and development team they're nice
Midtown office with a pool table and
their weekly promotion parties when
you've asked what the business actually
did they couldn't explain it clearly and
the quote they probably didn't discover
the value of a one line mission
statement if you're a business owner or
an inspiring one and you
dunno what I'm talking about here you'd
better search for a mission statement if
you want to be clear first to yourself
then to your potential clients about
what you can do for them you can please
everyone so proudly exclude people and
of quote if you try to satisfy everyone
you may end up satisfying no one if you
have a clear mission statement you know
exactly who your client is so focus on
that specific target market in your
effort to reach out potential clients
anything you hate to do someone else
loves so find that person and let him do
for me I love sitting alone and
programming writing planning and
inventing thinking of ideas and making
them happen this makes me happy not
business deals or management end of
quote I am also on the creative side of
things when it comes to entrepreneurial
and Devers which is why are seeing this
video knowing yourself will allow you to
delegate what you don't like to do and
immerse yourself into what you enjoy
doing kurt vonnegut's
and joseph heller were at a party at a
billionaires this extravagant estate
Kurt said wow look at this place
this guy has everything Joseph said yes
but I have something he'll never have
enough when I decided to sell CD Baby I
already had enough I live simply I don't
own a house a car or even a TV the last
I owned the happier I am
the lack of stuff gives me the price was
freedom to live anywhere anytime end of
quote
so this is kind of the overall theme I'm
getting from subversive writing simple
is beautiful enough is what I need to be
happy and the more I possess the more
burden feels the less simple
it is is this line of reasoning looks
appealing to you grab the book and enjoy
the reading I'm sure that in the process
you also get a lot of practical
immediately implementable advice and if
you like this video please give me a
thumbs up and subscribe thank you for
