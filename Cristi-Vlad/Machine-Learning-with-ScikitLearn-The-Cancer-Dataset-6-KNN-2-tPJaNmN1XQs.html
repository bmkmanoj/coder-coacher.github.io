our first machine learning algorithm on
this cancer data set remember the
purpose is to predict from an image
whether or not a tumor is malignant or
benign the classifier or algorithm that
we're going to use is KN n to learn how
it works see the previous video in this
series now we already imported most of
what we need at the top of this notebook
but I'm going to start all over again
for the sake of having everything in one
place so I'm going to import load train
and evaluate cannon in one or two of
these ipython or Jupiter cells proceed
shall we
so from SK learn data sets import load
breast cancer from SK learn neighbors
import k neighbors classifier from SK
learn model selection import ring to
split we're going to use this to train
in to split the data now import math
plot lib by plot SP LT will not gonna
use this one in this video but we're
going to use it in the next one I think
now the magic commandment plug lib in
line so that we can display our plot
within the notebook itself not outside
of it now loading our data set or
instantiating it
Lode breast cancer okay now let's split
the data set into training and test
subsets so X train X test
why train Y test is trained us split our
features cancer data cancer target our
targets or the labeled data and we're
going to stratify this by our targets so
stratify equals cancer target and we're
going to randomize random state equals
42 why 42 well Google search for what is
the meaning of life now let's define
trained or fit and our classifier so can
okay
by default it uses five nearest
neighbors for decision-making now can
fit or train or actually train our
classifier we're going to train it on
our train data X train white train all
right now let's run this entire cell
okay so these are the parameters that
using so these are the default
parameters that that's using to train on
the data and like I've said it uses five
neighbors by default now let's evaluate
it see how it went
so print accuracy of cannon
and five on the training set let's have
it display three decimal or three
floating points format can score so X
rain white rain this is how we evaluate
how it did on the training set and the
score on training that is usually higher
and accuracy of cannon and five on the
test set board subset the same thing
three F format can I score X test Y test
now if you are not familiar but since
this is a Python intermediate series you
should be familiar with this type of
notation with this type of formatting so
I'm actually asking it to display within
the string the actual result there are
several I mean you can do this in
different ways but this is like a clean
way of doing it
alright now let's run this shift-enter
so the accuracy on the training set like
I said is usually higher so it's 94.6%
and so with key and and and five nearest
neighbors our algorithm is able to
correctly classify ninety-three percent
of the test data which is actually very
good but can we work with the parameters
to make it even better what if we select
a different number
of neighbors or tune other parameters
well that's what we're about to try in
the next video so if you like this one
please hit the thumbs up and subscribe
thank you for watching and I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
