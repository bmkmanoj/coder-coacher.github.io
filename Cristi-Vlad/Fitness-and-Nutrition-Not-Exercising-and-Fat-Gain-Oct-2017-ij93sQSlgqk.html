someone posted on a video that I shared
on my Facebook page and I'll link to the
video in the description so the question
is along the lines of why does fat
tissue grow if you stop exercising so I
would say that higher adiposity is not a
direct result of stopping all forms of
exercise and actually becoming sedentary
if you don't exercise and if you consume
food below your daily energy
requirements you will lose weight now on
the other hand you can also maintain
weight with no exercise if on average
you consume food to meet your daily
energy requirements but that's not
really easy given the environment in
which we live today where food
availability is like omnipresent it's
there all the time day and night 24/7
waiting for you to consume it now it
requires tremendous self-control to
restrict your feeding but back to the
main question you could gain fat if you
stopped exercising as a result of
multiple factors first of all if you
stop exercising your lean mass that is
your muscles and they may shrink because
there's actually no evolutionary
advantage to hold on to expansive tissue
now higher lean mass may burn more
calories so if you're not exercising and
if you lose lean mass this means that
you require fewer calories for
maintenance so to maintain your weight
however the tendency is to keep
consuming the same amount of food or
even more even after you stop exercising
which is why this could result in fat
gain so it's not a direct relationship
now another rationale which is along the
same lines to what I said earlier is
that a sedentary lifestyle or being a
couch potato is correlated with
increased adiposity because it's so very
easy to eat above your maintenance
calories today and unless you're using
some form of food tracking like
chronometer or MyFitnessPal for example
and unless you're accurately logging
everything you put into your mouth you
will not know for sure how much you're
actually consuming now tracking your
food intake can also be a burden even
though I might think it's not and that's
why so very few people actually do it
precisely which is why it is so hard for
many people to lose weight okay so I'd
say that the bottom line is that an
active lifestyle which means doing some
form of activity or workout for at least
half an hour a day can help you build
lean mass depending on the workout can
help you maintain weight or lose weight
and most importantly will contribute to
better health alright that's it for now
