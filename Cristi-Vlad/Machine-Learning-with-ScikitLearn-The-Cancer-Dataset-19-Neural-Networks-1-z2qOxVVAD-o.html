discussing and implementing neural
networks in scikit-learn we're going to
work on the cancer data set that comes
pre processed with scikit-learn but
first let's go through a few obligatory
concepts of neural networks now to be
more specific we're gonna train a
multi-layer perceptron for the purpose
of classifying tumor samples into
malignant or benign MLPs are probably
the most basic models of feed-forward
neural networks meaning that the flow of
information goes only one direction
unlike methods that include back
propagation or other non unidirectional
implementations of simple or more deep
neural networks now according to
Andrea's Muller and Sarah Kairos is
machine learning book which I'm gonna
link to in the description multi-layer
perceptrons MLPs can be viewed as
generalizations of linear models that
basically go through multiple stages of
processing to reach a decision or a
prediction now remember from a previous
video on linear models that the decision
or prediction is based on the weighted
sum of features X 0 X 1 and so on
multiplied by the coefficients W 0 W 1
and so on all the way to WP the helpful
MZ learn library created by Mueller is
going to help us visualize everything
better so let's start remembering how
linear models look like so we're going
to import mg learn and we're going to
plot so mg learning plots plot logistic
regression graph okay shift enter to run
this so this is basically how we'll just
stick regression looks like or works the
output Y here is basically our y hat
from the function now what's different
for MLPs is that weights are calculated
multiple times so let's try and view
this a let's try and view a single
hidden layer multi-layer perceptrons OMG
learn plot plot single hidden layer
graph so like i said this is for a
multi-layer perceptron with a single
hidden layer which is basically a simple
neural network now a neural network with
multiple hidden layers is called a deep
neural network let's try and see how
that one looks like but I guess you
could assume how it looks like just by
looking at that the single hidden layer
that I've just plotted so plots plot a
two hidden layer graph
all right what differentiates neural
nets from linear models is that once we
computed a weight or a weighted sum for
a hidden unit we are going to
additionally apply a nonlinear function
to the result now two of the most
applied functions are array loot and 10h
so Rayleigh stands for rectified linear
unit and 10h is tangent hyperbolic cos
we're not going to go into the specific
details of these two for now what you
need to know is that the result is used
to calculate the output which is our Y
hat now applying these nonlinear
functions makes you know let's capable
of more complicated computations
compared to simple linear models the
specifics of neural networks even the
simple ones are much more complex and
intricate than what I've said here but I
guess we we have a starting a good
starting point to apply or to train a
multi-layer perceptron on the cancer
data set which we're going to do in the
next video so please make sure to hit
