the days of dial-up modems to imagine an
internet video service like YouTube
streaming over 6 billion hours of video
every month it is difficult for us to
imagine today that lifelike robots might
walk the streets with us working the
cubicle next to ours or take our elderly
parents for a walk and then help them
with dinner Alec Ross this may not
happen today or tomorrow but it is
likely going to happen in our lifetimes
the level of investment in robotics
combined with advances in big data
network technologies material science
and artificial intelligence are setting
the foundation for the 2020s to produce
breakthroughs in robotics that bring
today's science fiction right into
mainstream use and of code in this video
I present some of my take-home messages
from the industries of the future a 2016
book written by Alec Ross a leading
expert on innovation in the past robots
were not connected to the cloud and
because of that they had limited
capabilities but by becoming networked
devices constantly connected to the
cloud robots can now incorporate the
experiences of every other robot of
their kind learning at an accelerating
rate
and if quote now imagine what would have
happened if we were all suddenly given a
direct link to the knowledge and
experience of everyone else on the
planet end of quote
regardless of that trying to grasp the
actual size of the robotics market with
all its adjacent sub markets should urge
you to invest your time and money in
developing the relevant skills 6 billion
of the 7 billion people on earth have
mobile phones more than they have access
to toilets during my travels through
Africa and low-income areas of Southeast
Asia I have seen mobile phone-based
programs that have proven to be
effective for a range of health-related
interventions including diagnosis
disease monitoring
compliance expert assistance for
community health care workers and
programs to promote education and
awareness a mobile phone cannot sequence
someone's genome yet but it can be used
to take a blood sample and transmit the
data to a lab on the other side of the
world and if cold as pointed out by Ross
we are with genomics today where we work
with the Internet in 1994 however
genomics will impact our lives and our
health much more than any 20th century
innovation think only of CRISPR cast 9
for example the genome engineering
technology which I think it deserves its
own video another reality based look
into the future has to include the
sharing economy I think of the sharing
economy as a way of making a market out
of anything and a micro entrepreneur out
of anybody these marketplaces take
underused assets an empty apartment
empty seats in a car or skill as a math
tutor and connect them with people
looking for a specific service end of
quote think of Airbnb uber and other
similar multi-billion dollar companies
created in the past decade what are some
of your underutilized assets moving on
let's turn our attention to the Internet
of Things or any object or piece of tech
with the potential to send and receive
data think of cars phones watches
webcams smart appliances and even
clothing from 2015 to 2020 the number of
wireless connected devices is going to
grow from an estimated 16 billion to 40
billion chamber's predicts that the
Internet of Things will grow to be a 19
trillion global market for context the
GDP of the entire world is currently
just a little more than 100 trillion
there is one huge catch with the rapid
growth of these technologies we are also
creating an
most unimaginable new set of
vulnerabilities and openings for
cybersecurity hacks and if quote so
actually the Internet of Things becomes
the Internet of vulnerable things
implications for you of course there are
any device or appliance you have that
connects to the Internet is vulnerable
so the growth of IOT also implies a
massive growth in the cybersecurity
market which was 3.5 billion a mere
dozen years ago rose to 64 billion in
2011 78 billion in 2015 and is estimated
to reach about 120 billion in 2017 it is
logical that there is a similar spike in
the demand for people with information
security skills what to do well if this
sounds appealing to you then get skilled
you have the internet at your fingertips
you don't have to pay money for
knowledge or skill instead of dump
Entertainment spend your time watching
online lectures and seminars and taking
online courses proactively what you have
to pay though is time and hard work and
statistics are not in your favor
I mean who likes spending their time
doing dull work when it's so easy to do
only what's comfortable if Big Data
genomics cyber and robotics are among
the high growth industries of the future
then the people who will make their
livings in those industries need to be
fluent in the coding languages behind
them if I were 18 right now I would
major in computer science or engineering
and I'd be taking Mandarin former eBay
CEO John Donahoe told me okay let me
just finish off in a positive note by
recommending some of my current favorite
online places to teach yourself
programming and any other skill for that
matter
and do a search for them remember your
payment comes in the form of the time
and the amount of work you put in and
rewards are very likely to come if you
persist now before you rush to explore
these resources further if you enjoyed
