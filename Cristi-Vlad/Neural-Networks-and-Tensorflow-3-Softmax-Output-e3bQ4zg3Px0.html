gonna talk about softmax output Y
briefly well because in a future video
we're going to go through a programming
problem with softmax output using tensor
flow in Python okay for now what is
softmax output well in simple machine
learning projects like for example when
we have a binary classification yes or
no cat or non cat malignant tumor or
benign tumor our output neuron is going
to be either one or the other value
however when we're dealing with softmax
output our output is going to be a
vector of probability distributions over
a set of values that are mutually
exclusive so what does that mean now let
me exemplify this in an appropriate
context let's say we want to recognize
handwritten digits from 0 to 1 in this
case our output vector is going to have
10 values one for each label and each of
these values is going to be a
probability between 0 &amp;amp; 1 now the sum of
all of these values is going to be 1
since we're talking about a probability
distribution the value corresponding to
the highest probability is going to be
the output so in this case a properly
trained neural network in an ideal case
will have a very large probability for
the right digit so it will have a
probability closer to 1 while the rest
of the values will be closer to 0 now a
weaker prediction or a poorly trained
neural network will have multiple labels
with similar values or with values
closer to one another
now as specified in the deep learning
textbook that we're following and you
can see
the description of this video for the
book link using a probability
distribution tells us the level of
confidence we have for our predictions
and here's how our our output vector
will look like so we have so our y hat
so our prediction is going to be it's
going to have a value for each label a
probability value for each of these
labels and we represent this by the some
one I takes value from 0 to 9 where P I
is equal to 1 now how do we do this
encoding
so for a neural network we will be using
a soft max layer as our output layer the
output of the neuron and this soft max
layer will depend on the output of all
the rest of neurons in the same layer so
as we've said the neurons will be
mutually exclusive in terms of their
value all right I hope you get the main
idea from this video that a soft max
output allows us to use a probability
distribution over a set of labels when
the machine learning or deep learning
problem we're dealing with is a
multi-class classification now we'll be
more specific in a future video when we
use soft max in a programming problem ok
that's it for this video if you enjoyed
it please give me a thumbs up and
subscribe thank you for watching and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
