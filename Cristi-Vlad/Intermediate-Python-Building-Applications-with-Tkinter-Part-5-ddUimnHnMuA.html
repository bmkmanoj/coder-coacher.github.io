creating a graphical application with dk
inter and python in our last video we
started adding a new functionality that
will allow for a convenient switch
between search engines in this case
between Google and Darko and we started
by extending the callback and get
functions and in this video we're gonna
finish off by adding two radio buttons
to work with the extended functions so
this should be quite easy but first
let's import everything from from TK
inter alright and now we're gonna add
the radio buttons after bending our
entry with the return key so let's say
my button 2 is d TK button we're gonna
link it to the routes text is gonna
display Google the value is gonna be
Google so we have to make sure if Ben
get equals Google we're gonna do value
Google okay and the variable that's
gonna work with this button is BTN -
okay
now we're gonna use the grid geometry
manager to put this in our to arrange it
within our main application so my button
to read this is gonna be row equals one
the second row the column the column is
gonna be one and we'll make it stick to
the west side of V of the app we're
gonna do the same thing for another
button that's gonna work with that's
gotta be for duck duck
so it's DTK button we're gonna add it to
the root text is duck value is duck and
it is the same variable so this way we
make sure that only one radio button can
be selected at once so this is my button
three so my button three grid it's gonna
be row equals one column equals a1 so
it's the same column but we're gonna
stick it to to the east
okay should be good to go and to make
the app even more convenient
whoa gonna make it that we can already
that we can immediately input text as
soon as the app opens up so we don't
have to click on the entry widget to
start typing so how do we do this so we
wanna readily input text as soon as the
app opens up this is done by focusing on
the entry on the entry widget you should
see once we once we run the application
okay so we'll leave this as it is and
let's run it okay let's see how many
errors we get this time invalid syntax
where exactly text equals okay oh yeah
so it is radio and B it is with lower
caps radio button let's try it one more
time okay so there you can see the focus
is already within at the entry of widget
so if we remove this entry and run the
application one more time you can see
that there is no focus on you you have
to click to start typing but
so it's entry one focus you got it okay
so let's do a search for irrationality
select Google and click search see how
it works okay so the app stays on top of
the the windows let's hit enter see if
there works as well okay now that's
select duck hit enter and hit the search
ok so it works as we wanted to now I
cannot at the moment think of any other
functionality to to add to this
application but if you have something in
mind please let me know in the comment
sections below and our next video will
gonna create an executable all gonna
make it and executable to conveniently
run under windows so that's it for today
as always if you enjoyed the video
