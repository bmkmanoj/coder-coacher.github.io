exceptions that you may allow for your
intimate investing strategy so let's
think of a possible situation say that
you're following a similar strategy to
mine and you're doing I f+ ketosis with
an ayah feeding window of six hours and
a fasting window of 18 hours you're
feeling window is in the first part of
the day and you only consume food
between 10am 2 4pm some friends invite
you to dinner it's on them your
relationship with them is very important
to you and you don't want to refuse them
and you also don't want to go there and
be the guy or gal that only drinks water
the reservation at the restaurant is for
10pm so what are you doing the situation
well obviously you add an exception to
your protocol you go there order some
kiddo friendly food and enjoy your time
with your friends you do not have to
rigidly stick to your protocol and you
might sneak in one or two glasses of red
dry wine which is which is very low in
carbs but more about that in a future
lecture situations like this one will
present themselves from time to time you
have to take them in and make sure they
do not impact your long-term goals for
example if you know you're gonna have a
big dinner at the restaurant you could
skip the 10 a.m. breakfast and only eat
your 3pm meal this way we're adopting a
failsafe protocol without even breaking
your iaf protocol now with this move
you've temporarily prolonged your
fasting window for another five hours
assuming you've not eaten since 4 p.m.
yesterday this means that when you eat
today at 3pm you fasted for 23 hours and
this would be a great work around
because you didn't break your protocol
you've improved it and tomorrow you
could simply resume your 10 a.m. to four
p.m. feeding window hopefully this
example gives you an idea about the fact
that you should not rigidly stick to
your protocol if social situations
request your attention and attendance
friends and family are very important
however please do not make exceptions
become the rule remember there is a very
thin line between the two in our next
lecture we will discuss about feasting
and fasting or fasting and feasting
which is a strategy that should maximize
your long-term adherence to this
combination of protocols the same way it
did to me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
