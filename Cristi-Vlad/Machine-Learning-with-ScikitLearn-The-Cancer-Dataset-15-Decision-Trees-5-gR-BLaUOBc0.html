disadvantages of using decision trees
for machine learning classification
tasks so advantages first as we have
seen the graphical representation of
decision trees makes an easier
understanding of the decision making
process
additionally smaller trees are better
understood conceptually than deeper ones
now secondly unlike other machine
learning classification algorithms we
don't have to pre-process scale
normalize and/or standardize the
features more simply put we don't have
to bring the features to the same scale
because the algorithm can work fine with
them being at different scales and this
is in part due to the fact that the
features are processed individually or
separately and I think this is one of
the strongest points of decision trees
now if we are not satisfied with the
default parameters of the algorithm and
if we want to tune the algorithm for a
better decision we can play with
parameters like max depth which sets the
depth of the tree minimum samples leaf
and/or max leaf nodes which limits the
nodes of the tree now we can limit the
complexity of the model and prevent
overfitting by pre pruning and or post
pruning the tree and we can use these
parameters for pre pruning purposes now
as pointed out by Andrea's Muller and
Sarah Godot and their machine learning
book one of the main weak points of
decision trees is that even if we pre
prune a tree it
general tendency is to overfit leading
to not-so-good generalization
hence many machine learning
practitioners often use ensembles of
trees rather than single trees for
decision-making and this is what we're
going to discuss in the next video as
