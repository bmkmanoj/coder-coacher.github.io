environment so strong that when we feel
like losing control such as an old age
for example it can shorten our days
control is more often than not illusory
randomness and chance dictate daily
events and the degree of control we can
really exert is modest and so very often
over overly appreciated by formal
definition illusion of control refers to
our tendency to overestimate our ability
to control events it often occurs when
we feel a sense of control over
situations and outcomes we demonstrably
do not influence together with optimism
bias and illusory superiority illusion
of control can be considered one of our
positive biases so to better understand
our perception of control try asking
someone about their likelihood of being
involved in a car accident on average
they would attribute a lower chance for
an accident to occur if they are in the
driver's seat and a higher chance for an
accident to occur if they are in the
passenger seat several theories have
common favor of the illusion of control
bias one is the self regulation theory
and it goes like this in your life
you're driven by goals and objectives
since you plan to reach those goals
you exert control of our situations and
your environment to reach those goals
when and if the plan fails Midway when
you face suddenly changes and when you
are in conditions of high under high
uncertainty and chaos you will seek to
reassert or re-establish control of the
situation
some researchers in the field like
Taylor and brown are you that illusion
of control is adaptive as it mode
motivates you to persist in your
pursuits when you might otherwise give
up now this looks good on paper and from
my personal experience it often it is
often as it goes in real life the thing
is that this is mostly seen in highly
driven aggressive and goal-oriented
people we see this in those high control
people while on the other hand depressed
people are less likely to exert high
control there are more prone or more
susceptible to delegate or give up their
control to other entities they often
disempowered themselves without actually
knowing it
so illusion of control asserts that we
overestimate the degree of control we
have over events in our lives however
sometimes we can control a lot of what's
happening to us
other researchers like Geno and
colleagues in 2011 conducted a series of
experiments for this matter and they
found that when the subjects in the
study actually had plenty of control
over a situation they were more likely
to underestimate it so if such findings
can be replicated by other studies they
may reverse the well-established idea
that illusion of control is usually
beneficial as it was pointed out in one
article and I'm going to quote here
applying for more jobs increases the
chance of getting one exercise does make
you more healthy buying a new car does
make you poorer all these are areas in
which we have high levels of control but
which we may well be assuming we don't
to put it differently when you really
have control you underestimate how much
of what you do matters
okay so how can we benefit from the
illusion of control now it definitely
doesn't feel good being out of control
we may fall into a state of learned
helplessness by giving up when we may
have some certain degree of power to
control certain events but is it good to
be deluded by the illusion of control
bias as it was pointed out in another
article here and I'm gonna quote on the
positive side receiving unwanted control
leads people to experience positive
emotions and try novel challenging tasks
on the negative side
perceiving unwarranted control leads
people to take foolish unnecessary risk
especially in gambling context now end
of quote
we can benefit from the illusion of
control as it may encourage us to take
responsibility in our lives so when for
example when someone finds out they
suffer from a disease they often become
more in control of this situation by
religiously taking their medication and
by becoming more healthy aware in terms
of their diet exercise and overall
lifestyle another example is when
patients in hospitals are able to self
administer medication they usually give
themselves lower doses than those
prescribed but often leading to about
the same effect as with prescribed doses
think about it we have a powerful
machinery standing on our shoulders we
have to learn how to use it now I want
to end by saying that when we feel in
control over a situation we're likely to
take more action even if chance stands
against us this illusion of control can
be positively adapted adaptive and as
psychologist Jeremy Dee said and
I'm gonna quote would you apply for that
job if you knew how little control you
had over the decision no but if you
never apply for any jobs you can get
them so we pump ourselves up polish our
resume and practice our interview
technique end of quote
so you must be aware of the existence of
illusion of control you are driven by it
you and I all of us are driven by it
without much conscious thought you have
to learn how to distinguish the illusion
of control from real control even though
it may be overall positive the illusion
of control can be discouraging you
overestimate a positive outcome and you
end up in a negative outcome you have to
appreciate the degree of real control as
I said when you really have control you
underestimate how much of what you do
matters so it's a never ending trade-off
a game so learn to play trashin aliy
