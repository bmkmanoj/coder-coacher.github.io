IBM Watson for visual recognition for
image classification to be more specific
so what is IBM Watson they say it's a
cognitive technology that can help that
can think like a human big words
Watson basically is a supercomputer
created by IBM which you can access via
the internet for free for under certain
circumstances so let's go ahead and
create an account at console dot ng
bluemix net so you click on sign up I
already have an account and you follow
the process and once you have your
account created let's log in into the
dashboard I'm assuming that you have
Python installed on your system in this
tutorial I'm going to work with Python 3
on windows so we're going to use Python
to access IBM Watson through the visual
recognition API but first we have to
create a visual recognition service so
let's login into the account so what
once you're as soon as you're in your
IBM bluemix dashboard you click on
services you go to Watson and we're
going to create a new service here
create Watson you go to visual
recognition click on it you don't have
to change anything here just click
create well I already have a visual
recognition service created so I'm going
to use that one but in the meanwhile you
have to install the Watson developer
module in your Python so hip 3 install
Watson developer club I already have
this one installed so I assume you don't
back to the bluemix you click on your
visual recognition service this is where
you're going to have to take the
credentials the API key that you're
going to use and Python to log into to
your IBM account so you go to
credentials
ok so we're opening a Python 3
interactive shell and from Watson
developer cloud import visual
recognition V 3 and V R 3 or as VR we're
going to call it VR
now you have to get your API key from
here
copy paste it so copy the API key we're
going to create an instance of VR and
we're gonna login with our API key and
we're going to use the version from 2016
520 that we have our instance created
the visual recognitions instance created
and we're logged in we can use we can
use it to classify images you can either
have the images from your from your
computer or you can use a linked one
image from the internet in this case I'm
going to use an image from the internet
so I'm going to use image instance
classify because we're going to use the
classifier and it's going to be images
that you are Li think and want to be
mistaken let's look for an image let's
look for a one third image we click any
one from here
nice image this is the paradox of choice
let's try one with people how about this
view image we get the image location
called the image location we're going to
paste it over here and there you have it
it should have been classified the this
looks
the results are in a JSON format and and
it looks kind of messy but what you can
see is that Watson is ninety six point
seven point seven percent that this
image contains ski ok let's try and view
the results in a better way by going
down the JSON tree so image image images
0
classifiers again 0 and classes let's
try and see even better by importing
pretty print so we're gonna do pretty
print that pretty print
so Watson is 96.7 confident that this is
about ski 81 percent confident that it
contains snow 59% confident that it's
about some sort of sport 59% that it
contains mountain and 54% that it's
about skiing well I think it got it
quite accurate alright so in a future
video I'm going to show you how to use
the IBM Watson visual recognition for
text recognition and in a later video
for facial recognition so don't forget
to subscribe and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
