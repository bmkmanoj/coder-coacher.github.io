strategy where you restrict your food
intake to a certain timeframe of the day
whoa just a minute what okay let's break
this definition down and translate it
into human language so more simply put
intermittent fasting is when you eat
only between certain hours and do not
consume anything of caloric significance
afterwards so we only drink water tea
coffee and non-caloric beverages so what
does it look like let's focus on one of
the most used I have strategies I have
being the short for intermittent fasting
and this is called the 16 8 16 + 8 is 24
or 24 hours in a day 16 denotes the
number of hours of fasting or not eating
per day while 8 represents the number of
hours when you eat so in this case you
limit all your meals inside of an 8 hour
window you decide how many meals you
have in this window outside of it you
only drink water and non-caloric
beverages you also get to decide when
it's best for you to have this feeding
window it could be between 8 a.m. and 4
p.m. or between noon and 8:00 p.m. or
between 4 p.m. and midnight whatever
works best for you the key idea is to
design your I have strategy according to
the variables of your life because this
will make it easier for you to adhere to
it over the long term now what's my
personal story well I've been doing I
have almost full time since 2014 and I
experimented with different variations
of iaf I started with this one that I
just described and ate only between 8
a.m. and 4 p.m. I also experimented
with eating at night then I reduced the
eating window from eight hours to six
hours to four hours and even to three
hours then I took a break from if' and
restarted the whole thing again so far
the one that I've been the most
consistent with is an eating window of
four to six hours because it seems to
fit well into my overall schedule and
since it doesn't inherently imply
caloric restriction one should try to
eat all their maintenance calories in
the eating window so if we assume that
my energy equilibrium is at 2500
calories per day trying to eat this many
calories in such a short timeframe often
becomes a pleasurable challenge a short
feeding window may make it easier to
calorically restrict but I guess this is
