networks and the 21st in the series of
machine learning with psyche learn on a
cancer data set recall from our last
video that we train a multi-layer
perceptron on our data set and we got
some modest performance compared to the
rest of the algorithms we trained so far
now we got about 91 percent on the
training set and about 88 percent on the
test subsets so we're looking to improve
the performance of the classifier and
we're specifically going to focus on the
scaling of the data now let's examine
the maximum values or the upper limit
for the range of each feature and how do
we do this well it's a simple print
statement so print let's say the maximum
or each feature new line and then format
cancer data max and XS zero all right UK
first let's run all the cells one more
time
okay so clearly many of the features are
at different scales or within different
value ranges now let's try to bring them
at the same scale or within the same
range because this often improves the
performance of the algorithm the basic
idea is that features should have a zero
mean and a unit variance or a mean that
is equal to 0 and the variance that is
equal to 1 now we could do this by hand
which will allow for a better
understanding of the process or we could
use the standard scalar class from
psychic learns as a pre-processing
module now to be straightforward we'll
go with the standard scaler here but I
encourage you to try to make the
transformations by hand if you get stuck
you could look into Muller and guy does
this machine learning book which is
linked in the description or in the
secular documentation at scikit-learn
org now let's import the standard scale
and so from a scalar and pre-processing
import standard scalar then we'll
instantiate this scaler and fit it to
then transform into our data so scaler
standard scalar X trained X trained
scaled so scaler fit first we fit it and
then transform on X string and the same
thing for test the test subset
and then transform and then what's left
to do is to fit or train a multi-layer
perceptron on the scale data we could
use the one from above or we could
create any one and we'll create a new
one and set its maximum iteration number
because this one over here has goes with
the default values we only specify the
random state so we'll create a new one
and set the maximum iteration number to
1000
because as suggested by Miller's is
booked the default two hundred
iterations is not enough for the
optimization to reach convergence so ml
P equals n LP classifier max it's going
to be the parameter is max hitter 1000
and a random state of 42 okay remember
we use random state for reproducibility
of the results now what's left is to fit
it on the scaled data so X train scaled
Y train we don't have to scale the
labels and now let's see if there's any
change in performance so I'll just copy
paste let print statements from over
here and I'm going to change X ray into
X train scale and X test to X test scale
shift enter to run this right so the
performance is much better compared to
the one with the default parameters now
let me show you what happens if we set
the max error to 200 which is the
default value
so we get a warning message that maximum
iterations reached and the optimization
has been converted yet so that's why we
set it to 1000 and there is a however
there is still some discrepancy or gap
between the performance on the training
subset and on the test subset and in the
next video we'll see what we can do to
reduce this gap or in other words to
further optimize the neural network as
