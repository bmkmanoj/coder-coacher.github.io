some machine learning with scikit-learn
second learn comes prepackaged with a
few data sets these are already cleaned
and pre-processed which makes it easier
and quicker to practice machine learning
before transitioning to raw data sets
that you have to pre-process and clean
yourself which can take a lot of time in
some cases and it's not very enjoyable
now this is not a beginners series so
I'm making the following assumptions
that you know Python that you are good
with math and statistics and I'm gonna
put some emphasis on linear algebra and
probabilistic statistics now does this
mean you cannot work with scikit-learn
unless you know it you know math and
statistics well no but if you know them
and if you're good with math and stats
it makes it much easier and another
assumption that I'm gonna make is that
you have some basic knowledge of machine
learning so how it all works how the
entire process works from the beginning
to the end so in the following videos
we're gonna work on the breast-cancer
Wisconsin data set and we're gonna more
specifically we're gonna train a few
algorithms from so I could learn on it
and we're gonna see how each one of them
performs in terms of accuracy now what
I'm using is Python 3.5 with Jupiter
notebooks as you can see here but we're
gonna talk more about prerequisites and
also about the specific data set in the
following videos so I guess that's it
for this introductory video on your way
out please give me a thumbs up and
subscribe and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
