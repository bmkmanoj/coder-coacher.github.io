science stories in the media or medical
and are repeatedly bombarded with
science is sounding claims and stories
but as you will see we get our
information from the very people who
have repeatedly demonstrated themselves
to be incapable of reading interpreting
and bearing reliable witness to the
scientific evidence my basic hypothesis
is this the people who run the media are
Humanities graduates with little
understanding of science who where their
ignorance as a badge of honor
van Gould occur in the following minutes
I'm gonna talk about some of my
take-home messages from Bengal Dockers
his 2010 book bad science
why is evidence so complicated why do we
need all of these clever tricks these
special research paradigms the answer is
simple the world is much more
complicated that simple stories about
pills making people get better we are
human we are irrational
we have foibles and the power of the
mind over the body is greater than
anything you have previously imagined
end of quote
I don't think you could say that Gould
occur goes after nutritionists or the
supplement industry or the
pharmaceutical industry or conventional
medicine or even the media what I get is
that he points out flaws in all of these
industries should they be blamed for
taking advantage of our lack of
scientific literacy think about it how
many individuals are actively engaged in
learning about our innate gullibility
and inborn irrationality are you it's
not that these parties should
necessarily care for our well-being most
of them have an agenda and most of them
run for profit see things for what they
are it's because of availability and our
vulnerability to drama that people are
more afraid of sharks at the beach or a
fairground rides on the pier then they
are of flying to Florida or
driving to the coast and if quote if you
want to know more about these mental
flaws of ours I'd suggest reading works
by Daniel Kahneman and then our reali
if I was writing a lifestyle book it
would have the same advice on every page
and you'd know it already eat lots of
fruits and vegetables and live your
whole life in every way as well as you
can exercise regularly as part of your
daily routine
avoid obesity don't drink too much don't
smoke and don't get distracted from the
real basic simple causes of ill health
and of Court is it really that simple
most people know what constitutes a
healthy diet already if you want to make
money out of it you have to make a space
for yourself in the market and to do
this you must over complicate it attach
your own dubious stamp and of court
I think this invalidates many of the
diet books that are out there
golde occur also discusses at length the
issues within the research community let
me not call it industry and he comes up
with sensible advice what's truly
extraordinary is that almost all of
these problems the suppression of
negative results data dredging hiding
unhelpful data and more could largely be
solved with one very simple intervention
that would cost almost nothing a
clinical trial is registered public open
and properly enforced and of quote for
example before starting a trial a drug
company would publicly publish its
protocol the methods the measurements
demographics sample size hypotheses and
so on this type of transparency should
prevent many of the manipulations that
are done to trials at least some of them
throughout the entire book gold ochre
calls for individual action and for
scientific self education if I'm a
studying math statistics and how the
brain works may not be pleasant or
enjoyable
but it's one of the best ways to rise
above our gullible nature to academics
and scientists of all shades I would say
this you cannot ever possibly prevent
newspapers from priming nonsense but you
can add your own sense into the mix
start a blog not everyone will care but
some will and they will find your work
and of course today
knowledge is free a self education
should be on steroids I give you the
cern podcast the science in the CD mp3
lecture series blogs from professors
open access academic journal articles
from PLoS online video archives of
popular lectures the free editions of
the royal statistical society is
magazine significance and many more all
out there waiting for you to join them
and if quote I give you YouTube watch an
academic lecture instead of mindless
entertainment I also give you open
online courses from top universities
from all over the world what are you
waiting for go ahead take some action it
will serve for your betterment but

these videos coming thank you for
