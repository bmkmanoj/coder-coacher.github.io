to discuss about the processing of
dietary lipids by reviewing the section
17.1 from lenninger textbook so section
17.1 now let's move over to the side so
to be a sort through the intestinal wall
that very fast me to be washed so to
speak with bile salts which kind of act
like detergents and lead to the
formation of mixed micelles of bowel
false and trace of literals or
triglycerides so step one is the
emulsification of dietary fats are
emulsified into the formation of these
mixed micelles when mixed micelles are
formed this enables the activity of life
ages in the small intestine which
convert triglycerides into
monoglycerides and diglycerides so this
is step number two which is the
degradation of triglycerides by the
intestinal lipases
the great triglycerides these and other
breakdown products can then be taken up
by the intestinal mucosa and convert it
back into triglycerides so in step 3
fatty acids I'm going to abbreviate them
as a and other products are converted
back into triglycerides so after they go
through the intestinal wall they are
converted back into the triglycerides
triglycerides then cholesterol and April
lipoproteins are packaged into these
aggregates structures called
chylomicrons which I've drawn here at
the last this is a chylomicron so in
step 4 triglycerides cholesterol and
lipoproteins April lipo proteins are
packaged into chylomicrons in step 5
these kind of microns travel through
circulation through the length and the
blood to tissues so chylomicrons travel
to tissues and in the capillary of the
issues we have a lipoprotein lipase or
LPL which is activated by April c2 from
the surface of the chylomicron and
converts triglycerides or hydrolyzes
triglycerides into fatty acids and
glycerol so in tissue capillaries step 6
we have life
protein lighting which is activated by
April c2 which stands on the chylomicron
over here equals c2 and this allows for
the hydrolyzed ation of triglycerides
into fatty acids and glycerol FAS and
glycerol let's say in step 7 fatty acids
can then enter the cells and if we're
talking about the myocyte or the muscle
cell then they will be used or oxidized
for fuel usually and before in the
adipocyte a depo side or in the adipose
el they will be recertified into trace
of literals and sword for the longer
term what is left of the chylomicron
usually known as the chylomicron remnant
or chylomicron remnants travel to the
liver and it is taken up through
receptor-mediated endocytosis and the
remaining triglycerides that entered the
liver in this way can either be oxidized
for fuel or use
for process called ketogenesis or the
production of ketone bodies and this is
basically a very rough big picture
overview of how dietary lipids or
mobilized and transported we will get
into specifics in future videos so
