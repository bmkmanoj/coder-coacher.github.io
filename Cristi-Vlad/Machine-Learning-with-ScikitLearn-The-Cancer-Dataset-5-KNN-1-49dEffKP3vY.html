refresher on how the KNN classifier
works leaving the next video for the
actual training of this algorithm on the
cancer data set so K&amp;amp;N is one of the
simplest algorithms to start with when
you build a model with Kannon you
actually just store the training data
set and when you try to make predictions
for a new sample the classifier only
looks at its closest K points so K
actually defines defines the number of
neighboring points you're using to make
a decision by default it uses five
neighbors or five K points to make a
decision or prediction so how does it
actually look like I'm gonna use a nice
library called mg learned for
illustration purposes and this is
provided by Andrea's Mueller to
accompany his book on machine learning
which I'm gonna link to in the
description it's a great book by the way
so if you don't have mg learn you could
simply dip install mg learn and then I'm
gonna call to show you how the
classifier works I'm gonna call mg learn
plots plot can M classification and I'm
also gonna specify it to use three
neighbors so and neighbors equals three
I think this this plotting of ganon
classification uses one by default for
illustration purposes while the
classifier the K&amp;amp;N classifier uses five
but here for better understanding I'm
going to use three neighbors okay so
let's run this
alright let's assume this is our data
set and the blue circles represent
malignant tumors while the orange
triangles or the benign tumors as they
have been learned by our can and
classifier when we trained it on the
training subset of the cancer data set
we have a new point or the the star this
would be a new sample and when we ask
cannon to make a prediction or decision
or classification of this new data point
and we have specified it to use three
neighbors it will decide on the average
of these three nearest neighbors so this
star on the upper left its three nearest
neighbors are two benign so two
triangles and one malignant one circle
so in this case the decision would be
benign if we look at this star on the
lower right it's three nearest neighbors
our blue circles so these are malignant
tumors so our new sample or new data
point our new tumor data point would be
classified as malignant so this should
be pretty clear on how this machine
learning algorithm can and works once
again it's easy to set up easy to test
and works good with smaller data sets
with fewer features however it doesn't
do so well with larger data sets that
have hundreds of features it kind of
becomes slow which makes it less of a
choice in practice okay so next we're
going to build our cannon classifier for
the cancer data set if you liked this
video please give me a thumbs up and
subscribe thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
