two more questions here's the first one
do you also eat snacks during the
feeding window or only the main meal and
the one big snack meal so a little bit
of context this question was posted on
the forums of my udemy course and in
that course I presented the strategies I
followed at the time of writing the
course and these involved a combination
of intermittent fasting and ketosis to
maintain a lean physique at that time I
was experimenting with two meals per day
and my intermittent fasting was mostly
18 6 so 18 hours at fasting with six
hours of eating and I would have my two
meals in the six hour feeding window now
back to the question I didn't snack
during the feeding window and I wouldn't
mostly because of convenience but if you
decide to snack I don't think it matters
that much given that you do it in your
feeding window which is short six hours
in this case the caveat is that that
should be relatively strict during your
fasting window and you'd consume mostly
water black coffee and unsweetened tea
thus basically consuming zero calories
now as a side note as per my current
strategy I experiment with one large
meal per day so snacking in this case
makes no sense anyway I hope this helps
the second question comes from a reader
of my steam it blog and it goes like
this how do you feel about skim milk I'm
partial to whole foods because they
contain everything for digestion like
the enzymes and the complimentary
nutrients and skim milk collects the
fact is the keto diet or fats
I'm guessing it is
now I could develop an entire philosophy
in answering this question but I'll try
to be on point
so the entire a wholefoods argument
seems to become a big large marketing
gimmick and it kind of loses its
supposed common sense what the whole
food okay I guess conceptually we know
what we're referring to but if someone
tells you that they only eat Whole Foods
tell them to describe a whole food very
specifically and you may notice that
they find it difficult to do so now
not to diverge too much eating a healthy
diet consistently a diet that is
abundant in vegetables and which is non
restrictive unless very necessary like
for a certain medical condition and they
died that is diversified this is
invariably a good message but going
beyond that and getting into the purity
of food into food conspiracies and so on
and so forth may not be a good
investment of time money and probably
most importantly a good investment of
health now back to the skim milk my
short answer is that it's fine
if you're trying to restrict calories
and you would like to be strict there
are many brands providing skim milk
without other added ingredients so just
the milk without the fat what would be
the enzymes and the complementary
nutrients you are talking about could
you be more specific if you can then I
could further extend my answer now
another aspect that I want to mention is
that the taste between milks of
different fat content may be different
hence the one that you may prefer is
actually a matter of choice
okay now the other part of your question
about the ketogenic diet yes the
conventional ketogenic diet is Pro
dietary fat consumption however a diet
that promotes the state of ketosis which
is less dependent on dietary fat
consumption and more dependent on
carbohydrate selection can come in
different variations and with different
intakes of dietary fat as per percentage
of calories so the type of milk you
prefer to consume can be fit and at
least a few varieties of ketosis
promoting diets or variants okay that's
enough for this video if you have
similar questions you can leave them
