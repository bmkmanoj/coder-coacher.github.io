demonstrate a buffer overflow exploit
that he found in a Windows application
so please make sure to check the links
in the description if you want to follow
his work now without further ado enjoy
the demonstration hi my name is - Phil
and in this tutorial I show how to make
a buffer overflow type say this is a
software vulnerabilities you can sample
language and C C++ and have to work with
in Manatee debugger and mana PI comma
okay let's go to the virtual machine
this is a script in Python first time we
need to craft the program with a 4000
open the software and attaching a
manatee debugger okay let's run the
script copy the content and put in the
software and boom we have the a
de-essing and addicts address overwrite
but this is not normal buffer overflow
because we don't have the able address
overwrite we need to jump ten bytes for
overwrite disabled address this is a
trick for all method in the buffer
overflow safe or we need to jump 10
bytes or 60 bytes or 8 bytes it's just
just a number okay let's see the safe
chain address with the task alt + s we
see the address is corrupt that is good
okay let's sit in the
let's see the others in the stack we see
pointer to the next record it's a a a
and C handler it's a but we have this
four bytes we need to jump we need to
jump with these tricks crush Eagle eager
to equal sorry crush Eagle okay let's
try to the found offset with mana first
time we need to the create a pattern
but that was created it's here okay
there's the restart the program and
change the script copy the pattern and
put in the script again I hate it now
it's okay okay let's run again the
script
again copy the content and boom at the
SA takes it over right okay
let's form the offset again we need to
the task Alt + s and we see this is say
address following address in the stack
and we need here pointer to the next
safe record here we need to overwrite
with B and here we need to overwrite
with C but here is the offset we see be
a zero B this is a offset we need okay
let's try to found be a zero B and we
have the offset offset it's 78 with zero
okay let's try it let's restart the
program again and we need to the change
script again again and again and again
all time
Oh
/ right the first pointer pointer safe
record with B and we need to overwrite
second pointer with C but we've seen
need more bytes for allocated space in
the memory okay let's try again to
calculate the bite calculate by bite
first time we curve the program with
4000 - - and we have three two one six
Plus and say plus say okay let's try
let's run the script copy the content
and boom we have a day SAE and eggs it's
over right
viewing the sack chain address we have
first pointer it's over right and second
pointer it's over right again
okay let's viewing the address in the
stack we see first pointer it's over
right with B and second hand - second
pointer it's over right with C but we
have this for John before whites we need
to the jump but first time we need to
the found safe safe chain address in the
executable model will choose this skin
magic the array because doesn't contain
the zero zero charge because it's a bad
chart he he start with one and not with
zero zero like here ok let's try to the
fund pop operate address
Wow okay let's see what I found this is
a safe safe protection and safe safe
protection it's false
let's run the first because not contain
zero zero like here we see it's not zero
but it's here zero we need first copy
we need to jump 10 bytes
knocks and we need the field code and
these tricks
Junkers n plus n surf plus a plus nob
plus BA plus cross okay let's run again
the script copy the content content and
boom we have the field I was telling and
have a nice day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
