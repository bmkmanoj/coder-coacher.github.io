given day hmm how much information you
are being exposed to through your senses
I would especially assume the word is a
lot unless you are living in complete
isolation now being able to sort through
and filter the nonsense out of the
mountains of claims and arguments that
come to you is an invaluable trait or
characteristic that you may wish to
develop call Seguin an astronomer and
Michael Shermer the founder of the
skeptics society created a baloney
detection kit for this purpose which
contains a set of 10 questions to ask
oneself when presented with any claim
argument or disappear in firm ation I
dealt with the first question of the
baloney detection kit in a previous
video called sources and claims here I'm
going to go into the details of
questions 2 and 3 leaving the rest of
the questions for future videos in this
series now question 2 and 3 involve the
frequency and verifiability of claims
coming from the source I will be
specific so you can understand better so
question 2 says does the source often
make similar claims i will take a line
of reasoning that i often use so
pseudo-scientists quacks and even some
of your friends often engage or interact
with you with deceptive intentions they
take a claim with some previous
scientific support remove it from its
context and concoct their own version of
the claim
and you fall for it most often than not
let's discuss radiation for a while I
thought that radiation is the mother of
all evil I thought that my phone in
early causes cancer and that my Wi-Fi
router is going to kill me not knowing
better i injected or embraced these
beliefs because i was gullible and
following some famous gurus who were
preaching about this the charismatic
type you see research has shown that
high amounts of concentrated radiation
may lead to DNA damage through single
and double strand breaks SS B's and DSPs
and other DNA lesions you can think of
the victims of Hiroshima or people
exposed to high levels of ultraviolet
radiation x-rays or gamma rays now what
the radio phobics do they take this
claim out of context extrapolated and
make it appear that all types and
sources of radiation at all levels of
exposure will massively impact your
health aka your phone is going to kill
you there are many studies that come in
support of such wild claims but most of
them lack scientific rigor and more
importantly they lack replicability
which is an objective measure of good
science and the average member of the
scientific uneducated public so the
average member of the public which is or
who is usually scientifically uneducated
is not familiar with the intricacies of
good science and good scientific conduit
and it may easily fall for any
outstanding claim I personally did
and this leads me to question number
three have the claims been verified by
another source the strength and validity
of an argument or theory increases when
various sources fail to prove it wrong
so the validity of an argument improves
with the number of times it stands
scrutiny or attempts to be proven wrong
plus the verdict on the validity of an
argument is never set in stone even
though you have dozens of sources having
failed to prove your argument wrong
which makes it more valid there is
always the chance the marginal chance
that it will be proven wrong so validity
is not set in stone and arguments or
theories are never one hundred percent
right there are always up to test which
I think it's great so here's an example
of a bad argument all swans are white
now it only takes you to find one Black
Swan to completely disprove or shatter
this argument a better argument would be
most swans are white and when you do
find that Black Swan your argument is
still valid because you've said most and
not all now in your to do list number
one whenever being presented with the
claim resist the urge to adopt embrace
or included in your belief system should
you have one this way you avoid
reinforcing herd mentality instead put
the argument to scrutiny by verifying it
through various sources this takes some
energy but you have to do it number two
refrain from engaging in black/white
binary thinking either this or that and
no other way
truth is nuanced there are innumerable
shades and versions of it so there is no
single source of or variety of truth
number three put things claims or
arguments into their appropriate context
there are rare situations when arguments
are valid across all possible or
multiple contexts and number four beware
of quacks the world is full of them
pseudo-scientists media and even your
friends who make extraordinary claims
they may do it with deceptive intentions
in mind remember extraordinary claims
require extraordinary evidence that is
good scientific evidence so you have to
educate yourself in critical thinking
because as I said it is not a given it
is developed through deliberate practice
now i'll leave you with an advice from
carl sagan here goes try not to get
overly attached to a hypothesis just
because it's yours or because it looks
nicer because it comes from a friendly
face this emphasis is mine it's only a
weigh station in the pursuit of
knowledge ask yourself why I like the
idea compare it fairly with the
alternatives see if you can find reason
for rejecting it if you don't other as
