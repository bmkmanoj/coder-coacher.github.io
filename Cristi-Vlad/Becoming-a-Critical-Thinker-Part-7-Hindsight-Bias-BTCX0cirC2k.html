you tell that to yourself you know we
humans tend to be very good at
predicting events after they had taken
place so after the fact we can even be
called experts for that now let me give
you two examples so you receive a letter
informing the informing you that you
have just been accepted to this amazing
college you tell that to your mother and
she replies of course I had a strong
feeling you are going to be accepted
when in fact you had expressed doubts
about it to your father earlier this
week she doesn't remember that though
number two while preparing to go camping
your father tells your mother he feels
someone is going to forget something at
home as it turns out you forget to take
the mosquito protection spray while
camping when this issue is brought up
your father replies I was sure this
would happen if nothing was forgotten he
wouldn't have said that so this is an
example of a fake hunch think about it
if you go camping and you're to take say
60 items with you what are the chances
that you're going to forget something
like anything unless you do very careful
written planning chances are you are
going to forget something so in this
video I'm going to talk about the
hindsight bias so what is the hindsight
bias and I'm gone a quote here hindsight
bias is the effect whereby people think
that past events were predictable or at
least more predictable than they
actually were this is because after an
event the probability of it happening is
naturally one hundred percent so thanks
to our human nature we usually look for
patterns and give them meaning once we
find them more often than not we find
patterns where there are none can you
see the face in the moon and the full
moon that's an example of pareidolia
that I'm gonna probably talk about in
another video so we employ these mental
shortcuts called heuristics when dealing
with patterns and when we're making
judgments and decisions in the face of
uncertainty I'm going to quote from
Leonard Laden all from his book the
drunkards walk so he says in general
heuristics are useful but just as our
manner of processing optical information
sometimes leads to optical illusions so
heuristics sometimes lead to system
systematic error so the hindsight bias
leads to systematic error as well how
can we deal with it I'm going to give
you a few points here so number one
adopt skepticism and pragmatism even to
your own thoughts and I say especially
to your own thoughts number two learn to
react to events instead of trying to
predict them instead of predicting a
fixated scenario about the future
embrace or adopt uncertainty and this is
something that very few people very few
people can do because we kind of hate
uncertainty so embrace uncertainty and
try to develop flexibility in your
thinking this is how you prepare
yourself to to respond to a multitude of
different future scenarios number three
in dealing with be
we'll give more importance to direct
impression instead of past
accomplishments as modern out points out
and I'm going to quote in these ways we
can resist forming judgments in our
automatic deterministic framework so in
essence these are some of my thoughts
some of my quick thoughts about the
hindsight bias and in future videos in
this series of becoming a critical
thinker I'll talk about other biases you
can look at the videos at the previous
videos in this series in which I talked
about Thank questions one should ask
themselves one facing with claims
arguments and information coming from
other people so the first six videos in
the series are on the baloney detection
kit which is the set of 10 questions
created by Michael Shermer and Carl
Sagan for for this purpose so yeah
that's it for today on your way out
please give me a thumbs up and subscribe
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
