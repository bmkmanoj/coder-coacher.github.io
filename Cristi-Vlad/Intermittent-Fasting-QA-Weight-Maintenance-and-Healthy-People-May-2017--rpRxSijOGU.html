received via social media on the topic
of intermittent fasting these are also
related to ketosis as well
the first please remember that this is
my current opinion which may change in
the future if I am confronted with new
and better arguments and please
understand I'm not rendering advice here
I'm just speaking from the top of my
mind
so that's a question if I do if' and
extended fasting for weight loss once I
reach my goal weight what will my meal
schedule look like assuming still keto
do I continue the fast can I eat three
meals some days all days that's a good
one and now I don't see this type of
question often because most people want
to lose weight rather than maintain or
even gain some pounds from a personal
perspective I've mostly been on
maintenance since early 2014 which is
more than three years now
and I almost always break to some
variation of intermittent fasting ever
since now to answer your question once
you reach your maintenance weight you
have more freedom in your choices since
there's no pressure to lose or gain you
can experiment with different fasting
feeding splits and see which one's more
convenient to you now of course you can
always continue with your current split
and yes you could also experiment with
three or more meals per day it's not
like I am as what we should all do all
the time if you continue with your
current is and you notice that you're
still losing weight despite the fact
that you want to maintain you could over
against you in calories
increase mail frequency to prevent that
so to prevent weight loss in this case
strategic cheat days come to your rescue
now keep in mind that not many people
are privileged to be able to experiment
with this kind of stuff with cheat days
because like I said there are more of
those who want to lose weight rather
than otherwise okay I hope this helps
another question if you have no
outstanding health concerns like
diabetes cholesterol I'm assuming
cholesterol metabolism disturbances
insulin resistance etc and I do keto
strictly for weight loss and have less
than 20 pounds to lose is there any
benefit to extended fasting over a 16-8
fast now great question and this relates
well to the previous one from what I see
most often than not people try out
intermittent fasting as a crutch or a
rescue strategy they want to lose weight
they want I have to better their health
one way or another or even a combination
of these now I may be wrong because of
the availability bias however let me not
deviate from the main point is there any
benefit to extended fasting over a 16-8
fast well it depends 16-8 may be more
convenient and less discomforting over
and extended fast with extended fasts
some caution should be always
implemented because there are many ways
to do it wrong and my current view is
not as safe as many people try to make
it look on the internet and it's not as
easy either now from personal experience
so anecdotally
I undergo extended fast every now and
then mostly for variation purposes I
want to get too habituated with one
strategy or another one type of I have
split for example now whether or not
this is helpful I don't know exactly I
have some theories and some gathered
experience but I don't have a strong
point again there are voices that swear
by extended fasting as being the
ultimate health boosting disease
mitigating tool the fairy godmother
I will not go that far it could be
helpful for your body to take a break
from digestion
if you eat every few hours and you have
sometimes tools now there might be other
benefits and also drawbacks at the same
time to get back to the main point
the 16/8 split may be more convenient
all right nf set for this video I'll
answer more questions in future videos
