large part of the computational graph
for the convolutional neural network
that we want to train on the amnesty
data set so let's continue okay so if
you're starting and you'll have to make
some imports I've already imported all
that's needed in the notebook so over
here I imported tensorflow and most
importantly you want to import the
amnesty data set so from tensorflow
examples tutorials amnesty import input
data and you wanna then instantiate so
we'll create a data directory and then
so and then we're gonna instantiate it
like we did for softmax regression over
here okay so for softmax regression
we've instantiated it like this and
right now for for the convolutional
neural network we're gonna do something
similar so we're gonna say m nest equals
input data read data sets data there so
I guess it's basically the same thing
and one heart is gonna be set to true
okay
so we're actually gonna want how to
encode the samples for more efficient
computing and I've explained how the one
hot encoder works in the series of
machine learning which I could learn
yeah so if you wanna look that up do it
on my channel I've created a playlist
for machine learning which I could learn
okay now we're going to define our loss
function which is cross-entropy
so we'll say cross-entropy
equals TF reduce mean so TF dot reduce
mean reduce me
TF nn so we're gonna access the method
from tensorflow softmax cross-entropy
with lot gets with law gates or logits
and the logits or log its are gonna be
why conf which was define here and the
labels are gonna be y which we've
defined over here okay and then we're
gonna do the training using the atom
optimizer and not gradient descent
optimizer and we're gonna use a very
very small learning way learning rate so
let's say train step equals t f dot
train train atom optimizer and we're
going to say the learning rate is zero
zero zero zero one and the purpose of
training is to minimize cross entropy so
our loss function okay so this learning
rate zero zero zero one could also have
been written like one
II - 4 so 1 e minus 4 okay so it was
zero zero zero zero one okay so zero
followed by three zeros and one now
we're gonna define the correct
prediction which is going to be TF equal
TF Arg max so it's gonna take the
maximum between why calm and one
and DTF Arg max between y and one okay
now lastly we'll define the accuracy
which will cast the prediction to our
desired datatype so the desired datatype
is TF float32 here so let's say accuracy
equals TF reduce me and I want to remind
you that we're following the textbook
linked in the description so a big
shout-out to Tom Hope the author of the
book for inspiring these examples so TF
reduce mean TF cast and will cast the
correct prediction to the datatype TF
float32 okay so we have instantiated the
data set what's now left to do is to
create a session initialize all
variables feed the data into
placeholders and execute the graph to
actually train the neural network and
we'll do that in the next lesson so once
again to reiterate we've created a
computational graph by defining
placeholders using these helper
functions so it all started with these
helper functions or I would say with the
imports I guess we don't use numpy so
with these imports okay so we have the
helper functions the computational graph
we've instantiated the data set and nest
in this case the loss function which is
cross-entropy the training process using
atom optimizer and not gradient descent
then the prediction and the accuracy
using built-in methods from tensorflow
now we'll train the convolutional neural
network in the next lesson so as always
