were briefly going to look at the strong
and weak points of this type of
algorithm specific to scikit-learn
now remember from our previous videos
that we trained a multi-layer perceptron
to classify tumors as malignant or
benign so let's recap they're stronger
points I mean some could consider this
downside but I think it's an advantage
and I'm talking about the ability to
build very complex models over large
data sets and if you have high
computational bar and enough time you
can build really good models fairly
rapidly the complexity of the model lies
also in the ability to fine tune the
numerous parameters of the neural
network and so I could learn is
relatively good at that I'd say it's
flexible enough for general-purpose
machine learning now
parameter tuning can also be considered
a downside of neural networks not only
inside the learn but in general since
there can be many more parameters to
adjust compared to other machine
learning algorithms some petitioners may
find this burdensome
additionally pre-processing at the data
in one way or the other is often
required especially if we use solvers
like ad a.m. or atom which is the
default for mLT's in scikit-learn
remember how the performance of our
neural network improved with the scaling
of the data and it improved quite
significantly
so from 90 about 90 percent
- like 99.5% now similar to sigh :
there are a whole host of other
libraries that allow you to train your
own networks for machine learning
purposes some of them are more flexible
and may fit better to different purposes
compared to the secular and I'm really
sure you've heard of tensorflow piano
lasagna carrots and other specific or
nonspecific to Python similarly there
are online platforms where you can
implement them readily it is likely that
I'm gonna create tutorials with these
libraries and the future but for now
there is still work to be done with
scikit-learn alright this is the very
basic for now for neural networks with
scikit-learn if you enjoyed this view

because it helps me a lot thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
