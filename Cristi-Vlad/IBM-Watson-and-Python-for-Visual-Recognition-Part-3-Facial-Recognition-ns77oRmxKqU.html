visual recognition with IBM Watson and
Python in the first video I showed you
how to do image classification in the
second video I went through text
recognition and in this video I'm going
to show you how to do face detection and
facial recognition so make sure to check
the first video to register for a free
IVM bull mix account to set up your
Python environment in case you want to
follow along so opening up a Python
shell
let's do from Watson developer cloud
import visual recognition v3 version 3
as VR now we're going to create an
instance a visual recognition using our
Watson API key which I have it on my
clipboard you'll get it from your IBM
bluemix account in the section of your
visual recognition service and service
credentials you have it right here so
API key and the version is going to be
from 2016
may 21 Sui have our visual recognition
instance created we just simply do
detect basis
so it's instance detect faces and we're
going to use an image images URL equals
we're gonna select an image from the web
I've searched google images for jason
statham and let's just pick any image
from here how about this one view image
copy image location based
okay so it's instance now let's see what
we got so we have the results here I'm
going to show you what what I've used a
celebrity image in a moment but first of
all this is JSON format and as I've said
earlier it's kind of messy the detect
faces module provides a result that
includes an array of the faces detected
in the image so in this case the our
image was processed an array of the
faces an array of image information
about a detected face the location of
the face that is the geometric location
within the image so it is like a
boundary rectangle that encapsulates the
face within the image the gender of the
detected face and the identity if we're
talking about a celebrity so that's why
I've used jason statham the name of the
identity so we'll see if it detected
Statham in our instance
and the result is provided with
confidence scores for each gender and
identity so Watson will tell you how
confident it is in terms of percentages
about the age gender and identity of the
person detected in the image and the
JSON result also provides other
information that may not be as relevant
so to get the the identity in this case
if we want to see who is the person who
is the celebrity that Watson detected in
the image we'll have to go down the JSON
tree so in this case I don't have to use
a for-loop like I've used in the written
tutorial which I'm gonna link to in the
description I don't have to use a
for-loop
because there's only one person in the
image so I'm just going to go down to
JSON 3 by using image images 0
faces ok let's try and see if we can get
better results with I mean a better
visualization of the result with pretty
print
so pretty print credit print image
images 0
faces yep
so it says h44 maximum and minimum so a
minimum age of 35 and a maximum age of
44 of the person in the image I'm not
sure how old Jason Statham is right now
so Watson's confident and confidence
interval for this prediction is 52% the
face locations of the the geometric
location of the face within within the
image is this one the gender of domain
of the the person detective in de in the
image is male 90% confidence and the
identity in this case we're doing with a
celebrity is Jason Statham and a
confidence score of 92% we are not able
to see the boundary rectangle within the
Python shell but in your bluemix account
iBM has a section where has a demo
section of the visual recognition
service so if we paste the image URL
over here in the visual recognition demo
let's see what are the results so you
have the boundary rectangle that you
have it over here as foreign as height
as these are the coordinates basically
the geometric coordinates of the
rectangle within the image so this is
face detection and facial recognition in
three or four lines of code with the
obligatory ever is then I cannot go
without I may explore facial detection
and face recognition in a future
tutorial with in a more detailed way
with a simple computer vision or open
computer vision which are two different
modules so don't forget to subscribe and
