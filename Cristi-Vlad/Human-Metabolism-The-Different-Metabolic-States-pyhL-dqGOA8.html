the two major metabolic states in humans
now what do I mean by that I'm talking
about the predominant energy substrates
for each of these states one of the
states is fueled by carbohydrates and
the other one by facts of course you
could also use ethanol as an energy
substrate but I will not get into that
right now okay so from a macronutrient
perspective food consists of three major
groups carbohydrates proteins and fats
carbohydrates are broken down into
glucose and are used to fuel a
carbohydrate base metabolism some
carbohydrates are more complex and it
takes more time to break them down into
glucose while others are indigestible
and they may provide nutrition for the
bacteria in your gut proteins are broken
down into amino acids and they are
mostly used for structural purposes
serving as building blocks inside a body
in some situations amino acids can
contribute as energy substrates by being
turned into glucose through a process
called Google neurogenesis but this is a
topic that deserves an entire video of
its own fats are broken down into fatty
acids and glycerol in some situations
fatty acids contribute to the creation
of ketone bodies that can be used as
metabolic substrates as well by default
if you eat like most people that is
having a few meals a day and you consume
a diet that is not the void of
carbohydrates glucose becomes the major
metabolic fuel now please note that I'm
talking in relative values and
percentages here
not in absolute terms even if glucose is
the major fuel some other substrates are
likely to contribute to energy
production but in a lower proportion so
when it's not consuming enough
carbohydrates to power a glucose
metabolism efficiently or when you fast
that is when you do not eat for longer
periods of time your body provided that
you're healthy will break down the fat
from your food or the ones from your own
adipose tissue this is does it this
situation is predominant when you fast
it will break them down it will break
the fat down into fatty acids and
glycerol which will be used by some
cells and tissues as energy substrates
and additionally it will power up
ketogenesis or the creation of ketone
bodies inside the liver ketone bodies
are also going to serve as metabolic
substrates for the brain heart muscles
and other tissues themselves in the body
when there is no sufficient glucose to
serve as fuel for the brain it is these
ketone bodies that become the major
energy substrate in the brain so from a
3,000 feet perspective that is very
roughly speaking these are the
characteristics of the two possible
predominant metabolic states one being
powered by carbohydrates and the other
one by facts so that's it for this video
