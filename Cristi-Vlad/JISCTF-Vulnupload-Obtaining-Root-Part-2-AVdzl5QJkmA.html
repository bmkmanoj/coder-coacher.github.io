the previous video so we obtained a
shell on the server and we have a low
privileged shell which so it's Who am I
it's dub-dub-dub data so there isn't
much that we can do with this whenever I
get a shell on a server most of the
times the purpose is to get to the root
account so with different ways of
exploiting my privileges either through
local root exploits or different
application exploits or through finding
misconfigured files services and all
that stuff but in this case for this
cyber security challenge the purpose is
to actually collect the five flags so we
have we only have two flags which we've
been able to find through the webserver
so in the browser and the purpose is to
collect all the five flags so we know
there that there are five flags on on
this server and this is actually this is
gonna be quite easy as you'll see so
let's see where we are at the moment and
what do we have in our present working
directory so let's get back a step ok so
right now I've guess I guess we've seen
this and we've also seen the flag so it
was we've seen this in the browser and
let's try and see if we could cut this
flag txt so we don't have permission to
do that and we also have a hint over
here so let's try and get it ok so this
is our third flag let's just
this is quite easy let's just paste it
over here and it also says try to find
the user tech Navi password to read the
flag text file you can find it in a
hidden file so whenever I saw this I
thought of trying to find the command
through which I could look through files
using so look through all the files on
the server or on the system that had
that keyword tech Navi or password
either one of them
and I actually saw a really great video
it was a talk a lecture on local root
exploit on YouTube and I found the
command through which I could look for
the key word password and all the files
on the server so let's see let's go to
home so we have tech Navi here let's go
into it and at this point when I saw
this pseudo as admin successful I
thought is it really that when I am
tagged Navi would I be able to execute
everything as admin if that's the case
it would be a piece of cake to actually
exploit myself or escalate my privileges
to root which isn't the purpose but it
would be a nice bonus so so our goal is
to actually become Tecna theme let's get
back to HTML over here let's get at seek
password
so we see Tecna over here so this is
what we're going after
okay let's see sudo - L if we can
execute anything as root so it says no
TTI present let's try and escape this
shell so we're gonna import PT i PT I
spawn then a bash shell so it doesn't
have less try Python 3 - C import PT i
PT I spawn then - all right now let's
sudo oh yeah so we don't have the
password for dub dub dub data ok so like
I said I found the command which is
which helps me look through files using
the key word password now let's copy
this command and see it in action so we
can see over here that there are quite a
few files that have the key word
password in it and the one that I that I
that actually caught my eye was this one
so let's see my sequel compte
credentials dot txt so let's go over
there so CD at sea my sea or compte OS -
eh so let's get credentials dot txt so
we have the fourth flag over here
all right
and we have to use we have the user name
tag Navi and password evil hacker or
hacks our let's try to sue ourselves to
tech Navi okay and the password too lazy
to type it alright so we are now
technovic let's go to let's go back to
war dub dub dub HTML and get the
remaining flag so it was can't flag dot
txt right so this is the fifth flag and
officially this challenge is completed
ok let's copy it but as I said let's try
and go to home and we see that technovic
let's try and see if we can CD to root
permission denied
but let's go to tech Navi so like I said
we have the sudo as admin successful now
I could try and verify if my assumption
is correct so the assumption that tech
Navi could execute everything as root
and I could just do sudo - L so the
password for tech Navi what was it again
so it was
okay user tech Navi may run the
following commands all so this basically
means that we don't actually have to
know the password for the route we could
just change it so let's say password
root oh yeah
so sudo password root enter new UNIX
password let's say owned by me owned by
me now let's try and switch to root so
owned by me and there you have it so
this is a nice bonus we are now route on
this box okay so I guess this is it for
