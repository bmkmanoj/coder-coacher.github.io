the form of my course on intermittent
fasting and ketosis and I'll extend my
answer here as it may be helpful to some
of you as well so a student asked what
is the best appetite suppressant for
fasting well obviously there's no simple
answer to that appetite is regulated by
a whole host of metabolic and non
metabolic factors and there is no reason
for me to try to look for scientific
studies on appetite suppression because
I suspect I would not find solid
scientific evidence on that now
that aside I'll appeal to what has been
reported by many people including myself
so a short and simple answer may be that
it appears that caffeine has a good
hunger blunting effect if you are a
consumer if you do intermittent fasting
and you want to be strict you consume
black coffee during your fasting window
ideally you will not add anything to it
and most especially you would not add
oils butter and other types of fats
especially if you want to burn your own
body fat first it doesn't make sense
second it has no valid scientific report
now if coffee is not a choice
alternatives could be higher caffeine or
higher caffeinated tea and or caffeine
supplements which I think are cheap but
I can't assess their usefulness if you
do a combination of intermittent fasting
and ketosis and you are consistent with
it like
daily and if you're feeding window is
approximately at the same time every day
you may be more efficient at using fat
from from your adipose tissue for energy
which kind of adds to hunger suppression
now this is not to say that I eff with
higher carbohydrate intake or a high
carb diet cannot be a good approach
especially if you optimize it what's
also important is that you consume a
good diet in your feeding window which
provides you with sufficient vitamins
minerals and microbes from plant foods
and adequate protein and essential fats
from animal and plant foods depending on
your preferred approach now basically
you'd go for that that promotes the
health health of your gut flora which
could also further promote a hunger
blunting effect or could promote hunger
suppression now people who are caffeine
intolerant could simply focus on these
letter approaches which requires time
and patience to show their potential
efficacy and and we kind of know that
patience is not a universal human virtue
now to note about caffeine is that it
binds adenosine receptors in your brain
hence it promotes wakefulness focus and
alertness so it's important when you
consume it as in the time of the day and
the type of caffeine metabolizer that
you are and you can notice by a genetic
testing because this can have an impact
on your sleep since fewer adenosine
molecules will bind the receptors anyway
I guess I'll probably get into adenosine
and caffeine in a future video now to
get back to the main question I don't
think there's a safe magic pill or
substance
we'll kill your hunger rather a good
diet in your feeding window and meal
timing consistency and some caffeine in
your fasting window if you like it and
tolerate it
I think these can help as for me
personally I kind of stopped feeling
hunger back in 2013 when I kind of
reconsidered my diet exercise and sleep
and for those who don't know I started
with a restricted or restrictive keto
diet and then after a while I became
more liberated and introduced a wider
variety of foods and carbohydrates
so so far it's kind of a for your
journey so I can't easily relate to how
it's like being or feeling hungry
because for example if I am too drawn
into some kind of activity travel or a
demanding project I can go extended
periods of time without eating and which
is I think it's very convenient now I
wrote about some of these longer longer
fast I would say I wrote about these
some of these experiments on the blog
anyhow let me stop here and finish with
a promo comment so if you'd like to take
the course on intermittent fasting and
ketosis you can find a link for a
discounted price in the description of
