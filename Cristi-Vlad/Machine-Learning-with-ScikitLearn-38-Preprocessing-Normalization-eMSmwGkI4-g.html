another pre-processing method for
machine learning which is called
normalization now we use or we apply
normalization on the values of each
feature vector to bring them on a common
scale two of the most implemented
normalization methods inside could learn
our l1 and l2 normalization l1 is about
the least absolute deviations and when
we apply it on a data set it ensures
that the sum of absolute values is equal
to 1 for every row now l2 is about the
least squares and as you might guess it
ensures that the sum of squares is equal
to 1 will apply both of them on our data
in a minute so out of these two the one
that's more robust is l1 because it's
not sensitive or it's least affected by
outliers and data and outliers are often
encountered in raw data sets on the
other hand you would use l2
normalization when the outliers in the
data are important in training your
algorithms
so in short l1 doesn't care about
outliers while l2 takes these outliers
into consideration now let's apply each
of these on to our data but first let's
look at our data okay and then we're
going to apply each of them so let's say
data l1 is pre-processing
normalize our data and the norm is going
to be l1 and the same thing for l2 so
data l2 pre-processing normalize our
data and the norm is going to be l2 now
let's print the output so print let's
say
one normalized data new line data l1 and
the same thing for l2 so print and we're
gonna start with a new line here l2
normalized data data l2 okay now shift
enter to run this so as I said for l1 if
we sum the absolute values on each row
it should be equal to one so let's take
the second row for example take the
values and some the absolutes so the
absolute values so the sign doesn't
matter
so it's equal
it's basically equal to 1 and for l2
normalization we've said that the sum of
squares should be equal to 1 so let's
say squared plus this one squared and
plus this one squared and that's the
same thing so it is equal to 1 now to
reiterate what I said previously first
you would have to know the importance
your outliers play in the training of
the data will you ignore them or do you
have to take them into consideration now
you need to answer these two questions
before choosing either l1 or l2
normalization methods alright that's it
