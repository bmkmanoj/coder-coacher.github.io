machines we're going to briefly recap
the strong and weak points at this type
of machine learning algorithm will go
along the same lines with endrias
Muellers is machine learning book which
is linked in the description so let's
start with the advantages first I would
say versatility which basically means
that as VMs can do well on a variety or
on a varied range of data sets then it
kind of doesn't matter much if your data
set is characterized by only a few
features because your SVM will be able
to draw complex decision boundaries
despite of this now they can also do
well on high dimensional data like data
that is characterized by many features
provided that the sample size is
relatively small and this is where we
get into some of the disadvantages so
for high dimensional data with large
sample size like for example 100,000
samples as eum's may may not do so well
so they kind of don't scale on high
dimensional data now additionally you
may need to do some pre-processing of
your data before feeding it to the SVM
so you have to work on some of the hyper
parameters and this implies that you
have knowledge of what each parameter
does plus support vector machines are
not easy to inspect and that's why some
practitioners opt for algorithms such as
decision trees or ensembles like random
forests which may be easier to work with
they don't need much pre-processing and
are relatively easy to inspect and also
visualize which is really important
and I'd recommend you look a few videos
back into this series in which I go
through decision trees and random
forests moreover these alternatives can
be better understood by non experts
which are quite a few in this field ok
so as we saw in our tutorial as VMs can
perform well if you scale the data
entity tune parameters like choosing a
specific kernel modifying see for
example which deals with regularization
or gamma for example which also controls
the complexity of the model so both the
C and gamma can control the complexity
of the model so that's why they may be
worth trying all right now that being
said we conclude this section on support
vector machines and in the next video
we're probably going to go into trying
to understand uncertainty estimates for
classifiers and this is going to be
helpful in light of all the machine
learning models we've gone through so
far in this series
ok so stay tuned and if you enjoyed this
