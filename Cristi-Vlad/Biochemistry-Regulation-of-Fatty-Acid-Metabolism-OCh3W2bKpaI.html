oxidation is regulated according to
figure 17 point 13 of lenninger z'
principles of biochemistry textbook so
fatty acid oxidation is a tightly
regulated process cytosolic acetyl co is
in the mitochondria can have two fates
oxidation by mitochondrial enzymes or
conversion into triglycerides and
phospholipids fatty acid oxidation is
unnecessary when there is enough energy
coming from dietary carbohydrate now
there are two important enzymes of fatty
acid metabolism one is acetyl co a
carboxylase or acc which is involved in
fatty acid synthesis and the other is
carnitine acyltransferase one or cat one
which limits fatty acid transport into
the mitochondrial matrix as we've seen
in a previous video so let's go through
these processes step by step after
consuming a high carbohydrate meal blood
glucose levels increase and insulin is
released then phosphatase D
phosphorylates acetyl co a carboxylase
or a cc thereby activating it acetyl co
a carboxylase then catalyzes a
production of Melanie Alcoa which is the
first intermediate in the synthesis of
fatty acids melanie Ocoee inhibits
carnitine acyltransferase one thereby
preventing fatty acids to enter into the
mitochondrial matrix now what happens
under conditions of low blood glucose
such as between meals or in situations
of fasting
well higher levels of glucagon activate
BKA or cyclic AMP II dependent protein
kinase a which is a long name so let's
just call it PKA and PKA phosphorylates
acc thereby an activating it melanie
Okoye concentration decreases which
allows the entry of fatty acids into the
mitochondria where they will undergo
beta oxidation higher glucagon levels
also induce the mobilization of fatty
acids from the adipose tissue thus
providing a fresh supply of circulating
fuel important to note is that fatty
acyl groups in the mitochondria are
committed committed to oxidation so
whenever they are in the mitochondria
they they undergo beta oxidation also
Melanie owe a concentration is higher in
the fat state when there's plenty supply
of glucose and excess glucose that
cannot be oxidized or stored as glycogen
is turned to fat as trace or glycerols
higher Melanie Oh a concentration also
inhibits carnitine acyltransferase one
thereby preventing fatty acids from
being oxidized in the context of ample
supply of glucose as fuel and that is in
short a textbook overview of how fatty
acid metabolism is regulated I hope this
video was helpful if you enjoyed it
