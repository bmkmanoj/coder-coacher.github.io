caprylic acid and I'm gonna test it to
see how it influences my blood ketones
so I've done similar tests with MCT oil
and with coconut oil and they haven't
been so successful you can check them
out on the channel so I had a meal today
that was very low in carbohydrates and
it was like 2 grams of total
carbohydrates and it was about 5 hours
ago so right now I'm gonna check my
blood glucose and blood ketones then I'm
gonna have 15 milliliters of c8 oil with
some unsweetened almond milk which is
zero carbohydrates and it shouldn't
influence the test and then I'm gonna
wait for about 30 minutes to one hour
and check the blood glucose and blood
ketones again so let's see how it goes
so we're checking the blood glucose
first
all right let's see
66 so I guess we should see some higher
ketones but that's just an assumption
ice now see the ketones I'm gonna use
the same blood
the same braking
2.4 Wow okay so it's gonna be hard I
guess to top this so now let's have the
c8 oil okay so I'm using keto source
pure c8 MCT oil and this is the
unsweetened almond milk so I'm not sure
if you can see this so these are the
macros
okay so 15 milliliters of almond milk
so 54 and 15 milliliters have seen eight
oil so let's see
okay okay so down the hatch it goes
all right I'll see you in a bit so it's
been about an hour since I took the c8
oil now let's test again I have no
freaking clue how this is gonna look
like so let's see first we're gonna do
the blood glucose again
what are you guys think
so 16 black widows went down let's now
see the ketones so blood ketones should
have gone up but there's only one way to
find out okay so the moment of the truth
so not even an inch didn't see that
coming
okay so I'm actually not really
surprised at the result I'm not sure if
I was expecting like three point five
blood ketone levels because I think that
to start off my baseline levels were
pretty high if we talk about nutritional
ketosis and I wasn't in a fasted State
so I had a meal like six hours ago which
was about I don't know four to six or
700 calories so the baseline levels were
pretty high so I don't think there was
too much room for increase or for an
improvement in blood ketone levels but
there was a slight effective blood
glucose so we saw a small decrease from
66 to 60 so I don't know let's see I'll
try and test again in the morning
so I
bastard it's the morning my blog Google
should be hi since it's the morning and
my blood ketone should be at its lowest
so we should have some values to work
with but let's see so baseline levels so
blood glucose first
so right now I'm in the fasted State
like I said 74 right now let's see the
baseline ketones I'm expecting them to
be in the 1 millimolar range and if I
take the c8 oil maybe we can see some
some changes the 0.4 was pretty high to
them to work with now let's see the
morning ketones
as if 11.2 2.0 dad so now I'm going to
pour 50 milliliters of almond milk
and about 1 tablespoon so 15 milliliters
of c8 oil or little over a tablespoon
but I'm gonna try not to spill it like I
did last night
here we go
see you in an hour all right so it's
been a little over an hour so let's see
where we're at
so who goes first
what was it 74 76 81 so high blood
glucose let's see the ketones now did
they go down well they were 2.0 so I
really don't know what we expect
but we'll know in five four three two
point five so what do I actually make
out of this well first of all like I
said my baseline levels my baseline
ketone levels were very high to start
with so in the first test we didn't see
too much of a difference I mean there
was no difference in blood ketones but
we saw an increase of 0.5 millimolar
after one hour of taking the c8 oil and
the second test this morning so there is
a I could say there is an effect in the
first test we saw a decrease in blood
glucose while in the second one we saw a
slight increase so I guess it works but
I think I would see more like pronounced
results if I were like 0.5 or 0.3
million dollars per liter to start with
so if my blood ketones were lower I
could have probably seen a bigger result
or a bigger change pre and post
consuming the c8 oil so I'm not actually
negating any of the effects the oil has
because c8 rapidly converts to ketones
in the body so since I've already had
ketones in the circulation high ketones
and I was last night I was I wasn't
actually fasted there wasn't a
difference in the levels now in terms of
subjective experience of the effects of
the c8 oil I did actually feel a high
cognitive benefit of this compared to
the MCT oil or even compared to coconut
oil but I guess these effects would
actually be felt like more intense by
someone who starts with very low ketones
or who wanna jumpstart ketosis I guess
I'll keep trying to see how it works for
me mostly in terms of subjective
experience with regards to my cognition
rather than actually trying to see if it
boosts my ketone levels because it's
kind of expensive to keep breaking
yourself and using those ketone strips
anyway that's it for this video thank
