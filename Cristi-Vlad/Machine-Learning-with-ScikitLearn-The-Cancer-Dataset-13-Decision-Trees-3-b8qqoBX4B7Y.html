on the cancer data set let's see how it
looks like and for this we'll need the
gravis library so you'll have to in the
command prompt tip install grab this and
you'll also have to go to graphviz dot
not com but dot o-r-g and install it for
your relevant operating system we use
graphics for visualization purposes so
let's see how our decision tree looks
like how our trained decision tree
classifier looks like so first of all
we're gonna do some imports so import
graph this and from SK learn tree we'll
import export graph is we're gonna use
this to export our tree so that's what
we're gonna do now export graph is and
our tree the out file is gonna be called
cancer tree dot dot
so this is a dot file the class names
are malignant and benign
okay the feature names are cancer
feature names and two additional
parameters impurity which is false and
filled which is true now let's shift run
this to export our tree
now that the file is saved the next
logical thing would be to view it to
visualize it and we could do this using
ref is inside of Python but I already
know that the tree does not fit the
screen so it's kind of too big and you
have to scroll so it's not as aesthetic
as I liked it to be so what I'm gonna do
is save it as PNG so bear with me here
I'm gonna open up command prompt move
into the directory where the tree is our
cancer dot file is saved cancer treated
and we're gonna use the dot - d PNG
utility so the file is cancer dot the
cancer tree doc and the output is gonna
be cancer tree dot PNG okay and now
inside inside the jupiter notebook i'm
gonna change the cell from code to
markdown and I'm gonna use a markdown
code to actually view the PNG inside
inside of this cell so
the file is cancer tree dot PNG all
right shift enter now that that looks
exactly what we wanted to so if this
would have been at the usual way to use
graph is to visualize we wouldn't have
the entire tree on the screen but we
would have to scroll so it may have some
sort of impact in our understanding of
it but what does this actually in this
branching of the tree tell us well this
basically tells us how the predictions
are made now as you remember the depth
of the tree over here was set to four
and even so the image is quite big so
you can imagine what it would look like
for a deeper tree now as you can see we
have the worst radius at the top of the
tree or the root of the tree and this
leads us into thinking about the
importance of this feature of the tumor
mass then we have the branching into
worst concave points and texture error
however an in-depth interpretation of
this tree is not the purpose of this
video but it helps us understand what's
coming next
so with decision trees we can view the
importance or weight each feature
carries by looking into the future
importances attribute of the tree which
is exactly what we're gonna do in the
next video so as always if you enjoyed
this video please give me a thumbs up
and subscribe thank you for watching and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
