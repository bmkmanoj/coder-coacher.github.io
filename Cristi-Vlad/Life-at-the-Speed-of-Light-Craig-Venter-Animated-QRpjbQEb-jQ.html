digital age of biology in which the ones
distinct domains of computer codes and
those that program life are beginning to
merge where new synergies are emerging
that will drive evolution in vertical
directions craig Venter in this video we
look into Craig Venters this book life
at the speed of light now this is a
fairly technical autobiographical book
with some amazing details from within
genomics and molecular biology it should
be obvious that familiarity with these
topics is required in order to grasp it
appropriately however I will try to
explain key concepts from it in layman
terms hoping to get you excited about
studying these topics in greater detail
a human genome contains only around 6 x
109 bits of information my team is
perfecting the way to send the digitized
version of DNA code in the form of an
electromagnetic wave and then use a
unique receiver at a distant location to
recreate life with synthesized DNA it
will eventually be possible to create
all forms of life and of quote being
able to send and synthesized DNA
anywhere on the planet in a matter of
seconds opens up opportunities like
never imagined before it could be the
code for a new vaccine or a new protein
like insulin or an agent to fight
resistant bacteria or even a new cell
for therapeutic purposes belief is the
enemy of scientific advancement and thus
quote it was the belief that proteins
represent the genetic material that
pushed back perhaps by 50 years the
discovery of DNA as being the
information carrier so according to the
central dogma of molecular biology
information flows from DNA to protein
the DNA inside the nucleus of yourselves
is transported to ribosomes which are
cytoplasmic organ
where it is translated into proteins
bacterial cells contain as many as 8,000
ribosome complexes which enable
continuous protein synthesis both to
replace degrading proteins and to make
new ones for daughter cells during cell
division end of quote many antibiotics
disrupt bacterial ribosomal function
without interfering with human ribosomes
what do some microbes do they evolved
mechanisms to sort of eject antibiotics
before they have time to act some
resistance strains cloak themselves in
impermeable membrane other microbes even
eat antibiotics and thus quote there are
many factors that contribute to the
increase of resistant bugs and with so
many mechanisms of resistance what can
we do to fight back for one we can use
genomics to predict and chart the rise
of superbugs sequencing can help us
learn the mechanisms of action of these
bugs while synthetic genomics helps us
create alternatives to antibiotics one
approach that we are pursuing is to
revisit an antibacterial treatment
called phage therapy in which
bacteriophages that are specific to a
certain bacterial strain are used to
kill the microbe every few days have the
bacteria on earth are killed by sages
can we enlist their help in the fight
against superbugs and the quote phage
therapy is haunted by a controversial
past and discovered at the beginning of
the 20th century bacteriophages are
basically eaters of bacteria speculating
that bacteriophages played a role in
recovery from dysentery a Darrell
recognized their potential and fighting
infection and conducted the first human
study in 1919 after the phage
preparation was ingested by darrell and
callings at high doses in
to confirm its safety he had they
basically ate bacteria he administered a
diluted phage preparation to a 12 year
old boy with severe dysentery who
recovered within a few days and of quote
similar to antibiotics cells can adopt
or can adapt to become a resistance of
pages perhaps in the future we will be
able to sequence an infectious agent
from an individual patient to identify
the target microbe and quickly design a
custom phage therapy but we will still
need the rigor of modern methods to pull
phage therapy out of its
pseudo-scientific past end of quote okay
so there is clearly a lot of work on
that but I feel confident that Venter is
going to lead the way the same as he is
dead with many of his past ventures
moving on to some more sensitive topics
we may be inclined to think of earth as
being somewhat isolated from other
planets and celestial bodies but as
Venter point out plants have been
exchanging materials and microbes for
billions of years it has been estimated
that Earth and Mars exchange on the
order of 100 kilograms of material a
year making it likely that every shovel
of terrestrial earth contains traces of
Martian soil and of quote following this
rationale the second and more
fundamental is my assumption that life
does indeed exist elsewhere in the
universe there are still many people
often religious who believe that life on
Earth is somehow special or unique and
that we are alone in the cosmos I'm not
among them and if quote I'll not go down
that rabbit hole but rather focus on
what we can should and probably do with
this type of knowledge center says that
obtaining genome sequences from microbes
on Mars and beaming back the sequencing
infirm
to earth could lead to a safe and
contained reconstruction or synthesis of
their genome we can rebuild the Martian
microbes in a p4 spacesuit lab that is a
maximum containment laboratory instead
of risking them splashing down in the
ocean or crash landing in the Amazon and
if quote seriously if you want to get
inside ahead of a next-level thinker
read his book I'll end by saying that
future biological research is likely to
be based on a combination of computer
science and synthetic biology this would
better prioritize on our understanding
of the underlying technologies and
designs that power them so that we can
create safe policies to help us leverage
them thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
