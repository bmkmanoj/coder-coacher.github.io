single layer neural network so building
on top of the perceptron we can
conceptualize a neural network as being
a set or a collection of neurons that
act as a unit so let's create one we're
gonna use the data set that's being
provided with the artificial
intelligence book that I linked in the
description and you'll find a link to
the data set as well if you want to
follow along with the code
so first we'll load the data and so
let's say text is NP load txt data
simple and n dot txt
then we're gonna separate it into
features and labels so data is text all
the rows and columns 0 to 2 and labels
is gonna be text all the rows and
columns to and on ok now let's see how
the text looks like so we can see four
columns and our features so our features
are the first two columns and our labels
as you might guess are the last two
columns now it's also useful if we
visualize the data so let's say PLT
scatter data everything 0
not curly braces data everything one and
our axe label is gonna be the first
dimension so dimension one our wire
label so our y-axis is gonna be
dimension two and the title of the plot
is gonna be so PLT title is gonna be
input data now shift enter right so
pretty simple now let's set the minimum
and maximum values for each of these two
dimensions so dim one men dem one max is
gonna be data everything zero men data
everything zero max and the same thing
for them two men then - max is gonna be
data everything one men and data
everything one max pretty
straightforward now let's set the number
of output neurons the same as we did for
the perceptron
so we'll say num output is going to be
labels shape 1 which is basically equal
to saying that num output is equal to 2
now let's define our neural network so
we're gonna say dem one is gonna be dim
one man and then one max and them two is
going to be
you'll never guess them two men and then
to max so each dimension and now the
neural network so let's call it SN n
from single layer neural network it's
gonna be an else on your lab we're gonna
use new P and we'll specify them one dem
too and our output now shift-enter okay
then we'll train it on our data so let's
say error progress is gonna be s NN
train data labels and we're gonna train
it for 100 D box and we're gonna show 20
with a learning rate of 0.03 now shift
enter to run this one too
and let's also look at the training
progress so let's say PLT plot error
progress
PLT our y-axis is gonna say number of
epochs our while label is gonna say
training error okay and our title is
gonna be training error progress same as
with the perceptron and we'll also gonna
use a grid display now shift enter again
alright so we can see that the training
has been accomplished in just a few key
box now let's do some testing on this
and we're gonna use some new data so
let's say print testing so we're gonna
test
our perceptron on a data that has not
seen to actually understand how well it
predicts on this new data so testing
data we're gonna add a new line let's
say testing data and a few data points
so let's say 0.34 point to another one
four point three 0.5 and another one
four point six and eight and 4i in
testing data well simply gonna let me
make some space here for i am testing
data we're gonna say print i and our snn
our trained SNN with the simha method on
i of 0 okay now shift enter so this is
actually the prediction these are our
testing data and this is the predicted
output for for it so if we plot these
testing data points on a 2d graph it
will verify that the predictions are
accurate now in short there are a few
differences between the perceptron and
the single layer neural network however
the complexity is not much different
especially if you model it with a
library such as neural lab tensorflow
and other popular ones now we're going
to increase the level of complexity in
the following tutorial when we're gonna
start constructing a multi-layer neural
network so if you liked if you enjoyed
