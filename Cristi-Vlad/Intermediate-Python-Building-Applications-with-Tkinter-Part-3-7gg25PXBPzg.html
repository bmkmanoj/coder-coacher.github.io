of creating a graphical application with
dk inter and Python as you know from our
previous videos we want to create a
search bar and we wanted to occupy the
minimal amount of space on your screen
so what's it gonna do it will act in the
same way your search engine acts input
your query hit Enter or the search
button and it will return your result
now what's the real benefit from using
this instead of your search engine will
try to code its convenience in this
video by making it by forcing it to stay
on top of your applications without
actually interfering with your workflow
so what do we have so far
let's hit f5 and run our code so we have
the main app the route we gave it a
title the universal search bar we added
two widgets
a label widget the query and an entry
widget where we input text and we also
created over here we created two
functions a callback and a get function
that we'll use in this video so next we
want to create a search button let's
call it my button 1 and we'll call the
theme to K enter so t tkt button capital
b we'll add it to our root widget well
have it display search
we'll give it a width of 10 and we'll
have a use the callback function that we
previously defined okay now we're gonna
use the grid geometry manager to put it
in line with our label and entry widgets
put it on the same line so column row
equals zero so is the first row and the
column is two because column one is our
entry widget and column zero is our
label widget let's run this okay so
here's our search button let's run a
query say cognitive dissonance click on
search and it opens a new Google search
a new tab in your web browser so it
works
let's close this back to the main app if
we are in the entry field the cursor is
in the entry field and hit enter nothing
happens but you'd expect to act in the
same way the search button acts
because this is the behavior you're
getting in your desired search engine
but we have to code for this function to
so enter is not bound to any function
over here so we have to bind whatever is
in the entry field we have to bind the
Enter key to our and yet function over
here so how do we do this it's quite
simple so we have entry one and we use
then within the Enter key which is the
return to the get function okay let's
close this and run it again
let's query for mental delusions hit the
search it opens up a Google search for
mental delusions and now put the cursor
in our entry widget and hit enter and it
does what you'd expect it to do at the
moment the abbé acts and the same way
our search engine acts but if we switch
windows like for example if we're in the
web browser it gets out of focus and we
want to code the convenience of this app
by having it stay on top and indicate in
turn
there is an option to do this by
accessing the windows methods attributes
so we do this we force our application
to stay on top by doing route VM
attributes and the option is topmost and
we set it to one or two this is how we
force it to stay on top and we add and
our application over here by running the
main loop this is how you end this is
how you finish a TK inter-app location
okay let's close this run it again do
our query for mental delusions hit enter
and you see it stays on top so I think
this is convenient because it occupies
the least amount of space within the
screen and it also stays on top what if
your desert search engine is not Google
or what if you want to conveniently
switch your searches between Google and
other search engines like duck go calm
for example we'll see about that in the
next video
for the moment you have your first
