ivona API using the pavana module and
Python the PI Bona that we have imported
here to get your ivona API T's that you
need for this go to developer.bada.com
and register for free okay so we're
going over here in the placeholder for
iPhone now and you usually create a
voice in the following way
so we define a voice be is by phone so
we're calling by Bona dot create voice
and over here you have key one and key -
between quotation marks that's how you
do it if you are following along in my
case I created another file in the same
folder and I called it keys dot py
that's why I'm importing everything from
keys over here so I'm basically
importing my my keys so in keys and keys
dot py I have two variables key one and
key to holding my ivona API keys and I'm
doing this because I don't want to
display my keys over here so in my case
I do B equals PI phone and dot create
voice p1 p2 okay that's how I create my
voice and you do it like this so my
preferred I've owned a voice as of right
now is Emma so once you have your voice
created and once you have your signed in
with the with the ivona with your API
keys you
we'll have to select the voice otherwise
I think it's selected days I wanna
select a default voice but in my case I
usually want to use the voice so the
voice name voice underscore name is Emma
which is a British voice that I prefer
you can select a male or female voice
and language from the list on ivona comm
in the section voices so you just go
there get the name of the voice you want
to use and do V voice name is the name
of the voice you wanna use okay so
that's it
to make sure it works let's let's try it
out by having it say something so how do
you do this is V speak let's say I don't
know I have initialized I have been
initialized correctly between quotation
marks we're gonna delete this afterwards
so let's run it at 5 okay
I've been initialized correctly okay so
it works let's do it one more time
I've been initialized correctly alright
so it works and the next few videos were
gonna build the callback and the
threading functions and we'll integrate
them with the application and with that
in mind please give me a thumbs up and
subscribe thanks for watching and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
