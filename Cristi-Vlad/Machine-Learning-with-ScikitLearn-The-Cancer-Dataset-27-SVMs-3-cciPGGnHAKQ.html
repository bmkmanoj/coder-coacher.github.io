video tutorial today we're going to
apply a support vector machine
classifier with an RBF kernel to our
cancer data set now I'd recommend
watching the previous video for a better
understanding of how kernels work okay
now we're doing this which I could learn
so you kind of probably know how it's
going to look like now onto it so we'll
start with the imports from SK learn as
VM import and CC which is our support
vector classifier from SK learn model
selection import train test split to
split our data into training and testing
from SK learn data sets import load
breast cancer then we instantiate our
data set and split the data so cancer is
load breast cancer and then X train X
test Y train Y test is trying to split
cancer data cancer target and a random
state of zero for reproducibility now
our classifier so SVM is support vector
classifier to important default
parameters that control regularization
are the C parameter which was discussed
in previous tutorials and gamma which
controls the width of our Gaussian
kernel but more on this later
now let's train
or fit our classifier onto the data so X
train Y train and then finally we'll see
how it did by printing the score so
print the accuracy on the train named
subset with three fixed points format so
our SVM score on the training data first
extreme y train and then the same thing
so we'll just copy paste this and
replace training with that subset format
SVM score x desc
y test and then we'll run this with
shift enter we'll run the entire cell
all at once okay so we've got 100% of
the training subset which basically
means we are overfitting and the
accuracy on the test subset is not good
either there are a few ways to fix this
we could look into the scaling of the
data which is not scaled currently we
could also try to optimize the
regularization of parameters that I've
discussed earlier by adjusting C the C
parameter or the Gamma parameter and
we'll go into that in the next video
alright so if you liked this tutorial
please give me a thumbs up and subscribe
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
