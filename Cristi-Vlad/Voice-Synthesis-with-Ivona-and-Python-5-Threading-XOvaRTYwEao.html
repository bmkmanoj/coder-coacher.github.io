we invoke the callback function directly
by clicking the speak button the app
freezes or it becomes unresponsive let
me show you one more time so we run this
grab some text from my blog over here
notice how it becomes unresponsive
once I click the speak button
researchers from universities in Italy
Brazil and the United States did a study
comparing resistance trained RT athletes
were engaged in intermittent fasting 16
eights with RT athletes who act normally
the experiment ran for eight weeks and
the study was published in the Journal
of translational medicine in October
2016 you can read it here ok and I was
responsive while once it finished
speaking so this is because the entire
program is taken over by the running of
this function the callback function so
this is a behavior we don't want in our
app we avoid this by using something
called threading which kind of isolates
the invoking of the callback function
and allows the app to remain responsive
so in our definition of the threading
function let's three things we're gonna
create a new thread called t1 equals
thread that comes from the threading
which we've imported over here and we're
gonna target the callback function next
we have to start this thread and we do
this by t1 to start and then we'll
replace the command to run when the
speak button is pressed so we'll replace
the pull back over here with T HR or
threading functions so now whenever we
click speak we're gonna create a new
thread to
the callback function and allow the app
to remain responsive at the same time
okay let's delete this as well now let's
run it one more time at 5:00 notice how
I can a win after I click the speak
button notice how I can a use the
application by scrolling through the
text now let me face the text quick
speed researchers from universities in
Italy Brazil and the United States did a
study comparing resistance trained RT
athletes were engaged in intermittent
fasting 16 eights with RT athletes who
act normally the experiment ran for
eight weeks and the study was published
in the Journal of translational medicine
in October 2016 you can read it here and
you see that the app remained responsive
while the command was running so as it
is now one closest as it is now the
application accomplishes its desired
purpose and as I've said in the
introductory video the first in this
series this could be useful for
non-english natives if they want a voice
that mimics natural language to speak in
their videos on YouTube or other places
this could also be helpful for
anonymizing purposes I guess what we're
going to do in the next video is to work
a bit on the GUI to make the app more
static without actually affecting its
minimalistic aspect and its
functionality so if you enjoyed this one
hey give me a thumbs up and subscribe
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
