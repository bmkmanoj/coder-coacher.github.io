video today we're gonna try to find our
way inside Durbin stink which is another
vulnerable virtual machine from bone hub
so the purpose of this machine is to get
the four flags which will eventually
take you to full root access so before I
start I gotta say that I learned a lot
from owning this machine and it's not
like a beginner as they say it is it is
more like a beginner towards
intermediate but you'll probably judge
that yourself so another thing that I
want to say is that I may divide this
into two or three part or a multi-part
video series because in this video I'll
probably only focus on getting inside
the server and in the next one or more
videos we'll probably try to find a way
so we'll work on escalating or
privileges to root all right so that
being said let's begin first we're gonna
do a net discover to see the IP of our
vulnerable machine so this is the IP and
I'm actually using a bridged connection
for both my Kali and the vulnerable
machine right so now we have the IP
let's do a quick and map so the first a
map that I usually do is the SV to get a
basic understanding of what services run
on the machine and then after this
finishes and I started working on some
of the paths I started another more
thorough more thorough and maps can and
sometimes
in fact most times that type of long
scan is not necessary but sometimes it
is anyway so when I need to 168 0 102
and this is actually a very quick scan
so we have 21 22 and 18 so the first
thing we're gonna do is to head over to
one I need to 168 0 102 right now
nothing fancy on this landing page and I
try to view the source by right-clicking
and I wasn't able to to find a spot
where to actually click on view source
so this is what you should do if that
doesn't work so view source okay and
meanwhile we could let's open up another
terminal we could start there busting to
actually brute force for files and
folders within the web directory so derp
derp border buster 192 168 0 102 and
we'll actually gonna use the big text
word list so user share word lists derp
and big dot txt by default it uses the
common txt which is about 4000 words I
guess but this one is like 20,000 words
so let's start that make sure it it runs
okay so 20,000 words set it in the
background let's see what we have here
so we have web notes and foldout txt
make sure you update your so not sure if
I mentioned at the beginning but I
already did this and like I said I
learned a lot from it so anyway make
sure to update your host file with local
DNS so the new turbine stinked law can
be reached before it goes live okay
we'll keep that in mind and I saw that
this is this source contains multiple
multiple lines and if you scroll down
you can see you have your first flag
over here so that was relatively easy
now let's go to downloads Vaughn hub and
okay let's let's try to put everything
down as we sow the information that we
find to write it down because this is
very helpful and you should always do
this if you're into security related
projects or you're doing some sort of
analysis always write things down so
let's write down our first flag
okay control s let's see what Derby's
telling us so you can see we have a PHP
we have the robots.txt so let's see 192
168 0 102 robots.txt disallow PHP and
temporary so let's go to PHP we can go
there temporary try harder nothing in
here
okay what else so we have PHP my admin'
oh so it looks like we have a wordpress
blog over here now let's try to go to so
it's at we blog let's copy link address
or address go to okay so remember what
it's said here make sure to update your
host file with the local DNS so the new
derp sting blog can be reached before it
goes live so we see a redirect here so
we we asked for WP login so let's try
that one more time
192 168 0 102 we blog and it redirects
us to Durban stink local we long so what
you need to do in this case to be able
to access this this resource is to
modify your Etsy host file so let's go
to nano and see hosts and over here
we're gonna add 192 168 0 102 and we
wanted to point out 2 derp and stink
that local ok control all to save it
enter and control X to quit now
let's refresh
this ok so right now we can access we
can access the WordPress blog so at this
point we probably want to get inside the
administrator panel and for this purpose
the first tool we're gonna use is WP
scan and we're gonna go to down just
HTTP 1 I need to 168 0 102 we blog see
if that works yes
so it actually tries this one and the
redirection since we added it to Etsy
host works ok so there's there's quite a
few things to notice and this scan and
the first one that caught my attention
was one about arbitrary file upload let
me see if localhost and it was a
critical one yep so this one slideshow
gallery arbitrary file upload ok so
we'll keep that in mind as well and
let's try to enumerate the users so
enumerate you okay so just URL specify
that lets say yes again and it'll do the
same thing like it did before but this
time with the addition of enumerated the
users okay so we have uncle stinky and
admin now at this point there are
multiple vectors so we can see that a
herb is still running so at this point
there might be multiple vectors of
attack first thing which is really dumb
and you'd be shocked but way too many
people still use poor credentials and so
poor passwords and their login
information and that kind of explains
the the breaches of security and the the
news about big breaches big data
breaches that we are dealing with every
day and one of them over so one like
relevant example from the last few days
was about one of the most one of the
most watched videos on YouTube which was
about five billion which had about five
billion views and probably malicious
users got access into the the account of
those of those who had the video
uploaded it and they deleted that that
that video so my assumption is that they
had poor Prudential's or they might have
been infected with a keylogger or
something and that's how the breach
happened and that sucks
honestly anyway so there are multiple
vectors over here you'd first want to
try default credentials so for the admin
we could find we could try it and this
is what I usually do so I use admin
admin admin one two three four admin one
two three and all that stuff a second
you could try brute forcing your way in
with Hydra so you'd use Hydra to brute
force the login panel at WP login dot
PHP
that's another vector a third vector
would be to look through these and try
to
something that could be potentially
exploited so these are only three
vectors but I'm really sure that some of
you might find even more anyway we'll
just go with the first one the dummy
credentials so I already did this and lo
and behold admin admin actually takes
you to a dashboard which is actually not
the admin dashboard because in the
WordPress the admin dashboard has much
more options over here in the side panel
but this is good enough to go so
remember the slideshow thing from from
WP scan so we have arbitrary file upload
so when I saw this I thought well if
this is what I think it is so this
plug-in allows you to add slides or
images to to the WordPress blog and it
says over here so let's go to try to
let's say add new chose yours so this is
where we actually upload the image chose
your image file from your computer jpg
PNG jiff are supported they say or
support it but it doesn't so the first
thing you should try to do is when you
are in front of a situation like this is
to try and see if you can upload a file
of a different type other than an image
that's what I usually do so the first
thing that I do is to try to upload a
basic PHP shell and thereafter if it
doesn't work I try to manipulate that
PHP shell to turn it into dot PHP dot
PNG or something like that
and we might be confronted with that in
another video so you'll see exactly what
I'm talking about
but here a lo and behold we can upload a
PHP shell so I'm gonna upload this one
but first I gotta make sure that it
points out to my local IP so let's see
what's my if config eth0
so mine is 0 104 now let's go to our
folder so it was derp let's see what's
inside the reverse shell so 104 and my
IP is 0 104 so let's modify that
so with zero 104 let's control all enter
control x save it so right now it points
to my IP and on port 449 all right so
let's set up a netcat listener on board
four four nine and now just upload the
shell over here so let's let's give it a
title let's say info and I think we're
good go so save slide and it says slide
has been saved so this is the slide and
as we can see below over here so as you
can read Durban stink local we blog WP
content upload slideshow gallery so
that's the actual path to the PHP shell
so I'm gonna copy that link location and
then I'm gonna open it up so that we can
execute it so over here and we have our
listener at this point we could stop the
dirt Buster minimize it because I think
this is a good vector of attack minimize
this okay so it was executed okay that's
weird so let's see that one more time
I'm not sure when it got executed but it
got executed it was probably when I
uploaded it maybe anyway let's just quit
and set the listener again okay so we
have the listener and now let's try two
so it's listening and now we're
executing it okay and we should have a
shell okay so as you can see we are
inside the server so you name - a
at this point with one like escape from
that shelf so import we're gonna use
Python and import the PDI library PT I
spawn and we're gonna spawn a bin bash
shell
okay so we've spawn a bin bash shell now
at this point Who am I I'm dub-dub-dub
data so we are inside the server next
we're gonna let's see what's inside this
directory okay so next we're gonna try
to find vectors to escalate our
privileges from dub-dub-dub data to to
route and eventually get get the rest of
the flags so okay I guess that's it for
this video will stop here and we'll
continue in the next one so if you
