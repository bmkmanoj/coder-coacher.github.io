relatively long time especially if
there's sufficient body fat to supply
for metabolic needs but when thirst
comes into play we cannot survive for
more than a few days without water in a
normal temperature environment or less
than that if you're in a hot environment
and you're sweating today we're going to
talk about thirst taken to the extremes
my inspiration comes from Emma Baretta's
book extreme which we'll find a link to
in the description now please don't eat
while watching this animation because
some of what you're about to see and
hear may not benefit your appetite so
let's start by talking about some tragic
incidents that highlight our inability
to survive for long without water so one
day in 1877 a detachment of the US
Cavalry was crossing a desert region in
Texas when it got lost they were without
water for three and a half days in the
searing heat and four of them died their
harrowing experience was captured in
letters and interviews with survivors
and of court by the end of day one a
thirst was severe some of the men
suffered from sunstroke by the end of
day two thirst was uncontrollable by now
they had no saliva and were unable to
eat they chewed bread but the pieces
stuck to their teeth and pellets even
sugar would not dissolve in their
parched mouths and if cold they suffered
from visual and hearing impairments loss
of balance muscular weakness and
inability to talk coherently due to the
absence of saliva some of them were
delirious most of them couldn't sleep
but those who did dreamt about having
refreshing drinks so what happened
they're outrageous thirst made all
fluids appear palatable they drank their
own urine Sweden with sugar and they
also tried drinking the blood and urine
of the horses as soon as they died they
developed violent diarrhea then after 86
hours without water the survivor
stumbled across a lake and were later
rescued and if quote to further
elaborate and give you another example
will faster an explorer remembers about
the persistent threat of thirst while
traveling through the hot desert he and
his companions had to race you on
themselves to about a quart or little
over a liter of water per day they could
only carry a supply that lasted for
about twenty days they ate a starvation
reishi on but it was thirst the trouble
fetcher the most I was always conscious
of it he wrote even when I was asleep I
dreamt of racing streams of ice-cold
water
and if quote so how much water do we
actually need as per mo Barret healthy
average adults living in temperate
climates require about 3.7 liters or
about one gallon of water for males and
2.7 liters or about 0.7 gallons of water
for females
this amount mainly comes from drinking
water and other fluids like tea coffee
soft drinks etc but it also comes from
food in a proportion of at least 22
percent now working in or exposing
yourself to hotter temperature
drastically modifies this requirement
intensive labor in a hot place can make
you lose two liters or point fifty three
gallons or more water every hour through
sweating thus having you have to drink
at least six liters or about 1.6 gallons
per day
some negative health consequences that
appear even at moderate dehydration
include decreased mental performance
decreased alertness impairment in
short-term memory and migraines just the
name of few not surprisingly drinking
can improve alertness and cognitive
performance if you are dehydrated
however there is little solid evidence
that repeatedly drinking throughout the
day improves the performance of people
who are not dehydrated neither is there
any convincing evidence that we should
all drink eight glasses of water a day
and if quote now to give you a bit of
context for my own life I currently
don't drink too much water per se
because I'm mostly never thirsty I think
I get a lot of it from food since I
consumed a substantial amount of
vegetables and some traces of fruit but
whenever I feel this light of thirst I
quench it with very cold water and that
after feeling is extremely rewarding but
what about you how much water do you
consume on average let me know in the
comments below and if you enjoyed the
