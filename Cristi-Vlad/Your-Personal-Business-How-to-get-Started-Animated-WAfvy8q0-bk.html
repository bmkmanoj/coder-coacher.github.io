Chris Gila bow what is it that people
want more of they want more love more
money more acceptance and more free time
what is it that they want less of well
they want less stress fewer conflicts
less uncertainty you get the point I'm
going to discuss a few key concepts of
entrepreneurship and more specifically
about ways to start and operate a
one-man business my inspiration comes
from chris gill about this book the 100
dollar startup okay so let's begin with
what he calls convergence which is the
intersection between what you like the
link and what people are interested in
that's a good way to start a solopreneur
journey and if you have trouble
conceptualizing convergence there are
always common sources of inspiration to
start a personal business here are just
a few number one look for inefficiencies
in the marketplace notice something that
could run better a product that's poorly
promoted a service that could be useful
but it doesn't exist well step in number
two new technologies bring new
opportunities when everyone started
using smartphones new markets cropped up
for app developers case manufacturers
and so on end of quote number three a
spin-off or side project this refers to
how a business idea can be generate if I
may in too many others and Chris gives
the example of Brandon Pierce who
founded studio helper as a side project
to his main businesses music teachers
helper it now brings in more than one
hundred thousand dollars a year on its
own end of quote the main idea is that
whatever you do make sure you sell what
people want to
I entrepreneurship is after all
satisfying an unmet need so once you
decide on your product or service here's
what you can do to be up and running
your business as soon as possible one
set up a free website one way is by
using wordpress com to create an offer
for your product or service three make
sure you have a way to be paid you can
register for a free paypal account for
tell everyone about your offer use
social media in your advantage most
importantly chris says learn from steps
1 2 4 and then repeat moving on here's
another great way to get started Gary's
business is great and no one cared that
his website looks like it was made 10
years ago he also didn't wait for
someone to accredit or endorse him for
his business there is no consulting
school or degree you can start a new
business as a consultant in about one
day if not sooner end of quote and
here's where Chris is advice shines his
imperative is to follow two rules one be
very specific don't be a business
consultant or life coach get specific
about what you can really do for someone
and of quote two don't be cheap no one
values a 15 and our consultant so do not
under price your service since you
probably won't have 40 hours of billable
work every week charge at least 100 an
hour or a comparable fixed rate for the
benefit you provide and of quote this is
basically how you select or a filter
your own clientele and another part of
the book Chris gives you a step-by-step
process for easing your way into
self-publishing I will let you discover
the details yourself and I also want to
point out that this reflects my personal
story with writing and getting my seven
books
out there it was an adventure in
self-publishing and I might document it
in future videos so stay tuned for that
another easy saying that many existing
businesses can do to add a new revenue
source quickly is to create a service
from a product based business or
creative product from a service-based
business and thus code in my case this
would simply mean that my book could
provide the avenue for consultation
businesses very important to point out
is that once you're up and running
metrics are invaluable you have to
measure the performance of your business
continuously otherwise you cannot
improve I don't have to detail this it
should be crystal clear and I'm going to
paraphrase Peter Drucker as he said
something along the lines of what gets
measured gets done the theme of the
entire book is very practical as the
author sneak peeks into the stories that
people who started and grow their
businesses from scratch it's all action
oriented action beats planning he use
the one-page business plan and other
quick start guides to get underway
without waiting there's a link in the
description to the one-page business
plan so if you need a little practice
nature to start your own thing go ahead
and pick up the book and thank me later
now I'm always interested to know more
about the creative and entrepreneurial
nature of human beings so please tell me
