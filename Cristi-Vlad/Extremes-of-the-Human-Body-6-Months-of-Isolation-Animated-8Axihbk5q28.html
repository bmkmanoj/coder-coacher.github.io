you spend six months in a dark cave all
alone in this video and in a few others
i will go over the extremes of human
physiology and psychology i drive part
of my inspiration from a book written by
a mobile rat called extreme why some
people thrive at the limits here were
particularly gonna focus on isolation by
looking over a case study from 1970s a
self experiment so to speak so it was
several read the fourteenth yes on a
Valentine's Day in 1972 when Michelle
sefer a geologist kissed his wife
goodbye and went down into the midnight
cave in Texas located deep below ground
level he was to stayed there for about
six months he was on a self-driven
scientific mission now this wasn't the
first experiment of this kind for
Michelle or let's call him Mike because
it's easier to pronounce he is a similar
experiment about ten years earlier when
he spent nine weeks alone in a freezing
cave that was also part of a scientific
experiment and it left him severely
distressed both physically and
emotionally so why would he do it again
and in even harsher conditions quote he
wanted to discover what would happen to
his biorhythms when all external clues
the time were removed and this he was
successful his salter can finally
produced new findings in the field of
chronobiology and helped to advance the
understanding of long-term isolation but
this scientific knowledge was one at
considerable personal cost and the
spoked now let's look at some details
this midnight cave was more hospitable
than the freezing one from the first
experiment it has a temperature
about 21 degrees Celsius or about 70
Fahrenheit Mike lived in a tent in which
he was surrounded by scientific
equipment that he had used to collect
all sorts of data NASA supplied him with
food which mimic to the diet consumed by
the Apollo astronauts he couldn't tell
time because there were no clocks in the
cave quote his assistants camped at the
mouth of the cave and acted as ground
control turning on the lights in the
cave when he woke and turning them off
when he felt drowsy when the lights were
off he was in absolute darkness now it
was not all discomfort at least not in
the beginning because Mike brought a
freezer some furniture a music player
and some books that would help him kill
time he also had a rectal probe
installed throughout his entire state to
continuously monitor his body
temperature and he also carried
electrodes on his chest and on other
parts of the body to monitor his cardiac
rhythm his sleep patterns and other
important measurements Mike thought of
enhancing his comfort by bringing these
books and magazines to read and some
records to play but the record player
broke and the books were covered with
this form of fungus mild you within the
short of a few weeks so what happened
quote the lack of sensory and social
stimulation lateral gradual
deterioration in surfers psychological
state at one point he even contemplated
suicide only to reject the idea because
he did not want to settle his parents
with the depth he had run up financing
his experiment end of quote almost three
months in and a powerful feeling of self
doubt has settled them as reflected by
an entry in his journal
Michael wrote what am I doing here in
this silly experiment while my
professional life ebbs away end of quote
now before moving gone please know this
don't try this at home the info on this
video is not to be taken as medical
advice I am no doctor and I don't play
one on the Internet I there now if
you're wondering Mike was able to
complete the experiment but with
substantial physiological and
psychological costs some of them were
temporary and he was able to recover
from them while others were
longer-lasting quote three years after
leaving midnight caves Siffer still had
memory lapses his eyesight remained poor
and he had what he described as
inexplicable psychological wounds he
divorced and according to one report
retreated to a South American jungle to
recover from the ordeal and thus quote
now my framing and presentation of this
experiment to you may make it appear
that isolation and sensory deprivation
are all bad in all contexts but that's
far from my point in many cases artists
introverts and people engaged in deep
mental work cannot elevate the human
condition without having to experience a
certain form of isolation which
counter-intuitively can be satisfying
and rewarding so I put my highlight on
the contextual nature of the situation
all right I hope you took some insights
from this video for more on human
extremes please give me a thumbs up and
subscribe thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
