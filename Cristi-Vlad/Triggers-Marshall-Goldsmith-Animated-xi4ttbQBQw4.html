been a closeted Buddhist when he said
it's not personal its business he knew
that people disappoint us or disagree
with us when it's in their best interest
to do so not because they want to cause
us pain it's the same with all the
people who annoy or enrages they're
doing it because that's who they are not
because of who we are
Marshall Goldsmith in this video I
review some of my key take-home messages
from Marshall Goldsmith's book triggers
which is about adult behavioral change
Marshall Goldsmith for those of you who
don't know the coach of leaders has been
named by thinkers 50 the world's most
influential leadership thinker by ink
magazine America's number one executive
coach and by The Economist the most
credible thought leaders in the new era
of business so let's see what mr.
Goldsmith has to say about behavioral
change our behavior is poorly influenced
by our environment and in our
environment there are these triggers or
stimuli be it people events
circumstances and so on that make us act
in a way or another to avoid undesirable
behavior avoid the environments where it
is most likely to occur if you don't
want to be lured into a tantrum by a
colleague who gets on your nerves avoid
him if you don't want to indulge in late
night snacking don't wander into the
kitchen looking for leftovers in the
fridge and of cold
triggers or environmental factors may
often be out of our control and this may
lead us into thinking we can do much
about it we feel like victims of
circumstance puppets of faith I don't
want to accept that faith is the hands
of cards we've been dealt choices how we
play the hand
and of quote we have the choice for how
we'll respond to our environment we have
the choice for how we treat people we
have the choice for what we allow to
trigger our next action power in this
case comes from within and as Goldsmith
says to change we need the impulse to
imagine a different us but why is it
that we so often fail to change for the
better
inertia is the reason we never start a
process of change it takes extraordinary
effort to stop doing something in our
comfort zone because it's painless or
familiar or mildly pleasurable in order
to start something difficult that will
be good for us in the long run and of
quote note this change is unpleasant and
discomforting you gotta be willing to
live through the fire when we plan to
achieve our goals we believe that our
energy will not flag and that we will
never lose our enthusiasm for the
process of change we seldom recognize
that self control is a limited resource
end of quote as we go through our day
and as we make decisions our ability to
self control depletes you are less able
to resist temptation by the end of the
day whether it's about food
procrastination or even sexual
temptations there have been critiques
for the research behind the concept of
ego depletion but from what I read and
from our personal experience with
self-control this concept stands the
test in most situations what can we do
to fight depletion well there are a few
strategies here's what Goldsmith has to
say structure is how we overcome
depletion in an almost magical way
structure slows down how fast our
discipline and self-control disappear
when we have structure we don't have to
make as many choices we just follow the
plan and the net result is we're going
we're not being depleted as quickly and
of quote if you assume you're better
than others and that you don't need
structure and guidance
you like a crucial ingredient for change
that is humility
so adopt humility and know that
obviously you cannot structure
everything no environment is that
cooperative but all of us rely on
structure in small ways some of the time
and if called to and proactively I'll
let Goldsmith advice think about one
change one triggering gesture that you
won't regret later on maybe it's calling
your mother to tell her you love her
or thanking a customer for his loyalty
or saying nothing instead of something
cynical in a meeting it could be
anything as long as it represents a
departure however modest from what
you've always done and what would
continue doing forever then do it it
will be good for your friends it will be
good for your company it will be good
for your customers it will be good for
your family and even better for you so
much better you will want to do it again
and that probably says it all
start small one my new change at a time
all right
