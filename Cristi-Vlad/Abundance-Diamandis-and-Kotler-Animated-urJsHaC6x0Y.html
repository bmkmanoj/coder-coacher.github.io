time to build Wikipedia yet we spend 200
billion hours every year watching TV to
put this in perspective we spend a
Wikipedia worth of time every weekend in
the u.s. watching advertisements alone
if we were to forgo our television
addiction for just one year the world
would have over a trillion hours of
cognitive surplus to commit to share
projects imagine what we could do for
the world's as grand challenges with a
trillion hours of focused attention
diamandis and cutler here i present some
of my key highlights from peter
diamandis and Steven Kotler this 2012
book abundance studying molecular
genetics at MIT Diamandis often imagined
what it would be like to explain his
research to his great-great-grandfather
grandpa I would begin do you see the
dirt over there or you a soil expert he
might ask no but in the dirt there is
this microscopic life-form called a
bacterium oh you're an expert in that no
I'd respond inside the bacteria there is
this thing called DNA so you're an
expert in DNA not quite inside the DNA
are these segments called genes and I'm
not an expert in those either but at the
beginning of these genes is what's
called a promoter sequence oh well I'm
an expert in that the world doesn't need
another also specialist generating
research university we've got that
covered places like MIT Stanford and the
California Institute of Technology
already do a fine job creating super
geniuses who can geek out in their nano
niche end of quote I further elaborate
saying that we need people with
helicopter thinking abilities those that
can perceive a 10,000 feet perspective
and immediately thereafter getting into
the my new details of the same
perspective these breeds are rare to
find when people believe the world's
following the parts as kana man it's
often an anchoring problem at the end of
the 19th century London was becoming
uninhabitable because of the
accumulation of horse manure people were
absolutely panicked because of anchoring
they couldn't imagine any other possible
solutions no one had any idea the car
was coming and soon they'd be worrying
about dirty skies not dirty streets end
of quote we live in exponential times
change takes place blazingly fast our
minds are linear and they cannot keep up
it's hard but it's possible to get out
of a linear mindset and grasp the
exponential reality let's look at a
specific example these days it still
takes some time and the cooperation of
several people to perform a blood test
you need to draw the sample send it to
the lab analyze it get the results back
and this can take a few days if not much
more such as in the case of developing
countries a technology now under
development known as lab on a chip LOC
has the potential to solve these
problems packaged into a portable cell
phone sighs device LLC will allow
doctors nurses and even patients
themselves to take a sample of bodily
fluid such as urine sputum or a single
drop of blood and run dozens is not
hundreds of Diagnostics on the spot and
in a matter of minutes end of quote
since their writing of the book there
are more than a bunch of new
technologies focusing on very rapid and
convenient blood testing heck we're
doing ultra-fast genome sequencing and
genome engineering today but don't get
me started on this at least not in this
video diamandis and cutler wrote the
book in 2012 back then they envisioned
by 2015 the global market for
personalized medicine is projected to
reach 400
52 billion dollars all of which is the
same we will soon have the means methods
and motivation to value and individuals
as well being like never before end of
quote it's 2017 now and I have the
privilege of hindsight a quick look into
the numbers 4 2015 tells me that the
global market for preventative and
personalized medicine went beyond
diamandis and cuddlers its expectations
to be more precise the number was 530
four billion dollars for 2015 according
to global wellness institute link in the
description with the convergence of
infinite computing artificial
intelligence ubiquitous broadband
coverage and low-cost tablets we can
provide a newly free and personalized
education to anyone anywhere at any time
this is an incredible force for
abundance imagine billions of newly
invigorated mind thrilled by the voyage
of discovery using their newly gained
knowledge and skills to improve their
lives yeah well let me just finish my
social media aimless scrawling first
babish eve a researcher at stanford
thinks there are two types of mindsets
when it comes to risk type 1 people are
fearful of making mistakes for them
failure is shameful and disastrous as a
result they are risk averse and whatever
progress they make is incremental at
best on the other hand type 2 people are
fearful of losing out on opportunities
what it's shameful that these people
says shift is sitting on the sidelines
while someone else runs away with a
great idea and if quote you always get
the big signs what is the church that
you're going to make abundance is both
applying and a perspective this second
bit is key one of the more important
points made throughout this book is that
our perspective shapes our reality the
best way to predict the future is to
create it yourself and if quote
the reality bound optimism of the ultra
practical Diamandis is augmented by the
elegantly sophisticated style of Cutler
to energize you with readily
implementable ideas to turn yourself
into a doer I suggest picking up this
book and reading more and if you enjoy
this video please give me a thumbs up
