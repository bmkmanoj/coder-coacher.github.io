to email questions regarding my current
personal intermittent fasting strategy
so one question I got was if I take
supplements prior to working out in a
fasted state i partially responded to
this question in a previous video but
i'm gonna expand on it here so before my
resistance training workout I have a
scoop of c4 which is five calories so
it's kind of non impacting if I may and
that's just about it but I guess some
bigger questions are does it matter if
you take supplements well I don't know
but why would you take supplements if so
very few seem to have some positive
effect
well I currently think there is no
necessity of such if you have a diet
that gives you sufficient vitamins
minerals and micronutrients plus I think
that fat loss supplements if this is
what you're using or for the most part
worthless because you cannot out
supplement a poor diet you cannot out
supplement sleep and you cannot out
supplement exercise so if you start from
this point and consider that supplements
are not needed then I guess your
question is also valid in the context of
intermittent fasting okay but why do I
take c4 does it help well this is a
relatively expensive workout blend that
among other ingredients contains
creating it contains caffeine some B
vitamins and vitamin C it could help but
I think that placebo and auto suggestion
can also help in this case so I can
simply replace this with a
cup of coffee before my workout and I
might just do that in the future do
supplements break the fast well I don't
think so especially if we're talking
about supplementing with vitamins and
minerals but if you really want to be
strict you won't use them so again now
what is the context and what is it that
you're trying to achieve another
question I got was that if I fast before
aerobic exercise and the answer is quite
simple no because I haven't been doing
aerobic exercise for the past few years
all right
