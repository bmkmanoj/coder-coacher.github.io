intermittent fasting I often see this
question so here's my current take on it
I usually pack all my food into three to
four hour time frame around late noon
while the rest of 20 to 21 hours is when
I consume mostly water and black coffee
as for alcohol intake I've experimented
with all sorts of protocols and
frequencies so I could say that I'm or
that I've been consistent with being
inconsistent as of March 2017 my booze
of choices red wine I like its taste how
much about one to two glasses at a time
or per serving or to be more precise 250
to 350 milliliters
I guess that's between 8 to 12 ounces
how frequent about once or twice a week
there have been times in the past when I
drank more frequently like 3 to 5 times
a week and hadn't experienced negative
effects such as that they would impair
my physique goals as long as I would
have my drinks at least 4 to 5 hours
after my last meal but I would say the
negative effects were in terms of poor
sleep and you know what's paradoxical
about it when I drink I sleep less and
wake up energized I tend to lift quite
well in the gym after having my wanted
to glasses of wine the night before I
suspect the higher energy comes from
increased NADH as a result of ethanol
metabolism and I might do a biochem
video about it now I seem to tolerate
well this amount of wine such as that I
don't get headaches or hungover or stuff
like that but the caveat is that the
days when I drink are calorically
restricted and I have my drinks at least
4 to 5 hours after mile
miel so I'm kind of repeating myself on
another note one of the reasons I've
currently reduced the frequency of my
drinking is because I rather sleep solid
and deep for seven to eight hours and
wake up with a clean state or rested
mine so to speak instead of having a
superficial sleep of five to six hours
now in the past I also used to consume
harder liquors and other types of
alcohols
but it seems like red wine stuck with me
so it's my currently favorite choice now
a few quick questions and notes should
you consider or track calories from
alcohol well I'd say yes should you
reduce daily caloric intake if you're
having drinks at night I'd also say yes
if you want to minimize potential
negative physique impacts and maximize
the effects from alcohol with lower
intakes
so optimized for the dose but I wouldn't
bother too much about it though relax
enjoy yourself however if you drink on
an empty stomach chances are you'll feel
the effects from alcohol faster so you
might not drink as much which makes it
kind of a fail-safe approach another
thing if you are on a carbohydrate
reduced or restricted diet you may want
to limit your selection to harder
alcohols and dry wine and stay away from
sugary cocktails if you don't want to
deviate too much from your protocol I'd
also stay away from diet sodas but I
don't know don't take this for granted
you can and like I said you should allow
some indulgences from time to time
frequency or better said in frequency is
more important than the details of your
indulgence
so anyway
what about you what's your alcohol of
choice and how do you have it how often
do you drink what are your what are some
of your thoughts and observations about
this and do you also get legit after
booze pumps like me let me know in the
comments below anyway that's it for this
video if you enjoyed it please give me a
thumbs up and subscribe thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
