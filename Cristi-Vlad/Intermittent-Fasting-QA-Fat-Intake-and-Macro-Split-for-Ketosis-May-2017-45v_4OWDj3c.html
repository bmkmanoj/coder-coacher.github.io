social media
this one is more specific to ketosis and
it goes like this
if protein and carbs are relatively
stable can we reduce the amount of fat
in accordance with satiety or when do we
actually eat be that one or two meals
per day should we include the same ratio
that is 75 25 so 75 of the calories
coming from fat 25 I mean 20 percent
from protein and 5 percent from
carbohydrates okay so this question has
been answered thoroughly and for many
times and I'm going to repeat along the
same lines there is no reason to eat if
you're not hungry and you're on a
weight-loss track and when you do eat
make sure that your diet is not deprived
of nutrients and I'm talking about micro
nutrients such as vitamins minerals
phytochemicals and the like and also
make sure you consume adequate protein
now it is common sense not to force
yourself to consume dietary fat if your
purpose is to burn adipose fat that is
from your own fat stores from your own
body so creating a caloric deficit and
restricting carbohydrates is likely to
promote the mobilization of adipose
tissue to supply or compensate for your
energy requirements this is likely to
happen regardless of that the
macronutrient split you're following but
it could be more efficient if you
restrict carbohydrates now to get back
to your question and to answer shortly
the
answer is no you don't have to eat 75%
of your calories from fat so you don't
have to eat 75% fat
nutritional ketosis as I've said it many
times
is a matter of carbohydrate restriction
and not dietary fat consumption I hope
this helps now another question thoughts
about water fasting for three days or
longer coming from a non keto diet now
I'm going to tell you about my
experience here so doing some form of
lower carbohydrate or ketosis promoting
diet may make it easier to undergo water
fasting because of kind of being
accustomed to relying on fat dietary
oedipus or both as primary metabolic
substrates coming from a non keto diet
or a similar situation may be a bit more
challenging especially during the period
of glycogen depletion which occurs in
the first I'd say a few days now I
remember earlier in my youth trying to
do 24-hour water fasts mostly for or
because of my religious beliefs at that
time and I was kind of struggling with
it I was eating a nutritious leap or
diet back then and I was not used to any
form of dieting so basically I was
eating like three or more meals per day
I wrote about this at length in my
periodic fasting book now this is not to
say anything against high carbohydrate
diets which can be well formulated
similar to all other diets I was just
trying to put things into context and
from my current purse
active anyway this is kind of it for the
video if you have similar questions
please leave them below and I'm going to
try to provide my perspective as best as
I can
