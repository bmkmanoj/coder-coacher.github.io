he has consented to come on and give us
a lowdown on the ketosis and ketogenic
diets he is my go-to expert on that
because he has written the books on it
morning Christie morning dr. Matt how
are you I'm doing great why don't we
start off by giving kind of a background
as to what got you interested in ketosis
and ketogenesis well to be very specific
to the ketogenic diet it was back in
2013 when I actually wanted to I was
kind of fit at the time but I wanted to
lose the last few pounds of fat from my
midsection and I basically looked for
different approaches online and as far
as I remember I think I got to a blog
post from Tim Ferriss who was talking
about I think it was Peter
attea who was trying a ketogenic diet
back then so it was also advocating it
so I decided to try it and at the same
time took a lot of measurements in terms
of body composition in terms of blood
analysis in terms of food food logs and
tracking exercise and that's how I
decided to basically put everything into
a book format after the experiment ended
so it was between late September 2013 I
think yeah until December yeah I think
that's when I first kind of connected
with you is I was following your
progress online you were in the bio
hacking community and you kept posting
pictures of your progress online and it
was pretty impressive what you were
achieving with it
yeah I mean I reached I reached my my
desired I guess purpose for for it so it
was a successful experiment so what is
your body fat did what was the progress
from start to to really where you were
satisfied with the results well the
first texture that I took got me to
nineteen something it was nineteen point
five I think body fat percentage and
then the second one that I took at the
end of the experiment if I can call it
like that it was like fourteen point
four so nice had the muscle mass did
during that time I think it got a little
bit improved but I'm not sure exactly on
the accuracy of a DEXA scans in terms of
muscle fluctuations I'm not sure if it's
really precise yeah but I mean comparing
those two DEXA scans I think it got a
little bit improved but I don't look it
oh yeah we've seen actually pretty good
results with with fat loss and muscle
gain during the kid kita kita genic
diets that we've had people on so we've
had really good results with it
I think one of the the biggest things
was in cognitive performance I think
most of the people that I've had do the
ketogenic diet really felt like a better
clarity better focus almost like a
nootropic effect with the ketones
well definitely yeah I mean that's
that's probably one of the most I would
say benefits the most like observable
subjective observable benefit that I got
from the ketogenic diet so I could
compare my mental
performance before that with what I have
when I was kind of under strict ketosis
so definitely I was I had like higher
mental clarity I could like start
working on something like writing
writing writing something I could focus
all the way through like for a couple of
hours without actually with little
disturbances like I wouldn't want to
have the like rush to to try to get into
other things at the same time so I
wouldn't divert my focus that do you
consider yourself slightly a DD well it
depends I think you could you could
manipulate this state basically I could
I could consider myself on a DD if I
have a lot of caffeine okay now I have
tried ketogenic in a sense I mean I went
paleo a while back in 2007 probably and
stayed paleo for a long time and I had
periods where I feel like I was probably
in ketosis but why don't you talk to us
about the difference between a you know
a a diet that is more of a ketogenic
diet versus one that's more of a paleo
style I mean where do you draw that line
and how do you establish that well there
are a lot of variations of low
carbohydrate diets but if we talk about
a ketogenic diet and someone wants to
undergo a ketogenic diet I think one of
the most important things they have to
do is to actually measure ketosis okay
otherwise you wouldn't know there are
like subjective measures of ketosis like
the feeling of having a certain type of
breath like acetone breath but
that's that's not a good quantified
quantifiable approach so basically you'd
have to measure ketosis and one of the
cheapest ways to do it would be using
like ketone strips these are like urine
strips that you buy at the local
pharmacy for I don't know ten dollars
for fifty tests find out I found that
the the keto strips could be really not
that good for following ketosis I mean
what's your experience with that it the
the data I've seen on the keto strips
themselves have been kind of not the
best well I don't know I mean I could
still measure urine ketones after a lot
of after being in ketosis for a long
time so I don't know to me they were
pretty accurate but they actually
measure acetyl acetate right but you see
if you're burning a lot of ketones
you're you're also going to reduce the
amount that's going to be excreted in
the urine isn't that right well so the
circulating form of ketone is
beta-hydroxybutyrate that's what travels
from the liver to the site where it is
actually being turned back into a cos
date and then used for energy and then
so it's been further down further broken
down into acetyl co a and then use for
energy so I once it goes to ketone and
it doesn't go back right I mean you've
got that kind of beta hydroxy butyrate
and then it can go back and forth
between a coa and and yet if it goes
into ketones then it's kind of done
right well it could spontaneously
acetoacetate could either go beta
hydroxy butyrate so
that's basically in delivered
ketogenesis is the formation of
acetoacetate from acetyl co a right then
a zero acetate can be turned to
beta-hydroxybutyrate and delivered
tissues and reconvert it back to acetyl
as a 0 co co way or it can spontaneously
be carboxylate and be excreted by the
breath and that's in the form the key
tonight yeah Agathon that's basically
acetone yeah you excrete a stone but
again getting back to the the main
question well probably the better way to
measure ketosis would be using a blood
meal so that that measures of
beta-hydroxybutyrate
yeah and I've had most of my clients to
end up going with trying the key to keep
genic diet I have them get the finger
stick and get them on Amazon the the
machines are cheap but the testing
strips are expensive you know like five
bucks a strip or something our thing
yeah but what I do is I have them kind
of do it a couple times a week just to
see what they're there morning
ketones are and have you tested that
against the keto strips and I have not
that would be interesting to see how the
correlation is there yeah I think there
have been people in the quantified self
community and also in the the ketogenic
forums that have tested tested them and
I don't know I haven't looked into the
data to see how they correlate but I
think that if you if you want to be
extremely precise you would use the
blood meter and you would use it for a
few times want to know what gets you
into ketosis and once you can correlate
your subjective measures like better
mental performance maybe this doesn't
happen in everybody so maybe not
everyone who goes on a ketogenic diet
can like report the same benefits that
the rest of the people who are
successful on that board so you would
then be able to correlate the reading
you're getting from the blood with your
subjective measures whatever they are so
then you would probably wouldn't have to
test as often if you remain within this
certain like eating the same foods and
right yeah and it's five dollars a day
gets expensive for the testing again I
think it should probably get cheaper but
I don't know I mean that's like that's
how much it cost any 2014 so yeah still
doing didn't get cheaper now I have a
lot of people that will think that by
doing a low-carb they're doing ketogenic
and that's just not the case right yeah
that's right so I I think one of the
most important things like I said it's
the measure once you measure and you see
I mean blood beta-hydroxybutyrate is a
very good measure of ketosis so if your
reading is above 0.5 millimolar
that means that you're basically in
nutritional ketosis now what do you
recommend as far as a dietary
macronutrient mix for people that are
wanting to try ketosis well the basic
idea is that you would reduce
carbohydrates so reducing carbohydrate
to a level to allow for fat oxidation to
increase and that it will start
ketogenesis so that probably depends on
an individual basis but a good start
would be like
trying to reduce carbohydrate to like
say 50 grams per day total carbohydrates
and then do that for a couple of days
and start measuring ketosis like to see
if that level of carbohydrate reduction
is sufficient to trigger ketosis now if
you're not getting a certain percentage
of fat in as part of that macronutrient
mix I mean like I said I have a lot of
people that will think they can just go
in low carb and they're good but then
they'll eat like 220 grams of protein
and they'll kind of go through
gluconeogenesis in the liver with the
protein and so they're actually
increasing the amount of glycogen that
they already have so they're not getting
into ketosis so I usually have them do a
higher fat percentage along with the
low-carb well yes since you reduce
carbohydrates you have to kind of
increase another macronutrient basically
meet your caloric needs for the day so
some people can do like higher protein
with the same reduction of carbohydrates
and some fat and remain in ketosis like
I don't know maybe up to 100 something
grams of protein per day and still
remain in ketosis and if you would you
can and the basic ketogenic diet is
actually to increase fat to meet your
caloric needs with the increase in fat
fat intake does it matter the types of
fat whether it's saturated versus Poly's
versus Manas I'm not really sure about
this but the idea would be to kind of
eat food so like I try to be
unreasonable and consume fat as in
oiling your coffee
or going butter le I kind of don't like
this oh yeah me too I'm a big guy I'm a
big fan of avoiding the bulletproof
coffee tried it for a while and man it
did not work for me at all well I
personally tried it once or twice but I
don't know it seemed kind of odd to see
oil getting out to getting to the top of
ba to the top of my coffee and I know it
seemed odd and I I didn't like it yeah
yeah I actually gained abdominal fat
when I tried dad going bulletproof and
it was just not it didn't work for me
and I've had several people it didn't
work for but you know I still have some
that really really raved about it but
you know we with doing a lot of genetic
analysis we run into several people that
don't do well with with high fat diets
especially saturated fat so you know he
says if we see somebody with an a bowi
for I mean just you know that a boat
that April East enzyme is going to be
transferring fats through membranes and
across channels in the brain and can
result in a great deal of inflammation
but we've also had people that we could
use less saturated fat and use more
monos and Omega threes not truly get
them into ketosis but you know I think
there are some genetic genetic markers
that we should really watch to avoid
recommending and ketogenic diets for
people as well did you look at their
blood profiles at the same time yeah
they I mean typically when they're in a
belief or if we have them on a high-fat
diet especially saturated fats their
their numbers go really high especially
with the the particle bad particle
counts as well okay was what about
triglycerides uh triglycerides on the
apoE force they tend to go up not
excessively I mean we're talking like
mid 200s
on the high-fat diet but not to the
point where you know I've seen some
people with an AoE - that will go up to
400 on a high-fat diet which is not
really that big of a deal it's just
they're not converting into the LDL so
they tend to maintain a low total
cholesterol low LDL but a elevated
triglycerides and that generally is not
something that I get too concerned about
in that situation they have Oh III
threes are the ones that tend to do
really well with the ketogenic diets
them okay I don't know if you've had any
experience with people talking about
that on the forums or anything like that
well I didn't actually really look into
it too much so I cannot say a lot of fun
and with it with the Alzheimer's risk in
the heart disease risk associated with a
Bowie for I'm just very cautious about
recommending the ketogenic style diet
for for that group of people and you
know that's it makes up 25% of the
population yeah well they look lovely
it's probably better not recommending it
if you made these observations based on
me the cases that you've gone through
and most of the time when we're looking
at a ketogenic diet because ketogenic
diets are not easy to follow I mean it
let's be honest about it I mean it is
right some work to really focus on that
most of the people who have done that
are people that are very interested in
really aggressive weight loss fat loss
predominantly or their endurance
athletes that want to really improve
their performance because you know let's
face it a keto adapted athlete it's an
endurance athlete is a rock star yeah
Geoff Olek did a study on alter
attempted athletes and they published
they published a study I think it was
2015 when so I think it was December
2015 when they released their results it
was pretty insightful not also I know
that some bodybuilders also use
Kirra Jiang dad's when when they are in
a cutting phase when they are trying to
like lose body fat so yeah it's kind of
restrictive but at the same time I think
there are a lot of especially nowadays
there are there are a lot of foods and
also alternatives that you could have on
ketogenic diet there are substitutes of
higher carbohydrate foods like different
flours - for example if you want to cook
like I don't know cake or something you
could use different flours that our
ketogenic friendly what the same thing
people the would beat says they use
instead of wheat flour they use like
some nut flours and you get the point
yeah so more of the almond flours and
things like that yeah that's right okay
what are your thoughts on like the keto
bars I know there's a lot of people
capitalizing on the ketogenic raves and
they're promoting all these supplement
bars you know here we are in this paleo
world and you know everybody labels
everything paleo and yet you go to the
oranges right you go through the
conference and everything is a
manufactured food well what do I think
about it well the idea of a ketogenic
that would be to try to not to try to
eat food basically not a lot of
supplements and a lot of meal
replacements and a lot of bars it's not
that I'm against it especially if you're
a healthy person if you're a healthy
person you can consume whatever you want
as as long as your blood profile remains
constant and remains good you could eat
whatever you want as long as you are
also satisfied
with your body composition but if you're
if you wanna like use a ketogenic diet
to lose to lose body fat you should try
to start by consuming food and if you
see there's progression there keep doing
it if you don't try it like change some
of the variables yeah how that line what
about Keita assaults you know I know
Peter T and those guys really promote
the use of Kido Kido salts to boost
ketosis well I'm not sure if beater
promotes that maybe it's Dom D'Agostino
that was really pushing that one well
Peter attea experimented from what I
know experimented with some of those
sahjhan as ketones but it was only at
the level explode experimentation
my opinion about this is that I don't
know
it's not that I'm completely against
them but I wouldn't use them you should
if you want a the basic idea behind a
ketogenic diet for weight loss is
carbohydrate restriction so right you
know oh go ahead no go ahead what I
wanted to to kind of shift to an area
that's a little bit controversial when
it comes to this and I know our coaches
are going to get a lot of questions
about this so any insight you can give
would be wonderful but there is a huge
kind of thing in the collective right
now about using a ketogenic diet to to
slow the progression of cancers and I
know the theory behind it is you know
cancer cells typically use glucose for
metabolism and you know when the theory
behind it is you starve the cancer cells
by going on a ketogenic diet because you
don't supplied
circulating glucose for them I mean
where are your thoughts on that or do
you have any insight into that well
there's a hell lot to say about this
first of all the view that cancers are
glycolytic are only glycolytic is
extremely simplistic right and at often
I don't know I see it coming from people
who actually don't really look at the
big picture with which is extremely
extremely complex when it comes to
cancers and if you talk about if if you
want to talk strictly metabolically yes
there are cancers that are more
glycolytic than others but there are
cancers that can adapt to using
different substrates and there are
cancers that even can exploit the tofu
g4 for further progression I'm not sure
if you've read the the the most cited in
two papers on on cancer on the hallmarks
of cancer which was the first one was
written in 2001 and the second one was
in 2011 by Hanahan and Weinberg I have
seen that I've seen some excerpts from
those but I haven't actually read the
studies I think I did a summary of the
last one so maybe it was done most some
of your material that I actually read
that did possibly so one of the points
is of the acknowledgement that the
acknowledgement of the Warburg effect
but the rest of the points kind of get
you the idea that this is an extremely
complex issue and it shouldn't be viewed
strictly metabolically as some people
try to promote it because it's much more
than that
and it it gets even worse is when when
you dial in
metastasis which it's one of the biggest
dilemmas I think well and you know one
of the the aspects that I explain to
people is that even though you're
ketogenic does not mean you lose all
your glycogen stores and it doesn't mean
you don't have circulating glucose I
mean you know when we go on a ketogenic
diet we have that initial drop in in
serum blood glucose but then it
stabilizes and it stays there I mean
even if you're in full starvation that
you glycogen remains constant and it as
you said after the initial drop your
body probably gets used to it's going to
be replenished to a certain point
yeah like a physiologic normal point
like you wouldn't run completely why can
Jen deplete it when you're in a
ketogenic diet because once you've liked
when you when you go from a higher
carbohydrate diet to a ketogenic diet
that's probably when you drastically
lose a lot of glycogen in the initial
few days but until your body dials back
to like a functional range then after
that you probably like it the the point
that I'm trying to make is that you
don't run glycogen deplete right sorry
that you're not consuming carbohydrates
right and I think that's a common myth
that people have when there's they're
thinking that they're going into ketosis
now from your experience I mean how long
let's say somebody decides they want to
go on a ketogenic diet and they they
reduce their carbohydrates to 50 grams
or less a day how long do you typically
see someone shifting or does it have to
do with how much glycogen they have
stored or this is pretty standard how
long until they basically reach ketosis
right well this also depends on an
individual basis but I would say that a
couple of days most people mostly
can reach ketosis in a couple of days
some some people even like faster
because let's say that you have 1500 to
2,000 calories stored as glycogen and
you would deplete that in about two or
three days if you eat a normal kid
organic diet I think and then the of the
up regulation is ketogenesis it all
happens basically it's not like there's
glycogen depletion up to a certain point
then there's a increased fat oxidation
from there on and they kind of in like
mix together also they kind of can't
find the word so you're talking about
the transition from ketosis to keto
adaptation right it's not like they have
been individually they so getting back
to the main point it takes a couple of
days for most people to reach ketosis
and what you were getting at was the
keto adaptation state which is where
they're actually I mean there's a
difference between having that that
ketosis in the blood and getting the
body adapted to that keto adaptation
correct well Jerrod updation would
basically mean that the body is very
efficient to being in the state of
ketosis so it kind of got used to the
state of ketosis that probably means
that you would have to maintain the
state of ketosis or I don't know a long
time yet I'm not sure if there's a
really strict or there should be a
really strict definition of keto
adaptation because you know I've seen
some variations on what people classify
is the key to adaptation seen where they
say when the heart
transitions from using a glucose over to
using the fatty acids as are they
ketones as the primary source I don't
have hard up from what I know the hard
primarily uses fatty acids or energy
right but they still use it still uses a
percentage of that glucose and then when
it becomes that that kind of
all-inclusive part as well as the brain
a brain which is predominantly glucose
can can actually key to adapt so it's
probably I don't know so if we talk
about Kyra temptation and how long it
takes we have to and I don't think we
can specifically quantify this because
it would be it would be in terms of the
up regulation of enzymes and other
factors that would support ongoing
ketogenesis and like I said I I'm not
sure if we can quantify this but we
could say that Kiro adaptation is when
you maintain a state of ketosis like
trying to maintain it constantly
I saw one study and it wasn't a tias
study it was the the other the other one
you mentioned on keto adaptation rolling
systolic study yeah where he had shown
that the time to exhaustion on the
treadmill in the initial phase of
ketosis they dropped to 80% of max but
then after I think it was two weeks they
were a hundred and fifty five percent of
their initial as far as time to
exhaustion with that and that's I think
that's what they were kind of
classifying as that keto adaptations
are you familiar with that actually not
quite so I don't think I can say much
about that did they actually look into
the RQ of B yet and there was a
substantial difference between that one
week and the ketosis from the initial
and then at that two-week point where
they said that the they were measuring
RQ and they were measuring time to
failure okay well actually if you try to
dial up nutrition and it probably
doesn't take that long to to be adapted
to this state of ketosis I'm not sure if
there are extra benefits if you are in
ketosis for let's say two three four
weeks or two or three months and if you
try to remain ketonic like for six
months I'm not sure if there is a big
difference between someone who's been
ketotic for three weeks so someone who's
been ketonic for six months yeah I
haven't looked at that yeah I mean I
think once you hit that state you're
kind of you're are to kind of gets
established but you got to get through
that initial phase of it to get to that
that efficiency state yeah and there
might be difficult for some people
coming from a higher carbohydrate
nutrition because he you have to
understand it you're doing something
that's different from what you've been
doing so far so like trying to go the
opposite direction trying to limit
certain foods it might be a bit
difficult but the goal if you have a
certain goal in mind it should be
achievable I wanted to share the this
picture because this is always something
that I like to share the the keto
adapted to athletes
this this one here which is talking
about how much calorie reserve if you're
a glycogen burner an athlete that's in
burning glycogen versus how much reserve
you have for energy when you're in a
ketogenic Akio adapted state yeah well
yeah that's a really good one and
there's another important point that I
should make here and from what I've
observed aside of the aside of the
subjective higher mental performance I
would say it was the reduction in hunger
so yeah the complete the complete
reduction if I can call it like that and
hunger that was one of the like
subjective experiences that that I got
after being ketonic for a certain time
so did you notice a change in your
calorie intake I mean total calories for
the day when you went into a keto get a
genetic diet
well I remained kind of within the same
limit so I try to to remain within the
same limit of calories okay but it's to
me it's much much easier to restrict
calories with ketosis yes and same
experience and with intermittent fasting
because you would intermittent fasting
you impose further restriction to
yourself and if you only limit your
caloric intake to a certain timeframe of
the day and you try to be consistent
with that it's kind of easy to
calorically respect so these are
basically just good tools for people who
want to lose weight I'm not sure if
intermittent fasting is good for someone
who wants to like gain a lot of
you know I've actually had good
experience with muscle gain on
intermittent fasting I've been I do
intermittent fasting I've been doing it
for about five years so I I don't eat my
first meal until usually noon or one
o'clock and I'm not saying it's not
possible yeah it is
but to optimal I'm not sure so like for
bodybuilders who want to maximize well I
mean what you're looking at is you're
looking at your activating amp K so
you're going to inhibit mTOR and you
know theoretically you're not going to
be able to build muscle although you
know I've seen some studies on this with
using metformin and glucophage that's
you know it's a pretty strong inhibitor
of an activator of amp K an inhibitor of
mTOR but they have not shown in that
situation that it really impacts muscle
games as much I mean I I have to admit
it's harder to gain muscle when you're
doing it but it doesn't completely
eliminate the the ability right yeah so
so we're not talking in absolutes right
we're talking in proportions
right I would be interested in to
looking in the study you you mentioned
did they have like body composition data
with a body composition changes with
metformin in terms of muscle progression
I'll have to look it's been a while
since I read the article because I had a
lot of people asking me about it when we
were using we use a lot of metformin in
our clinical practice and some people we
were leaning more towards berberine to
elevate the amp K because it has less of
an impact on mTOR for some reason but
yeah I'll see if I can find that for you
okay do you know of any measure for like
any marker to quantify the upregulation
of MK I don't that's the that's the one
thing I you know I don't know if we have
an actual biomarker that we can measure
I don't know Sarah
but it would be great if we can get if
we get into that well I don't want to
keep you all morning but I do want to
have you mention your books and how
people can get access to them well the
one that's specific to my ketogenic
journey is ketone power so that's
available on Amazon and the one that's a
combination of ketosis and intermittent
fasting that's also available on my
Amazon profile page so anyone who's
interested can get them there and his
name is easy it's Christie Vlad CRI STI
v la D so easy to find him on on the
