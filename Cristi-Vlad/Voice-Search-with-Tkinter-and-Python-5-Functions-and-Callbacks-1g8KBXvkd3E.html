search or created that is the YouTube
and the Amazon buttons these are radio
buttons we have to add them to the
functions get and call back in order to
respond in order to have them respond to
the search functionality so how do we do
this well let's start with the call back
function over here the one this is the
one that responds to clicking the search
button this one so well what we'll have
to do is simply add two more Elif
statements so let's do the one for
Amazon first so okay so L F button to
get equals equals so the value of Amazon
is a MZ then web browser open and it's
going to be I have it written down HTTP
amazon.com s question mark URL equals
search elias percentage 3 d strip books
and field keywords
that's it and whatever it's inside our
entry get function so whenever we input
text over here and hit the search and we
have the Amazon radio button it's gonna
search on Amazon for whatever is in our
entry in this one in our entry field
okay and the other one the one for the
one for YouTube Elif button to get
equals equals the value of the button
YouTube is ytb okay then web browser
open and this is simpler HTTP this is
also HTTP okay so HTTP it's gonna be
youtube.com results question mark search
query and whatever it's inside our entry
field entry one gap okay
hopefully I have this right
and let's just another let's just add
another else bass over here okay so
we're gonna do the same thing for the
get function which is basically the one
that's called back when you search for
something and hit enter instead of
clicking the search button so we'll do
the same thing copy these paste them
over here make sure they are indented
correctly okay now let's see if we get
an error here so let's save and run it
f5
okay all right so we have no error now
let's test this by searching for one of
my books on Amazon so select Amazon and
let's search for stress and adaptation
adaptation stress and adaptation
click on the search okay
let's do the same thing by instead of
clicking the search we'll hit the enter
so stress an adaptation and I'm hitting
the enter button and it does the same
thing all right I guess this is it for
this video and the next one will
probably start on working on this voice
search functionality okay so if you
enjoyed this video please give me a
thumbs up and subscribe thank you for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
