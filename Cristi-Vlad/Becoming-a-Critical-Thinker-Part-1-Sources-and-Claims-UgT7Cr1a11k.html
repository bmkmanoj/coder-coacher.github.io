starting a new series on critical
thinking and I will build upon the work
done by Michael Shermer of skeptic
magazine and formerly by a Carl Sagan in
their support for critical thinking they
developed a baloney detection kit which
contains a set of 10 questions to ask
oneself when presented with any claim
argument or piece of information in this
video I'm going to start with the first
question in the baloney detection kit
that is how reliable is your source like
any normal child I used to engage in
magical thinking we had this local
newspaper called Dracula that came out
once a week I can still remember the
excitement I would get on Tuesday
evenings knowing that the new edition of
Dracula would be in my hands next day
after school as the title might suggest
the newspaper presented articles about
paranormal phenomena all things UFOs
ghosts fortune tellers services and the
weekly vampire column wouldn't it be odd
that in a small country like Romania
there were at least a few weekly
Encounters of vampires and that people
sending messages to their living
relatives it's like they were on a tight
schedule
it didn't matter I was absorbed not only
i but also the many other credulous
believers who would stand in line at the
newspaper kiosk every wednesday to my
defense I was a kid I knew little the
rest of the group consisted mostly of
grownups whoever they there what sort of
twisted logic was playing inside their
heads I think it was in the 6th or if
7th grade when I gradually started
adopting other interests more social
ones my devotion to Dracula slowly but
surely faded away
I'm not sure if this newspaper is still
in print I wouldn't be surprised if it
is my point I kept saying it my blogs
and I'll keep saying it human nature is
faulty by design we are not in born
creatures of Reason we are creatures of
habit by default we're not for evolution
and our habitual nature we might not
have been here but the rules of the game
have changed
since the early days of the human
species we are no longer living in a
habitat with high risk of getting eaten
by a predatory animal our primary
instincts are no longer at high stake
most of us do not benefit from the
mental biases and heuristics that have
gradually been assigned to us by
evolution we should strive to rise above
this nature of ours but it seems that
most of us do not do not want we come to
life with these prepackaged biases we
have to self-educate
in rational thinking thinking as
ridiculously as it may sound is not a
given we think we are good thinkers the
thinking is a skill and like any skill
it is developed by deliberate or through
deliberate practice and not sure of the
purpose of dracula newspaper but it made
its point its cash flow point if I may
it successfully exploited my brain that
was primed toward fearfulness and the
most negative paranormal and outstanding
phenomena it was catchy to say the least
in our distant past such traits priming
towards negativity and the outstanding
or outlandish were life-saving always
being on the lookout for danger that was
a must
nowadays it is not but we do not know
that we respond to these stimuli by
giving them our attention and what's
inside our pockets both being scarce
resources too many people entities
behind newspapers of such the media at
large mostly no exceptions and even your
friends might at least once try
to exploit this vulnerability of yours I
really hope I made my point with my
story now in your to-do list whenever
you find yourself in a situation like
mine whenever you are being presented
evidence that might sound out of the
ordinary to guard yourself against
deception ask these two questions it is
my friend or this entity telling me this
just because they don't know better or
is my friend trying to deceive me on
purpose now any answer that results from
such question or questions does not
necessarily imply immediate response you
do not have to engage in counter
arguments or trying to tell the person
and/or entity that they are wrong
instead of being offensive keep it to
yourself
gradually digest it turn the claim on
all of its sides investigated with
various sources and build your own
argument all this will add up to your
repertoire of good thinking skills and
this is the first step in dealing with
the baloney we are being 24/7 bombarded
