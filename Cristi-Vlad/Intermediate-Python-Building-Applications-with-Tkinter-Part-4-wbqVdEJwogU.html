the series of creating a graphical
application with dk inter and Python I
ended the previous video leaving you
with two questions the first one was
what if you want to use a different
search engine other than Google and the
second one was what if you want to
conveniently switch between search
engines say between Google and
DuckDuckGo this is what we're gonna
start doing in this video and in the
next video so here's what I have in mind
I want to create two radio buttons one
saying Google and the other one saying
go and extend our call back and get
functions to be used by these buttons so
in this video we'll work on the
functions well in the next video we'll
code the radio buttons so let's do a
recap by running at five and see what
we've got
this is our application a search a
search bar that currently uses Google
and it acts like your search engine but
it has to we've coded two convenient
features in the previous videos let's
run a query here with zillions hit enter
or the search bar or the search button
and it should be using this search it
should be using the search engine
yes so actually I hit enter twice so
what it does it opens up a new window in
your browser with your search query the
convenient features are the add one it
occupies the least amount of space
within your monitor within your screen
as you can see it's quite minimal and
the second convenient feature is that it
stays on top of all the applications and
we've done this by using the windows
methods attributes topmost we've set it
to true ok so we want to have our
application use Google or DuckDuckGo at
our convenience
we'll start by defining a string
variable we're gonna call it BTN - it's
gonna be a string bar and we're gonna
make some space over here within our
functions
this variable is gonna hold the value of
our radio button instead of creating two
variables each one to hold the value for
each radio button will only gonna create
one variable BTM - that's gonna be
shared among the buttons why do we want
to do this having a shared value between
buttons allows for only one radio button
to be selected at a time we don't want
to have two radio buttons be selected at
once
so if button to get so if the value of
the variable is Google it's gonna use
Google as a search engine and we're just
gonna use a live button to get the value
of the variable it's gonna use let's
just copy this so control-c control-v
it's gonna use DuckDuckGo calm as a
search engine
the URL is basically the same so this is
for the callback function and we'll do
the same thing for the get function make
sure the indentation is correct we don't
need this one
so far so good
and we'll finish in the next section by
creating the two radio buttons and by
assigning them their functions if you
