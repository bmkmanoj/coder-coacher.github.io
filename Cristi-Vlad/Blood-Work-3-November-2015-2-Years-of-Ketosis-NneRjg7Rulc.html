over my recent blood test results now I
usually take samples every two to three
months but over the last year have been
fairly consistent with the results so
I'm not sure if I should do it that
often but let's see what's this all
about if you enjoyed this video please

now here's what I've been testing for
but let's put things into perspective
let's see a comparison with some values
that I did in the past now looking over
my current results I would say that my
lipid profile has not changed much since
July 2015 my total cholesterol is
currently 200 milligrams per deciliter
compared to 175 milligrams per deciliter
from our previous test but that doesn't
mean much in the greater scheme of
things because from what I think total
cholesterol is not relevant as long as
HDL LDL and most especially vldl which I
did not test for yet and triglycerides
are in a good range now since July I
kept using the same dietary approach
consisting of a low-calorie very low
carbohydrate ketogenic moderate to low
protein nutrition with sixty to seventy
percent of my calories coming from fat
and the rest from protein and
carbohydrates with the strategy I remain
in ketosis although I consume
significant amounts of vegetables and
plant foods I consume little me because
I'm not a big fan of but I do consume
eggs and dairy almost every day my
protein intake is moderate to low 50 to
70 grams per day and I do just fine with
that I don't obsess over protein and or
fat consumption instead I focus on
optimizing my nutrition for micro
nutrient intake and I'm more focused in
staying healthy for as long as possible
by keeping am tour which is the
mammalian target of rapamycin
insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin
low these are a priority for me and
intermittent fasting helps me with that
I consume a low calorie diet because
it's very convenient for me I am never
hungry or crave for specific foods on
the contrary I'm almost invariably
satisfied with consuming 1500 to 1,700 q
calories per day or calories and I've
been doing this for almost two years now
i can eat so little food because i
usually fast for at least 18 hours every
day and consume food in a six hour
feeding window and i usually have two
meals sometimes i have only one meal so
it's a challenge to compress or try to
consume 1500 to 1700 calories in only
two meals try that many times i can even
do that and i tend to lose weight after
a couple of days of my intermittent
fasting protocol but i don't want to
lose more weight which is why i
strategically over fee after a couple of
days now over feeding is when i consume
between 3,000 to 5,000 calories and have
more than two meals and this keep me
adherent to my protocol i am also able
to sustain my weight my highly sensitive
c-reactive protein which is hs-crp is
still way below the warming point it's
slightly higher than its previous value
though and i suspect this value is the
result of my adaptive immune system
getting used to the new strength of the
influenza virus it would have been
interesting to see my current blood
count my complete blood count highly
sensitive c-reactive protein could also
be higher because i'm experimenting with
consuming isolated casein protein post
workout and i will have to see about
this in future blood tests my hba1c
which is hemoglobin a1c has remained
mostly constant since july now i don't
test and i didn't test for blood glucose
levels because i think that hba1c is a
better mark of blood sugar levels
especially since it reflects a
three-month period trend interestingly
or not my testosterone levels are higher
than the value from july and this could
serve as a testimony for the efficiency
of my testosterone protocol now imagine
that following a low-calorie
moderate to low protein nutritional
protocol and maintaining testosterone
levels high this is totally against what
every guru is pitching out there one
thing to mention is that even though I
don't obsess over fat consumption I do
consume healthy fats from eggs nuts
seeds some meat cod liver oil Lord olive
oil coconut derived foods etc and I do
not consume oil or butter coffee or
plain butter which seems to be
mainstream now I also did some thyroid
marker testing and d3 is on the lower
range but it's not like I did not expect
to see this caloric and carbohydrate
intake are both correlated with d3
levels as I've extensively written about
this on the blog the rest of my thyroid
markers fell in their normal range one
thing that I have to point out is that I
purpose to maintain d three levels
fairly low as they seem to be correlated
with longevity provided at other markers
of thyroid health or normal and for
those of you who don't know d three or
try I adult irony is the most active of
thyroid hormones and its purpose briefly
speaking is to speed up chemical
metabolic processes in the body in lay
terms speed up metabolism but I
personally don't want a faster or sped
up metabolism because I consider I would
waste myself faster this way so I may be
wrong but I fairly satisfied with my
current strategy a strategy that I've
been refining over the last two years
now I plan to start writing or talking
more on the type of heavy lifting
protocol that I'm currently doing I've
gone into the details of it in my
recently released course on ketosis and
intermittent fasting which you can find

interventions you can see these further
