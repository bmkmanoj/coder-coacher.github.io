some features to help you debug your
serviceworker cache hey guys Chris love
the owner of love - dev and today I want
to cover a few things about the chrome
developer tools to help you manage your
serviceworker caching in the last week
or so which basically is mid-october
2017 chrome 62 shipped and they added a
few new features to the serviceworker
cache interface to help you manage
things through the developer tools and
these are some very much needed feature
enhancements to the serviceworker cache
interface so let's get started the first
thing is additional information is being
displayed now in the past you would have
the path and then you would have
essentially okay or blank typically was
stored there I think right towards the
end they got to a couple of other things
but now we've got the mime type which is
also the content header is being
displayed and that can be very useful to
troubleshoot some potential issues you
also have the size of the actual file
which is the content link value and when
was the file cache so you can see how
long has it been sitting there in cache
so this is all extremely helpful
extremely useful to help debug things
but additionally if you actually select
the item and this is where things get
really awesome - is you get some of the
features that we get in the network
panel right here in the cache as well
now realize this is going to show you
what was actually persisted in the
serviceworker cache so that gives you
some insight into what is actually being
rendered or retrieved back to your UI
from your serviceworker so you get the
headers tab here and that's going to
give you the actual URL that was used to
get the resource from your server in
this case I'm doing locally so it's got
the local host
the actual method the status code which
typically is probably gonna be 200 and
you're probably gonna have get as far as
what you cash that's what you're looking
for but you're also going to see
response headers now because I'm doing
localhost I don't have any of these the
cache control header kind of things set
per se and that's why you got the max
age equal negative negative 1 I would
not do that for a production site but
these are there but it gives you insight
into what's going on and I think that's
pretty awesome
again additionally you can also see what
is actually stored in your cache and
this I really love because now I've got
the ability to actually see the markup
or the CSS the JavaScript I believe if I
scroll down I think I've got some images
in here as well this is a font that's a
font file here's a gift so yeah there we
go you can actually see the the image so
that is really awesome now what I'm
gonna do here as long as my little
server will honor it I'm just gonna
delete all these out and we're going to
hopefully go see this yes there it gets
kicks in okay good now in the past one
thing that drove me bonkers was kind of
having to come over here and manually
refresh the actual serviceworker cache
another thing that drove me nuts is this
refresh button was always down here at
the bottom it just was just not in the
right spot for a good experience but now
we've got the ability to believe this
will work - there we go you can see this
is a special cache I have setup where
product images are being stored that way
I can kind of control how many product
images are being persisted in the cache
that doesn't get like massive okay and
as you can see I don't have to manually
refresh anything as soon as something is
put into that particular cache it is
also reflected over here as well
- you should see it reflected there
there we go right there
Oh - shows up in our cache we don't have
to do anything
so just to recap some great new features
have been added to the chrome developer
tools as it relates to serviceworker
cache now first off is we get more
details about the actual asset being
stored like the content type how big the
file is and when was it added to the
cache and that is very important to me
we also get to look at the headers we
got the general header the response
header we even got the request errors we
didn't see that on the other ones so
that's pretty nice we also could see
what what headers did we send down to
the server to actually get the response
so that that can be very useful with
serviceworker caching because you can
actually manipulate the requests even
though it's that ultimately getting the
same file you could manipulate the
requests slightly different one let's
say you're looking at
internationalization you could pass down
a different language header and the
response could be different so you could
actually cache for different languages
which you know it's possible and then we
also get the preview here but another
key advantage of the updates to the
serviceworker cache interface is that
now I don't have to manually go back and
refresh the cache to see what has
changed as I go through it'll
automatically change right before your
eyes so if you've had a little
frustration with serviceworker caching
and troubleshooting debugging
I think the chrome 62 developer tools
have added some great new features to it
also the next day or so
I plan on showing a very similar video
on what's available in Microsoft edge as
far as managing the serviceworker cache
so definitely want to subscribe to the
channel you don't miss out on that video
if you get any questions about service
worker or serviceworker caching deal
please feel free to leave those in the
comments below I love to interact with
you on that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
