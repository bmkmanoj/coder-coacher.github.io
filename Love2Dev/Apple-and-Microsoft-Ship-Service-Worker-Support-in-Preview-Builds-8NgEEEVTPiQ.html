everywhere is Apple and Microsoft both
ship early preview versions of their
browser supporting service workers what
does this mean and what can you expect
hey guys Chris loved the owner of love
to dev and this is a big week Christmas
is right around the corner and Apple and
Microsoft have shipped gifts for
developers everywhere by adding
serviceworker support by default in both
Safari and Microsoft edge this is huge
news because these are the last two
primary browsers without serviceworker
support now as we've talked about
earlier
Microsoft did ship Microsoft edge with
service workers back in September in the
fall creators insiders builds however
you have to enable that by going to the
about flags today however that's changed
for insiders the insider edition of
Microsoft Windows ships with a version
of Microsoft edge that has service
workers turned on by default Service
Worker support in Microsoft edge
supports all the caching functionality
as well as native push notifications I
haven't got clarification yet if
background sync is supported but I'll
verify that as soon as I possibly can
and let you know now Microsoft has been
public about their enthusiasm behind
progressive web applications and this is
the last piece of the puzzle they have
supported progressive web apps also in
an earlier form they called it hosted
web apps and they've been very
enthusiastic about it since Windows 10
released several years ago so now we're
going to have full platform
functionality for progressive web apps
in Microsoft edge on Windows but not to
be outdone the very next day Apple
publicly announced that the latest
version of the Safari technology preview
has service workers turned on by default
you can download the Safari technology
preview if you're on Mac OS and try it
out yourself personally I don't have Mac
so I can't try this out and I can't give
you any direct feedback I needed to
check to see if this is available on
something like browser stack so I can
see what's going on now this is very
exciting to see the momentum that Apple
is pursuing with service workers and
progressive web applications we first
heard that Apple was going to start
implementing service workers back in
August but because Apple and the Safari
team are very tight-lipped about what
they're working on we haven't been quite
sure what the status is but this is a
very clear indication that they're
pushing very hard and fast to deliver
service workers for mass support now I
don't know when they'll ship and no one
else outside of their team really knows
when they plan on shipping but my guess
is probably next fall because that's
when they do their major updates
hopefully it'll be before then but who
knows stay tuned and I'll be one of the
first ones to tell you about it shipping
to the masses and hopefully it's going
to be available on iPhone and iPads
sooner rather than later
now this dovetails with some other
activity going on in Cupertino just a
few weeks ago apple also announced on
the WebKit Status page that they're
working on implementing the web manifest
specification this is a clear indication
that Apple has finally decided to adopt
progressive web applications again
they're not very public in talking about
what they're doing but these are very
clear signals that progressive web
applications are coming to iOS and Mac
OS and to round it up if you've been
following me this week I also reported
that the Apple App Store is becoming
very aggressive in rejecting
applications that they feel should be
websites or web applications instead and
they're also removing hundreds of
thousands of apps from the Apple App
Store that they feel like should not be
apps
rather should be websites and I clearly
see that Apple with these actions is
starting to drive businesses and
marketers and anybody who's trying to
gain access to consumers and customers
our line of business applications
pushing them towards a progressive web
application solution and one of the
things I've talked about in that video
is the Apple App Store actually is very
expensive for them to maintain now they
make I think three and a half billion
dollars a year in revenue but the
margins are not very good compared to
their hardware sales so it's in their
best interest to become more profitable
by removing that overhead and if you
really break it down most activity still
happens on the web unless you're on
Facebook or you know looking up
something on Google Maps or in Gmail
evidently now if you haven't started
working on serviceworkers right now is
the time you need to start working on
service workers you need to start
learning how to develop and ship great
progressive web apps that use service
workers Service Worker caching and can
implement things like push notifications
now it may sound very simple at first
but there's a lot of details that you
need to know and I've got a solution for
you
my course progressive web application
from beginner to expert will guide you
from starting at nothing in covering
almost everything you could possibly
think about needing to know when it
relates to progressive web applications
and service workers this will make you
the developer that businesses want to
have to help them ship the great
progressive web app to engage with their
customers and increase their bottom line
so be the hero that your customers and
clients and stakeholders want and learn
to master progressive web applications
Microsoft and Apple are both behind this
Google is obviously behind it
Samsung a ship support opera ship
support and Firefox has shipped support
for progressive web applications this is
clearly the future of the web and
actually I would say it's
web today not only are the browsers
behind it the marketing search engine
optimization experts are behind
progressive web apps this is a golden
opportunity for you as a web developer
or as a business owner to upgrade your
skills and your online presence</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
