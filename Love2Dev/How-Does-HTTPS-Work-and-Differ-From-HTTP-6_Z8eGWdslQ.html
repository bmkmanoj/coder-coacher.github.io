works and how it differs from HTTP in
this video I'm gonna try to explain it
so anybody can understand hey guys Chris
love the owner I just want to just kind
of show you how HTTP works or at least
explain it and I'm using HTTP and going
to talk to you a little bit about why or
what it does to protect you from the bad
guys so without any further ado let's go
to it so first off basically you when
you visit a website and you're using
HTTP what we call passive attacker can
it can hit you and basically if you're
let's say you're at a coffee shop or a
restaurant anywhere you're using
potentially using public Wi-Fi it's very
simple as long as the bad guys got an
antenna they can essentially sit there
and log all the data that's going
through the air and if it's in plain
text which is what HTTP will be when I
say plain text it also means images and
things like that they can also just view
okay and that's what's going on so they
could so if you're on you know
potentially sensitive sites they can see
exactly what you're doing some scenarios
I've been kind of taught about is maybe
you're doing research for work or stock
investment and you need to keep like
your research private or without prying
eyes you know corporate espionage can
sit there and see what's going on or
maybe somebody who's going to create
some fake news to tank a stock or make
it rise or something to go the opposite
of what you're doing who knows anyway
that stuff's just out there in the open
now the way tcp/ip works when it's when
you're using HTTPS and you go think
about this this kind of layered stack
of protocols now down here you've got
Internet Protocol and TCP protocol TCP
protocol whatever don't worry about
those too much but here's the hypertext
transport protocol or HTTP and this is
what this would be your plain text data
but when you use TLS which stands for
transport layer security that makes it
secure and that's what that's where the
s part of HTTP comes from the S stands
for secure that's because this layer
encrypts the data here so to see the
data here you have to go through that
TLS shield and if you don't have the
public and private keys to encrypt and
decrypt the data you're not going to be
able to see what's going on here with
the data packets so let's go back to our
passive attacker so now we've got HTTP
enabled and the problem is the passive
or at least the good thing is the
passive attacker can't read the data
going back and forth the the best the
attacker will be able to do is see what
URLs you're loading and that's
effectively all they're going to see
they're not gonna see what data was
pushed back and forth and that's always
a good deal for protecting you now
alternatively you could have an active
attacker and this is more commonly known
as the man in the middle attack and this
is where the the attacker would set up
some sort of proxy in the middle maybe
they've compromised a router on the
internet or something and they're
they're logging all of the information
coming through that router or maybe
they're trying to fish you or something
like that it's those kind of scenarios
that you're guarding against so what
they will do is they will reroute you
from the site that you want to go to
over to their fake version of the site
sometimes this is kind of typical
phishing attack but it could also be
what we call the man the middle where
they they siphon off the traffic to the
real site to their fake pages trying to
collect you know password
or banking information or their social
security numbers for identity theft or
what-have-you and this can easily happen
with HTTP because they can they can see
more what's going on in those middle
parts and if they do compromise that
router in the middle somewhere and they
are in charge of controlling where
domains resolve to or where pass resolve
to your eyes resolve to they can make
that go anywhere they want to now if
you've got your TLS layer in place even
if they do compromise that router in the
middle when you try to communicate to
the fake server the identity is
compromised and that means that the
browser won't honor the data coming back
from that server and if you're worried
the attacker will not be able to decrypt
the data go into the server or even if
they're acting as middlemen and even
passing you along to the right server
they're still not going to be able to
see the communications because they
don't have the keys to encrypt and
decrypt the data effectively so it's all
just jumbled up you know characters to
them they can't really tell what's going
on now the way HTTP works is that it
adds some extra back-and-forth to the
regular HTTP communication stack and
this happens when the connection is
initiated so it starts off with you
requesting connection to the receiver or
the server here and basically there's
what we call a Naknek kind of thing
going back and forth I won't get into
the geek-speak so much here but
basically you initiate and then the
server comes back and says yep I'm here
and then there's what we call a hello
exchange that goes on and the server
says hello here's the stuff for the
certificate the client kind of verifies
the certificate keys and the ciphers and
at that point at this point right here
the secure connection is established and
now you start sending back and forth the
real data and it's going to be covered
in that HTTPS security blanket now I've
got some numbers here these are just
kind of rough numbers based on kind of
some industry averages I
see this happen way faster than this in
the real world especially with HTTP to
this little part right here does not
take near this amount of time typically
I see numbers a lot of times under 50
milliseconds for this whole exchange and
encryption side to really kick in now if
you are wanting to know more about using
HTTPS I've got a course on progressive
web apps which require HTTPS to work
things like service workers and a lot of
new api's things like that anytime you
dealing with sensitive data search
engine optimization all these kind of
things all rely on HTTPS and progressive
web apps are a great new way to build
websites that really engage customers
and I've got a course at right now
sitting with over 20 hours of video
content to train you on how to start
your progressive web app journey and
become a progressive web application
expert and if you visit PW course comm
that will take you directly to the
course registration page where you can
save 171 dollars off the regular 200
dollar list price and you can start your
journey for the best price possible
thanks a lot if you've got any questions
about HTTPS please feel free to leave
those in the comments below and I've got
a lot more content and the queue to post
so you definitely want to miss that so

you're in the loop for everything that I
will be posting thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
