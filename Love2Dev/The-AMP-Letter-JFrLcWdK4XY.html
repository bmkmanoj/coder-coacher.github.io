hopefully a short video today I wanted
to talk to you about amp Google
accelerated mobile pages now earlier
this week some of my friends got
together and made a statement about amp
and really did a good job articulating
the good things about it but also our
problems with amp and they posted it on
amp letter org and I challenge you to go
out read the letter and then also do
some evaluation of accelerated mobile
pages yourself what are accelerated
mobile pages you asked I don't think a
lot of developers know what they are but
I do know marketers know exactly what
they are about two and a half years ago
the Google search team launched the
Google amp project there's a way to try
to make the web great again what they
wanted to do was battle the poor
performance that they were seeing
chronically plaguing the internet
especially around news sites so they
targeted new sites specifically but
they're branching out into other areas
like e-commerce right now the way it
works is you have your existing website
but you also have to essentially create
a parallel website using the amp
guidelines now amp was originally
created using the polymer project but I
believe they've actually forked that
project and turned it into their own
little library it's based on web
components and there's a few little
small Pete actually there's really just
a few small pieces they actually use in
an amp as far as I can tell
for example they have an amp image
element and my guess is what they're
doing is you set it up like a regular
image but when the amp server gets it it
renders it out what it does is it turns
your image into a responsive image array
and also optimizes those images for you
if you don't know what responsive images
are don't worry about that today I'll
have some more content about that than
your future but highly recommend it
every image on my blog basically for the
last two plus years has been optimized
but I've also created responsive image
arrays as well unless the image is
really small so but that's beside the
point basically they're just going
through and optimizing things for you
another rule is you can't have
third-party scripts on the page
which for new sites is really a bad
thing because now they can't monetize
because new sites don't run their own ad
services they rely on third-party ad
services and this is where the big
problem really lies
you see third-party ad services are
things that produce all that you may
also want to read the kind of stuff and
and the ads obviously but the problem is
they lean on really poorly written and
architected code some of the worst
JavaScript out there to be honest with
you and it's very unfortunate that the
amount of volume and money that flows
through those companies they can't
afford to hire developers with an actual
skill set that they need and I'm saying
that just being fight honest your code
sucks and it's one of the reasons why
the web is not doing well it's doing
well but when the average page takes 19
seconds to load on a mobile device we've
got serious problems pages should take
less than 5 seconds on mobile devices
and more like 3 in fact if you don't
load in 3 seconds generally you've lost
half the people that try to load that
page so speed is super important and
that's why Google tried identifier so
who created the amp letter well it was a
group of what I consider to be some of
the best web developers and thought
leaders out there many of these are my
friends and also people who influenced
the way that I know to build websites
the right way these are the people who
propagate out the web development best
practices now they as far as I can tell
I don't see anybody on the Google
payroll I don't see anybody on the
Microsoft payroll yet it doesn't mean
that they're not at some of the names I
don't recognize there's a lot of people
who have signed it like myself after
they published it and one of the things
I want to challenge you to do is to go
read the amp letter do a little research
on app if you're not familiar with it
decide maybe I should support this or
maybe you don't want to support it if
you do do the pull request and sign the
letter I did
it's not binding you're not gonna get
thrown in jail or anything like that
don't worry but anyway we're the points
that we were trying to make up the amp
letter well google should not treat a
Google page better than an external page
and the reason we say a Google page is
because when you do amp your page your
amp page is sucked into the amp
processor and it renders it out and puts
it on a Google web server and it's
served under a Google domain now up to a
few months ago this was always
google.com slash amp slash something
else like an identifier for your site
now they're in the process of migrating
this I don't know where they're at with
it so that it's like you're your
publisher ID dot amp project.org or com
whatever it is I don't remember
so either way it's a Google domain and
not the actual publishers domain and
this is one of the problems that I have
is that the content you produce is no
longer your content it's sort of a way
in my opinion for Google to create a
walled garden of content that they
control and not push traffic outside of
the Google property and that's one of
the things that companies like Google
Facebook Apple and so forth try to do
they try to keep you owned their
property as long as possible because
that's how they make money for example
Facebook when you click a link to go to
a blog post you don't really go to the
site you open up a little an extra
window in the Facebook app that loads
the site you don't even get to see the
address in the address bar now I got a
problem with that per se but I be honest
you don't when you copy the link it's
not a direct link to the article it's a
it's a link to the Facebook version of
the article I don't like that be honest
with you that's because facebook wants
to keep you inside of Facebook and not
leave their boundary because that's how
they make their money so the next thing
that we have a big problem with is the
preferential treatment Google gives
these Google hosted pages you see when
you do an amp page you get preferential
treatment in the search engine results
and that gives you an advantage
sort of people go to the page but it's
still not your site it's not your
property so I'm not sure how much of
advantage it really is to be blunt make
sure you get a lot more people reading
your content but do you really get the
credit that you need for it essentially
the monetization side of it no not
really does it really cost you anything
probably cost you real traffic on your
site but honestly if your page takes 19
seconds to load you're not really
getting a lot of value traffic anyway so
I don't so that's the problem so what
happens now
well should Google reward those sites
with a four good perf whether they're
amp or not well no yeah I know how to
make web sites lewd almost instantly and
the people who create this letter and
sign this letter do as well and we all
strive to make pages load fast and we do
our best to apply these best practices
to all the pages that we work on and a
lot of times I'll be quite honest I
guarantee you we know how to make pages
load faster than ample ODEs so why
should amp get the preferential
treatment over us why are we not why is
it just not another way to do it you see
we don't really have a problem with amp
it's general from a technical side in
fact I think it's probably actually
pretty good it's pretty close to what I
would like to see done I just don't want
it on the Google servers I don't want it
to get all the preferential search
ranking because that's what it really
boils down to so why not have I just
said you know we don't have a problem
but what about actual real published key
performance indicators for example speed
index this is one that the letter points
out this was created by Patrick meaning
a Google Chrome engineer by the way when
he made web page test and I won't get
into the math of it because it's some
calculus but it's a very good indicator
does your page will go quickly or not
I'm gonna run a web page test over a URL
that's the first number I look at what
was the speed index I'm shooting for a
thousand I'm under 3500 maybe 3,000 I
still feel good about myself but the
average web page honestly is 15 to 30
even up to 100
50,000 now every thousand roughly
correlates to a full second and honestly
if I can get to a full second and be
fully loaded and interactive I've scored
a big one right there I think it's
really tough on mobile devices for a lot
of different reasons so even there I'm
not so upset when I've got a five
thousand score for example but this is a
really good indicator of how well your
site loads but it's not the only
indicator there are lots of other
metrics that could be used in fact
Google has some great tools that you can
measure your site performance with one
is offered by the search engine team
called Google PageSpeed tool and not a
hundred percent inline with what they
would they recommend they're about 90
percent of line and I'm comfortable with
that and the great thing is it's also a
node module just like the other tool
lighthouse now lighthouse is an
evolution of the google chrome developer
performance audits but today it's been
expanded into things like progressive
web apps accessibility and just general
best practices another great thing it's
also a node module so that means both of
these could be included in your regular
automated testing process to see where
you are and see if you're improving your
performance or not they're not the only
tools that are out there the edge team
also has one called sonar which I love
and it's another test runner tool that
does things like audit your website that
can also run performance tests as well
so there's a lot of ways to test things
out there I think what we need to do is
maybe sit down and have a little powwow
and determine these are the ten tests
that you should probably focus on
because they are going to be the top
indicators of good web performance but
it's also about user experience and
that's another thing to the amp project
uses a pretty standard layout that they
know works really well so they
essentially repurpose your content into
a into a a better user experience then
that doesn't mean that everybody else
can't do the same thing with or without
amp we absolutely can and so why should
it be the only way there should be many
paths to this better search engine
ranking and honestly the Google search
team always has actually publicly said
it page load speed is a performance
indicator earlier
ranking indicator that they use now we
know that there's at least 200
indicators because they migrated things
like ranked brain in which is artificial
intelligence that number is going to
increase 10 to 100 fold easily over the
next year and they're also moving to a
mobile first index and deprecating the
desktop index there's a lot of charm
that's going on in the Google search
ranking into those stuff now that means
the performances should be even more
forefront because it's like to me it's
like the main thing to drive all the
user experience if your page doesn't
look quick the rest of the user
experience honestly does not matter
because most people will never see it
anyway so performance should be a key
indicator and that's ultimately what
Google is looking for they rank pages
that do two things have a good user
experience and provide the content that
people really want and they look at
things like bounce rates and stuff like
that to determine that that's why search
engine optimizers are very tuned in to
what performance optimization honestly
they're more tuned into it than
developers are I've been very impressed
with how well they're following that not
so impressed with how well they can know
how to implement it but I'm really
impressed with the passion and the
knowledge that they learn and the way
that they try to learn it they do make
the effort developers unfortunately
don't it seems like so anyway so key
performance indicators to do that we
just need to identify some of those so
before I close off I just want to
challenge you to go read the amp later
do a research on map form your own
opinion and if you agree with the amp
later go to make a pull request and sign
it for yourself and I would love to have
a discussion with you leave them in the
comment section below and we can
dialogue about this and also when I make
this post permanent I'll put a link to a
blog post I've already written and you
can also read what I wrote about this
topic if you find any of this useful
please share with other friends and
hopefully we'll get more people on the
bandwagon with this thanks a lot guys
and I really wish all of your websites
to load superfast and have the best
experience as possible thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
