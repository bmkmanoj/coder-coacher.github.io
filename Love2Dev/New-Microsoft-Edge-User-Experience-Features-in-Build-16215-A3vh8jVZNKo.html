10 insider preview that has some new
features added to Microsoft edge and I
want to go over those features here in
today's video crystal here owner of love
2 dev and today we're going to review
some of the new features that have
shipped with Microsoft edge in the
Windows 10 insider preview version
16,000 to15 and this is for the PC dozen
look like they really shipped anything
updating on the mobile not that really
matters to a lot of people but today I
want to go over a few of the new
features and first and foremost the
feature that I'm actually excited is
back and I'm still trying to verify a
little bit information on this is they
built it to pen a website to your
taskbar notice is a very underutilized
feature and Internet Explorer and
basically what this does is allows you
to pin a website to your taskbar so that
you can launch it from down here now I'm
going to do so I'm going to open up
Facebook I'm going to show you a little
bug that I think is now shipping as well
and it could just be my machine but
notice how everything is massively
zoomed in here what I want to do is I'm
just going to flip over to another tab
and come back and what it does is it
usually pops back to the right size
there we go so I'm calling that a bug I
don't know about you but it annoys me
it's gotta be something else going on
and they have changed some of the way
the tabs open up and I got a feeling
there's something a little quirky there
but to add a a site or a page to the
home screen you have to go to the
settings menu and then pin this page to
the taskbar I set home screen that
taskbar I'm so sorry about that but now
you see that Facebook is down here if I
right-click on Facebook you'll notice
that it tells me that there's two
notifications which clearly matches up
to what we see right there now this is a
pretty cool feature now for Internet
Explorer you did have to add either
metadata to your head to drive this
feature or believers
so an XML file that would also drive
this feature along with the live tiles I
got to verify if that's still the case
it's what shipped with edge or not if so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
make a video to show you how to create
the code for your site so you can take
advantage of this pin to taskbar feature
now as I was trying to find where to do
this I also found this the pin here at
spike in there while I probably just
totally forgot I was there but one we do
is I'm going to pin this over here as
you can see this is the second one
append let me close this there we go
and so basically now Facebook is going
to be pinned over here is this going to
be kind of a sort of permanent tab a
little mini tab over here and I think
that's that's actually another nice user
experience feature all right now the
next one that I'm pretty stoked about
what it's almost going to close the
Facebook up here close tab there goes is
let's go over here to this obesity
article now what I'm going to do another
feature that did not ship with is that's
been in men and explore and pretty much
every other browser is to be able to hit
f11 and go full screen now this again
this is another very underutilized user
experience feature that is available
pretty much across the board but I think
most people don't realize you can hit
f11 to make a web page full screen
personally I kind of like this because
it just gives me more screen real estate
gets rid of the browser chrome and think
about it if you're starting to make
progressive web apps you want people to
add it to the home screen and launch
without the browser chrome and so this
is definitely something that end-users
would like to do now this does not
compete with or replace programmatically
using the full screen API again you have
to prompt to get permission from the
user if you're doing that but that's
that's kind of an adjacent way to make
your website fullscreen and of course
the other way will be progressive web
app which right now is not shipped in
edge but look for that later on ok now
let's go back to normal screen
and what we're going to do is one's
going to go the next page some pages of
text now this is an e-book and if you
know if you do have ebooks edge can be
your e-book reader which is actually
pretty nice and they've added the
ability to highlight with some different
colors you can also select and underline
and then you can also leave notes which
i think is very valuable all righty
and then that notes there and all you do
is just pop that up and there it is
that's going to great if you're doing
like research I can see this being super
valuable for student types and
everything now
edge can also be your PDF reader I want
to do is I'm going to zoom on on Ilias
book here and just like this I wish the
UI on this the context menu was a saying
but it's not this is PDF not an e-book
and here you have to select the
highlight to go off that it doesn't have
the ability to underline it and I don't
see the notes feature in here yet so
that's that's kind of unfortunate now
you can say those it was this folio yeah
I don't I'll push the barrier I do read
PDFs in here a lot is don't push the
barrier on too much like a probably
should another thing you can do is ask
Cortana about that text so you can have
her automatically look things up for you
and she will go out and find things for
us so that's pretty cool let's see I'm
just going to do this right click really
kind of wish that context when you pop
up right where I was at to see it went
down basically student being searched
for us that's kind of cool
makes it easy to do research now let's
go back over to the announcement blog
post because there's some things I don't
think I can truly show here just because
it's just not easy to do first so the
edge splash screen for newly launched
tabs basically
better transition I'm not sure how to
quantify that or demonstrate that so I'm
just going to let them have that bullet
point there but this next one is pretty
pretty valid right here pretty important
I think doesn't happen as often and is
it used to to me but occasionally you
can go to a bad corner of the Internet
so to speak or just get on a site that's
got some rogue code so to speak and they
may launch an alert dialog it just can't
get rid of it may be caught in a loop or
something and you just can't kill edge
well now you can you can go up here and
hit the X button to close edge and it'll
close even if that dialogues popped up
there so that is a super handy feature
in my opinion now I don't know if it
allows you to close the tab because it
says the edge app it'd be nice to get
just close that particular tab I'd also
like to see the ability to tick control
a for to close the tab or maybe even alt
f4 to close the entire browser the next
one to demonstrate this when I did the
right now let's do that if I right click
here and add tab to favorites you can
see it was highlighted over here and
it's going to stick it somewhere over
here now a problem is I don't know where
it stuck it so I think we're down here
at the bottom oh there we go it's
showing me tabs this is the one we just
added there we go oh this is very
interesting it added all of the tabs
that's very fascinating so I'm going to
do a little more investigating on that
particular one because it shouldn't have
added all the tabs on my opinion but it
did now is another one I can't quantify
new tabs will now animate more smoothly
on to the tab bar when opened and closed
that one I got no clue but let's just do
this to me that's really the same as
what I had what I've seen in the past I
don't know I don't know what to look for
that they didn't really quantify that
now this next one I like too this one
will come in handy when you for me when
I first what a reboot or
or start Windows sometimes I will go to
my email client first and what I do
often times there's a link an email I
want to click and it's going to launch
the browser that's been a frustrating
experience sometimes because I don't
want to lose all the browser tabs and we
have had my previous session what this
is going to do is restore those browser
tabs and even different windows at
different instances of edge and what's
going to do is it's going to add that
new tab onto the last open session of
edge so that's pretty nice basically it
just puts it in the last possible place
so you know where to find it if nothing
else so I do like that behavior now
that's a quick rundown of all the new
stuff that's shipping in the latest
windows and solder build as it relates
to edge there's obviously more features
that shift this is actually a very big
drop now one thing I may play with today
and possibly do another video is this
handwriting stuff that looks pretty cool
I don't play enough with my pin so I'm
going to try to maybe play with that but
I do encourage you to go read the
article and see all the different
features that have shipped and maybe
even some of the issues that you may be
having that they know about there that
they're trying to address so hopefully
we'll the supremacy this useful if you
liked the video make sure you you give
us a thumbs up or MF you want to make
sure you don't miss anything on the
channel make sure you subscribe or like
our Facebook page and as always if you
got questions or discussion points
please feel free to leave those in the
comments below I'd love to have a
dialogue about the new features in edge
if you've got questions about things you
think are missing or stuff I might talk
about those there too I need to make a
video showing you how you can actually
report that to Microsoft so that they
know you're looking for a certain
feature too so again like a channel
subscribe and hopefully this is useful
to you and you can start using these new
features and tell your friends about
them tear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
