death here and we are very excited about
progressive web apps but even if you
haven't heard of the term progressive
web app you're gonna love what they
bring to the table these are just
websites that took the right vitamins
and progressively become apps that's
right any website can be a progressive
website and we know how to do it you're

quality so that you earn a place on your
customers home screen this means that
they're going to re-engage with you over
and over again another great thing about
progressive web apps is they are
discoverable this has been one of the
web's great superpowers that has been
underestimated for years the fact that
it's easy to find websites it's easy to
share links with people and they can go
quickly load a website without any
friction
browsers are enthusiastically behind
progressive web apps and they are racing
to add more and more features so what do
you have to do to upgrade your website
to a progressive web app well it's
basically three quick things first you
need to implement SSL now we have a
video recently about that and I
encourage you to go watch that but you
need to make your site SSL this is going
to unlock all kinds of great new
features because browsers know that they
can trust your site even more next you
need to add a web manifest file to your
site and this is again a very simple
process that we have great experience
doing and finally you need to add a
serviceworker to your website now this
is a big technical area but loves dev
has some great experience building
fantastic service workers to enhance the
ability of web sites to unlock that
great user experience the progressive
Web Apps promise and on top of that love
to dev has actually been building
websites using the methodology that
progressive Web Apps promotes for almost
seven years now before progressive web
apps were a thing we were already
architecting websites the right way so
that we already understand and have a
lot of experience building websites to
meet progressive web app criteria so if
you want to learn more click the button

you can start your progressive what
about journey today
