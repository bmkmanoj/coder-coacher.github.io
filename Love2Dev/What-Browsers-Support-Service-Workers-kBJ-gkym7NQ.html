support service workers which is a
common question we see ask when we're
out talking about service workers and
progressive Web Apps and we see it asked
a lot in online forums like Stack
Overflow and Cora and that's what we're
going to answer here in this video today
hey guys Chris love owner love to dev
here and today we're going to talk about
Service Worker support now we are
obviously big fans of service workers
because we're huge champions of
progressive Web Apps and we love service
workers because they enable so many
great features to be native in the
browser in particular they give you a
rich mechanism to make your application
work offline browsers are starting to
implement push notifications as well as
background sync capabilities this isn't
where things are going to be limited to
because new specs and ideas are being
fleshed out and hopefully will be
delivered in browsers and platforms in
the near future but a big question we
get asked when we're out talking about
service workers and we also see online a
lot is what kind of support do I have
out there for service workers what
browsers support service workers and
effectively how many potential customers
have browsers that will use these
service workers so that's what we're
going to try to answer here today and I
want to start off by looking at a great
resource maintained by Jake Archibald
now Jake is one of the web's big
champions of service workers and
progressive web apps so we really enjoy
his humor and stuff when he's presenting
these topics but he maintains a site
called service worker if service worker
ready and basically what he does is he
goes through all the different
dependencies and feature paths that
service workers need in order to
effectively be supported
and before I go down his list I'm just
going to review a few things first
service workers are depending on
browsers supporting promises natively
and if you aren't familiar with promises
they are a coding convention that allow
some kind of a simple way to do
asynchronous programming I won't get
into the details of promises will
produce some cut as like a primer or
something like that on its and there are
many resources available to get get your
head wrapped around promises if you
haven't already started using them next
service workers need to have such
supported if you haven't heard of fetch
it's also relatively new and it is a
modern replacement of the standard Ajax
stack that we use Ajax is based on the
xml httprequest object and it's a you
know is written about 1213 years ago
it's a little clunky so to speak
encoding a par lamps but it it uses
callbacks and some crazy coding
conventions it's really not that hard to
do but it's just not that clean to do
either such simplifies the HX process
and turns it into a promise base object
which makes it a whole lot easier to
make asynchronous code and this is
important because service workers need
to work with asynchronous code and if
you haven't really given dive into who
service workers they're event-driven
experience or coding or coding provision
or whatever you what they're driven by
events so like you would attach an event
handler to the fetch event which is
where any request to the network is
going to pass through your service
worker and you can intercept that
request in the such event so it's one of
the reasons why such is required
you're not going to have access to the
xmlhttprequest object inside of a
service worker but you can use the fetch
API so hence the hard dependency on
fetch beings
for it so anyway so fetch is required
we'll talk a little about that in
another video and then I would also
consider another third key requirement
which browsers don't have a problem
supporting those because they've been
supporting it for decades is HTTPS and
the problem here is that the vast
majority of websites still do not
implement HTTPS that's very unfortunate
well now we released a video a couple
weeks ago on 5 reasons why you should
implement HTTPS today and serviceworkers
was one of those reasons
in fact browsers are starting to gate
access to more and more api's behind
HTTPS so you definitely need to
implement HTTPS if you want to learn a
little more about why go check out our
video so that I will consider those like
three the key things that service
workers are dependent on the browser's
must support so that's just a review
promises the fetch API and HTTPS all
right so the first thing that Jake lists
here on is serviceworker ready is
general enthusiasm
what kind of attitude do different
browsers have about service workers and
a lovely cover except it's a different
logo browser logos here and you can just
quickly glance the green background
means that they're really behind it as
you can see that's pretty much all of
them the one outlier is Apple Safari and
we don't have no clue what Apple's
position is they have shown up to the
actual specification discussion meetings
and done some participation however if
you are familiar with the way Apple
works with the web standardization
process is they don't really work very
friendly with it the way they implement
and deliver these specifications
typically is they keep quiet keep quiet
and then suddenly it just shifts and
that's kind of how we find out if
they're going to support it or not
the reason why I think you put yellow
back there is because they have shown up
to the meetings and there is speculation
and it's just an it's just complete
speculation is that they are going to
try to implement service workers sooner
rather than later I suspect if we find
out anytime soon
it will probably be this fall because
it's usually when they do a release that
would possibly have that in them and
another one on the other side is
Microsoft edge I know personally that
the edge team is super excited about
service workers and they are working
fast and furiously to get Service Worker
support built-in if you have the Windows
10 insider ring and you can go into the
about flags inside of the developer tool
so to set up 12 and you can go in there
you can hit the about colon Wack Wack
flags some point I think anyway there is
an option to turn on service worker
support just let me forewarn you it's
probably a little buggy so it may not be
the best experience but it will get you
some experience as to where they're at
right now now so that's that's
enthusiasm just to prove the point if
you are where the Microsoft edge team
maintains this site here that shows all
the browser support for different
specifications and isolated in own
Service Worker features and totally
forgot why I went into my dependencies
service workers also need the cache API
which is another new API which is how
you make things work offline so as you
can see right now the cache API is
currently in development and if we
scroll down service workers are also in
development and you can see that there
are over 6,000 votes on there user voice
on features that edge should focus on
and that's actually one of the top
feature requests in Microsoft edge right
now is Service Worker support so we love
the fact that the developer community at
large is showing great enthusiasm
for service workers as well but you can
you can look at just about anything you
can filter it out by a lot of different
features I invite you to go to you can
get there easier than that URL up their
status modern dot ie will take you to
this page and they've actually visualize
things quite nicely as well they've got
all kinds of information available to
you we'll go over this in another video
but it's a great resource for you
another one to go look at is can I use
you can usually type in a particular API
and can I use will give you a nice grid
showing support curious as to why these
are coming off green instead of fully
green because usually they're nice solid
green that this kind of yellow screen
not - doesn't really go into details
about why they aren't necessarily
getting the full spec support but as you
can see there's a little bit of red on
there really it's limited to edge and
Safari and like I said that edge will
turn turn to green probably by the end
of the year I would imagine I'm hoping
that it ships with the creator's update
this summer so - stay tuned for that
offer minis never going to support it if
you understand my Opera Mini that is a
proxy browser and in essence when you
make a request there what they do is
they request the file on their server
and then they actually send an optimized
JPEG down to the browser those are
really four feature phones this kind of
stuffs really not going to be targeting
that audience anyway so anyway alright
let's go back to is serviceworker ready
just to go down again I mentioned
promises is a big deal all the browsers
now support promises that's been there
for a little while so we don't have any
concerns on that level oh and if you're
wondering that this purple one is this
is the Samsung browser and they have
their own version of WebKit that they
ship and they have really amped up their
evangelism game and involved in with
developers over the last few years and I
really want to just just take a little
side note and just applaud them for
doing that and kind of joining the game
they obviously have a huge presence in
the Android mobile marketplace
now as far as you know the debug
serviceworkers this refers to be able to
open the f12 tools and like step through
code and and some other features that
you're going to need in order to be able
to kind of work in troubleshoot your
service workers before you deploy them
right now that's really limited to
Chrome Firefox and opera and they all
have nice developer experiences now
navigator dot Service Worker that's
essentially the property that you would
reference to register a serviceworker in
your code and of course you can see that
the chrome Firefox Opera and Samsung are
the ones support that and then the
ability to post messages back and forth
right now Firefox and Samsung or they
offer full support where Chrome and
opera have partial support if you're not
familiar with that it's a way to
communicate back and forth to a
serviceworker if you did any web worker
coding it's going to be a very similar
process again remember serviceworker is
going to be an event-driven thing does
not have access to the Dom or the window
thread at the actual UI thread so what
you have to do is you essentially you
have to post messages back and forth
them so that's going to be the
communicate communication mechanism
between the front and the back so to
speak and of course we need to support
the fetch event because we need to
intercept we'd be able to possibly
intercept all the requests to the
network and of course those four
browsers again support it you can see
you should go down pretty much anything
related to the fetch and fetch event
they all have good support you also get
the install event which when you
understand serviceworkers that's part of
the lifecycle that you need to possibly
check on the Skip waiting allows the
serviceworker to kind of go ahead and
take a take control if you replace in a
previous version you can see Opera is
the only one it currently doesn't
support that I like that feature because
if I don't have essentially an
application schema change it allows my
serviceworker to just update a lot
faster
we'll talk we talk about that more in
our course on serviceworkers and the
whole life
cycle and again the next event in the
life cycle is the activate event and
then you can see the client claim and so
forth update checks you can see opera is
not getting a life cycle because they
don't have a skip waiting teeth there of
course with fetch you got the request
and response objects where they're
supported right now you got partial
support in Safari but the rest of the
browsers are doing good
the basic fetch request all the browsers
currently support that caches again
Safari and edge of the two that are out
right now because they don't support
serviceworker fully again it should
change an image very soon now background
sync is a new feature right now Chrome's
the only one shipping with that but I do
know that Firefox is working on
delivering that very soon so we will
look for that not totally sure where
background sync is with edge I've got a
feeling when service workers ship that
might be one of the top priorities
they've got to ship with it but I can't
really tell you for sure on that one so
that's like a quick rundown of where
serviceworker support is right now now
if you're wondering because this is
another big question is well since
Safari doesn't support it I mean an edge
doesn't support it and obviously
Internet Explorer's never kind of
support it because Internet Explorer has
been deprecated for over a year now
buying Microsoft it's only around
because Windows 7
can't run edge and enterprises have a
lot of legacy websites that they can't
afford to upgrade right now that are
depended to work say in IE 8 or IE 9
those are they really the only reasons
why you would use Internet Explorer but
that's never going to get any of that
support because they're not adding
features to that codebase just to just
remind you I like to say that a lot
because I think a lot of developers
aren't aware of that but anyway so like
I said that's that's kind of where
things are well we're going to see new
features at it now we're going to
talking about the legacy support iOS in
particular because they're not public
about
if I want to make Safari have some of
the features we've been building web
applications that are mobile first
offline first for most of this decade
really since the 2010 timeframe and we
devised a mechanism to essentially cache
everything in local storage and pull it
in and out of local storage today though
all the browsers now support indexdb and
that gives us an even better mechanism
to persist our application assets and
what we we're doing that today rather
than local storage a little more
efficient so if you want to know more
about service workers about support how
to do polyfills for especially the cache
API be sure to check out our course on
service workers called slaying the
dinosaur and we look forward to hearing
from you definitely leave comments below
