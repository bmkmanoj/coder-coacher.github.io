let and constant variable declarations
I was and I spent some time and really
sat down and figured it out in this
video I'm gonna walk you through how
those different variable declarations
vary and which one you should use and
we're gonna show a bunch of different
demos to help you understand the
concepts of scoping and a variable value
assignment so that you understand which
one you should use in your code today
okay in this video we're going to look
at the differences between variable
declarations in JavaScript and
traditionally we've had Barr to declare
our variables but with ekam script 2015
the language introduced two new variable
declaration methods that is let and
const and we're gonna look at the
differences between all three types of
variable declarations and give you some
advice on which way you or which ones
you should choose now basically the
difference between the three variable
declaration techniques is that var which
is the traditional one we've had since
the beginning of JavaScript has function
level scope that means if you declare a
variable anywhere inside of a function
it is hoisted effectively to the top of
that function by the interpreter and is
available throughout the entire function
it's not limited to a block scope which
we'll look at in our demos here with the
for loop and the for each method on an
array now let is similar to var in that
both can have their values changed after
the variable is declared and it's that's
one of the language features that
JavaScript has that variables basically
are mutable which means you can update
them as needed and you can actually
change their type and that kind of stuff
so
go from a string to an integer to a date
to an object to an array and all sorts
of variations of them now the final
declaration is a Const and a Const is
similar to let and that it has block
level scope where the difference is is
that Const can't have its value
reference change and I'm using that
explicitly value reference and we'll see
what that means
towards the end of the video so make
sure you stick around so the new
variable declarations are let and Const
and the difference between them and the
VAR keyword declaration is that they
have block level scope so a for loop for
example is a block and any variable you
declare inside that for loop is only
available inside that for loop and not
outside that for loop so we're gonna go
through some demos and we're gonna look
at all the different variations and
gyrations that you might need to account
for so hopefully you'll be able to
understand what each of these variable
declarations means how to use them and
you can start seeing how to apply them
to your code and then we're gonna I'm
gonna try to give you some advice on
what I think you should do as far as how
you should use these different types now
what I'm going to do today is use the
chrome developer tools console just to
demonstrate our principles here and I'm
gonna start off with a very simple
demonstration using we're going to go
through the far variable declarations
and we're going to see how those work
and how so you can get a grasp on how
the different scoping mechanisms work
now remember var uses what we call a
function level scoping I'm going to use
a simple for loop to demonstrate how
this scoping works now inside the for
block we're going to declare a variable
called index and then we're going to
echo out the value of index as we loop
through this particular loop and we've
set the max or the length to be 10 we're
going to iterate through from 0 to 9 and
then we're going to echo out the final
value of index
and remember index is going to get
incremented each time we finish a loop
through so as expected we see 0 through
10 and that's because we were just
echoing out the value of index and 0
through 9 or our 10 iterations through
the loop and then after the last
iteration we incremented one more and
then that caused our index to be greater
or be equal to length which means we did
not execute the loop and but the value
is 10 and that's why we got the 10
echoed out because we had it echoed out
after the loop was completed so that's
all good now if you're gonna try to
recreate these demos which I highly
encourage you to do and you're gonna do
it the way I'm doing it make sure you
refresh the page each time and that's
because you get variables set at the
global level and you may wind up having
little issues so just want to put that
out there the way you don't see things
that don't match up to what I'm doing
that's probably what it is I know this
because as I was going through setting
these up I did exactly that okay now on
this one I'm declaring a variable inside
of our for loop and it's called inside
and I'm gonna try to echo out that value
here and this is going to demonstrate
the concept of variable hoisting that we
get with the VAR keyword and that's
because we've declared this variable
inside this block but it will the actual
declaration will get hoisted up to the
top level of that particular function so
it's basically just as if we declared it
right here with the Lin variable that's
where the interpreter is actually going
to place it so if we execute this we can
see we get 0 through 9 but what we're
doing is we're setting it equal to the
index inside of the loop and so it
doesn't actually get incremented like
index does so outside the loop we see it
as also 9 but realize that it is
available outside the loop and that's
because the variable declaration was
actually hoisted outside of the for loop
and this is something that can be very
confusing to developers coming from
other languages because javascript is
probably the only language
has this concept of hoisting I'm sure
there are others but this is the only
one that I really know of so let's go
ahead and set this up and we'll go to
our next demo this time we're gonna
switch to an array and we're gonna use
the for each method on the array and
that's because it's basically the same
execution with same stuff going on that
we would get in a for loop but it is
executed as a function and not as a
block level construct so I've set up an
array called lists and we've got the
numbers 1 through 10 in the list and if
you're not familiar with the for each
basically it's a method that has a
callback and it passes three variables
to it the actual value the current index
in the array and the actual array but
we're just interested in the actual
value which would be 1 2 3 etc and then
we're gonna try to echo out that value
now value is declared here instead of
this function inside of the actual
function that's being executed at the
global level so a little Inception there
but we've got a function inside of a
function and remember var declarations
have function level scopes so if we try
to execute this we get the values of the
array echoed out but when we try to
execute this last line here that
references the value which is defined
here we get a reference error exception
because value doesn't exist at that
level and that's because it wasn't
hoisted because it is a function and not
a block all right so let's refresh and
see and we'll go to our next example in
this one we're going to declare a
variable outside of the for each
function but we will be able to
reference that variable outside of the
function because it's declared here and
we're going to try to reference it here
outside the function but notice it's the
same name as the variable that we're
handling are getting the value in the
for each loop so what will happen here
is we'll get basically two different
variable declarations completely
independent each other now what I did is
you know
with the with the initial-value
declaration as I said it's a value to
through a string but our array has a set
of numbers
so as we iterated through the array
value was equal to the actual value of
the item in the array which was a number
and that when we executed this
console.log outside of the for each loop
we got the original foo setting that's
because it's a completely different
variable even though they have the same
name they have completely different
scope and they don't step on each other
and so I know some people can get name
collisions and but this is this could
create scoping issues if you don't keep
track of where your scope is but again
var has function level scoping and the
for each method uses a function which
has a totally different scope from the
parent scope all right moving on to our
next demo this time we're going to start
using let we're going to start back at
the top of our examples we're going to
use that for loop again and we're going
to declare our index is a let here at
this pin the for loop which is the block
and we're gonna try to echo we're gonna
echo out the value of the index
increment and then we're gonna try to
reference index just like we did before
outside of the for loop this time when
we execute it we get a reference error
exception and that's because index does
not exist outside of the for loop that's
because the scope is block level and not
function level so that is the difference
between var and let right there but
we're gonna keep looking at how let
actually works here this time we're
going to declare a variable inside of
the actual loop and that way we can kind
of get a better grasp on this block
level scoping so here I'm studying the
variable inside inside of the loop and
it's going to be equal to the current
index and then we're going to echo out
the value and
site inside the loop I know this is
crazy using the same name but we're
gonna try to reference that variable and
the global scope and the global function
and I think we'll get our trusty
reference error exception again and
that's a knot hoisted up to the top is
if we'd done it with a var statement
so again block level scoping verses
function level scoping no variable
hoisting using let now let's go to our
array demonstrations using for each end
of functions here now a function is its
own little block so I think you know
what we might be getting here now we're
declaring the variable or vowel a value
as a foo using let and the main function
and then we also have value as the
handler in there for each loop we
already discussed that and what we
should get here is a list of all 10 of
our values and then at the very end
we'll have food echoed out and that's
exactly what we see that's because we
actually have two different variables
declared just like we did with the with
the the var declaration so there's no
difference there in that case because
even though it's function it's still a
different block level for us and
actually sorry for load and this time
we're going to play with that inside
variable that we declare outside of the
block how about that one
alrighty alright so here we're declaring
inside using let we're setting two equal
to two and what I'm going to do here is
I'm going to append I'm going to very
explicit here we're going to pend the
current value to our inside variable and
we're gonna echo out the current value
and at the end we're going to echo out
the final value of inside so what we
should see is each one of our array
items and then we're going to see the
final value of that
now the reason why I did this particular
demo is to show you that you can declare
a variable outside of a block and as
long as it's a child block of where the
variable is declared and that variable
is available inside of that block
assuming that there's no name collision
meaning that you name this variable the
same as something that's inside the
inner block or another function in this
case so that way you can declare
variables just like you've been doing
and make them available to those inside
blocks or inside enter if their child
functions if you will and they are
available already now let's go to our
next demo we're gonna start using cots
so we're going to start seeing the
difference here and how Const works
compared to our var and let okay so here
instead of declaring the index in our
for loop with a var RA let where you can
actually change the value of the index
we're going to use Const and remember
index is going to get incremented after
the loop executes so when we execute
this we get the first value of the index
which is 0 and that's what it's actually
declared as in the COTS but as soon as
the loop tries to increment the index it
is trying to change the value of index
and that's going to cause a type Erick's
exception that's because a constant
cannot have its value reference changed
and that makes sense all right now we go
to our next demo we're gonna just skip
ahead to our array Timo's here there we
go here we go and drop that in there
this time I'm going to clear a constant
value of foo and then our for each is a
method which is a different block all
together and it's also going to have a
variable here called value now also
realize that this
Abell declaration is different than this
one and therefore we will wind up seeing
all of our array values and we should
see the foo at the end as well and
that's exactly what we see we see alton
variable or elton array members and then
our foo which is what we declared our
value constant declaration well you know
you get the idea so alright let's go
ahead and get this set up for the next
demo this time we're going to do declare
a variable inside would just do this one
so we did yeah that's exactly what we
did okay for some reason there's
difference here oh this is a difference
okay we have difference just do that
okay
so this time I'm gonna try to do to
append the current value to inside which
is declared using Const and I think you
know what's going to happen it's going
to blow up at us and that's because you
can't change the value of a constant
declared variable therefore we didn't
get a chance to even start incrementing
through our loop it just blew up at us
let's get this set up for the next one
and this time we're going to declare a
Const inside of the for each function
handler and again we're going to try to
append the value to the food - here just
to give us a little the thing we're
going to echo this out each time now
what you'll see is that we nothing blows
up at us that's because each time this
function is executed this variable gets
declared again and the way this is
working is the for each loop the for
each method actually triggers this
method each time
so this is a new instance of the
function each time it goes over then to
the next item of the array so this
constellation is only good inside the
scope of this one time the function is
executed and but the next time through
your reader clarin that variable and
that's why we're able to get food - 1 3
- 2 all the way to food - 10 and that's
because it's brand-new variable
declaration and we're not actually
trying to change the value of inner
value and we're not trying to read it
we're not trying to overwrite the
previous declaration all right our next
demo must show you a little fascinating
trick about the Const declaration all
right now this time I'm declaring
comment inside at the top of our
function and we're using Const but this
time instead of setting it explicitly to
foo I'm actually setting it to an object
or JavaScript object that has a property
called foo with a value of bar now
inside of our for each loop I'm going to
append the current value of the loop or
the array to the inside foo property and
we've used a constant declared so you
might think that this was gonna blow up
but you'll be surprised it works now
we're echoing out the value right after
we set the append the current value to
our food property so we get all 10 of
our array values that could out but then
we also get the object change the the
object itself hasn't changed but the
food property has changed this is why I
kept mentioning value reference when you
declare a constable it's sort to me at
least in my mind I think about it is if
I'm setting a pointer to a memory
reference and in this case we're setting
it to an object and that object stays
the same
but the properties remembers that
particular object can be changed and
that's because they don't affect the
addressing of the constant variable
declaration to that particular piece of
memory the value so to speak now if you
if the object actually declared Fuu is a
constant then it would not be able to be
changed and it's because the actual
value there is referencing a specific
there there the very variable there is
actually referencing a specific value in
memory so that's effectively what's
going on so you can change the
properties of a member and really this
is this is gonna be limited to objects I
haven't tried it already be honest with
you but I think it would work with an
array as well I'm not sure if you
changed the size of the array things
might blow up out to maybe do a separate
video on that one but that's what's
actually you know we can do that we can
just do that little code fun here folks
all right so we're going to actually
yeah let's do this again here we go
okay so we know that we've got this and
we're going to do source deck so I think
this will work
equal to index Steve minus one just for
fun and let's see what happens here is
this is live cutting so this may blow up
in me okay there we go so there's
already been declared that's interesting
oh you know what kind of it is this is
that refresh thing okay so let's go back
and we'll rerun it I think this time
we'll get it okay so it didn't blow up
at us and the value didn't change okay
so that wasn't like the best demo let's
do this again all right
take this will do us okay what doesn't
blow up at us that's for sure and we do
get we are able to change the very the
values even though this list was set as
a constant this is what's going for list
is defined as a constant which is an
array but I can change those values
inside of the array as we go through now
let's do one more demo with this because
I think this is important let's do 10
Plus this would change the size of the
array now let's see if it blows up at us
this time but I reload the page all
right let's do this again okay so it
doesn't seem to blow up at us that's
good
one more time I got one more thing just
to make sure that our size is changing
there we go here we go our size is 20 so
therefore you can change an array I just
wanted to make sure about that folks had
not tested it I was just one of the
things that occurred to me so you got a
little bonus coverage here now I do have
a good blog post explaining all this and
the link is in the description below and
if you think this has been helpful to
you I'd love to see a big like below any
questions please leave those in the
comment section below I'd love to
dialogue with you about this now before
I end what should you do okay so here's
my rule on this if you got code that
isn't broken the users var don't go and
try to break it don't waste your time
trying to fix it if you're doing
maintenance on a function or a module
and you want to convert it to let and
Const
feel free to go ahead and do so if
you're writing brand-new code I would
probably advise you to start using let
and Const and try to avoid using far I
got a sneaky feeling that eventually var
might get deprecated but that's just me
guessing little speculation there okay
now if your code is going to be executed
potentially on legacy browsers like
Internet Explorer which a lot of
enterprises are still unfortunately
still using or maybe older Android
phones basically if it's going to be
executed in the
wild and public I would probably stick
to doing bar and that's because you
don't necessarily know if the browser's
gonna support these new keywords if you
were comfortable with doing transpile
and using typescript or babel you could
go that route I'm still not sold on
doing that yet but that's subject for a
different video let's say but if you're
comfortable with it and you can do the
proper maintenance to make sure your
code is updated eventually then go for
it now if you're writing for a
controlled environment where you know
let and bar are available then I would
say use Latin bar for example if you're
doing node modules now you should be
doing node at least six point five note
eight is current version but I tend to
have to write towards six point five
because I write a lot of lambda
functions and while recording this
lambda has not yet upgraded 3ws has not
upgraded the lambda subsystem to use the
more current version of node but they do
have notes 6.5 available which does
allow me to use Const and let so I have
been slowly migrating my usage of lüt
and Const into my node modules or my
lando modules the other place is in side
of service workers because if the
browser supports service workers then
you can feel comfortable using let and
const and arrow functions and other new
syntax sugars if you feel like it so
that's my advice if you know with a
hundred percent comfort that these new
variable declarations are going to be
supported by the executing platform then
by all means use them instead of R if
you're not sure or you've got still a
decent number of people using say legacy
browsers then I would probably stick
with the bar and if you've got existing
code bases I wouldn't just stop
everything and go through and upgrade
everything because you're probably gonna
want it placed in a lot of time at
breaking things but if you do go through
and do maintenance and you have created
a essentially a policy or a style guide
on how to use
and let inside of your functions then by
all means go ahead and as part of that
maintenance go ahead and do the upgrade
just make sure it doesn't break your
code and make sure you keep track of
that block level scoping correctly and
realize that you can't mute mutate
constant variables and I think you'll be
good to go so again if you think this
has been helpful and useful share with a
friend and let me know what you think
down the comments section below and
definitely go read the blog post</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
