placeholder text and input forms well in
this video I'm gonna show you how to use
some basic CSS to apply custom Styles
not only to the text in your input
fields but also those input fields that
have placeholder text hey everybody
Chris love the owner of love to death
and this video I want to show you how
you can customize the style of the
placeholder text in HTML input fields
using just CSS and we'll also look at
how we can apply Styles specifically to
input boxes that do have dis the
placeholder text displayed so without
further ado let's just review what we've
got going on here this is a very simple
code demo for this one what I've done is
I've just created a a real simple form
here and just stacked a bunch of divs to
display different input fields and the
one difference that I did is sort of
borrowed the some of the font color
classes or classes from bootstrap using
the the BM naming syntax here in this
case I'm doing text and then primary and
if you don't know what be a BM is that
stands for block element modifier so
basically you do your class names so
that they're descriptive of what they're
trying to do so here you can see it's
text and instead of saying blue or red
or something like that which you could
totally do instead you give it a little
more semantic meaning little tangent
here to kind of explain what's going on
even with the bootstrap stuff is they're
trying to associate colors with
information and this is why being able
to style placeholder
could be a very valuable asset for your
web applications and that's because you
can convey meaning with the style of the
text in particular in this case color
but we'll also say that we can apply a
few other things
now remember placeholder is text so when
you apply aa
thrown button so when you apply this
styles are gonna be text-based styles to
the actual stuff but then so we'll but
then we'll look and see how we can do
the actual input field just itself so
what I've done is I've created four
different ones to apply basically
different colors so we got primary we
have danger success and warning and then
I tried to put a very original try put
some colors here but I also change I
changed this so I could do a little hero
screenshot image a little bit for the
actual blog post in the thumbnail for
this YouTube video so that's why the
text doesn't wreck about the color now I
would walk you through seeing how this
is applied in the developer tools
normally and the browser developer tools
but unfortunately they don't really
provide any value so with that said this
is these are this is our form loaded so
you can see we've got blue red green and
yellow even though I did change that to
purple if I haven't reloaded deck there
we go yellow I noticed that typo last
night that's how I was looking at the
blog post I was like though anyway so I
have changed like normally a default is
going to be like a kind of a grayish
color so that basically what they're
trying to convey with that by default is
that it's not the actual text it's more
like construction if you're not familiar
with placeholder in input fields they're
great to provide kind of instruction
sometimes even label to the field you
can also like maybe display a format
like a phone number format you're
expecting those kind of things but as
soon as you start typing the placeholder
text goes away and as long as there's no
actual value in the input field the
placeholder text will show
in its place it's placeholder now
normally like I said it's just going to
be black kind of off black whatever but
I have styled this and I also made
everything uppercase if you noticed and
I've made the font size a little bit
bigger than the default and just to show
that you can apply different styles
obviously the way you want to style it
may vary you know but like I said the
colors can convey different meanings and
things like that so you've got a lot of
options here but like I said when you go
inspect the element I don't have the
ability to see the actual placeholder
thing it is a pseudo element and if you
follow the long in the CSS shapes and
also in the the the background that big
background hero image video that I've
recently posted we use pseudo elements
to do some styling there but
unfortunately that's not available for
us here at least on the chrome developer
tools so yeah we don't really have
access to see it there so that's kind of
a bummer but the page as usual it's
available on the left to dev samples
github which i've got the link in the
description below and it is under under
I just pop that up you see it's under
the CSS folder and then there is a
placeholder - color folder which is
where this particular file is now what's
going on hey Jolin up here and just got
my you know our basic little initial
reset so to speak and that that would
allow me to effectively kind of sinner
of our kind of faux dialog if you will
for our form on the on the screen just
some basic styling being applied to the
input box and for the layout for that no
big deal there saying for the the form
wrapper again just nothing to do with
the core context of this but here's
where things get fun okay now if we saw
before I applied
the different kind of semantics meaning
classes to it so this is the this is
gonna be the root of our selector so I
applied this to the div wrapper around
the element rather than on the element
itself and I did that specifically
because I wanted the option because the
way I would do this in normal life as I
would do it there because I want the
option say if there's like a no label
accompanying it with it or maybe some
other elements to add value to a form
that I can kind of put this semantic
meaning at that level and that can drive
some other visual cues as well I just
think that's a good practice then I put
I put the input selector I think in this
case is probably optional so it may be a
little technically over specified by
doing that and that's because here we
have the pseudo selector placeholder
which would only work with an input or a
text area element by the way you can do
this also with a text area or and I just
didn't get it I didn't think about doing
that till later
but you can totally do this with the
text element and this is one of the
variations okay now I'm gonna page down
to get you to what should be the quote
standard I do want to mention that the
this the pseudo element for placeholder
here and what I'm going to show you
later on to do the just the input field
itself are both technically non-standard
things right now that means that they
haven't been like approved or
recommended by say the w3c working group
as something for browsers to implement
however most browsers have implemented
some form of it but unfortunately this
this standard quote-unquote has kind of
lag I guess lag behind I don't follow
the CSS standard process as much as I do
like actual API stuff so I'm not totally
sure where it is or what's hanging this
one particularly up from being
implemented but most browsers do support
this placeholder pseudo element now in
the past you did have to vendor prefix
it and that's why I went ahead and put
all these
under prefixed versions here and you'll
see some with the double quote and some
with enough double quote this is
actually a duplicate one no it's no
sorry there's the there's the dupe the
the dasa double quote i mean double :
sorry I was up late last night okay yeah
but you can see I've got all those now
normally I would stack the selectors and
make one rule but this is what I found
when I did that no browser recognized
the rule and I was like what because
normally you can stack them I could just
say put a comma here and then you know I
could literally just do this that's
normally what you would do I did I
selected the whole thing sorry let's do
that again dude there we go all right
you would normally do that both I found
when I did that it just didn't get
recognized by anybody but when I
separated them out into individual rules
then suddenly my silent appeared in all
the browsers and I did test in chrome
edge and Firefox I probably should have
tested opera and some other things but
it's not there I think it I think it
kind of proved the point on this I
believe you can even get support through
this in Internet Explorer but you know
as with all things ie should stop
worrying about that because it's being
deprecated very soon completely off the
face of the map anyway so anyway I
actually pulled the colors out of
bootstrap and drop those in here to
match up as you can see I've got the
blue red green and yellow colors I also
bumped the font size up to 1.3 and gave
it a long high to 1.3 just for good
measure and then I did a text transform
to make it uppercase all to show you
that you can apply pretty much any text
based styling rule to this placeholder
text and it should get applied for us
all right so with that that's that's how
works that's that's all there is to it
we hope to be blunt and you can see that
it gets applied okay so now for the next
thing this is an element that doesn't
have a placeholder in it so we're going
to do is we're going to see how we can a
style the elements that do have the have
a placeholder visibly displayed we can
style the actual input field differently
and in this case I'm going to put a
purple border around the the input field
and if the the text in the placeholder
is too long we're going to truncate it
with an ellipsis so what I'm gonna do is
we are just going to put some random
text and this particular one that one
should definitely overflow now if I
reload doo-doo-doo boom you can see now
we have a purple border around it which
honestly this is leave it proves our
point and on our second one that had all
the little garbage text appended out
that would have gone over the CSS
intelligently truncates the text but
doesn't leave us hanging it actually
uses that ellipsis so that it doesn't
look ugly like this that it just looks
sort of unprofessional and if I can get
it to move oh you know what it's not
gonna move because you can't move your
care your caret through placeholder text
that's another little tidbit to know
about placeholder text so if you've got
really long placeholder text
probably not even that useful to begin
with this part is the last part of it so
but anyway but notice this one doesn't
have any placeholder and so the purple
border wasn't applied to it now how did
we do that alright as you saw i
uncommented it out this and the pseudo
selector to do the the the styling on an
input field
we're a placeholder is being displayed
is a another pseudo selector it's a
single : and it's just placeholder -
shown and that just means that the
placeholder text is shown apply this
style to this particular input box so
you can see between the placeholders
shown and the placeholder pseudo
selectors you've got different options
to really customize a lot of things
about your input forms so that you can
make your forms hopefully more usable
and that's really a big goal of
designing forms and there is a true art
to designing forms to make them easier
to use easier to read and ultimately
make it so that the users don't make
errors entering data or it get
frustrated and I mean who doesn't get
frustrated filling out a form you don't
understand and so that's why
placeholders there they can really help
guide you but you can add more semantic
meaning to them so that your users feel
a lot more comfortable filling out those
forms so I hope this has been really
helpful for you I know this is kind of a
you know a neat little trick kind of
thing and like I said it just takes CSS
it is technically a non-standard thing
but pretty much all the browser's
support it in some form of fashion the
the : : placeholder is kind of the de
facto standard for most modern browsers
so you should be pretty good there but
if you do need to do some legacy stuff
look at the vendor prefixed versions and
another note you do have to create
duplicate rules for all these different
things
at least that was my finding and I tried
it in all three of those browsers and
not a single one of them recognized
until I split the rules up so you can't
rule our selector stack for this
particular trick so if you got any

thanks a lot and hopefully you'll be
