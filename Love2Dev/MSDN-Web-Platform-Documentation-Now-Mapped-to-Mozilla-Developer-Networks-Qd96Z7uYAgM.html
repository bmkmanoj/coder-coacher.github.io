to death here and I just wanted to cover
a recent announcement by the Microsoft
edge team last week they announced
formally that they have started mapping
or actually did a 301 redirect from all
the existing in this DN documentation
for the web platform over to the Mozilla
documentation and the great thing is
that the Microsoft edge team is not
alone in this effort they are also being
joined by the Google Chrome team Samsung
internet team and believe IBM is and a
few others the w3c itself they're all
going to be putting their power and
efforts behind making the Mozilla
developer Network web Doc's the official
documentation for the web platform now
if you're not familiar with the MDM
documentation we're not really hope you
are at this point because they usually
come up either first or second in the
search results for just about everything
I'll look up but I need help with and
but basically anything that's a web spec
meaning html5 JavaScript or CSS they've
got a page out there representing it now
Microsoft alone just 301 over 70 700
pages from the MSDN site to the MDM web
Doc's so for search engine purposes
that's going to be pretty darn office
awesome so if we look up something like
serviceworkers which I spend a lot of
time in and hopefully the search will
work here that's not gonna work great
about that let's see what happens when I
do this here let's try it from here I
know it works from here I never go to
the home page there we go
let's see oh of course it's not gonna
work okay there it goes all right see
see we got serviceworker serviceworker
container and this should be a view that
you've probably seen before one thing
that it does down at the bottom is it
shows browser compatibility and one
thing that is missing here and this
particular
one is Samsung enough but I don't think
it might let's see
never yes I'm something I don't know it
is not there and the reason why Samsung
Internet it's pretty important these
days because well let's face it Samsung
actually sells more fun than phones and
Apple and they have their own default
browser called Samsung internet which is
actually pretty good browser these days
a few years back it was not very good
but they've done a fantastic job with
making a first-class browser and also
building a developer relations team that
is out there so those guys are also
putting their energy behind this effort
and so basically if you notice over here
in the top right-hand corner there's an
edit but you have to be signed in and to
be able to edit and you also need to be
part of the foundational team now the
great thing is that they found the
foundation that these organizations are
joining around this effort is really
open to individuals as well and I think
that's one of the beautiful things about
the web so if you're interested in
working on the documentation and
updating it so that people like you and
me can route their way what rail that
way around the web platform and make
better websites this might be a great
opportunity for you to participate and
just make the the web platform a lot
easier for us to understand so that we
can get some some better experiences
deployed so I just curious what your
thoughts may be on this hopefully you're
gonna be at least somewhat excited about
this it's certainly going to help me out
because I do spend a lot of time on this
site and I do for cajon aliy find issues
or just a lot of incompleteness
especially around cutting edge stuff
like I said I spend a lot of time in
service workers over this year over the
past few months and ultimately I found
that the documentation really trails off
after a little while because I'm really
starting to push the limits I think on
the service workers so I do spend a lot
of time actually reading the spec but
these articles these documentation pages
that are out there kind of helped
translate the original spec into
something that's a little more human
consumable
so I'm pretty excited about that hey hit
me up on Twitter and that's at Chris
love or the comments below here
definitely might have a conversation
here and if you're on Facebook I've got
a I've got a Facebook page just go to
facebook.com slash left udev and you can
follow me there and interact with me as
well
and don't forget the liking this video
and subscribing to our youtube channel
so you don't miss anything like this
because i've got a big pile of things on
my to-do list to get published and so
you're gonna be seeing a lot of new
content over the next month or so so
thanks a lot and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
