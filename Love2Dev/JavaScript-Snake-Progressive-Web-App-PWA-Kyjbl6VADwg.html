of them and they're great candidates to
be progressive web apps so in this video
I'm gonna show you how to turn
JavaScript snake into a progressive web
application that you can play on any
device hey thanks a lot for joining me
this is Chris the owner of love to dev
and today I want to show you how to play
the JavaScript snake game then we'll go
walk through the code this is a
progressive web app but the code right
now is kind of preventing it from
working on phones because it doesn't
support touch so I am going to show you
on my desktop right now so let's just go
play the game and if you're not familiar
with snake it's a game that came out on
the Nokia feature founds a while back
and was super popular because I think of
it basically was the only game but the
goal is to try to hit these little
things make your snake grow without
hitting the snake or the wall as you can
see the snake gets bigger and a little
faster this is gonna be very difficult
there we go oh another difficult one but
basically you just use the arrow keys to
move the snake right left up and down
and again want to try to avoid hitting
the walls the snake you just want to hit
the wheat the one dot missed it I missed
it again
anyway that's how it works now what I'm
going to try to do over the next what
I'm have time to do it is add touch to
it and also make it responsive so that
it works on phones better it's also got
this kind of really bad men your menu
option and stuff up here this definitely
needs to get cleaned up so I'll try to
work on that up a half time but anyway
let's go to the code and see how that
works
hey guys in this part of the video we're
going to just walk through the code on
how I upgraded the snake application now
I don't think this is the prettiest
implementation if it came but again this
is snake something that works on
featured phones and so I don't know that
it was supposed to be pretty but that's
okay now just real quick the basic stuff
make sure there's a viewport got a
reference to the manifest all that will
check out here in a moment I've got a
favicon made sure I had a theme color
meta tag that matches up to the theme
color in the web manifest file and this
is where I like what the heck is this
guy because he put all of the navigation
and the head element which of I don't
know that I've ever seen somebody to do
something like that but eventually uh
panel cleaning it up but it's didn't
want to fuss with the UI too much on
this at this point and then of course
we've got the regular stuff so this is
how the game gets triggered off again
not not the best thing here but that's
okay it works this is actually this is
the theme changing code the actual game
isn't the file snake and then he
initiates it here so what I did was I
just extended his inline script lock to
do our serviceworker registration code
again this is just the super simple
serviceworker registration code if you
are interested in doing more advanced
things here i've got some stuff in my
progressive web app from beginner to
expert course that will cover more
intermediate in advanced level topics
around this but for our purposes this
simple serviceworker registration is all
we need again you verify that the
service workers are supported in the
browser and then you proceed to register
the service worker using a registered
method passing it a URL to your service
worker which should be in the root of
your site and all I'm doing is just
going on with it was
or failed that's really all we're doing
let's go look at the web manifesto oh
yeah real quick just make sure I did why
that is under why that's coming it out
but it is a lot a lot common to us I
kept working it locally
I am referencing an app cache here and
if we go look at snake dot have cache
this is so it'll work offline in older
browsers I think I don't think I need
the quotes let me take those off but
basically these are all the resources to
make the game work you need the HTML
page the regular and dark skin theme and
then the images and of course the
JavaScript that drives the game the
snake j/s now if we look at the manifest
file again we've got our long name we've
got the name that shows up on the icon
on the home screen you get a nice
description got an array of icons that I
generated using the progressive web app
image generator and again I put those
into a meta folder so I can isolate
those out from regular application
assets tell it to start URL to be the
root and put the scope in there for the
application to also be the domain again
I want to make sure it's displayed full
screen and that means no browser Chrome
it's a little different from the other
ones but basically yeah no browser
chrome got a background color but leave
that matches up to the blue the web
manifest stuff doesn't and the visual
studio code doesn't give me a color
actually on here RGB that would actually
be the red I think because this is the
blue and that if you remember matches to
the theme color reset and the head now
the reason I started doing that is
because I needed to I started getting
warnings from lighthouse about that but
also seen warnings on the console and I
think that might be one of the reasons
why you may not get the add to
homescreen prompt is if these theme
colors are are way too out of sync
basically so I think it's a good idea to
make sure you've got the theme color set
in the head as well as here and it from
what I can tell - it also needs to
actually match up to the artwork that
you are uploading like your the the
images that are referenced up here I
think I think there's doing there's some
evaluation going on to see if there's
too much contrast that kind of thing or
they're just not in line with each other
I do have portrait here although I think
this game might work a little better in
landscape on them eventually want to do
because I don't think this right now
this game does not work on touch screens
which means basically means it doesn't
work on phones which is very ironic
since snake was a phone game it does
rely on using the keyboard which course
on feature phones was how you did it but
wanted to be portrait because I wanted
to be able to work on phones and layout
correctly and and be able to control it
so this this game is gonna need a little
little love - to make actually work
correctly at least across different
devices and I think I already mentioned
it I found some other repos since
working with this one that may want it
being a little bit better code bases to
work with so the if what I may do is
actually completely wipe it out and use
a different code base for the game but
this one looks a lot like what was on
the Nokia phones so I may try to clean
it up there is a lot of work that needs
to be done to make this truly responsive
and and usable on different devices so
anyway but yeah just a basic code
walk-through nothing too spectacular or
fancy with this one but hopefully will
serve as a good reference to get you
started on your progressive web
application journey now do you have a
link to the block to the blog post in
the description below there's also a
link to the github source repo that I
forked you're free to clone or for work
and do what you want to with it and if
you are looking into learning how to do
progressive web apps and service workers
I've got a course with right now well
over 20 hours worth of video contouring
content yeah it's progressive web app
from beginner to expert and if you hit
the link in the description below which
is PW a course com that will take you to
the page where you can register for $29
which is a hundred and seventy one
dollars off the regular 200 our list
price just because you've watched this
video and I know you are excited about
progressive web apps and I want to be
able to help you so be sure to register
for the course as well and if you got
any questions or comments about this or
anything about progressive web apps feel
free to leave those in the description
below or in the comment section below or
hit me up on Twitter at Chris love and
ask me questions I'll be more than
willing to dialogue with you as well
thanks a lot and I hope this has been
fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
