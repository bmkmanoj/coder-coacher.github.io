that many of us like myself have gotten
sucked into on our phones in this video
I'm gonna show you how to make a 2048
progressive web application that you can
play on your desktop your Android device
and your iPhone hey guys Chris love the
owner of love to death here and in this
video I'm gonna walk you through the
2048 progressive web app what we're
looking at right now is recording I made
on my phone and you can go to 2048 love
to death comm and access the same exact
application and that's really what it is
I mean you just sit there and you play
the game by slotting the tiles together
to match the numbers and the goal is to
try to get a tile that has 2048 on it
now you can keep playing after you reach
that goal but that's actually when you
win so you should be prompted on with
chrome on Android and most the other
Android browsers to add the progressive
web app to your home screen if you do so
you will get a tile on your phone's home
screen and it'll launch and look just
like a native application which is what
you see here on the screen notice
there's no browser address bar or
anything like that it's just the
application and you've got the regular
game play going on so hopefully this is
a good demonstration of the application
and where now we're going to switch over
to the code which you can get to from
the github repo in the description below
in this section of the video I just want
to do a quick run through of the 2048
progressive web app code just to show
you how everything is structured now
let's just start up here we're in the
index.html file now the entire
application is just one web page it's
nothing too fancy I do start off by
referencing the
- and that's for our legacy browser
friends iOS for the time being and go
down to the actual app cache you see
it's just got a reference to the files
that need to be cached locally and then
the next progressive web app part is to
do somewhere down here there we go
reference to the manifest file there you
go and that's going to load our
manifest.json file which I'll go over
here in a second and if we go down
further down through all the gameplay
stuff we should eventually register our
serviceworker here we go basic
serviceworker registration script
nothing too fancy going on here just
registered the serviceworker and echo
out if it worked or not now let's go
look at the manifest JSON file I have
the full name here as a short name which
is pretty much what's gonna be displayed
underneath the icon on the home screen
I've got a description here and then
we've got the icon set of all the
different like icons for the different
home screens etc I want to start URL to
be the route did set the scope here we
do want it to be full screen which means
without the browser accoutrements make
sure you set the background and theme
color and you do want to make that thin
color match up to the theme color you're
setting in the header and for this
particular game it does need to be
portrait to work I've tried at landscape
and band I was mess so don't do that
also just threw in it's in English and
that the character directions are left
to right now as far as the serviceworker
goes very simple serviceworker the
entire application is going to be pre
cached so i put in all the application
assets up here in this array called
cache list and in the install event
handler that cache list is added to
cache
and it's added to a named cash called
pre cash and nothing going on the
activate event that we need to worry
about the fetch event handler checks the
cash and if it is in the cash returns it
otherwise it returns it via the fetch so
honestly it the way this is set up this
line will probably never be hit in this
particular application and that's
because the entire application is very
small and self-contained and we can pre
cache the entire thing and that's about
it folks there's not a whole lot to
making 2042 progressive web app so it
should serve as a really good
introduction to making progressive web
apps especially if you've got a small
site you should be able to pre cache
everything and not worry about too much
so if you got any questions leave those
in the section below and if you think
