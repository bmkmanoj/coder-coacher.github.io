don't think you can test your websites
using Microsoft edge today you have no
excuse microsoft announces a free
partnership with browser stack that
allows developers on all platforms to
test Microsoft edge 43 ok so just
moments ago Microsoft and browser stack
announced a strategic partnership to
allow free testing of Microsoft edge on
the browser stack platform and just to
give you a little bit of background
browser stack is a what I would call a
virtual web testing platform because
they host multiple virtual images of
different devices and platforms and
browsers so that you can better test
your websites and web applications in
different scenarios and this is
important because today's landscape
requires literally tens of thousands of
possible end-user devices and it's just
not feasible for any company to maintain
a device lab that is that diverse now
browser stack allows you to virtually
test your applications in all these
different browsers on different
platforms I always recommend you have at
least a minimal physical device lab
available to you for example i have an
iphone i have a couple of androids and i
have a windows phone but also have a
couple of 7-inch tablets I have a
10-inch tablet and I have an iPad as
well as my surface however for me one
key thing that is missing is a mac or
MacBook this is because I don't really
want to invest several thousand dollars
in a platform just for testing
I'm personally not going to use now to
that effect that means i have a problem
testing safari but many web developers
are the complete opposite they're
working on mac and they don't
necessarily install parallels and put a
virtually hosted Windows environment on
Mac for them to test but they still need
to test to make sure their applications
work in Microsoft edge now if you are
truly complying with web standards your
websites should not have a problem in
Microsoft edge however there's always as
edge cases and a little funny there
where you need to test and this is one
of the reasons why Microsoft has
partnered with browser stack to offer a
free testing environment now this isn't
the first attempt at Microsoft's made at
helping developers that don't work on
Windows test Microsoft edge or Internet
Explorer but this is the latest one and
this is probably a really good solution
the fact that they're making it free is
also a great idea
so let's just review some of the
features and offerings that Microsoft is
making available to developers through
this browserstack partnership and this
is their blog post that they post did
just a few minutes ago probably in the
last half hour and you know obviously
they were thrilled about announcing this
but let's look at some of the things
just a little more background about
browser stack they have 36 thousand
companies that use browser stack however
I think most developers are still a
little unaware that the offering is
there so hopefully this will help expand
knowledge of this offering now I've got
to admit I've known it's been there for
a while personally I don't use it but
it's not saying that I don't like it it
just it's just not part of my budget
let's say and it just depends on
customers whether or not they want to
use it or not and a lot of times because
it's my own properties except the maybe
building and put a budget in there for
something like browser sex not that
enticing to have a free offering like
this is very exciting for somebody like
me but let's let's look at how this is
going to work so what they're what
they're saying is I have not tested this
yet so this is important that we go over
it live testing provides remote
cloud-based instance of edge over WebRTC
so if you're not familiar with WebRTC
that's a technology that enables
effectively live communications so think
skype or facetime or whatever but via
the browser and this is something that
edge and other browsers have supported
at least a year or two now they started
off as a ortc but there were some
security concerns with that version
specifications so this was this is kind
of version 2 of that and you know
Microsoft did take a lot of heat for not
supporting the first version it was
because of security issues but now
they've got I got those things ironed
out and worship we're good to go so
they're using that technology which is
pretty cool and here's something that's
interesting you can use the cloud based
browser just
is you would if it was installed on your
local platform so that look at this Mac
OS Linux or older versions of Windows so
think about that a lot of developers
especially in corporate world and
enterprise space are still stuck on
windows 7 they haven't gone through the
upgrade yet now it's going to change in
the next year as windows 7 becomes
deprecated but even in that case you
can't run edge on windows 7 because the
operating system just does not support
the features that edge needs to be able
to run and of course edge isn't going to
run on Linux or Mac because edge is
designed to be the best browser on
windows at least that's their that's
their goal okay they're not going to
focus their energies on other platforms
so this is kind of an interesting
statement here that means it's going to
be kind of feel like a local browser on
these other platforms which is very very
interesting in my opinion now here's
another one I'm not really another
another thing I really don't have any
experience at very minimal to say the
least is using the web Java API to
actually script automated testing I have
done this a little bit the past I am
very rusty with it at this point it's
been a few years so this is not
something I feel like I'm up to date on
using I know a lot of developers do
build really good automated scripts to
walk through their websites to test
things and it's been a while since I've
had the opportunity to truly do that
it's been more one of those things
trying to get clients to effectively
budget and allocate resources around
this to understand the importance of
having a repeatable automated test
script for the solution but that's
neither here nor there I just pointed
out because I'm not going to be able to
really demonstrate that with any
effectiveness for you but it is very
nice that you can use the webdriver API
and your kind of seeing this animated
gif file here hopefully you don't go
into epileptic shock from it but that's
kind of how
runs it just it really runs things
really quick automated for you all right
let's see what else do we got here oh
you're going to get access to three
versions of edge you're going to get the
two most stable releases which is going
to be effectively what the masses would
get access to and they're saying the two
most recent this is a very important
aspect too because when do you need want
to test your website the best practice
is to test in minus 1 that means the
most current version and the previous
version of a browser okay you should not
need to worry about n minus 20 minus 3
what not and this is because every
browser today does automatic in place
updates so the chances of somebody
having that very out of date version of
a browser probably very slim okay and
again you should always feature as heck
anyway so just in case the you've got a
feature that's being used as more modern
let's say you're using fetch for example
you can do feature detection to see if
you want to use spectra or dynamically
load the fetch polyfill right so that's
that's kind of one of the reasons are
ways you can deal with this testing but
it's very important I think that they
are kind of honoring this best practice
of the current version and the previous
version but they're also going to offer
the preview release and this is what's
in the insiders faster'n the version of
edge that I'm using is on the latest
insiders build so I've always got access
to that that it didn't sort of preview
things so I get I'm lucky enough to get
to test the buggy beta versions of
everything so but this is great to it
gives you an opportunity to test what's
coming in the next release of edge so
that you can kind of verify that your
site will work there as well now they're
making a specific statement right here
today which is March 28th or whatever I
might be short today is let's see March
30th I'm way off anyway you can you can
test the windows 10 anniversary update
today edge
teen which is what's coming out this
summer looks like that's going to be
dropped in the creators update on april
eleventh which is about two weeks now
and that sounds to me like it's going to
be the insider ring is going to be
available and that's when browser stack
is going to pick up that preview release
it looks like so they're going to
essentially catch up to the insiders
release somewhere in there it's not
saying that it's going to be available
april eleventh it's saying the way I
interpret this it's going the edge 15 is
going to be shipping in the april
eleventh insiders ring and then
browserstack will get that
infrastructure set up to support that
version going forward so it sounds like
they're going to have a little bit of
lei from when these insider rings come
out just so that make sure they get
their infrastructure worked out so
there's no apparent bugs in the
deployment of those latest insider bill
so you and again if not i don't think
it's like super uber mission-critical at
the moment the insider ring drops that
you can test and browser stack because
remember it's still that's like months
out preview of what's going to ship to
the masses so it's not that exciting so
those are the kind of the feature
offerings here what i want to do next is
we're going to i'm going to attempt to
actually sign in and see what this
testing experience is like if you're a
web developer and you want to stay up to
date on some of the latest information
