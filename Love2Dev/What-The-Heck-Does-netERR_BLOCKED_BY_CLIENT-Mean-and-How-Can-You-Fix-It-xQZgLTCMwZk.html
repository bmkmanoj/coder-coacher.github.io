dev thank you for joining us today we're
gonna talk about how to solve an obscure
issue have you ever had issues with web
assets like style sheets or images not
loading typically this is due to either
a file missing from the server or a typo
in the URL that means you uppercase or
lowercase a character and the server
didn't find a matching file those are
the common reasons that you may have a
typo in the URL
then there are some edge cases where the
request is not missing but you know that
means satis 404 if it is missing but
maybe something else is blocking the
request now there are many levels where
a request could be blocked the cause it
could be in the network transport layer
it could be in a proxy server some or a
router you know something between you
and the server
also maybe something on the client or in
the browser itself and that's what we're
gonna look today because this is the
cause of a problem that was brought to
my attention I received an email from a
reader who wanted to let me know some
images on a blog post were not rendering
and this is the blog post he was
referencing this is a one that I wrote
back in I think in April but I'm about
nine months ago about how big the web
has gotten and we've reached a point
where the web has gotten bigger than the
install disk of the original game Doom
but as a scroll through the the blog
post here in this section there should
be some images rendered and right now
we're not seeing those images rendered
and we'll discuss why not because I went
to troubleshoot the issue because I
thought maybe the files weren't there or
maybe I'd missed the URL up and the
reason why I thought that would be the
case is because we've been moving our
assets from one cloud provider to
another cloud provider and we had and
you know I want to make sure that the
files got moved over and I thought well
maybe these scripts that we used may
have missed some of these files or
something like that so you know I
thought maybe something to slip through
the cracks but that wasn't the case when
I did I you know go to the developer
tools I got a little bit of a surprise
when I noticed that the reason they
weren't loading was something called
error blocked by client now if we go
over to the developer tools we'll see
here are the four images that are being
blocked and you see the message here I
was really thrown back because I didn't
know what was going on all kinds of
crazy scenarios went through my head I
wonder if there maybe was a header issue
where they weren't configured correctly
on the server some other configuration
error on the server
maybe the images were not really formed
correctly because we've been running all
of our images through image optimization
routines and maybe something screwed up
there
so I did what any you know good
developer or system admin do it does I
Bing gold or look to the hat pom flaw in
the search engines
to see if other people had a similar
problem and well yeah a lot of people
have these problems I found many
references to this issue on Stack
Overflow and basically it turns out what
it is blocking the request is the ad
blocker now the reason this was an
interesting one is because the images
were only blocked for me in chrome where
I have ad block plus setup I currently
am not running any extensions an edge am
so the images came up for me just fine
an edge and I can there we go and if we
just open it up and do this now I scroll
down this time you see the images are
there all right those are the images
we're looking for
so turns out they were blocked by epic
plus so typically when you see this
error it means an extension has blocked
the request
fortunately adblock plus adds an
additional panel to the chrome developer
tools where you get another essentially
network waterfall or it tells you what
it did with all the requests and here
you can see the same for images and
they're highlighted in red but here you
see the filter column and that tells you
why they were blocked so the pattern
that blocked them was this - 300 by 600
period that matched a pattern in one of
the lists that ad block plus uses to
block common ad or malware file
references so the reason why that 300
600 is on all those is all those images
are the same size because we are using
responsive images so we create an image
array from the original where we resize
images to create a responsive image
array and we'll have other videos about
responsive images and so keep track of
things on our youtube channel you'll
find more information about that topic
in the future but one of the things we
do is we try to put the width and height
dimensions in the image filename that
way we can kind of keep track real quick
and see what's going on and automate
further aspects of that so that's why
the 300 by 600 is in there just happened
to be chance that they matched the
pattern in that block plus so we'll have
to go back change an update our naming
algorithm so that we can avoid that in
the future so the next time you've got
an image that's not loading it may be
because of an extension in your browser
these are this is an example of things
that you may not flush out in your
in-house testing because things like
this for localhost that block and
extensions sometimes get bypassed
localhost things like that so you got to
kind of be careful on how you request or
kind of maybe monitor these kind of
scenarios you do need to kind of see
what it's like for a real user a lot of
times and this was just one of those odd
cases and I'm glad that the reader
brought it to our attention we will
correct the issue
so hopefully this will help you out when
you have a similar problem and you can
troubleshoot it rather quickly
