and today I'm going to just do a real
quick web performance audit on a site
and this one I'm gonna pick apart a
little bit on Neil Patel I've known him
Neil is he is a master at online
marketing and is great providing lots of
great content but like most the websites
in his niche and I won't name names
tonight well let's just say they've got
they got work to do to do to get their
web performance up anyway so it's
reading this a really good article on
why the homepage is down tonight
you know it's a rather long article blog
but couldn't put it down screen article
by the way do you recommend going into
it but as usual I got to thinking is he
started talking about dropping crap on
your page and I was like here we go so I
went to my trusty tool webpagetest and
dropped good old Neil's site in there
and if we go back here's the the core
the top-level report and always I've
been doing three runs and I am doing
most my default runs today on a Nexus 5
Android device I could just as easily
put on an iPhone let's say but it
I do recommend trying to do it on a
mobile device instead of on a desktop
now I didn't choose the the GPRS options
it is only high speed cable connection
maybe I should run out with that while
we're doing this let's do that doo doo
doo you will just do that and we'll have
this done by the time I kept down just
so we can see the difference so let's go
back so if I can drop him on there I
think yeah here we go
let's change it to something most people
might have loyalty will give them a
better connection
yeah okay let's go back to history and
yeah I love webpagetest
it's a great way just to get started all
right so first things first obviously
he's got a lot of green on his report
card but obviously there's some areas to
fix and the first one is time to first
byte and all these SEO online marketing
guys constantly keep talking about web
performance optimization being in a key
a search engine ranking factor and
they're absolutely correct the problem
is they don't know about well really
what what performance optimization is
and they really do the same the same
mistake that your typical developer
makes it's all about your server speed
uh-huh that's five percent of the
equation unless your servers crap and
unfortunately Neil's got a little bit of
lag here it's not the worst thing in the
world that I can tell you exactly how
Neil can fix it so listen to me guys
don't use a dynamic website engine but
that I mean don't use asp.net don't use
PHP sorry WordPress people WordPress is
dog slow don't use Ruby on Rails don't
use your dynamic CMS and be anything
infrastructure instead get some sort of
engine or tool or something you can just
automatically trigger that's going to
make the call to that rendering engine
or do what I'm doing and actually
building an infrastructure that just
compiles it out and make a static
website of your content that way your
databases aren't getting hit your
rendering pipeline is not getting hit
yada yada yada instead you're gonna get
a super fast response rate now he's got
800 milliseconds here on this particular
one that's really not the worst I see I
see a lot of them that were three four
seconds because they're doing that are
worse I'm looking at you 84 lumber you
screwed up big time on home Superbowl
Sunday because you had crap servers
released your servers crap configured
and that cost you millions and millions
of dollars next he has got HTTP 1.1
enabled but you notice right here he is
secure which is good unfortunately his
site's not
like properly secured and you know how
to know that doesn't really have the
green lock let's see maybe I ought to
look at another browser a little more
visible with it I'll go over that stuff
later but by being HTTPS you have the
key to actually turn on some massive
performance benefits and that is HTTP -
and I can tell he is not HTTP - because
this is a slanted waterfall you can see
it goes off to the right if it was HTTP
- it would go straight down basically
you would have essentially just one
connection to his server which is this
CDN server it's not even is primary
domain that's other thing that like a
lot of top web sites do they don't pawn
off their assets to a second domain
that's domain sharding that is a 1.1
HTTP 1.1 strategy that's dead these days
said you want to have one domain and
have all your assets there next he's got
the same problem so many people I have
look at all these freaking JavaScript
files and each one takes time now it's
not such a problem with HTTP - but as
well scroll down here you see a lot of
yellow slugs in here and a good website
is as void of these as possible and I
love JavaScript as much as the next guy
but I know it is a performance killer
and how do I know that you see this line
right here page is interactive when it's
red that means the user can't do
anything they may try to scroll or point
to something and it's not going to
respond that's because the the single
you only get one thread the single
thread in the browser that's rendering
your page is locked up due to this crap
and you can see it's it's this goldenrod
right here
that's JavaScript that's rendering CSS
that's another thing - way too much CSS
is obvious is used so much here's green
but then it Jencks and it goes locks it
back up and then you're green again that
he Yanks Jencks it again and you can't
interact with it it is so frustrating to
people
but look it takes nine and a half nearly
ten seconds for this page to actually
become usable because of all the crap
that's going on look at all this crap
that's going on got a trim that up dude
got a trim that up got me a nice flat
waterfall now he's done a pretty decent
job of getting the the proper cache
header set up but you can't rely on
those especially on mobile devices
because they purge the the cached
resources a lot more aggressively than
desktop so for the most part know that
most of these files aren't really going
to be cached it's gonna be a lot of
excess traffic between the mobile device
and your server and that's that's also
bad and this is where service workers
can come into play I really don't think
he's using a service worker be honest
with you did not check but I'm pretty
sure he's not because I don't get
prompted in chrome to actually pro add
it to my home screen so gotta get some
progressive web app Nesta to you buddy
all right now again caching static
content it got a B on that one
let's yes it's just because if you give
a bunch of third-party crap that's not
the thing you got to eliminate
third-party crap as much as possible cuz
you that takes your set out of the cut
out of control it's why you don't use
discuss for comments because it makes
your site disgusting but um one point
seven two kilobytes it's usually a big
smell to me as well it just means you
got too much Chuck he does have some
images on everything aren't really big
images so that to me it's just he's
loading a ton of JavaScript I haven't
actually looked at the actual JavaScript
with this tools tipster cost that's not
too bad that's not terribly bad let's go
back up here to this I should have to
think I got a breakdown somewhere in
here I'll wrap this up here in a second
yeah here we go we've got look at that
half of his pet content almost is
JavaScript and that's bad
so you gotta fix that and you can get a
lot better performance out of your site
get it down to under three
seconds all right guys talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
