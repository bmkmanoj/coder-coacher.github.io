to Delhi I've never been to India and
I'm so excited I get to come to India
and I know so many of you have been
following my blog watching my videos
they're fans of the Facebook page and so
forth and I finally get to come meet
some of you in person and shake your
hand and and have great one-on-one
conversations with many of you about web
development topics now I'm gonna be
doing several sessions on progressive
web apps and service workers and we're
also trying to organize a half-day
workshop on day one we're just going to
dive in and you're gonna be able to work
with me on solving problems with
progressive web applications so that you
can deliver the best products for your
customers that you possibly can but
that's not all I'm not just gonna talk
about development stuff I'm also gonna
have one session dedicated to fitness
for developers this is a big issue for
me now North America we've got an
obesity epidemic and as I'm looking at
trends around the world
I can see that Western culture is
invading India and you are starting to
experience the same things we did many
years ago but as someone who's gone
through and lost about 25 percent of his
body weight and gotten in shape and I
can see how this culture and our
developer lifestyle is not the best so
I'm gonna have a whole session dedicated
to helping you as a developer maintain a
good physical fitness so that you can
live a long healthy prosperous life and
honestly it's gonna make you a better
developer because you're gonna be able
to feel better as you mature and grow
older so come join me and many other
great speakers and as we talk about all
kinds of amazing fun development topics
at the Leela Hotel and Convention
at the C sharp corner conference April
13th 3:15
you want to make sure that you register
today so that you don't miss this
opportunity to come meet me and many
other great folks and hang out with
other peers too I can't tell you how
much I love developer events and the
growth and learning and just motivation
I get and hopefully you'll see the same
benefits as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
