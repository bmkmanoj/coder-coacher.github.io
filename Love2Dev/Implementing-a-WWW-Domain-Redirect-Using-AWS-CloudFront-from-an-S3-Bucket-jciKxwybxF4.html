and today I've got a quick tip for you I
have been getting into or I should say
love to dev have been getting into
hosting our websites in AWS we've really
switched to a static website model and
one of the pieces to properly hosting a
website these days is to have a content
delivery network or CDN now 88 WS
Amazon's Cloud Service has cloud front
which is their CDN offering and one of
the things you want to do when you're
configuring your website is you want to
avoid a duplicate content penalties
particularly like for SEO purposes but
you can also have cross domain issues
when it comes to you know just
referencing assets in your website you
want to kind of limit multiple domains
if you can I know in the past we try to
do what we call domain sharding so we
could get extra connections to the
server to download assets but with HTTP
2 that's going away and that's one of
the benefits you get from using AWS
cloud front is HTTP to support we'll
have some videos on HTTP 2 in the near
future so stay and you know connected
with us so you can know when those are
posted now I've got a just using our
site love to death and as you notice
it's just let the death of here in the
address bar and of course it's HTTPS but
this is being served from cloud Front
and here are our cloud Front
distributions now right here is the main
CDN distribution and that is pointing to
an s3 bucket we're going to cover that
today but what I do while jar your
attention to is a couple lines below
you'll see that there's the WWF today
now what I had to do to get this to work
properly what we're trying to do is
we're trying to do a redirect from
either your primary domain to the WWWF
domain version of it or the ww2 your
primary domain it doesn't matter which
one you pick you should pick one or the
other and standardize on that one I like
to go with the primary domain because
the reason we have WW sort of legacy
back into the early days of the internet
that was sort of an alias to identify
the protocol that was being used back in
the early 90s when I first started
getting on the web we had a lot of other
direct protocols or services I was one
of the protocols with services that we
would use in all times we would set
domains domain up the domain set domains
up to point to those different service
types on our within our organization
let's say so
WWF or World Wide Web back then we also
had things like gopher and so and so
forth but I don't know if we anybody's
going to go for servers these days a who
so to get this to work within amazon's
cloud infrastructure what you do need to
do set up another f3 bucket and in that
s3 bucket what you want to do is you
want to configure a redirect now let me
just go open the s3 bucket for this and
I do tend to play a little more in the
console your web console for my Amazon
stuff that I probably should what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to scroll
down here at the bottom and here is the
WW love to do now I've got an index.html
in here it's actually for me playing
around on experimenting I don't even
need that anymore but what we do need to
do in the bucket is go to the stetic
website hosting settings and choose this
last one here in the scroll just so you
can see the default is do not enable
website hosting or enable web site
hosting I'm going to
another video just on this topic alone
so look for that one on our video list
and then the third option is redirect
all requests to another host name and in
this case I'm redirecting to our primary
domain so that's how this bucket will
respond when it's accessed directly now
if you know anything about the way
buckets are configured you can access
them directly as say the s3 bucket but
when you enable web hosting you can also
get to them with the domain and here's
the actual website endpoint and that's
going to be the name of your bucket s3 -
website - the region that you have
provisioned the bucket dot Amazon AWS
comm again I'll go over that in the
setup website hosting video series but
today I just want to focus on how to do
this redirect because it's not quite so
obvious now the CloudFront distribution
that you point to your bucket and it's
going to be called an Origin in your
cloud prompt does pick up on most of the
configuration you've done for your
website by that I mean any kind of cache
headers and things like that especially
on the individual files or in s3 power
lines keys the way you have those
configures to be served however does not
pick up on this redirect all requests to
another hostname and there's also a way
to do some configuration to control
redirects it doesn't necessarily pick up
on those so well either
so to get around that what we do is you
create a separate bucket that is your
your redirect bucket so to speak and
then you're going to create a whole new
cloud front distribution and point it at
that bucket but you're not going to
point to it with the bucket named s3
Amazon AWS as you can see that I did
here on the primary domain instead
you're going to point to it as the
public website URL and that will cause
it to trigger the redirect for you
because it's going to serve that default
response
from that s3 bucket and that's going to
cause your browser to redirect so that's
what I've done here I've pointed this
particular bucket at the wwlp.com s3
bucket and then when we go to WWF you'll
see that it doesn't redirect
I swear folks it just worked why is this
not working you got to be kidding me
let's try this when I do it that way it
works I wonder if it's because I've
already got the protocol on there hmm
awesome investigate that a little
further so there's there's potential
hole in my system so to speak let's just
try the W okay so works as long as I
don't have the protocol on there so I
will investigate that further and see
what the deal is because that shouldn't
be the case anyway all right oh also too
you need to make sure your dns is set up
correctly to manage this so to do that
we're going to go to services we're
going to route 53 because that's where I
maintain my DNS and we'll go to hosted
zones and we'll go down here and I'll
have another video on configuring this
properly but you want to make instead of
being a cname or an alias for your WW
you want it to be an a record and you're
going to want to choose alias and you're
then you're going to want to point it at
your cloud front distribution now
because we're in an evolving world you
don't want to use just an a record
because you want to be able support IP
six anyway I'll be the yeah the latest
version of IP which has got a different
kind of addressing system and these are
called
aaaa records and you might do the same
thing with setup as an alias and pointed
at that cloud front distribution
and that should get most of your stuff
in place obviously I found a little
holes I was recording the video so I
will investigate that and I'll probably
make another video about that one so I
hope this helps you out I know I
struggled with this a little bit getting
my DevOps setup for the site and I
noticed that many other people were
asking the same question around the
internet and so hopefully this video
will help you resolve an issue there
