websites are using HTTP but you haven't
upgraded yet in this video I will go
over some key reasons why you need to
upgrade to HTTPS today hey guys Chris
love the owner of Lutz dev in this video
I just want to go over five key reasons
you should use HTTPS today and if you
aren't using HTTPS on your site you're
really missing out a lot as you'll see
as this video progresses now first off
HTTPS to an end user implies trust you
get that green padlock up there in the
address bar and that's because you've
got a valid certificate just basically
encrypting or securing the communication
between the browser and the server and
those certificates are issued by a
trusted certificate authority so there's
basically a third party that is
verifying who you are and so that that
identity is there so that they they
really feel comfortable knowing that
they're talking to you and not a third
party or a bad guy trying to do some
sort of man-in-the-middle or passive
attack on the communication between the
browser and the server next the the
browsers are really getting more
aggressive in displaying visual cues to
end users if a site is secure or not
secure in fact this summer and the
summer of 2018 chrome will start
displaying the not secure in the address
bar where the green padlock is if the
site is you is served over HTTP no
matter what there's right now there are
some gates what we call gates in place
or qualifications so if you have a login
form for example with the password field
anything that has an input type of
password
will require HTTPS in Chrome or you will
get the not secure if there's any kind
of what they would deem to be sensitive
data being collected you'll also get the
not secure and so this is a very
important part of making sure that the
visitors to your site know that
everything is secure and that they can
trust you and that the browser's are
going to get real aggressive in telling
people that you're not secure now this
is a very big one and if you didn't know
this a key ranking signal to search
engines is using HTTPS non secure sites
are finding it harder and harder to earn
usable or really good search engine
placement now there are still some
places that I'm finding that I can find
HTTP served sites and honestly I'm going
after them if I'm in that niche and
that's because I don't say I'm going
after I'm going after their position in
the search rankings because I have
secured site so I feel like I can out do
them so to speak and so that's one big
thing right there that can keep you from
a lot of organic search traffic this is
traffic you don't have to pay for
visiting your site in your brand and
starting that relationship with you and
that can cost you a lot of money in the
long run a big push back against
certificates is that they have been too
expensive in the past and I'm talking
about the 90s and early 2000s typically
certificates were $100 or more a year
and to most businesses that's very cost
prohibitive especially if you're just a
blogger but today that has really
changed let's encrypt is the most well
known at this point they provide free
certificates now you do have to go
through some technical steps to get that
certificate but you can issue a
certificate for free and is a domain
validated certificate which is
effectively the lowest validated
certificate it's nothing different with
the encryption layer but
but they are free I host all of my
properties in Amazon's AWS and because I
use the cloud front service for CDN I
can use their certificate manager which
offers free domain validator
certificates and so that is free Azura
and Google cloud also provide free SSL
options or TLS T LTS TLS options for
using their CD ins as well now let's
just look at this is a little bit
outdated from last summer this has
gotten even bigger since then but let's
encrypt publishes an ongoing graph of
all the certificates they've issued over
time as you can see this is a very steep
upward climb that let's encrypt his
issued certificates for and this keeps
getting bigger you're seeing 50 million
there I know the number is over 60
million right now and I'm talking to you
in March of 2018 so this number just
keeps getting bigger and bigger and it
just shows how important the the free
SSL option or TLS option is to the
marketplace now here's another big one
if you're wanting to use modern api's in
the browser and they're way many of them
I mean just lots of them most of them
developers and people honestly I don't
think they know they exist
they're being gated behind HTTPS
especially if the during the the
specification process of a particular
standard determines that there may be
sensitive or you know put data that you
just don't want to get public being
transferred or used it's going to be
behind HTTPS now some of these features
include service workers which is a huge
deal right now for progressive web
applications HTTP 2 which works with
that can make your HTTPS pages load even
faster then they loaded under HTTP
another thing I've been using a lot
lately is WebRTC or the media capture
API that's where you can use the camera
and the microphone in the browser and
live stream feeds so
for example Skype can actually work in
the browser using WebRTC
so that's pretty cool geolocation has
been around for a long time but that's
being gated behind HTTP because sharing
your position to in place actually in
plain text it could be a problem for
hackers be able to find out where you
are and all kinds of things so any kind
of time there may be some sensitive or
personal data being transferred it's
probably going to be gated behind HTTPS
because it's just safer to do so okay
like I've already mentioned HTTP to can
and typically will make your pages load
faster than HTTP one even though it
requires HTTPS now the problem with
HTTPS is there is that the encryption
negotiation step that has to go on in it
and that could be 50 to 100 milliseconds
plus it takes a little extra CPU on each
end to encrypt and decrypt and that kind
of thing
but because the way HTTP works are HTTP
2 works the page load process is super
fast now and typically you can get I'm
just going to throw a ballpark it let's
say a 25 percent performance gain and
again that's also a search engine
ranking signal and it's just you just
want to provide good fast experiences
for your consumers and this is
definitely the way to go and definitely
can make your secure pages load even
faster now as far as HTTPS adoption our
Qualis does a survey and they're
basically a SSL you know security farm
kind of thing and this is again just a
little bit outdated that their survey
shows over 60% of sites now use HTTPS
and that is the numbers growing that was
a last summer number but that number is
growing significantly in the last few
months I think we were probably around
70% now and honestly if you look at the
top sites you're going to be looking at
somewhere
75 to 80% of them will also be properly
using HTTPS and I challenge you to go do
kind of an anecdotal survey of search
engine results and I think you'll find
that the top ranked sites pretty much
across the board I would say 90 percent
or more are using HTTP HTTP archive
which is a site I like to refer to for
web performance tracking they they go
through twice a month and audit the top
half I think is half a million sites
according to Alexa and they run web page
test analysis over them and out of the
top million sites this is one point last
summer again but almost half the sites
were using HTTPS and I know that number
has grown since then now a big part of
progressive web apps is to be secure
it's one of the key foundations is being
secure and if you are looking to learn
how to build progressive web apps I've
got a great course if you just visit PWA
course comm they'll get that allow you
to register or enroll for $29 which will
save you a hundred and seventy one
dollars off the regular tuner dollar
list price as I'm talking to you right
now there's well over 20 hours of video
tutorial content there for you and
there's more that'll be added in the
near future
so this is a great value great
opportunity for you to roll in and start
your progressive web application journey
which of course includes being secure so
I hope this has been helpful for you do
you any questions about this please
leave those in the description below and
give me a like I've got way a lot more
videos on the way around HTTPS and
progressive web app so make sure you
subscribe to the channel so you won't
miss a single video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
