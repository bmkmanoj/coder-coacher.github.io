version of the filly code camp schedule
application last night so I just thought
I would do a quick run-through to
demonstrate the core functionality there
is one feature that I haven't had time
to ship yet or actually add the code for
and that is saving your own personal
schedule but I will get that up there
before the code camp on Saturday now the
icon is up here in the top right corner
that's just where it is on my desktop or
my home screen and as you can see it
launches and we've got our full schedule
on here this is like all 60-plus
schedules for Saturday I think nope I
get the ten o'clock in there all right
yeah we got them all in there all right
I'm just gonna whip through them really
quick you see it's nice and fast and
responsive if I hit the details on this
one it loads that particular page now
you can do a faceted filter so you can
see I just turned off the 8:30 sessions
that turn off the 10 and now the 10
o'clock sessions aren't there I go back
and if it responds why was it not
responding that's weird
I gotta figure out what's going on with
that but that's okay cheap maybe you
just notice that the back behind the
8:30 sessions showed back up and if you
actually looked at the URL this is still
the URL for that one sessions detail and
the reason that doesn't change is
because I'm building all this
dynamically on the front end and we
could also search elasticity I want to
go look for there's your you can see
back behind me we've got all the things
are changing and now this is just
sessions I've got to stand up how about
that these are just sessions that have
as you're either in the title or in the
description now I did not add the
ability to search by
presenter I may add that before Saturday
and that may make things a little easier
for you fact I'm gonna do that today I
think I will more think about that that
right now is about it why that menu is
not working when that's over I got to
look into it but it's a z-index issue or
something like that I bet you can notice
down at the bottom I've got a button for
my sessions that right now is not wired
up but the way I want that to work at
least for now is when you go to a detail
is this a button over here with the X I
want to turn that into like a little
toggle and it'll add it to or from your
session that session will be persisted
locally in fact the faceted search over
here for this session times that was
also persisted locally just another note
the entire application will work offline
which means it doesn't really matter
what the network condition is which can
obviously be pretty sucky in a lot of
cellular networks which I imagine is
what's going to need a case Saturday
with you know seven eight hundred people
in the building all with their phones
all trying to figure this stuff out
anyway so this should be a lot more
useful than trying to find one of those
big monitors and then squinting to try
to find where the session is this will
pull to make this easy for you to just
do it on your phone and you can also see
the power of progressive web apps and
experience the goodness of it all so
hopefully this is good check the blog
post which is in the description below
and also the Co zone github and I will
be updating this the link to the actual
app is also in the description so make
sure you get to that before you get to
the code camp on Saturday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
