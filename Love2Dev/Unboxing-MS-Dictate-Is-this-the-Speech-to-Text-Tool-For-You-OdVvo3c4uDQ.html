text tool called dictate and in this
video I'm just going to do a quick walk
through effectively an unboxing of
Microsoft dictate and we'll see how well
it works and is this something you might
want to try on your computer so
Microsoft has released a new application
product whatever you want to call it
called dictation it's from their garage
works which is basically like a little
skunk works side project kind of thing I
think internally there at Microsoft and
if you're you started using mobile
devices I think more and more people are
not tithing because it's paying the rear
to type on the screen so you're seeing
more and more people start talking to
their phones thanks to Cortana the
Google assistant and Siri and of course
Amazon's got Alexa these kind of
personal assistant kind of things are
coming pretty cool but the way they work
is they are essentially doing dictation
and they're translating that to text so
we call that speech to text and then you
could also go back and forth I believe
it or not way back in 1996 I started
building voice-activated systems and
we'll get into the details of all that
but that's how far back that was and at
that point it was it seemed like it was
reasonably mature but it's gotten so
much better since then now I also have
Dragon Dictate on here which works okay
but and there is also the speech
recorder or whatever voice the
speech-to-text stuff it's already built
on the operating system but this looks
to be a little bit better
I literally just downloaded it having
tried it out yet I opened up Word as you
can see I've got a new tab here called
dictation and I'm gonna do is I'm going
to
start I haven't looked at the
instructions nothing yet just watch the
little intro video so this is me
starting this out so let's start this
out hope this will work with the
Camtasia recorder going if not there's
going to be complete waste of time and
I'm sorry
anyway let's start so this is me talking
to the voice recorder to not do anything
to start dictation text the text
Microsoft microphone connected okay
let's see what happens try it again
this is me trying out the new Microsoft
dictation service so far so good
it looks to be doing exactly what I
wanted to do new paragraph
so I think I can start using this
possibly to dictate blog post and even
scripts for videos that I'm doing
another great use for this would be to
write books and documentation that I
need to share with other people new
paragraph
so it looks like it lets you effectively
talk naturally and then tries to catch
up with you and I think it's a little
bit awesome places but that's
understandable
normally with any speech recognition
software there is a slight training
phase you need to go through so it can
learn how you enunciate words what your
normal speaking patterns are and any
kind of local way of saying things that
you might have for example I'm still a
southerner at heart even though I live
in the US Northeast and I still try to
retain my southern accent and a little
bit of my droll
new paragraph new line okay there is a
little bit of training I think that I
need to do about I do like the fact that
I can just sit here and I can talk and
it's going to try to figure out what's
going on I don't know how big the speech
buffer is before it starts writing stuff
on the page but I do like the fact that
it gives me the chance to essentially
walk through entire paragraph or
paragraphs in my head and just translate
those to the document after the fact and
it lets me pause and watch it
and maybe we've hit a kink here and it's
going to not record anything else up the
up it stopped so maybe there's a bug in
it or something that made it stop
alright I won't do this so whether this
other piece now you're wired it up to
the translator which is pretty freakin
cool let's go to French I used to go
France a lot so good morning how are you
doing
it looks beautiful outside maybe we
should go for a good 1 hour run new
paragraph
hey that was pretty cool that I can now
speak French stop listening all right
well I got to learn the commands here
but that's ok let's see what the about
tells us because like I said I haven't
looked at anything just going to take us
to a web page and it's going to open up
where I left off at just good oh it's
just going to take us ok so here are the
commands if you want to visit this
they've got an alias domain set up its
dictate dot IMS and literally this was
my first attempt at using it I think it
was fairly good obviously there are some
places it needs to kind of clean things
up but that's ok I'll look into and see
if there's ways to train it and make it
better but I guess a quick run-through
I'm pretty impressed I'm going to try it
today and see what else I can produce so
there you have it my first run-through
with MS dictate and like I said I think
it's I think it did a pretty decent job
right out of the box I literally had
just installed it
and opened upward to give it a spin and
recorded my experience so you had
somebody who had no training on using
the product effectively walk through and
dictate stuff fairly effectively without
a hitch
I also really liked the ability to do an
automatic translation I think that's a
brilliant piece to add to this dictation
tool and speaking of somebody who
probably understands technically what
they're doing under the hood again big
kudos there for meshing or mashing up a
couple of different api's I know
Microsoft has a translation API and I
got a feeling the dats wired in
underneath the hood brilliant moves guys
glad to see this happen so hopefully
you're going to download the dictate and
give it a spin love to hear what you
think you can leave a comment below and
we can have maybe a discussion about it
but this looks like a very promising
tool and I'm very glad that the
Microsoft folks put the time in to make
this and it really looks to be a step up
from the built in speech-to-text
capabilities and I got to tell you I
think this might be something to compete
against something like Dragon which I
also have on this machine and anyway so
good good job there again leave comment
like the video if you think this is
pretty cool and definitely share it with
other people because I think this might
be something that helps people out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
