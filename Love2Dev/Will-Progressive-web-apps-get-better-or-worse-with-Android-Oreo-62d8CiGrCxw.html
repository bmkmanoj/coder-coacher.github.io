this Android Oreo really take a bite out
of progressive web apps in this video I
want to talk about what potential
problems people have been finding with
the latest version of Android and
progressive web apps and answer is this
really a problem or better things on the
way hey everybody
hopefully this is going out this is my
first attempt at doing a facebook live
from my desktop it's taking a little bit
to get some of the infrastructure in
place and launched and hopefully this
will be a good experience and maybe I'll
make it a little better as we go through
this but I want to start trying to do
some live video and talk about things
because there's all kinds of things that
always want to maybe produce some
content on and I kind of shove over to
the side and never get it back around to
doing it and it's real bad
characteristic of me so I thought I'd
just go ahead and start creating some
live videos because I seem to be very
popular and can be very useful and I can
also make them very responsive to
interesting topics of the day so to
speak which is what we're going to do
today to get this thing kicked off now
if you know me or you don't know me my
name is Chris love I'm the owner of
loves dev and I am which we consider a
big advocate of progressive web
applications and just give you a little
elevator pitch on progressive web
application these are websites that in
the words of Alex Russell have taken the
right vitamins and progressively become
apps now we've got videos and some
written content as well as courseware on
progressive web apps but basically these
are applications that will prompt the
user to add them to their home screen
and they do this because the site is
served over HTTP or has an SSL
certificate
either way the same thing has a valid
web manifest file and you should also
have an appropriate array of different
image icons so that they can the
platform can put that on the desktop and
then finally you need to have a
registered service worker that at least
has a fetch event handler now I'll talk
a little bit more about those kind of
topics in other live streams I'm sure
but these have been emerging ways to do
websites for the last two years or so
and honestly the way we've been building
websites for the past six or seven years
are basically the model of progressive
web apps but now these features I just
discussed make them native to the
platform I mean native to Chrome Firefox
Opera and Microsoft edge and we'll talk
about that as we get closer to the edge
summit as far as what Microsoft strategy
is and of course I'm leaving out apple
in there but that's a whole no
discussion we can have as well but today
I want to talk about an article that my
friend max Bertman wrote yesterday that
has gotten a lot of attention and that
is because Google released some details
on Monday about Android Oreo which is
the newest version of Android it's still
in beta it's not the official latest
version but it will supplant Android in
and he noticed some negative things
around progressive web apps and so he
wrote an article about it and as I read
through this article yesterday on oh no
no way
so I'm just gonna kind of scroll or zoom
in a little bit and we'll talk about
what's going on here
and he's just talking about you know
Android or goes out and progressive web
apps have acquired new problems and he's
already installed Oreo on his pixel and
I have not done that to my device in
fact I need probably to read it actually
it's need get a new phone but anyway and
started trying progressive web apps out
and he noticed something
right off the bat and that is the broken
add to homescreen experience now from a
developer point of view this might seem
like the most minor part of the
progressive web app but to the consumer
or your actual customer this is
everything they don't know about service
workers they don't know how you set your
caching strategy they don't understand
how you've wired up maybe push
notifications or background sync or any
other really cool advanced geeky
features that developers get excited
about but getting prompted to add the
website to the home screen and launch it
looking like a native application that's
what customers see and that's what they
get excited about when I talk to non
developer types and I'll show them this
and I've shown them how to do these kind
of things for the last six or seven
years they get very excited about this
but evidently Android Oreo has broken
the experience that we've had where
we're progressive web apps get their
icons added to the home screen and they
look just like native applications they
launch just like native applications and
that's because the home screen icon
feature is not working quite right first
off he points out that non Chrome
browsers when you add to home screen
nothing is happening right now and we'll
go through this I think I have a clue
why things aren't working right and we
can play that video I think there we go
it's 23 second video he's gonna
basically just show us what it looks
like this looks like Samsung internet
which is a very good browser right away
pinching a little bit here we can see
what's going on and you're gonna go
through the home screen experience there
he's going to flip the part light which
is one of the premiere long-term
progressive web apps and there you go
you see part of what's going on first
off the icon wasn't added because it was
coming from Samsung Internet but it also
kind of give you a preview of what he's
going to complain about here a minute
and basically points out there's a new
add to homescreen process and Chrome and
he talks about that kind of feels like
there's like an extra
step being added to it I'm not quite
sure how much of an extra stuff that
really is this is the manual Add to Home
screen looks like not the one you get
prompted for there you go
who's comparing them side by side they
are for us and he points out that
there's just a little extra space step
but here's the big one icons are not
icons like we've had in the past where
they're essentially on equal footing
with the native applications now they've
got a little chrome icon overlaid on top
of it plus their circles so if your
regular icon is a square it's going to
shrink that down so that fits within the
circle it's not going to say crop in on
that or anything for you so it's going
to not look real pretty and this here
with the Aliexpress icon the chrome
overlaid on top of it and here he's
comparing what things look like on
Android 7 compared to what they look
like on Oreo and you can definitely see
there's a big difference there and
that's not really what we're going after
as web developers who really understand
the advantages progressive apps give us
over native apps for sure this makes us
look like second or third class
experiences already by doing that and so
that's that boy everybody kind of got up
in an uproar but he does finish the
article by pointing out web Dave geeky
web apk will be our hero and I was like
what the heck is web baby I have not
heard of this term before and I felt
like how did I miss this but I did i do
what did I do wrong what did I miss here
and I think it turns out I didn't
necessarily miss the term I did know the
concepts were on the way I literally had
never heard of the term and so I
scrambled over the last day trying to
pull up articles on this and they're few
and far between there are a few news
places that are reporting about this but
there seems to be nothing I can find
on the Google or Chrome developer pages
that kind of talk about this terminology
and the term web apk now they may have
talked about that and hallway
conversations at
isn't maybe that's why max knows about
it and whatnot but it seems like the
chrome team from their comments is a
little cagey about it and I know it's
like to deal with in particular folks at
Microsoft being a little hush-hush about
stuff that's coming down the pipe even
though we know it's kind of coming out
they're a little hesitant about same
thing for sure so I kind of get that and
this other part wasn't really exciting
but if we scroll down there we go we've
got the icons again not looking great
and just talked about two things so but
he does point out right here Google
needs to work harder on press about us
and that's really Waverly saying here is
he the promise that that the chrome team
in particular is making is that this is
this is a way to make user experiences
that are great without having to be
native applications not having the
friction of the App Store not having to
pay the App Store tax be able to update
when and you feel like doing having the
web superpower of deep linking and all
these great and wonderful things and
this has been the promise but it seems
like they're trying taking a step back
from what he's picked up now we scroll
down the comments first one is Paul
Kinlan and this is a key person to
comment on this because Paul is somebody
on a reference here in a moment and he
worked for the chrome team and
particularly he works on the stuff
around this web APK concept and
everything it looks like I don't I think
I might have met Paul once I can't
remember but anyway I do know who he is
I doubt he knows who I am who knows he
may be anyway but if we expand this out
it won't blow up at me and one thing
that max pointed out in the blog post is
that he started talking about this web
APK stuff you know 14 months ago is what
it looks like here and basically the
this is kind of a what I would call a
party-line kind of thing of that I get a
lot from Microsoft folks too so
since exactly what Paul's saying I guess
is that you know just it takes a lot to
get things right before they want to
ship it so to speak but it's it's coming
right and you know he's thanks him for
it but this this comment here from mark
PS ACK
sorry if I mispronounced that leads us
over to a Twitter conversation thread
that was started based on Max's article
in else Ahmadi replies directly to max
and I think this is where things started
making more sense to me about what's
going on so if you don't know adi adi x'
developer relations on the chrome team
he works on like a bajillion different
open-source projects and really does
generally a good job making the web
better place for us and helping
developers sort out some things so he's
a good guy to follow but he points out
here the issue with oreo displaying the
small chrome icons for sites i did the
home screens now fixed and he said test
it with a canary version of chrome which
is like the version that's like right
past the ones that the chrome team kind
of builds internally right and it's the
one before chrome beta so to speak if
you aren't familiar with that any points
out that that shouldn't be there now
what i had to do is i had to go but kind
of really like I said I went back what
the heck is going on with this web APK
thing now if you're not familiar with
Android applications
it looks like the live feed that I was
recording cut off the middle of it so
just what I wanted to pick up roughly
where I was and kind of finish out what
I was talking about so just real quick
to recap so everybody knows we're on the
same page been discussing Android Oreo
and what it means for progressive web
apps based on max Burton's blog post
yesterday where it looks looked like the
chrome team basically is making us take
a step back with progressive web apps
not necessarily delivering on the
roadmap they've shared with us and doing
so they they make the icon that's edit
to the homescreen a circle and then
overlay little chrome icon on top of
that really kind of taking us back but
what it really turns out is that
basically a little bit of plumbing has
not quite shipped with Oreo and chrome
just yet it is in Chrome Canary and it
can be enabled in Chrome Beta it's not
actually in the real Chrome and it's not
an Oreo just yet but basically it
started me down the right track when I
found out he got some Mahdi's reply on
Twitter to max his article and basically
he's like everything should be fixed so
I looked around and based on
conversation because you can see right
there max is saying but what but that's
web APK right but haven't actually been
delivered he mentioned that in the
article and basically that's the truth
so basically web APK web APK is pretty
close to getting released it just wasn't
ready for this beta version and
sometimes that's just how things go but
they're kind of getting things set up
for it so that's okay and just got
realize it's beta that's fine so it
looks like the panic
we can get over it go back say we're
going to be good that what I do want to
do is just want to go over what is web
apk because this is real exciting stuff
I don't think a lot of people really
talked about that and I had not heard of
that term and I thought I missed
something I don't miss something a
progressive web app so I feel like I'm
really like tight with progressive web
apps like really tight with the
progressive web apps but everything I
missed this term not what web APK offers
web APK i wouldnt looked on the end
I found like next to nothing on it and
I'm like am I crazy what max talking
about but I did find enough referencing
to it and evidently I got a feeling
where some of the people reporting on it
and talking about it like Max and a few
news sites that I found in the Android
space was probably some of the chrome
team members having halle conversations
with folks and getting the word out
there maybe it's just something that the
they were giving to some of the media
folks I'm not totally sure but basically
that's how it's kind of gotten out they
didn't actually use the term web apk in
any of their content there's not a lot
of content necessarily on it but I
remember Paul Killian was the first one
to kind of respond in kind of a hazed
way to Max and basically this is what I
want to reference here is last year's
chrome dev summit Paul Killian had a
session on what comes next for the web
which basically lays out a roadmap
primarily for progressive web apps and
this is where it gets really exciting
I'm not gonna play the video because I
think that'd be a little duplicate and
here I want to link to the video in the
description so make sure you watch it
and I'll have a point right to where he
starts talking about these things but in
essence when someone adds your
progressive web app to their home screen
in chrome one soryo official ships
what's gonna happen
seamlessly is that the progressive web
app is automatically compiled to a
regular Android application effectively
making a Cordova type application except
there's no like webview it's just built
in to work that way with real chrome and
not a webview which is awesome but you
also get all the first-class features of
being a regular native app on the
platform and that's going to include
things like being in the app drawer and
in the system settings so you can go
through their individual partitioning
and so you can view what the storage
situation is like with your application
that users built uninstalled us like a
write or native applicant as much as
they do native apps because they install
all the freaking time the another thing
that web apps have that native apps
don't really offer is the ability to do
deep linking that means somebody can
send you a link to a site or you can
find one on the search for
and crumbs just gonna know you've
already got it installed us a
progressive web app and it's gonna
launch the site as a progressive web app
but it's gonna open up the page that you
show if you click the link to which is
going to be pretty awesome I think
that's something that definitely an
advantage over native applications there
and of course you're gonna retain the
ability to just update your your
progressive web app whenever you need to
naturally and seamlessly without having
to go through the app store process yay
which is awesome which is one of the
reasons why a lot of people go the route
of the Cordova app because they don't
want have to fuss with the the
censorship effectively that is app
stores and making their application
updates and getting those things
deployed everybody it's a nightmare and
the web is just fantastic for that
deployment scenario now another thing
that's real important about the web APK
approach is that you're also going to be
a real native application and you will
have access to more native api's if not
all them I haven't got a real full story
on that still a little foggy that's okay
but I got a feeling it's gonna be a lot
like the hosted web app story it's bone
windows and if you aren't aware for the
last few years not many people are aware
of this if your website served with SSL
and has a valid web manifest file you
qualify as a hosted web app and you can
submit your URL to the Microsoft Windows
Store and they will automatically create
a Microsoft native application of your
website effectively the same kind of
features and you will be featured in the
App Store now I'm not a fan of putting
into the App Store I always thought
staff stores were just the dumbest thing
in the world we already have search
engines and the web's great it's just
getting access to stuff now one of the
cool things about these hosted web apps
when they are put through the app store
is you will have access to the hardware
api's and stuff that you don't normally
have in a web page or a web or just a
browser
and from what I've picked up with the
web APK it's the almost exact same story
though the big difference is they're
just bypassed in the store because it's
just a waste of time
so that's a great story right there I'm
a huge fan of this really glad to see
this so just have a little patience
right now there
kind of undoing a little bit of stuff
that they did so they can take advantage
of the new plumbing and evidently it's
almost baked but not fully baked and you
know want to take the cake out before
it's done because it's going to be a
little gooey in the middle and you got
to have it fully baked and that's what
we're really after
so hopefully this clears up the
confusion and we don't panic as much
about progressive web apps in the future
thanks for max for pointing all this
stuff out and because I would have done
the same thing if I saw it I would have
freaked out too so I don't blame max for
freaking out on that and you know we
could by doing it he actually kind of
teased out some comforting information
from some of the developer advocates on
the chrome team which is good to hear
too so that's good that they're paying
attention to things out here in our
ecosystem now if you got any questions
or comments please leave those in the
area below definitely like the video
don't like you can thumb down it - but
tell me why I mean this is my first time
with doing this lot of stuff and
obviously I'm having to come to kind of
come back and and patch things up a
little bit now hoping to make this more
regular because I've got all kinds every
day it's like I want I got like four or
five different blog post or videos I
want to do and like never get them done
because I got so many things to do and
this may be a way for me to just get
stuff off my chest and not worry so much
about just being like really pristine in
my video production just get the stuff
out there and if you've got any
questions or topics you want me to cover
yeah just ask those in the description
below to shoot me a message on Twitter
that Chris loved follow the Facebook
page love to dev just communicate with
me also don't do and you know as always
have fun enjoy progressive web apps make
great websites make great web
experiences and let's make the web a
great place all right guys
again it's Chris love the owner of love
- dev and I am so thankful you to spend
some time with me on this video
