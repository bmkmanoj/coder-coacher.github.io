hey good morning guys
this is Chris and I am hopefully coming
live from my hotel room and this is just
before I'm gonna head out to the airport
a little bit of time left so I thought I
would do a quick live video for you I
know I promised you some live videos
like during the event the other day but
honestly the noise was pretty loud and
there was no Wi-Fi available and the
cellular connection actually inside the
building tend to be a little flaky at
times and so I decided not to bother
with it and that's unfortunate because I
really wanted to do some interviews of
some of the guys especially on the team
there was a lot of good interesting
people that could provide a lot of value
to at the event that was just it's just
the logistics really weren't my favorite
I don't think so
but I didn't want to do a quick wrap up
before kind of get my bags packed up and
head out to the airport this morning and
if you don't know Wednesday which was
two days ago actually
Microsoft held the Microsoft edge web
summit which is a one-day event where
the edge team which is the browser on
Windows actually has some announcements
and goes over like new releases new
technology stuff and and sometimes just
some interesting things that they're up
to and doing and so what I thought I'd
do is just run through a few of those
highlights I'm gonna go through my notes
I got nothing really planned
structurally here so I'm just really
literally gonna go through my notes and
point out some highlights now the first
a couple of things to note is that edge
is now two years old so internet
explorer has been rused supplanted and
replaced for two years now in fact
internet explorer honestly is not even
supported by Microsoft anymore except on
Windows 7 and honestly it's just there
because companies haven't either updated
their operating system or they don't
update their a lot of business apps and
that's why it still exists next they say
their own 330 million active devices
that means that
they're about 330 million Microsoft edge
devices is really what that mounts to in
my opinion because that's where address
is on Windows 10 so that's a number put
that perspective there about five
billion Android devices out there don't
mean necessarily that they're
considerably Isis but a little over two
and a half billion devices that run
chrome on Android right now so 330
million is actually pretty small in
comparison that right now if you
actually look at your logs especially
for consumer or external traffic on your
site you should see somewhere between 70
to even up to 95 percent be nothing but
mobile handsets hitting your your
properties these days they really
emphasize a lot on getting feedback from
people who use edge especially if you're
frustrated something where you find
something that's a legitimate bug a lot
of things that are considered bugs
actually art bugs
it's just that other browsers get more
credit for things and this is meep
speaking but what they do is they
implement things before they're actually
a specification people confuse
implementation with being a
specification and that's not always true
either but they have they provided
several ways to provide feedback I do
plan on producing a video and some other
content around ways to submit bugs and
feedback to the team and they are very
interested in hearing about those kind
of things and trying to fit because I
what they want to do is make sure that
they build a browser that works
everywhere for everyone and that all
sites load there and what you know hear
from you is a big way to do that let's
see the browser is always being updated
basically major releases are every six
months with the operating system but if
you're like me on insiders build you get
updated almost every week with stuff and
that may be a little micro increments
and stuff like that security patches are
a different story those are gonna be
updated rather quick when I think they
said they had 82 updates in the two
years I think it was like every thirteen
point three days
is what Charles said so anyway you can
finally edit two favorites at least the
URLs which is good you can drag and drop
those favorites who spent a lot of
frustration with that by some people I'm
actually using favourites a whole lot
more than I used to I really actually
appreciated that let's see did you do
edge is always getting faster in fact
they scored 2.5 times faster than they
did originally some of the one of the
benchmarks there which is really good
it's just because they're able to clean
up the code continuously and they they
do their own Diagnostics and stuff
they're always improving the performance
of stuff the you can always see what
they're working on on status in
Microsoft edge comma fact if you go to
Microsoft edge comm there's actually a
lot of resources there which is another
video I'm planning now sonar sonar is a
linting tool basically it's something
you can integrate into your continuous
build if you want it's a node module and
what it'll do is basically tell you
things that are wrong with your site now
right now they've got a initial set of
rules that they're going to audit
against you and a nice thing is you can
configure if those rules are executed
against your site or how they're
executed the actual format the
information is presented to you there's
lots of good things that that got lots
of plans with sonar myself so you can
definitely notice you're going to hear
some things about me from that another
big announcement that I was really happy
with is that they are collaborating with
Mozilla that's the Firefox team Mozilla
has actually renamed their documentation
site from Mozilla documentation
something or whatever always but it's
just MDM web Docs and these are
something I go to regularly to do
research on specifications and just how
to do things be honest with you this is
a fantastic source of written
documentation on Web API is whether it's
HTML API is
JavaScript CSS it's all covered there
the problem is sometimes it's not
necessarily right sometimes it was
written early in the spec and it hasn't
been updated yet the the edge team has
made 75,000 wiki edits because this is
an open wiki so you could actually sign
in like you see over on the right it's
actually I think I'm get hub and you can
also update the content and feel free to
do that so you're gonna make the web a
better place for us developers by doing
so now one of the big things that they
went over that I've not really done
anything with is bash on Windows and if
you're not familiar with this about 18
months ago Microsoft build announced
that they were in support bashing
windows I did write a blog post about
this back then and I wasn't really sure
what to make it because I just I don't
know what I'm missing I guess because I
don't really do that but I do know I
have frustration when I go read
tutorials on how to do things especially
node and they don't quite work because
they the node modules with the syntax
are showing me is actually for bash and
honestly I don't know a lot about bash
this is one of the things I would have
to learn about but it's known as the
windows subsystem for Linux you're
actually running an instance of Linux on
your machine and the way you actually do
this is go to the Windows Store and
honestly if you just type in bash let's
walk you through what you're gonna see
you can see that you can run Linux on
Windows and there are three current
instances of Linux that you can download
and boom - and then open SUSE
and then SUSE Linux for enterprise
server and then of course there's always
like a hundred million versions of Linux
so what else do you support well
according to the people I talk to there
are more in versions of Linux that are
in the pipeline that will be coming soon
if your favorite flavor of Linux is not
there yet I would start pinging the team
that manages that and put some pressure
on them and hopefully we'll you'll see
your favorite version there
soon now I want to have to go over the
this whole thing in the near future I've
gotta get my head wrapped around a
little bit but I did hang out with the
some of the guys on the team that
yesterday and I had some really
interesting conversations with them it's
something that actually now is really
fascinating to me so anyway we'll talk
about that and other content let's move
along let's see oh well okay so one of
the big announcements and well if you
haven't picked up on it
Microsoft especially the edge team in
particular is really excited about
progressive web apps they did talk a lot
about progressive apps the one thing I
was very disappointed is they're not
shipping next month which by the way new
ver the fall creators edition will be
available on October 17th and that's
when all the stuff that I've been
playing with and almost suffering
through at times because of bugs with
the beta stuff is going to be available
to the general public what's not going
to be available to the general public is
service workers ah which is frustrating
but I probably get it basically they've
been working on service workers this is
not an easy implementation they put
about two years worth of engineering
resources into service workers and
basically they'll before they release
something major like that they're going
to put it out there in kind of a test
form and the way browsers do that these
days is behind the about flags and
basically if you go to about : flags you
will see a set of options you can do
this in every browser and you can turn
things on and if we scroll down to the
standards preview section down here you
can enable service workers you will have
to reboot your computer and this is only
available today on the windows insider
build but I don't like ever 17th it'll
be available to the general public so if
you're not on the insiders build that
your machine gets updated then then you
can start playing with it now what I
thought I'd do is just do it super quick
it's just not what I wanted to do
they're super quick just quick
run-through of what they've got in the
developer tools right now
and that's another thing developer tools
are really being rewritten
what's there right now just don't really
don't really make assumptions about the
team based on the developer tools today
they're going to be changing a lot over
the next year again another great place
to provide them feedback all right now
if you go to the debugger and the
developer tools there is now a service
workers node on the tree over here and
you can see the service workers and what
domain the service worker is hosted
under over here you will see some
information about the service worker it
looks very similar to some of the
information you get in chrome right now
it's not quite as sophisticated I've got
to talk about how service workers work
in edge I've got all kinds of cool
really deep information that I can
provide probably really going to go into
it in my courses and stuff like that
now I haven't played with a lot of this
stuff yet but to actually debug the
serviceworker and this is because the
serviceworker is an edge work a little
bit different than they do in chrome and
it's actually a good thing which I will
be going over to other things so
basically they're two separate processes
not just separate threads or separate
processes which is actually a really
interesting and cool thing so here we've
got a new instance of the serviceworker
and to be able to debug the
serviceworker now was having some issues
with this and I'm still having some
issues with this so this is some of the
stuff I'm trying to sort of work through
at the moment I'm just going to reload
my page here and see if that helps I was
able to get the serviceworker code up to
actually debug yesterday I'm not seeing
it I've been like everybody else I'm
having problems with the edge debuggers
right now so anyway but here's where you
would actually debug the code and I was
able to do this the other night so
that's that's a thing all right let's
just go back here I'm gonna go back
through this cuz I only got a couple
minutes for I've got to get ready and
I'm sure you're getting bored of
listening to me maybe they went over the
browser stack partnership a little more
and I got it some videos on that from
earlier in the year I think back in
April and I think they now said it bill
and that is really cool
they went over a lot about security and
safety just how they do that I won't go
into that here because it gets really
deep but there are a lot of things that
they do about that they do spend a lot
of time on progressive web apps I had a
lot of hallway conversations obviously
with them and there was also some
Googlers up here too but a half-dozen
from the chrome team that I got to have
some good conversations with about
progressive web apps and service workers
and stuff like that so it's gonna add a
lot of value to some things that I'm
working on of course they're obviously
gonna be they're gonna be putting press
of web apps in the App Store that did
not go into details about the what I
would consider add to homescreen your ad
Start menu yeah let's say they're not
totally sure what that's gonna look like
just yet
which is why they really haven't told me
anything that's the gist of it they're
kind of working through some thoughts
and ideas on implementing that but I
want to go over to do more detail about
the plans on progressive about some
windows as it stands today as far as
what I can say publicly I guess but
anyway
do
service workers familiar there when it
seems like the next big drop in service
work as a side note might be geofencing
there seems to be some discussion on
that as far as interest I don't know how
far along the specification is gone
did it do chakracore was talked about a
lot chakra cores pretty cool basically
it's like the eight the is the
JavaScript engine in an edge and it's
been available and open sourced on
github for a while now and there's
actually a flavor of node that runs on
it and there's a lot of advantages from
using chakra core there and chakra core
actually runs things like cosmos DB
which is a new database in a juror they
talked a lot about typescript
improvements hopefully I'll be going
over those soon I mentioned sonar they
have a
of web payments which are fascinating
got all content planned on that - that's
going to be awesome it's already being
supported by three browsers and it works
and others they spend a lot of time on
accessibility very important topic that
is often overlooked I'm super guilty
about that but if you do follow
accessibility you will build great user
experiences hi Stefan
Nolan lost one over a lot of performance
things that you need the cognitive
essentially Todd went over from a
browser perspective and Dylan went over
from a coding perspective like from our
side and a few quick he went over like
three things that you might be needing
to actually do yourself and obviously
I'm gonna go over this stuff I mean it's
performance it's like my thing so that's
a quick summary of the public things
that they talked about we did spend a
whole day yesterday a small group of us
with representatives from the edge team
and it's just having some candid
discussions it was a very a really good
experience and I love hanging out
especially with the browser guys because
they built the platform I build on and
which allows me to understand how to
build websites better so I do encourage
you to go back on channel 9 and watch
some of the videos if you see this it's
a summit Microsoft edge com that will
give you the full agenda and if you
click the little take us straight over
to the channel 9 link there we go and
the videos are all up here you can go
back and watch each one of the videos
and see what happened so hopefully this
is helpful to you and again like and
share it with your friends I'm going to
have to make it a post here in a few
minutes and good luck for all because we
can I guess and I got to get to myself
ready to go downstairs and catch the
train so I can head out to the airport
alright have a good one guys I
appreciate your time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
