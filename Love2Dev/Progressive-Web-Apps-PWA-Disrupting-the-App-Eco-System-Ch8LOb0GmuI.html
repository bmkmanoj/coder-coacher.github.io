the app ecosystem it's the web and today
in this video I'm going to show you what
a progressive web application is and
give you some good fodder for why
progressive web apps are going to change
the way you think about mobile and
native applications hey guys Chris love
the owner of love to death and a
progressive web application an attic now
if you haven't heard a progressive web
apps these are just websites that took
the right vitamins and progressively
become apps that's right these are
websites that look and behave like a
regular native application and are
benefited by the great features that are
offered by some of the new platform
capabilities that help them rival native
applications without losing their rich
web capabilities of reach and engagement
so sit back relax and I've got a great
presentation we're going to walk through
to give you a high-level overview of all
the great things about progressive Web
Apps and why they're probably the better
solution for your app needs thanks for
joining me for this presentation on
progressive web applications and how
they're going to be able to disrupt the
application ecosystem and if you haven't
heard of progressive web applications
this is going to be a great presentation
for you to watch and learn if you have
heard of progressive web applications
maybe you need some extra resources to
help you sell the concept to your team
members and stakeholders again another
great reason to watch this video or
maybe you just want to know more about
progressive web apps in general gonna
have a lot of information here and I'd
love your feedback so with that let's
let's just get started with a little bit
of paperwork here so to speak a little
bit about Who I am I can get the slides
to move there we go all right so I am
Chris love I am the owner of a lot to
dev and basically I try to tell people
that I
live in the browser and focus on
front-end web development but I didn't
have a background essentially doing
full-stack stuff but if things have
gotten more complicated I have migrated
to the front-end it doesn't mean I don't
do some back-end stuff I am actually
pretty bull bullish and excited and have
fun doing service architecture stuff as
well it's just not my primary focus now
if you want to go to our YouTube channel
there's a little bit li there for you
and if you're watching this on youtube
you're already there and I do encourage
you to subscribe to the channel if you
want to follow me on Twitter I like to
share a lot of resources around web
development especially around
progressive web apps and web performance
optimization and you can follow me at
Kris love and love to have you do that
if you want to drop me a note ask me
some questions directly to feel free my
email is Kris at love to dev calm in
that is my personal email address and
the website of course is love to dev
comm and you know that was the kind of
the professional photo of me but what I
like to do in real life is run Spartan
races and that's one of my favorite
photos of me finishing up a race up in
tuxedo New York last summer and that's
what I do for fun so if you're you're
into fitness and you're into Spartan
races maybe we can meet up together at a
race and and enjoy some fun together
outside of this development world okay
so as we get into this progressive web
application thing I think it's important
to understand why progressive web apps
are important why this is the direction
you need to take your website and to me
the biggest reason is because HTML on
the web in general ultimately fell short
when it comes to user expectations and
when I talk about this primarily those
user expectations really started
changing almost around a decade ago when
Apple released that iPhone right about
that point is where the web truly had
one over the desktop as the preferred
way to deliver content and build front
end user experiences and it was because
you could build the web and it would
work in different browsers across
different
forms it's time honestly we had cut a
minimal amount of constraints that we
had to worry about and what I'm talking
about that we're talking about viewports
and what I would say input modalities
back then we had keyboards mice and the
general resolution was 1024 by 768 but I
think at that point we were just
starting to get to say 1200 by 900 as
far as screen resolutions but in general
we didn't have to worry about too much
at that point so things like responsive
design weren't important everybody in
the least of the development developed
world was getting online using
high-speed Internet primarily fixed wire
and wire Wi-Fi and so bandwidth wasn't
necessarily a concern at that point but
since then everything's kind of flipped
around today the predominant means that
people get on the Internet is through
mobile devices and at least 25% of the
time according to analysis analysts that
means they're connecting over cellular
connections which is GPRS that means LTE
4G 3G and sometimes even worse the other
side of it is instead of those great
processors and our laptops and desktop
machines most people are connecting
using their phones which are lower
powered devices and just don't have the
amount of resources and horsepower that
we experience on desktops and as
developers we're generally on those
desktops making those experiences and
that can lead to some other undesired
ramifications when we actually ship to
production because we haven't probably
properly tested at the same time does
html5 really meet the needs that people
are expecting and so let's talk a little
bit about how the web's fallen short now
- in my opinion HTML html5 has a big
perception problem is perceived as slow
I hear this a lot and honestly I know
it's not slow because I love to
specialize in what's called web
performance optimization and I've got a
whole series of content around web
performance optimization tips tricks et
cetera that will help you make your
sites run extra
we fast and one of the things that I see
is most websites don't adhere to these
what I would consider cardinal rules or
our best practices of web development to
deliver well performing websites and
that has caused the web to be extremely
slow I'll give you a stunning stop the
average web page takes at least 20
seconds to load on mobile phones and
today mobile devices account for up to
95 percent or more of the traffic to
every web site in fact recently I was
talking to a lead engineer for a major
US retailer and if I said the retailer's
name you would you would probably
recognize it and he told me that 95
percent of their website traffic came
from just iPhones let that sink in a bit
for you a major US retailer 95 percent
of their website traffic comes from own
iPhone not a desktop not even an Android
and iPhone now that's a huge market
share that means they could almost
ignore desktop altogether but that also
creates a lot of unique situations where
performance needs to be minded now the
other thing is that the per web is
perceived to be lacking capabilities and
I found this very unfortunate as I go
out and interact with developers I work
with clients I talked to their
developers I talked to developers at
events around the country and it seems
like most web developers don't really
know what the web can do and I found
this very unfortunate because the web
can do some amazing things and for
example I still think a lot of
developers don't realize there's a
geolocation API that's been available
for over a decade across all browsers
this means you don't have to do any kind
of server-side location detection you
can do it right there in the browser
with the users permission and this gives
you all kinds of great powerful
capabilities especially when it comes to
retail when you've got local retail that
you need to manage and another one is
that it's been incapable of working
offline and this has been untrue again
for about a decade
then the app cache manifest
specification was introduced in that
ushered in the era of when we could make
sites work offline the big problem with
app cache is it's not the easiest thing
to work with as far as the development
and DevOps side and that's led to a lot
of confusion but I think even more is
the fact that probably the vast vast
majority of developers out there are not
even aware of its existence and this is
unfortunate because I've been able to
leverage just having an app cache
manifest as a mechanism to make my web
applications work offline now I like to
point out this article because back at
TechCrunch in 2012
Mark Zuckerberg said that their biggest
mistake was betting too much on html5
and I found this very disappointing
especially seeing where Facebook is gone
and Facebook has basically gone the path
of creating a custom browser with a
closed content ecosystem essentially
they created their own private internet
effectively and what they did at this
point it doesn't think this is a
critical point in Facebook's life cycle
is they essentially turn their nose up
at html5 went to the native app platform
and decided to decentral off all the
Facebook content from the rest of the
world and I won't get into the details
and technicalities of that but you can
see that that's how they went about
doing it in fact they even created their
own markup language called JSX which
honestly I personally hate and this is a
language that mixes three different
major concerns javascript CSS and HTML
and puts them all into one file format
and I think this leads to a lot of
confusion and a lot of unnecessary work
that we as developers have to do now
know react is super popular that I am so
not a fan of react because of that but
I'm not going to get into that today
this is not here to discuss the merits
or negatives of any kind of framework or
approach to actually producing your
content I want to focus on why
progressive what
are awesome and but at this point let's
just talk about that so that's that's
just it they looked at it and said I
don't think we can trust that the web is
going to basically roll or mature fast
enough for us to for it to keep up with
our growth plans our growth strategies
and so they went a different direction
essentially went off and crafted their
own web where they can control
everything from end to end and that's
one of the things that I think is unique
about the web is the only thing we
really control is what we have on the
server once it gets requested and in the
browser on the client side actually
returns it we don't have any control
because we don't have control over the
browser we don't have control over their
device we don't have control over their
operating system so it's kind of the
wild wild west out there fortunately we
have things called
web standards and in as developers we
need to program to those standards
unfortunately at that point web
standards weren't as mature as they are
today and we've come a long way in the
last five years but at the same time
there was a lot of things that as I
analyzed facebook at that time I saw
them missing on missing big time and
just I flat out in my opinion
misunderstanding what was available to
him at the time and it was very
frustrating to me so with that I think
that's just one of those big examples of
how the web was completely misunderstood
and underutilized so to speak and I
don't want you to be making those
mistakes especially with the
capabilities that we have today so let's
look at the perception problem and a
different light now most the common
thread I guess is that most developers
and stakeholders perceive this graph is
being true where native apps for devices
like the Apple iPhone iPad Android
devices and Windows with the desktop
native applications give you a lot more
capability they're tight more tightly
integrated into the platform they have
the ability to do offline although I
rarely ever see a native application
actually work offline
and they have the ability to do things
like push notifications when a user
doesn't even have the application loaded
and so that's a clear advantage that
native applications have but the web on
the other hand is much easier to reach
to people and as we go through this
presentation I'll talk about some of the
some of what that really means and how
we can actually reach people but really
it comes down to links the ability to
link or deep link to content is the
web's superpower it allows us to as
marketers or brand managers and business
owners to directly drive traffic to
specific landing pages where we can
funnel visitors into our sales funnel so
that we can ultimately build that
relationship where we've got a
profitable relationship where we can
provide goods and services for customers
at a profitable margin and that's what
everybody wants it's much harder to do
that with the native application in fact
it's much harder to get people to even
download your native application so
here's why HTML ultimately has fallen
short so some of this technical and one
of the first things is browsers are
single threaded and what that really
means is that all the JavaScript you're
loading all the CSS they're all handled
by the same thread and if you understand
threading models which basically any
developer should you understand that
there's only one task that can be done
at a single time and when you've got a
lot of JavaScript being loaded and
you've got a lot of CSS being loaded the
browser can't finish that what we call
the critical rendering path and actually
render at the markup how many times have
you gone to a website loaded that page
and then it flashes and reloads all over
again and maybe you've scrolled down the
page a little bit and all of a sudden
you're back at the top or maybe it's
hung and you can't even scroll or click
the link that you're looking for and
that's because there's a ton of
JavaScript being loaded there's a lot of
CSS that's required to render in in most
cases upwards of 99 percent of that code
is never even used and that means that
you've got to sit there and wait and
this is a huge reason this is probably
the
number one reason why it takes 20
seconds for the average web page to load
these days and that's just it it leads
to performance issues and that's
frustrating and it's this is the number
one point of frustration for end users
when web pages take too long to load I
just want that instantaneous experience
that instantaneous experience you want
to be away at 1 second or less if
possible but at 3 seconds you've already
lost half the people that tried to load
that web page so you've got three
seconds to load and over a mobile phone
on a cellular network that rip that
makes a lot of constraints that you need
to actually design your experience to
work under and another one is what I've
kind of alluded to the lack of platform
level API access deep integration into
the hardware and this can mean a lot of
different things but be honest most web
pages most web applications out there
don't necessarily integrate too deeply
in to the platform but they do need to
sometimes integrate interact directly
with the hardware but those are kind of
my opinion really edge cases but then
there's things where like I mentioned
geolocation is something where you're
going to integrate in with the platform
and you want to be able to do that in a
lot of cases maybe you need to play
audio or video again those are actually
leveraging platform level things and the
web's got great multimedia capabilities
with the audio and video tag these days
and then you've got things like the
media capture and WebRTC api's that
bring that kind of stuff to a whole
another level now a lot of the reason
why we couldn't get a platform access is
because of security concerns essentially
the browser vendors have been debating
what's the best way for us to provide
access to these Hardware features
because the tighter we are the more we
give developers and brands the ability
to integrate into our plot
they also they're also integrating it
into the Archos our customers privacy
and that can open up security holes that
were not necessarily comfortable
allowing to get open and honestly the
native applications have had different
ways of going about doing it and
effectively they're fleshing out some of
those issues for us to determine kind of
what works best at this point and as
those things have kind of gone through
the a B testing cycle if you will now
we're able to have a clear model or
pattern for browsers to agree upon so
that standards can be made so that now
we can have a kind of a permission based
pattern to this and it really boils down
a lot of times to this make sure your
site is being served over HTTPS one of
the key tenets of being a progressive
web application and I'll talk about that
more later on so now as you've got a
secure connection at that point then ask
the user permission to be able to
integrate with that that platform
feature and and enable it and if
honestly if that's not essentially good
enough for that particular platform
feature then maybe you do need to get a
go the mobile native application route
in fact Microsoft is upgrading all
progressive web apps to full-blown
native applications on the Windows
platform if you go through the Windows
Store and if you go through that effort
and people install your progressive web
app from the Windows Store then you have
full platform access just like any other
native application your own equal
standing with you WP applications and
that's a very key advantage that you can
have on the Windows platform and again
that single threaded model how do we get
around this single threaded model so
that we can get better performance and
the next thing dealing with that
developer lack of awareness we need to
get better developer education about
what's available on the platform which
is one of the reasons why I'm doing this
particular presentation
so that you'll be better exposed to
what's available on the platform and I
also want to help you implement better
user experience and this can mean a lot
of things and I'm not really gonna be
able to get into kind of UX kind of
things or best practices in this
particular presentation but know that a
lot of it comes down to that performance
stuff but also how you design navigation
input modalities all these kind of
things you've got to design and craft a
great seamless user experience it just
makes people feel comfortable with your
brand and from a technical point of view
a great example of this that I see
missed all the time is developers are
trying to use JavaScript to do
animations javascript is the worst
choice you can make for driving
animations instead you need to
understand how to use CSS to do
animations how to do keyframe animations
transitions all these kind of things CSS
works great for this and it uses the GPU
whereas JavaScript uses timers and those
are extremely inefficient again not
going to have time to cover that in this
presentation but I want to plant that
seed in your head and in the near future
we'll try to do some content around that
as well now more about how we fell short
I think this is another technical reason
is the inability to explain HTTP caching
and high level HTTP interactions like
the html5 appcache and this is where
dotting deep into serviceworkers
serviceworker caching and managing those
assets that are cached can is very
important and it's also a very confusing
topic I would say it's more advanced
topic but I think the average web
developer has very little concept of how
HTTP caching works things understanding
the cache control header and I think a
lot of devops teams often overlook this
as well and we see a lot of problems
with that if you look at the HTTP
archive they track who actually uses
proper cache headers
and usually it's somewhere under there
the 60% range which i think is very sad
because this is a very key part of
making your website work more
efficiently and this ultimately leads to
the difficulty in building an offline
first web application kind of what I
call a natural way meaning it's just a
normal developer and deployment workflow
it is making sure that your web
application can work offline and
obviously this is where service workers
can be super valuable but we've got the
ability to do that even as service
workers aren't supported but because we
don't really have an offline first
approach to our normal development cycle
this is often overlooked and this leads
to what I consider poor quality user
experiences and another thing that the
web has not had until service workers
came along was the ability to execute
things in the background and in service
workers are fantastic for this because
they work in a separate thread in a
separate context from the browser and
this allows you to do many things that
either really slow down your user
experience or clog up your server so to
speak and I'll talk about that in my
course quite a bit is how to leverage
service workers to do things that you've
been doing maybe through the front end
or maybe on your server and now you can
maybe push that off to the serviceworker
level and improve your overall
experience so now we talked a little bit
about how the web has kind of fallen
short I want to talk to you a little bit
about what is a progressive web
application how is it progressive about
actually kind of change the way we can
approach the web to kind of
counterbalance or counteract or
eliminate some of those issues that I've
brought up in the first section of how
the web has fallen short and if you want
I've got a free ebook available for you
that goes through what is a progressive
what about essentially why you should
upgrade and that's it love - dev comm
/pwa upgrade all you gotta do is submit
your email and I'll send you information
on how to download that free ebook now
the web are the the progressive web apps
I think the best way to explain them is
this quote a new way to deliver amazing
user experiences on the web and that's
because progressive web apps really
bring together best practices for
delivering websites and also bring in
brand new technologies features that the
web now supports am combining those
together gives us the ability to deliver
great user experiences and that's
ultimately about what all of this
concerns great user experiences now the
great thing about a progressive web app
is it doesn't need to be maintained
separately from a native application it
can completely replace that application
experience in fact that is what Twitter
is and the process of doing if you
haven't heard back in April of 2017
Twitter released a new progressive web
app called Twitter light and it is
almost a one-for-one parody of Twitter
on the phone with the with when I say
parody with their existing native
application and that's because the web
has all the capabilities that Twitter
needs to provide the Twitter experience
there's nothing that Twitter doesn't
have access to that they need to drive
everything that you would want to do
with Twitter post tweets upload live
videos photos all kinds of stuff the
background push notifications all the
stuff that you're used to getting from
say the desktop or the native
application you can do through Twitter
or light and that's just a great example
of how you can phase out any native
application concerns and trim your
essentially your your whole technology
budget for having to maintain different
applications and pour that in to
progressive web applications and deliver
a much better experience and progressive
web apps basically this is a new level
of quality and because you've got this
new level of quality this new
level of experience you can ultimately
earn a place on the users home screen
and this is one of the clear advantages
that native applications have had
because when you've reached that point
where the customer is willing to go
through all the steps necessary to
download your native application from
the platform's application store your
icon is now sitting on that desktop and
that icon on that on their desktop or
their home screen represents a unique
bond where they like your brand enough
to make it part of their day-to-day
experience even if they don't open your
application your brand logo is sitting
there on their home screen reminding
them of who you are and reminding them
with that relationship that you have
with them it also means that you need to
deliver and consistently maintain a good
user and business experience so that
they don't look at that icon and go I
don't know about that anymore and maybe
knock you off and it takes a lot to earn
that spot on the home on their home
screen even if you're a native
application but this is exactly what
progressive web applications can do they
can earn that place on the native on
their home screen and they'll be much
more inclined open up and view your
content now progressive web apps have
three really key attributes and the
first one that I've talked about several
times already is they're fast they
respond quickly to the user that means
they load fast they respond quickly to
user inputs and expectations and that's
because you followed web development
best practices and when you do that you
can have basically an instant load
experience for your website and that's
one of the first tangible qualities of a
progressive web application next it
needs to be reliable it means the user
knows that when they launch your
application it's just going to work and
to do that it needs to be able to work
offline and when they've got poor
connectivity and as you go through
especially in my course you're gonna
learn that essentially you're building
your website
web application to work without the
network you are building a offline first
mobile first web experience when you
build a proper progressive web
application and when you do that the
network honestly should not matter for
the most part now there's obviously
cases where you need to get live data
off the internet and that the great
thing is when you've got a service
worker in place you've got a good
strategy for dealing with those offline
and poor connectivity cases next it
needs to be engaging it needs to have
this immersive user experience and this
is where I call those esoteric areas
this is where kind of you get into more
user experience and artistic side of
things but there are also technical
things that you can manage as well like
having good navigation patterns and
again just having a good experience all
around and this is where doing things
like you know not overloading the site
with JavaScript and unnecessary CSS are
good having a good plan for how you're
going to cache your assets offline so
you can get quick snappy transitions and
many other kind of things but it's also
about having that home screen experience
in earning that spot there and
maintaining a good relationship at that
point and it's also about being able to
use things like push notifications so
that you can touch those people or what
we call interruption marketing in other
places to remind them of things about
your brand and this is very very
important and this is another key
advantage that progressive web
applications have over our traditional
web sites now I've already mentioned
this quote but I want to give credit to
where it's due and as Chris Wilson with
the chrome team and basically he said in
one of the videos that they shared at
one of their conferences progressive web
applications a new level of thinking
about the quality of your user
experience and this is the thing when I
say the HTML fell short it's because I
don't think we really approached HTML on
the web thinking about it with a good
quality of user experience and this the
whole
push behind progressive web apps is to
push the web to have better user
experiences Alex Russell this is the
dude that actually came up with the term
progressive web app okay he also works
for the chrome team and I love this
quote because this really says exactly
from a technical side of things what a
progressive web app is these aren't
these apps aren't packaged and deployed
through stores they're just websites
that took the right vitamins and they
progressively become apps and that's
because the progressive and progressive
web app means that you can add all of
the support for all these brand new
features and even if the browser itself
doesn't yet support some of these
features your website will still just
work and also because you have followed
these web development best practices
your website's going to work really
really well
now we're gonna see later when I talk
about some of the case studies how
adopting proper progressive web
application stuff has benefited many
businesses on on iOS which right now it
doesn't have serviceworker or app
manifest support but because they
followed better web development
practices their business metrics have
increased significantly and Bruce Lawson
he used to be the head of opera which is
a very popular browser and especially in
developing world and I love what he said
about this that native apps are bridging
technology like flash and I think this
is a very bold statement for Bruce to
say but I wholeheartedly support and
understand this and I think he's 100% on
point when he says this remember when I
said that the web essentially finally
took over and owned the desktop back
around 2007 that's because we finally
kind of figured out what does it really
mean to build a good user experience on
the desktop and we had that limited
constraints of viewports and and we had
a pretty good idea what the platform was
gonna be like and then all of a sudden
the phone came out and just like the
desktop they just went faster right
instead of 20 years we went to
less than 10 year cycle on this one
where native apps kind of gave us the
guidelines of what a good user
experience should be like on these
brand-new mobile platforms and one of
the things that we did along the way to
to make the web kind of work like those
desktop applications is we used flash
because flash gave us the more
controllable platform to kind of build
higher end user experiences but as we
know now flash is being completely
deprecated Adobe's killing it off and
browsers are rapidly removing support
for it in fact right now I don't think
there's really any browser that really
wants to support flash it's a very
limited when it is and the thing about
Flash was it kind of gave us a way to
kind of see what might actually work on
the web and a lot of the things that
flash and if you think about it
sam'l as well have led us to craft
specifications and standards like the
CSS grid for example in ant web
animations and the multimedia elements
that I talked about earlier they it kind
of gave us a roadmap for how these
things needed to be implemented to be
successful in the web and that's exactly
what's gone on progressive web
applications are going to replace native
applications because they're just
cheaper to develop they're cheaper to
deploy and they're much much smaller
which means the user has more room on
their small device and so many other
great capabilities around them
ultimately anything you deliver as far
as a user experience is about what the
customer wants and customers want
applications that work offline that load
instantly and have easy navigation and
visual cues this is all about that user
experience they want to basically not
have to fuss with they don't want to
have to wait on your application to
respond they just want it to work I hear
that so much when I talk to what I call
normal people they just want things to
work and they don't want to have to get
frustrated waiting on things to work and
if you follow best practices more often
than not you're gonna have that
just work experience but also from a
developer's point of view it's about
what stakeholders want the people who
actually pay us to develop these
experience they want platform
integration they want to appear on the
user's home screen and they want to have
those things push notifications I can't
tell you how many clients and potential
clients have asked me over the last
decade how can I do native push
notifications on the web and this has
frustrated me because I've lost out to a
few projects in favor of native
applications because they simply wanted
push notifications often they didn't
even have a strategy for how they were
going to use them they just said they
wanted them and push notifications are
really awesome their way to re-engage
your customer and the great thing about
it is now we've got the ability to do
native push notifications on the web and
like I said we've got better platform
integrations we've got more and more
api's to give us access to some of the
deeper things in there and I've talked
about things like geolocation multimedia
but we've also got new API is emerging
around social sharing email integration
and all kinds of other platform
capabilities and of course that coveted
place on the user's home screen or Start
menu if you will and that's that's
ultimately what all of our efforts are
really about now everything works great
when we've got great connectivity and
you look at your phone and you see those
five bars you just know you don't have
to worry about the connectivity it just
works and often here in the United
States if you've got an LTE network
you're in pretty good shape for that but
I can attest that's not always the case
often even around me in a very developed
suburban world I get one bar or less on
my phone and the connectivity goes to
pot that's right it's just good it just
it just frustrates you as you wait on
things but what's even worse is you get
no bars and for some reason there's
several Italian restaurants near me when
you go inside there's absolutely zero
cell
and it's very frustrating because
nothing works at that point I get no
Twitter updates no Facebook updates what
I'm going to do at dinner except talk to
the people around me anyway I digress no
bars is very frustrating because now
basically nothing on the web really
works unless you built your site to work
offline but the worst case the absolute
worst case is what we call Wi-Fi that's
when you've got those five bars but
there's something between your phone and
the internet that's broken and your
connectivity the internet does not exist
and essentially what's going on is
you've connected to the cell tower but
the cell tower from there to the
Internet is not getting you connected to
the actual Internet and this is so
frustrating because you're like I don't
know why then the average person
probably just assumes that your website
is down and this is bad we don't want
that but if you build your progressive
web application and use service workers
correctly the state of the network
really doesn't matter and ultimately in
the end your app must be able to handle
any kind of offline situation the
network should be a progressive
enhancement not a necessary requirement
for most applications now obviously
there are edge cases or different key
nodes they necessarily edge cases but
there are many application scenarios
that probably do need to be connected to
really be used to the fullest I've
mentioned Twitter obviously I can't get
any new Twitter updates if I'm not
connected but I could still queue up
tweets and have those go out when I do
get back online and there's ways to do
that with service workers if background
support is supported or maybe you can
even kind of polyfill that on your own
and even if you don't have service
workers there's ways to get around that
and work that up as well and think about
Pokemon go Pokemon go work if it was
offline or what if the internet
connectivity was spotty could you still
make Pokemon go work
I absolutely believe you could because I
know a little bit about how it worked
because I essentially reverse engineered
it to a large degree and I know that the
little critters that spawn there's your
phone actually know
about a lot of them there in your
general radius around you so you could
actually make it work even if he had his
body internet connectivity and so things
like Pokemon go perfect candidates for
progressive web applications but
progressive web applications offer an
opportunity for us to upgrade the tech
stack now I've mentioned app cache now
app cache is in the process of being
deprecated by browsers but for now for
browsers that don't support service
workers like Apple Safari and Internet
Explorer app cache is supported but for
in most cases you want to actually use a
service worker the great thing is you
can use both and I'll talk about that in
my course why that's the case but
basically if you register a service
worker and the service worker is
supported the browser will refer to it
for offline capabilities but if the
browser doesn't support service workers
you're not going to have a registered
service worker which you can still
reference an app cache manifest and it
will work just like it has in the past
now another thing is I've used local
storage quite a bit over the last decade
to store content and this is this was my
original persistence layer for restoring
offline content was in local storage
but as indexdb achieved ubiquitous
support by all browsers I've been
migrating away from local storage for
most of that and so most of my data
persistence now is done in indexeddb
instead another thing Apple has since
the announcement and release of the
original iPhone had a specification for
touch icons this is how you tell I oh s
Safari how to add your website to the
home screen and put your icon there and
what the launch experience should be
like instead that's done with a lot of
meta tags in your document head but
that's being replaced in favor of a web
manifest which we'll talk about later on
and now you've got a more integrated add
to home screen
Experion
it's because the browsers will now
either pop up an install banner or give
you visual cues to tell you that you can
add a progressive web app to the home
screen we're in the past you would have
to manually do this with something like
cubic orgs Add to Home screen library so
now you can safely migrate yourself away
from these solutions again let me remind
you the progressive web apps need to
operate fast they need to engage
customers and I want to emphasize this
too to properly build a progressive web
app you need to build them very
differently from the way you've built
web sites in the past now this is a
little rundown of kind of some of the
reasons what a progressive web app is
and some of the advantages of
progressive web app now let's actually
look at how this compares to native
applications now this is what I call the
app Smackdown this is where I go through
and compare native applications to
progressive web apps and kind of set up
what the reality is what our industry
and our analysts finding that real users
do and want now here are real stats now
these are aged a little bit this is from
2015 and grand you're not gonna have a
lot of 2017 stats just yet but at that
point there's a lot of analysis going on
around apps this is because businesses
are trying to figure out should I ship
an app or not basically and if you look
at it the mobile web accounts for about
13 percent of mobile screen time and
native apps account for 87 percent of
mobile screen time so if you just look
at that stat alone or that comparison
there's no reason for you to bother with
the web right just build a native app
because that's the only way you're going
to actually get anybody to ever do
anything with your brand but if you dive
deeper into it out of that 87 percent
eighty percent of it is spent in the
users top three applications now what
are those top three applications well
let's just say it's Facebook okay and
back in 2015 the reality was being
passed around that we have passed pcap
this is the point where application or
native apps basically are just not
wanted anymore and users are kind of
abandoning them so the effort and
respond in an effort to or the effort
and investment in those platforms really
is not going to yield your the returns
that you need or expect and here's the
one of the bigger telling stats the
number of apps that the average user
downloads in a given month is zero now
you may be saying no this is not true
this is reality this is what real users
actually do and when I talk to my
friends that are not technical or not
developers and I just say how many asked
have you downloaded this in the last
month or the last three months
the answer is wait a minute you know I
haven't downloaded an app in a long time
unless it's their kids that are playing
with their phones and then they're
constantly downloading free little games
that's about it that's about the only
downloads that people really have the
only time that people tend to download
new applications or just download apps
is when they get a brand new phone and
they have to download all the apps that
they've already downloaded and usually
this is done automatically when you
upgrade your phone so that's not a good
story when it comes to native
applications and one of the reasons why
people don't install apps is this is
what they've actually told us is that
the they get it a little turned off by
the over-broad permission demands
upfront this means when you go through
the download from the App Store you go
through this step where it goes okay
this app needs these permissions one two
three four or five you know and it
breaks out a lot of people because I
don't necessarily know what it is to
them it's almost like reading the tax
code it's scary and they want help and
if it's too much effort and it's too
much friction
they just don't bother another reason
native apps are huge they are massive in
size
and diskspace on phones is very limited
and honestly most people want to be able
to do one of three things predominantly
on their phones these days if you're
like me you want to listen to music and
podcasts and audiobooks that's a big
chunk of what's on my phone the other
thing it's on my phone that everybody
else seems to be interested in is their
personal photos and videos okay that's
what people really want to use the disk
space for on their phones instead of a
bunch of apps I very rarely talked to a
friend who has more than a dozen or two
apps that they've even downloaded that
weren't there by default another concern
that they have because they read
headlines and they don't necessarily
understand them is privacy concerns they
don't necessarily trust these
applications and they don't trust that
they're safe from hackers because they
do read a lot about hackers and viruses
attacking these native these one of
these mobile platforms today especially
on Android and that can be very scary as
well now remember this is what's always
the true the web is the number one
places customers discover and interact
with new things they're constantly
searching for stuff and today personal
assistants like the Google Play
assistant Cortana and Siri are how we
find things on and to begin with and
those are all based on web searches so
when you ask your phone finally jeans
around me or find that Italian
restaurant near me what it's doing is
it's hitting their search engine and
it's giving you the results from the
search engine and those links are gonna
take you to websites pretty much all the
time so again the web is how you get
discovered and people are constantly
looking for what we call long tail
phrases and if your website is ranked
well enough for those long tail phrases
the odds of them finding you and
choosing you are much higher you can't
really do that with the native
application because content and native
applications really is not indexable and
it's not directly linkable at least for
the most part so this is where the web
has it
very clear advantage over native but
what about actually earning a customer
if you're a developer you may not know
what it takes to market to get people to
interact with those interfaces
experiences that you're building but it
ultimately comes down to money
advertising and marketing money to get
people to pay attention to your brand so
what does that cost now these numbers
are a little bit dated some of the newer
numbers that I've looked at are even
higher so it costs between $1 to two and
a half dollars for an interaction to
possibly even get somebody to download
your mobile application but to actually
get somebody to really use your app on
iOS you're looking at nearly $8 on
Android over $2 some of the recent
numbers have they've been seen around
these loyal users numbers is on iOS
today sometimes the number I see the
average number I see is upwards of $15
to actually get a real customer for your
application androids not quite as bad
I've seen between 250 and $5 but I'm
referencing these because I got a good
link to the Heth to those numbers but in
general it's much much higher now you
compare that to what it cost to get
traffic to your website 3 what we call a
pay-per-click campaign like Google
Adwords or being's pay-per-click traffic
or even Facebook you're looking at
pennies most the traffic I can drive to
my content is costing me between point 4
cents and seven cents a visitor it just
depends on how well targeted things are
other factors when it comes to marketing
but compared to a dollar - two and a
half dollars to get somebody to even
consider downloading your application to
drive for pennies people to come visit
my content is so much cheaper and I have
to develop the same kind of marketing or
front-end materials like video promos or
banner ads and things like that or come
up with pay-per-click ads the same kind
of stuff that I would have to for
native application but it's so much
cheaper to get people to visit those
pages and videos and things like that in
fact like the one you're watching right
now here's another big thing this is a
actual graphic that I pulled from some
of the chrome teams presentations where
they were comparing side-by-side web
apps to their native counterparts and
the ones on the left are regular native
apps for Android and the ones on the
right are their web counterparts and as
you can see the web counterparts take up
less than a megabyte of space on the
device whereas the native ones take up
four hundred and sixty Meg's on iOS the
numbers are even worse because iOS
applications are much larger in size
than Android apps so this is another big
factor of will people even keep your
icon on their home screen if they don't
visit you regularly then most likely
they're gonna delete that application in
favor of storing videos and photos that
they're taking on their phone trust me I
know that's true so let's go back to our
capability and reach graphic now we've
already established that native apps are
perceived to have more capabilities but
the web has much better reach so who
really has the clear advantage here well
remember apps are things you want to
invest in and not one-off experiences
the web tends to be a one-off experience
but if you can provide a good enough
experience like the web can become
something that people invest in and
remember the web super bout superpower
is its ability to link again Alex
Russell the guy who created the term
progressive web app and URL sharing is
what enabled the web to spear spread and
prosper and he calls it the web's
superpower and that's why I'm calling it
the superpower because I totally agree
deep linking is the power you can create
content rapidly and get an index rapidly
for what I've said with these long tail
keywords which is if you know enough
about search engine marketing longtail
keywords or
over 80% of the search phrases every day
in the search engines so let's go back
to our graph we've talked about how the
web now has the ability for you to craft
things that are more platform integrated
which means they have more capabilities
but the web retains its ability to for
deep linking and reach
but native applications haven't gained
that ability and that means that the web
is essentially on par capability wise
with those native applications but it's
still the big winner when it comes to
reach now that means that the web is the
clear winner when it comes to the App
smackdown and this is the big reason why
you really should start investing
heavily into progressive web
applications now we're going to keep
looking at progressive web apps and more
details about them and hopefully you're
going to enjoy this and share it but
remember if you want to learn more about
programming progressive web apps we've
got a great course called progressive
web app from beginner to expert and I
encourage you to visit PWA course comm
so that you can get the best deal on our
progressive web application course
available ok we've looked at the app
Smackdown and we've established
progressive web apps as a clear winner
over native applications these days so
let's dive a little deeper into the
advantages progressive web apps have
over native applications we've talked
about better reach they're linkable and
you can easily share content via deep
links and you don't require this complex
installation step before you can get to
that native of that deep content in fact
native applications mean you have to
launch the application go to the default
home screen and then try to navigate
your way to the information you were
actually looking for where is a link
that you share can go directly to the
content on your progressive web
application next is they're very
discoverable one of the big complaints
that we have about app stores is the
search sucks they're just not optimized
for search it's really hard to get
you're content ranked where search
engines have an established criteria to
rank web pages in fact if you do that
enough research in SEO you'll find out
that Google has over 200 independent
ranking factors with three very key
ranking factors ones one primarily is
external links to your actual page and
how important are those links how
contextual irrelevant are those links
all these kind of factors but you've
also got things like rank bearing which
is machine learning it's a very
sophisticated strategy for ranking web
pages and like I said there are like
three billion different searches done
every day and about 80% of those are
unique and 15% every day are brand-new
searches that the search engine hasn't
seen before so this is very interesting
very exciting but the web has a very
mature way to find content and find the
right content deep inside of your site
native apps it's just not happening
progressive web apps are cross-platform
they work progressively even if the
platform or the browser doesn't support
some of the features like service
workers no problem as long as you've
crafted using web development best
practices your site's gonna work well on
every single browser they're also
responsive which means you can build one
one codebase and you craft it using CSS
media queries and often like frameworks
like bootstrap helped take care of this
kind of stuff for you so that now your
website will work on any device any
screen resolution and work more or less
back to where we were 10 years ago where
we didn't have to worry about those
screen resolutions quite as much
granted you still need to test on
different screen sizes just to make sure
things work but we've kind of got this
science part of it worked out and we've
got things like well-known breakpoints
and grid layouts and things like CSS
grid and flexbox make this experience
much easier for us to manage as
developers and designers but the big
thing is it's cross-platform you don't
have to maintain
three four different native applications
to hit the different device platforms
you have one code base that can reach
everything and that is a very key
advantage when it comes to return on
investment and how much how many
resources you have to throw at building
interfaces for customers
the web has a much simpler installation
process it's just freaking installable
we've had the ability to do favourites
we've had the ability to bookmark things
we've had the ability to add things to
the desktop panel to the taskbar even
panel to the Start menu and that's just
getting better and better
now the browsers are starting to
integrate native stuff if you meet the
criteria required one of those criteria
will be served over HTTPS have a valid
web manifest file with the icons that
are needed and I've got a video and blog
post on what's your baseline icons for
your progress what about need to be I'll
give you a hint
you need 17 images but I've got a trick
in there so you're gonna have to worry
about making 17 images it'll I got a
trick to make those for you anyway the
browsers will prompt you there's no app
store needed unless you're on Windows
and you want that deep platform
integration there's really no need for
you to have to worry about that most
browsers will actually trigger a thing
but you could also do it yourself if you
really want it to and make so that makes
your application your web application
your progressive web application much
more findable and indicates that deep
customer relationship now again
increased engagement progressive web
apps are app like they're freshly
engaged well and basically that means
they're just always up to date
because we've got an instant deploy if
you've got a continuous deploy process
you can update stuff thousands of times
a day that's what github does did you
know they update their website on
average a thousand times a day and
they've got this continual deploy
process that's constantly building
things as their developers check in
little tiny changes into their
production branch and we talked about
reengagement that's because you've got
things like push notifications that
allow you to drive interactions directly
from the platform without the user even
being on your website and in the future
I can foresee things like geofencing and
you know that whole Minority Report
experience where you walk in the store
and it says hey welcome mr. Smith would
you like to look at some jeans hey we
can do that through things like service
workers in the near future because we're
already looking at things like
geofencing capabilities and if you're
not from here with geofencing that's
what she saw in Minority Report when he
walked into the gap and we're on the
cusp of making that real with the web so
at this point you're like man Chris
these progressive web apps this is the
path we need to go on this is totally
right for us it's totally right for
everybody right but the reality is what
platforms and browsers support
progressive web applications and I've
got great news there basically all of
them are excited about progressive Web
Apps chrome obviously is the lead
champion because they're the team that
coined the term progressive web apps
they're the ones that started crafting
the serviceworker specification and
they're obviously the first one to
implement a lot of these features but
opera and Firefox are right alongside of
them the Microsoft edge team has
supported and promoted the concept of a
hosted web app since Windows 10 was
released which is now over two years ago
and basically a hosted web app is a
progressive web app without the
serviceworker and then you've been able
to submit those to the Microsoft Store
for a long time in fact a lot of very
popular apps in the Microsoft Store our
hosted web apps which basically means
they're progressive web apps for the
most part and another one is Samsung
Samsung is one of the most popular
devices today the galaxy and Note series
are some of the best-selling mobile
phones out there and over the last
couple of years they have developed a
fantastic browser called Samsung
internet and it has supported
progressive web apps as well now each
one of these platforms implements things
like the Add to Home screen experience
slightly different and that's okay yeah
and that's also good because we get a
little variety of kind of what we're
it's best out there but for the most
part they all support that now at the
moment Microsoft edge has not shipped
public support for service workers but
they have shipped it in their insider
preview so hopefully by the release of I
think it's red stone 4 is what it's
called basically this the spring 2018
release which could turn into the Summer
2018 release there's no guarantee what
day it's gonna ship now the average
Windows user will have serviceworker
support on there in through Microsoft
edge which gives you basically
everything on Windows will support pull
progressive web app capabilities at that
point but this leads to the big question
what about Apple and what about
progressive web apps on iOS the good
news is many of the features can be
polyfilled and honestly I've been doing
this since about 2010 when I first
started having to build mobile first web
experiences I learned really quickly
that I had to adjust the architecture of
building my websites and the good news
is that architecture I chose and crafted
is basically a progressive web
application I found ways to cache and
persist my assets and content and data
offline using local storage at the time
and those patterns still work and I was
using appcache at the time and that
still works
now progressive web apps because they're
progressive still work on iOS and
they're gonna perform better on iOS than
a traditional website and that's because
you have implemented web development
best practices but the best news and the
best signal we have is that Apple has
started development on serviceworkers we
don't know when they're gonna land
they're never public with what they're
doing necessarily but for this one they
did actually tweet out some stuff they
let us know that they're actually
working on it and they triggered they
tripped the actively working on it bit
on their Status page of features so we
know that Apple is actually implementing
serviceworkers we have no clue if
they're going to adopt the add to
homescreen capabilities or not but
knowing that they'll support service
workers is 90 percent of that battle
anyway which means in the near future
we're gonna have ubiquitous
serviceworker support across all the
platforms which is
so awesome now here's some stats if you
don't believe me the Aliexpress which is
a major econ ecommerce retailing
platform similar to Amazon saw an 82%
increase in iOS conversions after
changing to progressive web app and
that's because their experience just
worked better the Washington Post
hasn't has seen a near five times
increase in user engagement that means
that people are actually reading The
Washington Post five times more than
they were before became a progressive
web application in fact let's compare
the difference between the progressive
web app Washington Post and the regular
Washington Post you're looking at under
a second on average versus three point
three seconds is what they clocked is
the average load time now I'll be honest
I seriously doubt they were getting
three point three seconds I believe is
probably worse because there's no new
site that loads that fast even on
desktop because they're so polluted with
so many third-party scripts but because
they followed better web development
practices and they were able to clean up
their load time to under a second but
they're not the only one forbes.com
The Weather Channel and now Twitter and
many other thousands of companies are
experiencing similar numbers and
interactions of customer engagement
increasing because they've adopted
progressive web applications and if
you're wondering about actual users this
graphic comes from an infographic the
chrome team released about three years
ago where they said that they had 1
billion active users a month here's the
reality
that's old today you're looking at over
2.5 billion users use browsers that
support progressive web apps and then
once edged ship service worker support
we're going to top 3 billion active
daily users would that have progressive
about support in their hands or their
desktops so this is great news that
means we've got a massive market to
serve with progressive web applications
so now we've established that we've got
great browser enthusiasts
behind progressive web apps and we've
got a massive potential user base of
progressive Web Apps and I've already
mentioned some great wins for
progressive web apps that have been
reported from companies let's go look at
a few of those companies and what
they've been reporting in some of the
case studies around progressive web
applications and most notably one of the
first things that the chrome team loves
to point out is Flipkart if you're not
familiar with Flipkart this is like
amazon in india so they've got different
challenges than amazon does have has
here in the Western world they've got a
lot of users that are on poor cellular
services and on lower powered mobile
devices and a native application it just
really wasn't working well for them
because there's just not enough power in
space on those devices much less the
cellular connectivity so what they did
was they decided to adopt a progressive
web application approach and they saw
fantastic returns and they're one of the
first adopters of progressive web
applications so this tells you even when
progressive web apps we're not really
truly fleshed out yet
Flipkart was able to take advantage and
turn that into a massive positive win
and so they've reported and these stats
are a little bit old at this point I
think
but they've started seeing three times
more time spent on their site by
customers and whenever you got people
spending more and more time on your site
the more likely they are to convert to
actually paying customers and that's a
good thing they also saw a 40% higher
re-engagement statistics and if you're
not familiar with how sales funnels and
stuff reengagement is very key to
driving actual sales because the more
times people come to your site the more
likely they are to purchase from you and
then like we see here
they had a 70% greater conversion from
the home screen so when people add that
icon to the home screen
they're much more likely to buy from you
or convert however you need them to
convert but here's another big stat that
I'd love to see three times lower data
usage that means they had a third of the
actual band
with needs that they had before that is
huge
most native applications and websites
use way more bandwidth than they
actually need to make their experience
work so one of the things that they did
that I really like is they created a
great onboarding experience to kind of
guide their customers through the
progressive web application experience
and that ultimately leads to a higher
add to homescreen rate so if you know
what a essentially an onboarding
processes they've done a good job with
that and there's resources out there to
kind of show you what they've done with
their own boarding experience and I
encourage you to go out there and
investigate that more and just for an
example when you first get to the
Flipkart site they've got a little thing
to actually drive the Add to Home screen
experience they've got a little button
up there and as you go through it
they'll even show you how to add they
walk you through the Add to Home screen
experience so that you know exactly how
to do it manually even if the browser
hasn't prompted you yet to add it to the
home screen now another great example is
Alibaba another Asian based company
again a major online e-commerce retailer
and so they wanted to obviously increase
sales and attract more potential
customers and that's exactly what they
did they saw a 76 percent increase in
conversions and an increase in active
monthly users but look at this they
added 14 percent more iOS users which I
think in China is a huge deal because
iPhones are a lot more expensive per
capita there than they are here and I
think they're whew they're rare to find
as well but they also saw a 30 percent
increase in customers and engagements or
whatever their metrics are on Android so
both platforms saw a major increase in
customer engagements now another Indian
company is housing comm and this is sort
of like Airbnb in hotels calm or
priceline.com kind of merged together
and basically they're a real estate
company maybe they're more like a Zillow
or something I'm not totally sure but
anyway they wanted to acquire better
more users and enhance their website
quality by adopting a progressive web
app and what they reported is again an
increase in conversions fewer people
leaving the site on what we call a
bounce rate and the longer average
session which means again spending more
time on the site but one of the things
they note they reported it's really
positive a 30% faster little page load
that's a very key thing to so if you're
not sold on progressive web apps yet as
a the path you need to take I'm not
totally sure what it's gonna take to get
you there but progressive web apps are
changing the way we look at the web and
everybody who has been adopting
progressive web apps and putting them in
production had been reporting great
returns now that doesn't mean that
everything about progressive Web Apps is
super easy to do there are three key
technical requirements the first is
upgrading to be HTTPS and there's a lot
more to it than just installing an SSL
certificate you also need a good valid
web manifest file with those icons that
I mentioned earlier and you need to have
a serviceworker that handles the fetch
event to offer offline caching
capabilities and this is where things
can get super complex really quick and
this is why I have created the
progressive web application for beginner
to expert course again visit PWA course
comm right now there's about 20 hours of
online training available to you and I'm
only adding more and more every week so

take the points directly from here and
build your own rapport and if you need a
little help I've got a little book
