internet domain name services company
and you're wondering what you should do
well in this video I'm going to talk to
you about who they are what they're
trying to do and probably the best
action you should take hey guys Chris
love the owner of love to death and
today I'm gonna talk to you about
something that business owners need to
be aware of that I have helped many out
with over the years and that is domain
registration scams in particular in this
video I'm gonna talk about the company
called Internet domain name services
company or ID ns I'm gonna bring them
out in particular because if you're like
me you've been receiving letters from
them well maybe one letter depends on
how many domains you have but you see I
have several dozen domains that I own
personally but also managed domains for
some of my customers and without fail
usually a few times a year I get an
email or a phone call from one of those
clients asking me what is this bill I
thought I was paying you well you see
the IDNs sends out invoices fake bills
if you will to people who have domains
that are coming up for renewal and what
they're trying to do is get you to pay
them for your domain registration and at
the same time transfer your domain
registration from the company you
currently use to them now ethically this
is a super dark gray area it's not
illegal but it's kind of shady at best
okay and this is not anything new I've
seen these kind of scams over the years
for example 15 to 20 years ago I can't
remember the company's name but they had
an office on the Canada and the United
States side of Niagara Falls
that way they could try to scam people
out of
domains on both sides of the border now
what does IDNs actually do well it's
sort of like when the power gets
deregulated the electricity or the or
your other utilities and all these kind
of third party companies pop up that
effectively resell the real providers
services and often what happens is they
promise you savings but in reality they
want to charging you much more than
you're paying before now IDNs is
essentially upfront that they're gonna
charge you more than you would be paying
anyway their rate for one-year domain
registration is $45 for a.com now I
don't know about you but I know what the
wholesale cost is for different domains
and that's because I register a lot of
domains and I have registered a lot of
domains over the years for myself and
for my customers and basically I act as
a management company or management
service or concierge if you will for my
customers to manage their domains now
personally I do this
more or less as a favor because I don't
charge more than what it really cost at
a wholesale level in fact it's really
negligible if you think about it but for
me it's more important that my customers
domains are managed in a proper way it
was more two domains than just the
registration there's also DNS and other
factors that play into it now don't just
have open domain registration for a
reason and that's because it's kind of
the wild wild west right now and that's
sort of because it did get deregulated
which I do love deregulation in general
but what you have to be careful for is
scammers a lot of times you'll see
companies that offer really cheap domain
registration rates for the first year
for example it's not uncommon to see
domain registration for 399 or $4.99 a
year that company's selling it to you at
a loss for com the wholesale cost is
roughly between eleven and twelve
dollars now that's varied a little bit
over recent years
a few years back it was basically eight
to ten dollars but each of the top-level
domains has actually increased their
wholesale pricing but that shouldn't be
of a concern to you now to give you an
idea to my customers I charge fifteen
dollars a year for domain registration
now it cost me just under twelve dollars
to actually do that registration so you
can see I'm not personally really
pocketing much money in fact when you
consider how much time it takes for me
to go through fill out the forms and
deal with all the other stuff that goes
along with it
it's really a loss leader for me like I
said it's more of a courtesy so what
about those companies that charge $3.99
and $4.99 a year
well usually year two hits and it's
thirty five to fifty dollars a year now
idns offers discount rates if you do
multiple years but again drastically
over the going rate now you can register
a domain for up to ten years at a time
and I've had some very smart customers
go ahead and do that
in fact I noticed on my domain
management system the other day that
I've got a couple of customers that have
domains coming up for renewal that were
registered a decade ago and they haven't
had to touch them since so what is
domain registration well first domain
names are a way for us to address places
on the internet without having to use
the IP address system after not familiar
with IP addresses their numbers their
blocks of 255 so it would be something
like 255 255 255 255 I think about
running an app or something like that
not gonna happen
much harder to memorize and phone
numbers are the other side of it too is
we can place multiple in destinations or
domains on a single IP address that
makes the internet very flexible and
scalable so there's a lot of advantages
to it but we have to have a system in
place to manage them so with the route
there are what we call top-level domains
like com net dot org
there's a lot of country specific
domains like dot uk' and dot CA for
United Kingdom and Canada but it doesn't
end there in the last few years we've
also got a lot of keywords for topic
specific domain extensions out there and
I won't even bother with those I also
don't see very many people registering
them now the price of each one of these
top-level domains varies based on who
really owns that particular top-level
domain now there's usually not a
business that owns that per se it's
usually an organization or a country
management infrastructure or something
like that like a government or a
governmental type of body for the most
part so I've seen some of these country
top-level domain registrations cost
several hundred dollars a year for
example I think dot IO is roughly
seventy to eighty dollars a year it's
one of the reasons why you don't see me
using dot IO even though it's kind of a
chic thing to do right now now these
companies that do offer these discount
rates they have they have kind of a lost
leader agenda there so be careful
they're gonna try to upsell you on
additional services that you may or may
not need and oftentimes they're at much
higher rates than what you could get on
the open market as well and I'm not
gonna go into that because I want to
focus on idns for the most part in this
video so again what they're really
trying to do is get you to transfer
transfer your domain from your current
registrar or provider for domain
registration to them now domains are
registered one year at a time but like I
said you could actually do that for up
to ten years and the way I like to put
it is if you could renew your car's
license plate for up to ten years and
not have to worry about your car
registration it might be a good idea to
do that because honestly I hate dealing
with paperwork and if you think your
site's gonna be around for a decade
investing 150 to 200 dollars right now
so you don't have to worry about in the
future might be a good idea to and also
like I said the price of that
registration is slowly creeping up so
maybe that's a good time to lock in that
price right now now who is idns well who
the heck really knows is probably some
ie out there who's effectively reselling
other people's services that's him
honestly what I do and I'm not front
with it about my customers I am NOT a
domain registrar a reg domain registrar
has to go through a certain verification
process and there is a steep amount of
capital in it that reported to meet the
requirements
trust me I looked into it about 15 years
ago when the system opened up for
registrar's beyond just network
solutions and my calculation back then
was it was gonna cost me a cool two
hundred thousand dollars or more just to
meet the requirements and get up and
running so it's a lot easier for me to
use another system that allows me to
effectively almost white label it if not
white label or private label that
service and they are the actual
registrar I'm just the person selling
the business at a wholesale cost so most
likely it's just a one or two people
operation that doesn't have a real
physical place to live or operate out of
not that there's anything wrong with
that I work out of my house
and I don't have a problem with that but
if you look at the address in Jersey
City New Jersey and you go visit it on
Google Maps
what do you see a UPS Store now there
are legitimate home based businesses
that do use places like a UPS Store as
their business mailing address I've used
peel boxes for a while just to keep my
personal address out of the mix and
that's not necessarily the worst thing
in the world to do but when you see it
with something like this you pretty much
know it's a scam now these guys all they
have to do is go to their p.o box there
and get the checks in the mail each day
now they've also got a website set up
and if you notice it's not com
it's a dot AC which is one of those kind
of outlandish kind of places to go do
this at and it's probably because
there's some sort of legal shield in
front of them that's another smell that
you might want to pay attention to right
there so what should you do if you get a
letter from my DNS
well you're getting it because your
domain is coming up for renewal so renew
your domain but throw the IDNs letter in
the trash talk to whoever manages your
domain that could be you it could be
somebody like me who manages your
website or web services for you make
sure that they know it's time to renew
the domain and to go ahead and do it now
if you're getting charged more than 30
or 40 dollars a year to do it
I would try to negotiate or switch
services like I said from my customers I
charge fifteen dollars a year for this
and that's 4.com now if you wanted to
register one of those more expensive
domains then I'll definitely raise the
fee to reflect that because I got to pay
for the actual wholesale cost and so
that's obviously part of it so make sure
your domains registered throw the I DNS
letter in the trash forget about it but
let it serve as a notice that you
definitely need to get your domain
renewed and at the same time you're
probably getting some sort of notices
via email from your actual registrar
reminding you it's time to renew your
domain and I can't emphasize enough
renew your domain and check it at least
once a year make sure all your contact
information is up-to-date
I've had several customers over the year
despite automated emails coming from my
system and me physically picking up the
phone and calling them did not renew
their domain in their site went offline
of the day that it goes past that
registration date now don't fear if you
did miss it you can renew the domain and
get it back up and going usually it
takes about 12 to 24 hours for that
process to happen but you've got some
damage there especially if you've got a
business critical presence on the web so
again make sure your domains are
registered and if possible register for
multiple years as much as you can afford
to do to be honest with you now if
you've got any questions about domain
registration or domain names in general
