to dev and today I'm gonna do something
a little different don't just come out
for this but if you were fortunate
enough to watch some of the videos from
the Microsoft edge some of it a couple
of weeks ago maybe you've come across
the progressive web app talk biorhythm
and that's who I have with me today and
so we're gonna talk about progressive
web apps and making the web into an
application experience and now can you
tell us essentially who you are
Microsoft what's your title and role and
responsibilities is sure Chris I'm my
name is Krupa and I've been I'm a
program manager at Microsoft in the web
platform team I started about eight or
nine years ago it's hard to keep track
these days and I've always been
interesting web development so my work
has always been around kind of this
intersection between developer tools and
web developers trying to build stuff for
the web and said welcome to the studio
for many years I ran to Chris you know
for the very first time I was doing WPF
development at that moment and then I
you know when Windows 8 started doing
development for you know making web
technologies a native platform I
switched over to working on web tooling
and then ultimately I'd joined the edge
team as a program manager on progressive
web apps which is really a culmination
of how do you build how these web
technologies to build a good experience
that works across a variety of devices
and tends to kind of you know encroach
upon the turf that native apps have
traditionally traditionally held onto I
liked it you you talk about it
encroaching on native apps and that's
one of the main themes we have about our
own progressive web apps now in your
presentation at the event you talked
about
I'll make the web native is I think a
good theme for some of the things you
were emphasizing there and you talked
about not only say the progressive web
apps story that I think the those of us
who have been in the PWA space for a
little while kind of cage it or boxing
it with them removed that progressive
web app box but you also talked about in
terms of a uwp a store application and
then you also went into even talking
about electron and so I thought maybe
you give us a recap
of the the topics they're the concepts
you were talking about in the session as
well yeah absolutely so one of the
things I wonder really focus on was we
tend to talk about web development in
terms of technologies and dev tools and
the works of our developers but if you
look at every other point of view from a
user's point of view because again one
thing I mentioned is that you certainly
care how your app is built they just
want your app to work they want to be
fast they wanted to be discoverable just
wanted to do what they want you know
what it does they don't really care if
it's built in java.net objective-c or
even the technologies there's one a good
experience so take that particular angle
is how can we reconcile users high
expectations based on just a quality of
app to see today with also web
developers and the familiarity they had
with web technologies and how much they
want to stay in that in another
ecosystem and so the approach I took was
really let's look at how people are
building apps especially within
Microsoft as we are facing this exact
same issue of we have a lot of web code
and we also are present so many native
devices and we want to see how can we
maintain one code base and so provide a
really deep rich experience on all those
various devices that we are very present
in like your Android devices your iOS
devices windows as well as on Mac OS and
so the approach I talked about in the
talk is how you can have a progressive
web app a really rich really performant
web experience that that's really the
best that can on whatever device it is
on and then reusing the bulk of that
content and enhancing it with native
hooks depending on which technology are
choosing so one things I talked about is
Cordova is a really popular solution for
mobile devices electron is a great
solution for for desktop for especially
down level Windows and Mac OS and then
they're hosted web app platform for you
to VPN Windows 10 it's a great solution
for being able to access winner KPIs and
be able to target deeper device
capabilities on a Windows device we also
be using your web code almost entirely
so there is I guess I'm trying to think
there was something here that I wrote
down my niblets is back through this
well let me actually let me ask you a
question maybe I don't know if you know
the answer now I've looked at estimates
and it's there I just say the numbers
that I want to talk about more very
still it's been like three years that's
a pretty anybody like publicly say that
they think
but I've heard as much as like 75 to 80%
of the apps in the Apple App Store for
example I'm about the Windows Store are
actually web apps that are compiled like
using Cordova or what the the precursor
that was back in like 2010 2012 time
frame is that number still holding true
roughly or you know I haven't checked in
quite some time as well but I do know a
lot of us on lot of the app stores are
based on web technologies and even
popular what's gonna be using a regular
basis you are built entirely on that and
and the thing is also Cordova is one
thing that a lot of people been using
but the other newcomer that I think is
getting a lot of traction react native a
lot of people are building apps and
react and then being able to react
native because one of you could react
native it you really cool is that you
can still use JavaScript for your logic
and writing JSX you know the xml like
markup language HTML like but not quite
in some areas but it gives you Native
community of UI components on always
devices you're targeting so you're still
right it looks like okay but what gets
generated isn't web complete a web of
elements and primitives it's actually
native controls like your native slide
viewers right so okay well that's good I
mean it still holds water that still a
lot of the applications are actually
websites and disguise now I think I
don't think there's enough developers
you know and I mean that in a large
degree I would say very very few know
what a hosted web app is and this is
something y'all have made available for
several years now but I don't think a
lot of people have really leveraged this
and it's very simple to do can you talk
a little bit about the hosted web app
opportunity yeah absolutely
so hosted web app is essentially a a
version of the traditional webview
inside your native application concept
you basically point your app to a URL
and exact contents from your URL or
surfaced inside your application and
what makes the who said without model a
little bit more interesting is that you
can write in your server code some logic
that says if I'm running inside the
windows app container
I can now access this native device
capabilities and this is done without
using any redirection or indirection
like plugins in the Cordova world or
some you know background library so you
might use in some other technologies
which is actually a really nice way of
having so at any one code base and being
able to access device capabilities
without dealing with the overhead of
additional frameworks and additional
platforms that might be running in the
background at the same time now the one
thing one hosted web app system
interesting especially nowadays is that
we've been improving the unity
beautifully peak platform heavily we've
been adding API so you've been adding
functionality that people been asking us
for quite some time and one of the
things I've been adding recently is
things that make it easier for web
developers to go from having a web app
the more easily cut target more the
advanced api's that are available on the
system like cortana for example or
system tray or making your app run at
startup these are things that are
gradually coming in that make it much
more easy for you to not just have a web
app but that does a lot more with little
extra effort on your part to do well in
a Windows Device well I've got one
question about about that integration
piece that actually frustrated with so
I'm actually writing a progressive web
app book and one of the demo
applications I've been building is a
podcast application so things sorta like
stitcher okay the problem that I've had
with websites are the way the web is
treated on my Windows devices is as soon
as the lock screen comes on the audio
quits
so is this deeper integration gonna give
me the ability to keep playing those
podcast files when the lock screen comes
on absolutely no one of the things we
added is the background media API so it
worked on the Xbox and at the same exact
functionality should work on a Windows
on a desktop PC as well so once you add
that functionality and you should be
able to access your music and you know
audio even if that app is no longer the
foreground even if it is in there in the
background and we can and one of the
things that you point out in the event
and obviously didn't have a lot of time
to go into but you can do the detection
in your JavaScript code to see if you've
got access to those APRs or not by
simply testing to see of what window is
there the window object windows into the
Dom a global object called windows and
if that object exists you're obviously
running in a winner tea context and at
that point it can
vini api exists and then if it does you
can write your code just as you would in
a more packaged traditional app that you
might have been building in the past now
the other nice thing about this I don't
have to compile it using Cordova or
anything like that
the way it works is you have a website
that's served via HTTP so it's it's
secure and then you also have a valid
web manifest file and web manifest is
actually a w3 standard so that's a
common thing as well and those are the
two criteria there's not a there you
don't have to have a serviceworker to
make these work which you know leaves it
a little bit shy of the progressive web
app standard but because you've got that
this is one thing the that finally
became obvious to me we were out there
and I've been struggling with this since
I first heard of the host of web app
store I was like I'm not a big fan of
the App Store itself I think that's just
an extra set of steps that the search
engines already offer a cleaner so
especially when it comes to web but I
finally got it because I I've been doing
a lot more research on why HTTP this
summer and so I got a comment went down
that rabbit hole a lot more so I
understand that at a deeper level and
you know we had that that special day
Thursday and Jeff Bert off was kind of
going over these concepts with us and he
said something that finally made this
resonate with me so when you get an SSL
certificate essentially you're you're
announcing the world you have a level of
trust with me whether it's domain
organizational or like the enterprise
level whatever it is the top level one
you've got a level of trust than Who I
am so like when I go to the test a
personal hand on my driver's license
there's a level of trust but to get that
access to the system level api's you're
kind of taking it to the next level when
you go through that store level now
you're saying now we as Microsoft having
an extra level of trust with the
producer of this particular application
so we're going to give them access to
these you know more into maybe eyes I
like the term intimate when it comes to
that consumer interface there and so
that to me that was something that made
sense to
that point and so I really like that
message does that fit with kind of a
couple of way y'all are trying to
message this as well well absolutely you
know when you say that we burn up PWS to
be in a store large reason is trust
there's a certain amount of validation
that happens both automatically and also
manually in many cases to make sure the
app that you are installing does the
right things isn't doing things that
might make your overall you know system
is unstable or overall if a user
experience degraded and so yeah
absolutely that's gonna make things why
we we do want this you know level of
trust and verification with SSL is one
part of it being a store is one part
having a valid manifest together no
there's a bunch of things that we
basically check for that's part of your
app being there that it's a good thing
so I just have a question in my head now
lost it oh so I don't know if you I
don't know if you're Liberty to be able
to share the number of say progressive
web app or hosted web app sites that
you've identified and I guess it's like
this is like multi-layered here but it's
like one of the things you all said is
that not every site that technically is
a hosted web app are we going to allow
in the store and this is where you can
get into the issue of censorship or
something like that
as far as an apple and and everybody
else has had these kind of issues with
apps being admitted to the store one of
the things that I'm still not clear on
is what are some of the what are some
tangible areas of criteria that you're
going to use to determine if an app or a
hosted web app it actually gets added to
the App Store yeah I think Aaron
Gustafson build last year give a good
overview of a lot of these things and we
haven't changed too much of that overall
and so we're thinking to identify all
the manifests are out there and then
from there you know taking that sites
and running some sort of quality
analysis on it the two ones we're
focusing right now are really
performance user experience and actually
you can say performance is a part of
user experience as well but we just
bucket in two different categories just
for convenience right now we run all
these sites through several linting
tools the most popular ones that most of
you know your audience is familiar with
it's probably PW lighthouse we
Google creates which is a really good
job like not checking your app against
performance accessibility security you
know a variety of criteria and we also
have a tool that we you know talked
about at that summit called
called sonar and so we're running it
through both of those tools to get a
good you know approximation of what the
quality is looking and we also have a
lot of data from bing on how responsive
decide how many milliseconds it take for
a site to make the first request you
know what category is it you know does
it contain offensive content does it
contain content it would be appropriate
in certain countries but not other
countries is it a program for an
educational audience we have all these
types of material information that we
have and right now is experimenting but
what is the best combination of them to
put together to provide an experience
that that still persists a very
lightweight approach for getting these
app to the store and also providing one
that gives you the satisfaction I'm
using something that is that is you know
appropriate it is good it's fast and
it's performant and we've identified you
know this is probably you know we talked
about not about it's briefly much giving
some of these talks in in Europe earlier
this year we you know we have a you know
billions of billions of websites that
Bing is aware of and from that the ones
that have a valid manifests are
somewhere around but 1 million they're
about a 1 million websites right now
that have a valid w2c manifest which is
a strong signal that you are you know on
the path to billion PWA not Olivia
already and so from there if you look at
once that there's one thing with the
market interesting is that a lot of that
have a manifest but we look at the
actual data the other missing icons or
the icons resolve to you know I consider
like a lot of template builders for
example are putting a manifest and got a
developer actually creating the assets
that go with it so what we do also is we
make sure that the manifest contains
data that actually resolves to actual
content like a thumbnail or screenshot
and things like that
so when you add that extra layer of
verification the number goes from like
about 1 million to probably around like
you know 8,000 or so and then in this
number you know it's coming we're
constantly evaluating content changing
and the more you know us Google Mozilla
are talking about pwace the number just
keeps going up as more developers or
adding a mantha to their site so it's
just a statement in time basically and
so from this 8,000 when you run across
all the various tools like lighthouse
and sonar even though the quality we get
a good opinion of sites that are really
great really performant and good
and here's some things that are you know
could do a lot better on like
accessibility a lot better on not using
the you know the serviceworker to do a
lot of things that may be unnecessary
because constantly thing the server and
downloading content and so what our goal
really is to define the top you know the
top you know the number is seen a TBD
but find the best of those sites and
then get them into this or and you know
we're currently taking the approach up
we're gonna notify developers initially
whether piloting this program to see
what their thoughts are on it you know
we're not indexing it automatically just
yet we are having really lightweight
process where the pack is ready it's in
a store hidden I was asked my developer
to just you know give us a thumbs up
that you know this is another didn't we
will be putting out like so so you get
those are some tangible things
especially just developers because we
could run the lighthouse we can run so
are so we can see essentially what those
scores are let's say Greg yeah it's very
interesting that there's a million valid
manifest files but the matching cons for
example are missing that's that's a very
key thing like a blog post I need to to
make but one of the things think I was
concerned with is okay so if I make I
cut the rope knock off then yeah that's
probably something that might get
submitted to the store right because
it's kind of fun and whatever I'm just
using cut the rope because y'all made
the thing and I just think of a fun
little game but would a site like love
to dev which is essentially me with my
blog and my services on there I mean it
doesn't necessarily really need to be an
app but would that be something that
y'all would keep out just because it's
not like a happy kind of experience so
definitely go back and forth that I mean
Chris haven't made a good argument you
know about a few years ago on you know
what kind of sites make Santa's apps and
what kind of sites do not make some amps
but do we look at this you know the App
Store has many there are many definition
of an app store you can you know people
have a very different view of it
depending who you ask but my general
view is that an app store is nothing
more than a search engine it's just
basically search engine this happens to
return apps and the way their apps are
returned you can sort by comments into
it by rating and sort by a host of
factors and if people are searching for
let's say your blog and it happens
the AppStore they when Obrecht forcing
will install it they can optionally
choose to you know I actually do want
Christmas you know blog to be something
and see on my xbox or on my phone or on
my device not in a browser but any more
and more specialized browsing context
and especially if you've done extra work
to better integrate with the device
because they you have a katana
you know Texas speech or speech to text
you know one of those things really
actually reads things out loud if you
have that enabled for example that's a
value that you're providing to people
are selling your app that you do not
really get for you know for cheap in the
browser so I would say that if you have
a good experience and it meets all of
the criteria I'm not exactly opposed to
anything being not an app or an app no I
think it's like there's so many rules
and guidelines already on what to do and
what not to do so from a purely from a
technical point of view where you know
if your site has the right you're right
technicals from being a pedo you a
that's right user experience I think
people are searching point one install
it but that's great for me like you know
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna stop someone
from doing that okay that's that's good
now I know you also talked about I don't
know I haven't seen this directly yet I
don't know that there's necessarily
enough progressive web app sites that
are out there yet but but beings
obviously identifying those as they're
going through and doing the crawl and I
think this is this is one of the things
that from just conversations and body
language I've gotten from say the chrome
developer relations team their bit
jealous of right now and I think y'all
have also hinted at at least like shown
prototypes of possibly in the search
results even having like a special
listening type to indicate that this is
a progressive without is that still on
the roadmap is there a timeline you know
anything about that or yeah you know
actually for a very long time in Bing
have been served in a surfacing like an
app with a nice button if it actually
exists in the store so we've actually
been doing for a very long time
so really the question really is you
know we've brought our we give a special
badge it's indicate that it is a
progressive web app or not you know
they're multi ways of looking at it you
know we definitely do want to make sure
that the ranking of some of these sites
is influenced by how well it loads how
performant it is and also whether it
contains like could offline capabilities
and so on the conversation we have with
the pink team you know too early
because you know we will be having full
service worker support in RS in the next
version of our part release so we still
have a little bit of runway to to figure
these things out but we are
experimenting with many solutions and
you know my take is this as a user of
being as a certain someone searching for
things I don't think you really care if
you're if the app is a PWA or not like
you know it's a that's an implementation
detail it's like interesting to you and
I and people watching the show but to an
average consumer the app is a
progressive web app or a native app or a
hosted app all these things are not
really interesting don't leave it's very
interesting is that I have the app in
the store I'm I really click a link and
it's what if I still wanted to and so I
currently lead towards let's minimize
the you know random you know overhead up
terms and just keep it in there familiar
with you know maybe make them their top
5 or 10 results which people always
click historical click on more make
those be high quality experiences
whether it's a PWA or not I'm hoping
it'll be a PWA you know given the
generic quality criteria one enforce
across all all sites and then if there's
a happen to be an app and the store will
continue to do what we do today which is
providing easy access to it depending on
on the on whatever browser and platform
you're on well one of the things I
counter when I'm having conversations
about this is you know the search engine
optimization crowd because I pay
attention to them a lot they're very
interested in the progressive web app
story and to me what it really is is
it's just a cool term that the chrome
team seems to seems to have come up with
and I got a feeling that the saw that
came up came into being the colors of
the conversations with their search team
because I know probably the most
important factors to get you ranked now
sort of say links backlinks and stuff
like that it is overall users user
experience because that's ultimately
what these the two main search engines
were really going after they're trying
to give the best place for you to go to
answer whatever question you're looking
for and they're not shy about saying
these are the crowd these are the
technical criteria to do and really
those technical criteria are all you
know covered and encouraged by the
progressive web app story to really
do good websites and you know obviously
Google's you know getting favoritism to
those who follow amp but to me amp is
just really making a good user
experience they're just they're just
kind of telling you they're just saying
okay just do these things and we'll fix
your site for you kind of thing rather
than you just doing it naturally and
whereas progressive web app is you just
naturally in my opinion so and you know
that's that's you kept you kept the
great user experience several times in
your talk and I think that's that's the
number one message to get out about
progressive web apps is make a good user
experience and these tools like sonar
and lighthouse and things like that are
gonna be great to give us more more
tools to tangibly you know audit our you
know our product to see what we need to
fix and how we can and tweak and do
those kind of things better so anyway
let's I wanted to kind of go on to some
other thing on that topic okay so before
I guess before we move on to the next
thing one things I want to talk about
and I can't remember I don't think he
really touched on it in the presentation
but I think we did have that little side
conversation later that afternoon about
where's the right place for say forget
about versus an electron app and a store
app and stuff like that in particular
the electron application which I want if
if a lot of the people aren't
necessarily familiar with what what
we're talking about we say electron
visual studio code is an electron
application right yes yeah so and I like
the way you kind of put it if I remember
correctly the electrons story is like
really good for I would say today's
desktop scenarios but if correct me if
I'm wrong but I felt like you kind of
said over the next few years
we're hoping that'll probably phase over
to more of a progressive web app kind of
story in a way is that kind of the right
way to say that or or because you're
thinking like sounds good like Mac and
say Windows 7 where's Windows 10 world
it's kind of a burrow right now is a
gray area
to be this or could just be a
progressive web app you know kind of
thing and it comes down to obviously do
you need the how far along that path do
you need as the system hooks to do some
things like file Stewart's directly I
think I think that's really where it
comes down to is you know the web of
today is a lot different than web we
might have been accustomed to like three
or four even five years ago where we
were greatly limited in what you could
do like today the amount of capabilities
to you know your typical browser has and
being able to access Bluetooth for
example or be able to in this case and
push notifications is significantly more
powerful and so from that point of view
my hope is that as we keep evolving the
web standards for a lot of these
technologies we keep making the web you
know better at deeply integrating with
the system where you will have less of a
reliance on a lot of these third-party
solutions that are gratefully right now
but hopefully in the creepy of browsers
we were able to do more and whether we
surface it in the browser or what UI we
display I mean that's up to desta that's
a TBD you know thing the future you know
Google's in Google's really been solid
progressive web app you get a a
chromeless for a version of the browser
without any of the UI which is still
let's in the end of the day of their web
platform running and executing all dode
same exactly as it is in our world
they're hosted web apps which is really
are what the Microsoft web platform
executing and running all the code and
providing hooks into the native
capabilities and so there'll always be a
case for down below Isis because no
matter how many was you know or in
latest versions of all the browsers and
the operating systems there'll be a lot
of people in the world who are on older
versions so I think it'll be a long time
before we can say that you will never
need to use a you know Cordova react
native electron or any other solutions
out there for targeting other native
capabilities number how powerful the
browser gets because you just want to
target as many people as you can and you
would need a solution for them right so
so here's the big question I have that I
feel like there's kind of a hole okay
so when I hear you know the chrome team
talk about progressive web apps and you
can extrapolate this over to Samsung
internet and even Firefox and opera
there's that at home screen story you
know when I talk to people we're gonna
give you this app store
experience that when I asked about
what's the add to homescreen story gonna
be like no I don't really feel like I
get an answer and maybe I rephrase it
what's the add to start menu or pin to
taskbar you have a plan for that what
are you looking to do because you know
right now you you had the pin the pin
site kind of thing which was kind of
cool and even got live tiles but then it
got ripped apart with the whole edge
transition and such and I think this is
this this needs to be answered in some
form because I think developers that are
in the progressive web app world think
in that closed box of it's the house to
get the add to homescreen prompt the one
of the things I keep getting from y'all
is don't limit your your thoughts to
just what's already out there let's
let's let's think about how we could
handle this even better
maybe so do you have anything to add
ever or expand upon that you can
actually talk about at this point no
open anything but the web platform team
is that we do most of things in the open
we try well you know we're always like
vlogging and chatting but status fade it
gives us up-to-date information on
everything working on so yeah I'll
gladly you know tell you what we're
thinking about whether it happens or not
it's a different story but you know our
thing really is this because progressive
web apps will be apps in the store today
on Windows you have many areas resurface
after result we talked about being
earlier if you do Cortana search on a
Start menu for example we show results
from a system which related results that
might be on the web and it can happen to
be an app put in a relevant App Store
entry we give you that information as
well so we already many ways would
surpass a PWA if it happens to be
already installed now the question
you're going for is if I'm in the
browser in the typical entry point for
PWA is today is the browser on many
other platforms and we have the
equivalent of that that's maybe we were
trying to you know reconcile as well you
know we're working with it you know I'm
working with the edge team on what are
some solutions that make a lot of sense
because add to homescreen add to start
or do we have the term instance and
that's not one of things what I'm saying
is that you know in a future insider
build you might see some of the
experimentation we're trying to do and
get data on what makes the most sense
but for us for me personally though we
have so many entry points today that
take you to the App Store already and
whether we have it
in the browser or not I think it's a
secondary thing we just want to make
sure that if you're a user and you're
accessing website and you want to peel a
version of it then it shows up in the
right location and we're trying to
figure what the right location is you
know the browser might be a good
location for it but it might be
somewhere else as well and I'm not going
to be vague deliberately I just don't
know what the answer is yet and that's
we're just experimenting and trying
different things out so you know because
I realized let's just say there's 10
million progressive web apps this time
next summer which would be amazing right
you know but you're probably going to
have 10,000 maybe in the App Store so
what are the other you know almost
million sites gonna do to try to earn
that that engagement with the potential
customer because like I said they may or
may not even really need to be in the
App Store plus I mean I also feel that
going through the App Store adds that
extra friction to the whole process the
you know I think Google's point to
research Li where the guy showed it was
six to eight steps to install an
application and how many people fall off
at each step whereas if you just like
they're already coming to site love to
dev naturally which is a miracle but
let's just say they already come there
you know maybe one day it just pops up
and says hey why don't you just add this
to your Start menu or your taskbar or
your desktop you know kind of thing and
obviously I think you're I think you're
in a different kind of scenario than say
the Google world is because I think from
the Google perspective 80 to 95 percent
of the traffic they're dealing with
these days is on the phones whether its
iOS or Android whereas I think edges
traffic is gonna be pretty much gonna be
on the desktop I might be the only
person that uses it on the Xbox but I do
and and you know the phone story is
almost dead at this point I think - so
y'all's space is the desktop so you've
obviously got a different kind of
approach that you probably have to take
to it so that's that's what I'm getting
at - is you know there's gotta be
something we can do to kind of take it
out of the take it out the necessity of
being in the App Store to get that icon
on there - you know just to clarify on
what we're talking about like your app
being the app store and you know the
millions we finding and being and stuff
only have to deal with an automatic
indexing case where we automatically
find the apps and we index them into the
store you can always manually submit
your app to the store like there's
nothing preventing you from taking your
website and not waiting you know the
number of days or hours or weeks or
finds it and puts in a store you can
mainly submit it so if your primary goal
is to get the App Store you can do that
today
very lightweight process it's credit
marshal account provide the URL and
we'll take care of the magic for you and
one of the sites we talked about is PW
builder which just burped oft ironically
it's that it's like great in kind so you
can always use that site to basically
get a PW a then I just for the Windows
Store but also for all the other
platforms as well so it's actually a
great solution it's a really neat tool
that you know I'll show it to developers
let's go
Wow because what it does is it'll create
the it's the the app X file for the
Windows Store and it'll create it'll
compile an apk using Cordova for Android
and it'll create the whatever package it
is for Apple as well and it'll
automatically submits them to the stores
if I remember correctly or do you still
have to manually it's on the roadmap for
being able to do that but right now it
just gives you the packet or you can
download an upload and the other biggest
thing is also luckily create the
manifest and the multiple icons as well
they're using a great library that
allows you to provide one large image
and then be able to customize the icon
for the various sizes because you know
Windows has a set of icons that it
recommends iowa's has its own set
recommended icon size as sort of Android
and it's not like one or two icons it's
always like you know eight nine twenty
thirty so at the end of day it was like
a lot of icons and unless you have a
dedicated design team creating them any
help you can get is fantastic and just
to actually appear to be a builder helps
you with that so you know that's my
first point clarification is that you
know we submitted website manually Peter
be a builder is great or you can wait
for it to be automatically indexed but
the other point also is that you know
you mentioned that the apps have to go
to the App Store the thing is the App
Store just is in many ways that storing
it's a storage storage ground for all
these apps the UI we surfaced to users
doesn't have to be the full-blown apps
or experience it could be something more
in line so for example on edge you can
actually go to the new tab page
install an app directly from the from
the new tab page itself is your progress
bar and the contents for them are coming
from the App Store but
not actually seeing the full-blown after
you're not leaving the context of your
browser to be able to get there so we
can always imagine that if it turns out
and I'm pretty confident is that taking
having a link that takes the user from
the browser from whatever you why
they're currently in into the App Store
where they have to now do it please
install step and then have to go back to
where they were to pick up from where
they left off I can imagine that will be
frustrating and probably not you know
not the best work we want but there are
many solutions that you know exists
already and that things that we are
experimenting with where you can kind of
get the best of both worlds where you
get a good in line and so experience
while still maintaining an entry in the
App Store we have a central location for
reviews and ratings and being able to
see all the versions and things like
that so I think we can solve that in an
elegant way we just haven't gotten there
you know we have found the right elegant
solution yet I really like where I guess
the chrome team is going with that web
APK story and I don't think there's
enough information out there on it yet
to really you know truly define it but
the the journal gist is that Add to Home
screen experience on Chrome for Android
is going to automatically package it as
an android APK kind of silently and that
sort of sounds sort of kind of what you
were just talking about you know just
somehow notifying the user that they can
do that and maybe y'all just
automatically do something similar to
make it a Windows application at that
point the baby not turn on some of the
access to the system integration without
that app store coordination of course
there's there's all kinds of scenarios I
can I can think about at that point to
anyway so you can it's like install any
app X whenever you want now obviously we
don't want do that for consumers because
that kind of has its own set of risks
and things like that
so there are many technical levers they
can pull to make that happen but we
definitely won't be able to essentially
yeah my door - did someone just open the
doors you know but essentially there are
many ways we can do this but the
solution we are trying to go for is one
that makes it easier for non-technical
users to be able to install an app trust
that it works without having to you know
guess at what the right answer would be
yeah I think that what the chrome team
is really after is they didn't want to
they don't want to create two sets of
plumbing from there
out of use of it to manage that how we
manage the icon and how this launches in
context and I think they kind of figured
out we could just make this kind of web
APK thing and make it a native
application without going through the
store and so you kind of get a I don't
know an app store light kind of
experience I think from that you get
everything that say you love to dev
would need because I don't need
integration into platform stuff
necessarily but if there was something
that needed those platform things then
then definitely would go through the
store again it's that extra level layer
of trust kind of yeah the thing is like
the biggest thing is they know where all
of us are pretty early in our
investigation of how to deal with pwace
because this is a new frontier for a lot
of us you know we all of us have lot of
experience in the browser and how to do
lis a lot of data on what the best user
experience can be in the browser is this
whole you know crossing the gap between
the browser and your operating system
that is it's a new area and every
browser every vendor has pins to have
their own solution we're all
experimenting what I'd say we're pretty
early on in what's going on and I'd say
whatever solution that's used today may
be changing in the future may stay the
same but you know we shouldn't be too
tied up to what the state of the world
is right now I think the world in the
future will be a little different
especially we start talking about these
devices that are far more different than
the traditional mouse keyboard touch
devices we've been we've been talking
about you know that's another thing you
pointed out in your talk to the I don't
know necessarily didn't it's sort of
resonated with me a resume gave me more
when I went back and watch the video you
talked about designing one of the
criteria for designing the user
experiences it needed to be responsive
and I liked the way you did it you said
you know we all know about you know
device layouts basically but we also
really need to consider what I
classified is input and interactive
modalities and that was one thing that
when I first heard about the the pointer
event story over the touch events that
whole API was designed to you know light
up additional input modalities is
designed to think we don't necessarily
know what tomorrow's input modalities
are going to be so let's just give you a
generic thing that we can clamp on which
you know ironically is kind of what
service workers are designed to be able
to do too but you mentioned that to make
sure your experience
has accounts for those different input
modalities and I don't know if that's a
common story that y'all have on the team
or not but I thought that was very good
and I think it was you just kind of went
over it I think enough people really
resonated what we were talking about do
you have a little more to say on that or
yeah absolutely you know a big thing is
that when you look at how people using
devices today the diversity of them is
just massive and the nice thing about a
web app is that unless you're explicitly
blocking a particular type of device
type which almost nobody is your website
will work on a small screen or a big
screen that question is will look good
and will it actually function well and
so the first experience a lot of us had
with this when touch devices came out
for the first time you know we're like
oh the link area is perfect for a mouse
pointer you know precise small pointing
device but when you have a finger where
it's less precise these links are not on
working things very close together no
longer work well and hitting the wrong
link we had to start designing with
padding's and margins and start actually
thinking about this in much greater
detail and because oftentimes you have
one code base for all these various
devices you're running on it requires a
certain little extra planning and your
media queries help with that for your
detection helps with that and there are
multiple ways of being able to detect
with your on touch device or not but I'd
say it is an important enough thing that
we can no longer ignore and we should
design things in a way that is adaptive
to account for devices that are popular
today and also you know go in the future
now the other thing also worth
emphasizing is I'm currently I always
talk about you know building for the
largest addressable audience but that
actually couldn't vary depending on your
particular audience as well if you're
building a fitness app for example and
you exclusively targeting only wearable
devices at that point I'd say it's okay
to prove optimize for an experience for
a very small screen and have a more
generic experience for larger screen
devices because you know in a perfect
world we all have all the time in the
world all the skill developers in the
world or if you were to developer
yourself you have all the skills on your
own to be able to build for all these
things but in reality you have to
prioritize what to target what not to
target and and things like that so there
is a certain level of you know wiggle
room in how far you want to go but the
experience have you talked about the
summit is an ideal one where you have
something that targets all the existing
devices and it's available in a form
where you can easily adapt
too much rewriting the same work for
future devices as well yeah and I think
doing just simple things like using the
right input type goes a long way I'm
still amazed how many new sites launch
without say using the input type email
when they're asking for your email you
know or number you know those kind of
things
no not necessarily the PWA thing but it
is about user experience and I think
that's just part of the thing the push
notifications this is another area where
I haven't heard a lot from the edge team
on what this might look like and I know
that I know the first the first concern
is to just get service workers ship
which means service workers with caching
and I don't know if push notifications
are going to ship next summer and light
up when service workers light up or not
but have y'all talked about how the push
notification experience is going to look
like you know a yellow box give a great
talk on serviceworker the plan is to
have push notifications also enabled and
it's a standard it's a WT standard so
how do you implement push notification
the client side is going to be the same
and of course that was a big server side
component to push notifications as well
whether using Azure or firebase or or
AWS you have variety of solutions for
being able to set up the push
notification server for all the rails
devices you are interested in and so you
set that up as well so from a developer
point of view it would be the same as
what the push notification would be on
newc standards documentation you'll be
reading either from us or from from any
of the other you know websites that deal
with web documentation for a lot of
these things and from a user experience
point of view we'll just have it
integrate nicely with in this case a
notification center or the existing UI
is you have for dealing with
notifications because at that point a
notifications had been around for a very
long time the native world alternate
system world with no reasonin piggyback
off that functionality because there's
you know goes back to there's no point
in overloading or specializing a
notification just because it happens to
come from a serviceworker website
because to an end user they don't care
nor do they are they particularly
interested or knowledgeable about what
the difference is between a notification
that comes from from a PWA versus
something that comes from their c-sharp
app or from their Skype client for
example
actually I came across a stat and I
can't remember if it was about a one
particular site which was I think I was
reading it was round weather calm but I
think if they said in general that they
estimate daily 300 million push
notifications in progressive web apps
already and I was like you gotta be
kidding three hundred million already
that they they think they can account
for that was it was a little
overwhelming I'm like huh so I pretty
much just turned push notifications off
every application cuz I get so many
notifications yeah you know one of the
biggest things that progress about so
going for them that native apps have
always had was able to push
notifications like if you know we talked
earlier about what will it take for
progressive web apps to be the primary
tool and not rely on on a like wrapper
technologies like electron and Cordova
push notifications whereas things that
will significantly move the needle
towards a pure web app because that's
something that often was the gate note
people gated whether they're gonna build
a native app or a web app based purely
on can they reengage and engage with
their users even if their app isn't
actively running and there's a lot of
stuff there's a great website called I
think it's called PW stats and they
actually collect a lot of information
you know from business point of view
from various sources from from research
studies from when or where is conference
and so on that connect lot of stats on
how people are benefiting from PW A's
and one of the theme you'll always see
is that everyone especially you know
shopping sites and e-commerce sites they
love push notifications because it
allows users to go back if they forgot
to make a purchase or complete a
checkout flow to complete successfully
complete it so it's actually a real
business sense that push notifications
are able to be or are solving that go
beyond just a pure technical cool you
know get notification for as well so
speaking of the store thing I well
actually you could go back I know when I
first started doing mobile first web
applications and I was really trying to
sell businesses on not doing a native
application because I could do it as a
web application I had several clients
choose to go to Android in particular
they want to go to I o s at that point
but the thing that they gated on there
was two things that they were getting on
they were getting them kind of do push
and the other one was access to the
camera and since then there's ways that
you can access the camera it's not the
sometimes it's not this the slickest
solution but I think you've got the
ability to push that thing up so you can
get to that native integration and that
kind of segues into something else I
wanted to kind of talk to his releases
some of y'all about maybe is what are
some of the what are some common
scenarios of deep device integration you
mentioned like Cortana for example the
you know now and I often think you know
let's list because I used to do machine
interface type stuff like plant
automation things is what a different I
first got out of college so I did PLC
programming and and you know things like
that on plant floor and so a lot of
times I'll think about you know in terms
of building those SCADA interfaces to
the actual manufacturing process and
getting that that imp that input back
the you know back then it was serial
ports and and you know things like that
are special cards proprietary kind of
information coming in that way and so
that to me that's that's one scenario I
think another common way to paralyze
that is like see medical devices be able
to get real-time data off that can you
think of some other common scenarios
that some of your customers are talking
about that having that platform
integration is going to be very helpful
for them absolutely you know for this is
that for everything can do you know
generically in the browser there's
always a little bit more you want to do
an often that little extra more happens
to have a native component to it you
know it name any particular API there's
you know like and a lot in the browser
and like for example a great example is
encryption you know you have much richer
you know faster encryption libraries
that the native system you know ships
with that is something that you can do
in the browser but you are much better
off deferring to to your file system or
to your operating system and I kind of
gave the next one into the file system
you know being able to encrypt your
storage being able to access storage in
multiple areas it's you know the
security issue as well you know there's
a lot of danger and like allowing or any
website to have access to all of your
files but being able to do even more
with the false
one big area and authentications a big
piece that I mentioned also the
Microsoft team's developer Chandra who
was presenting with me at the talk
Howard as well is the way we
authenticate on a lot of the under web
tradition has always been username and
password but the way you authenticate on
a device is always very different you
use your fingerprint you use gaze you
just look at your camera like Windows
hello all these things are situations
where you want to be able to take the
best about the native device provides
and make it a familiar part
authentication flow so that way you're
not typing a username password it's
going to your phone checking it to you
are the person you know you claim to be
to education and so on
and there are many more as well either
especially to get like if you talk about
Xbox if you talk about like a an MRB RA
or situation you buy the MRP or oh
virtual reality mixed reality oh yeah
the virtual reality stuff it's one of
those things I'm like yeah it looks kind
of cool but I got so many other things I
got to worry about right now yeah like
customize hardware like you were
mentioning it go native it's like a it's
a fantastic way of being to bridge the
gap and the other solution is also we
talked about native access it doesn't
always mean just being able to call an
existing API in a deeper fashion you
might have an existing library that you
had a built in c-sharp or C++ or
something that is just a legacy
component that you want to interface
with your web code and that's another
great situation where the approach that
all of us are taking now on providing
native access will solve like for
example if Microsoft teams you know we
there's a massive you know complex media
library gives you the smooth video and
audio that we take for granted in many
ways that's built by the Skype game and
so what marks of teams does is they have
their web app that happens to call into
this native library when you install the
application in Windows and also on any
desktop that is something you couldn't
just do purely by rely on the web but
you can by relying on this this
component in built over many years by
some of the smartest people in industry
okay so yeah I mean the other the other
kind of canonical example I think about
is you don't have them up there but we
have
Wawa's here and it's basically a
convenience store gas station but it's
got like a really awesome deli in it
okay okay and they're super popular but
they the way you order is you go up to
little kiosk uses a little touchscreen
thing right I don't know if you have
similar places out there or not sheets
is another example of that and there's
some other ones that are trying to
implement this and just look at that and
go man this should just be a web
application but I know they've made it
all native and things like that bother
me but I wish I could just pay for it
right they they don't have the ability
to swipe the credit card with a lot of
point-of-sale things now are going to
say the iPads do that into me that's
that's a device integration to get that
gahard swipe the kind of thing so to me
I think that's a meal of the inner to
touch to that be a web code would be
like a massive opportunity were there to
disrupt what's out there you know like a
square device for example and then to be
able to just work yeah exactly
yeah I and you know I've had another
conversation with with ade we were
joking about a year or so ago I guess
he's got a boat he's like well you can't
control my boat with a web with a web
page and I'm like maybe I could could
use IOT back and forth and all that kind
of stuff but yes I think there's to me
that it's it's hardware access but and I
keep forgetting about platform user
experience access that may or may not be
there and yeah yeah and the file system
thing I just don't think about because
web developer I've just never had access
to it and I know there's been the file
API that's kind of been dangling out
there in an unfinished state in the w3c
it seems like for six or seven years now
and I guess it's never gonna go anywhere
but I think it's a lot of because of the
control of how do you get them SS to
that I think you know more and more apps
that are doing more in the browser that
they were before will see a reinvestment
a lot of these areas that we've
traditionally said may not make sense
for the browser contact I think we're
gonna start looking at it not from a
browser contact with more from an app
context and does it make for sense an
app to have permission to do all these
various things like an ideal world
though I look for the browser just you
know be something we just talk to us the
container for apps but less there was
the thing we focus on an index on is the
primary entry point for a lot of these
things
right yeah because that's that's the
thing about progressive web apps when
you when you get past that that initial
trust with the consumer of your your
experience you can give them that
experience without having to at least
have the browser chrome visible but now
I stop me if I'm going off off a little
bit too deep here but you know now there
is actually a difference between the way
chrome is launching a progressive web
app at least today and the way you're
looking at doing it
whereas Chrome's actually launching an
instance of Chrome with the the browser
Chrome hidden you know y'all are kind of
launching a kind of a different type of
instance of edge is that correct so
that's it's it's kind of taking away
that layer I think to make it a little
more efficient as am I correct in that
or is it going off the rails two teeth
you know I'd say that you know in a good
overall though what chrome is what we're
doing it's all very similar you know we
just happen to you know the same
components that we're using to display
content edge browser or the same
components are being used behind the
scenes in running the app we're a bit
you know we know if you've ever bought a
task manual see the thing called dub dub
a hoax that XE and that is really the
web app you know container were using to
run these apps in but overall though
these are all just like say the
statements and you know just how
implications done today I can imagine
that a year or two from now we'll all
convert it into a coverage common
solution where we have so maximum code
reuse with the platform web components
but how they run apps gonna be very
similar in that we use them without much
overhead of I know your bookmarks your
address bar and things like that
yeah that's me that that's that's a big
key part of it and that may be what
they're they're migrating things to in
the web apk I'm not totally sure about
that but that just seems like the the
right path to essentially get that
because I know y'all talked about you've
got essentially got two main teams when
it comes to is you've got the like the
the the developer side which I would
call the edge HTML chakra core CSS
rendering kind of stuff which is where I
would say the progressive web app team
probably sits a lot more and then you've
got with the user experience stuff which
deals with managing tabs and bookmarks
and and that experience
and so there's really kind of two sides
to the story you don't need that UI team
so to speak when it comes to the
progressive web app because you're
taking that story away and you're
letting people focus on what is the
progressive weapon up at that level
I'd say that you know the one thing to
call out is that you know we actually
work very closely with booking so it
still phase this one one web team
basically that cares about the website
exactly right but also in the manifest
the WC manifest for progressive web apps
you have to choose to specify what level
of UI you want you can have a very
minimal UI can have a standard UI you
can have a hybrid in the middle because
you know even though progressive web
apps you know the way they are right now
in the windows world tends to hide love
the browser chrome in many ways though I
don't I don't want to say this gonna be
the decision designs gonna have forever
you know I'm not gonna say immediately
but forever because there's a lot of
value in having a bookmarks a lot of
value in having a URL because the you
wanna play when the greatest things that
the web provides is like in weddings I
talked about is being share your content
very easily without having to do any
extra work so I'd say highly URL right
now might just be a just another way we
have it you know implemented it at this
particular moment ideally want to move
to a world where you do have the ability
other from the user or the developer to
specify how they would like his or her
app to be exposed it would be have a
browser chrome would have an address bar
or at some way of being able to copy the
URL very easily and then have best of
the app world as well it's really rich
integration with mudie's device
capabilities because I think we're
currently just in experimenting with
multiple extremes of what it's possible
but it will converge on to a happy
medium where if you want to have the
browser experience you'll be able to get
it if you want to have a native app
experience where you have a an app that
doesn't have in the browser
you know UI in it you'll get that as
well but if you want something in the
middle you really pick and choose
exactly what you want I think that I
think it's important to that developers
need to realize when you're going to
this progressive what about monoliths
that you do launch without any browser
chrome you're now responsible for the
back button in particular kind of
experience and I see also I've seen some
questions on Stack Overflow and journal
like I click a link and now I'm in a
browser and stuff like that and it makes
sense to me it's a little bit confusing
if you're in said that native app mode
and you click a link to an external site
it's going to long
at least the chrome story I guess right
now it's gonna launch Chrome or launch
it in Chrome as a tab the traditional
way but to me that makes sense if I was
in a native application that's what I
would do anyway but it's it's freaking
out some developers but I think there's
also some states you can get into where
it's not doing that and it depends on if
you're in standalone or you know
whatever kind of mode but another
question I've got about the web manifest
now no there's the standards data and I
misunderstood what you said when I was
there at the event and but you had that
best special setting that that was
actually in I guess the apex format or
you were creating you could you could
use the serviceworker or something like
that
is there leeway in the way the manifest
can be designed where each browser could
possibly identify some like specific
property that y'all could define that
you're looking for that maybe Chrome's
not looking for in Firefox and vice
versa and all that kind of stuff yeah I
mean you know a lot of these things
allow for vendor prefixing of things
that are specific to one particular
particular browser or not but you know
the general approach we've been taking
with edge for a very long time now is we
want to basically follow standard and
not introduce too many platforms with
civic hooks you know breathing listening
really valuable but have a conversation
with Mozilla with Google with Intel and
some of the companies that are actively
working on their web manifest back and
see if it makes sense to include that
maybe there is a required in an
attribute or maybe an optional attribute
but we currently have no plans of doing
anything that is specific to just us
that other browser vendors can ignore so
I think the last question I want to ask
is you're getting to see kind of what's
already shipping there's progressive web
apps what developers are actually
publishing publicly and you're you're
obviously doing I would you know big
data analysis I'll just call it all
right home on the results you're seen
even if it's say the 8,000 the number
that you kind of mentioned earlier so
the first thing you mentioned the what
I'm getting into is what are some common
things that developers are doing that
they maybe need to be aware of that they
could do differently or better or just
flat-out doing wrong like missing the
icons to me that was a huge thing
point out right there yeah knowing now
that I know that I'm gonna try to do a
little research and point that out to
what are maybe some other points that
you would try to tell developers they
need to be cognizant of when they're
building progressive without for their
brand I see you know for the most part I
think developers are doing the right
thing there they've always been focused
on user experience make sure it's
performant make sure it's faster make it
secure I just keep doing at it you know
one thing you touched upon earlier it's
like progressive web app is really just
a is it just a marketing term in many
ways and it's not really something that
is a specific type of application you
have it you can have an app that is
progressive across various degrees may
not be 100% at the letter of the law but
that's probably spirit of law in that it
happens to have a good user experience
and means users well it with where they
are and what they expect from your
content so doctor you'd say you can
never go wrong making your apps launch
faster in a paint the first picture
screen as quickly as they can and be
able to not surprise users by having
random pop-up they're just having it you
know just things that make you go I wish
I was a native app this Web Apps is this
possibly awful so that's where tools
like sonar and Peter V lighthouse
you're really gonna jump helping you
provide one level of validation that
you're on the right path and so I'd say
there's any specific I want you to do
you know I don't want to burden
developers you know I can mention
earlier their lives are developers
already hard as it is and I just talked
about the the number of frameworks and
build tools I'm gonna be talking about
the summit right that went back when you
and I part building websites we use like
Netscape impose your notepad added one
HTML file just double clicked it on our
desktop BAM you know up at work now you
need web pack Babel and like you know a
lot of different things which you know
or make my autumn developer workflow for
web developers which has its own set of
advantages but it definitely adds a
level of complexity that you really
don't want to want to deal with so my
goal really is to you know moving
forward is to help reduce some of this
complex phase but I'll just split more
both Laura for the again suppose just
them you know the technical of the
technical people that you meet there so
if you're gonna go for today just keep
doing you always think you know building
build it well be responsive make sure
it's adaptive is that the right thing
it's not taking up memory unnecessarily
just to normal things of being a good
citizen on the user's browser
uneasier device and the rest we will
it's up to us to figure out what's the
best way to make sure that gets into the
hands of users if you are automatically
if you're you know manually submitting
your app to this door okay well think
it's good stuff do you have any parting
words that you want to pass along or no
not at all I mean I think you know one
of the things is you guys are a lot of
fun to build because it's a lot use a
lot of technology and knowledge that you
you know tribal knowledge really that
you've been learning over the past many
years of our development if you've been
doing it for a long time and so my
general take is that just do it it's
familiar to you and this index on user
experience and that should make you
happy all righty well I really
appreciate you taking the time to talk
to me and hopefully this is going to
help people out and get more worried out
there about progressive web apps and and
thanks for all you're doing and thanks
for you know what the edge team is doing
and you know number one more anything
else I'm just so happy y'all are
enthusiastic about this concept and and
come to help push progressive web apps
forward and and just make those you know
progressive web apps a first-class
experience on Windows in particular and
I think that the or you're working at it
you know obviously I wish you could do
it faster that's the only thing I wish I
could pass along you know so but all
right well I appreciate it and thanks a
lot if they want to maybe follow you or
reach out to you what's the best way to
do that Cooter's easiest way this is my
first name Krupa ki our UPA and so it's
a it's a good mixture of progressive web
content technical content and random
animal gifts they happen to retweet
awesome and also the MS edge dev tag on
Twitter is not a place to reach the team
in general so all right well I
appreciate it and maybe we'll talk
sometime in the future when the when
maybe service workers ship next summer
we can follow up on anything that's
change between here and there
sounds like a plan all right thanks a
lot bye Chris
No maybe it's kind of stuff for me
