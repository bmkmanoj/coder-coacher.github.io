we can further extend work we did
yesterday
turning the html5 boilerplate project
into a progressive web app so that now
we pre cache all the static assets so
that your website can load instantly and
also start working offline hey guys this
is chris love here for love today and
today we're going to talk or introduce
the concept of serviceworker caching
through the concept of serviceworker
precache caching strategy now a previous
video I walked you through how to
upgrade the existing html5 boilerplate
project to be a progressive web app by
adding a web manifest file and a
serviceworker file they just had an
empty fetch event handler and I remember
the other third part if we actually
deployed it that would be required is be
served over HTTPS if you haven't watched
that video I do encourage you to go back
and watch it just to see how we set
things up now I'll be showing you again
over local host so the HTTPS part won't
be a part of this tutorial but what
we're going to do is we're going to take
the files that are referenced to compose
our page for the html5 boilerplate here
and we're going to put those in to cache
in our service worker using the install
event now I've referenced it in the
video before that you do need to
understand all the details of the
serviceworker life cycles to start
beginning to master serviceworker
development but for today's tutorial
just understand that the install event
is triggered every time a new
serviceworker is registered so that
could be the first time somebody visits
your site or any subsequent visit if
you've made a change to the actual
serviceworker code that will also
trigger the install event also be aware
that that does not necessarily mean
mean that the new Service Worker is in
control of that page and this gets into
the minutiae of the Service Worker
lifecycle so you may not necessarily see
the results of what you're looking for
immediately the trust me they're there
okay and you will see that on subsequent
loads now remember like I said we're
using localhost in this case I'm over
port 15,000 won and we've got our
boilerplate project and you can see the
chrome is prompting me to add it to the
home screen so we've still got our
minimal requirements to be a progressive
web app I was going to shrink this down
a little bit and get this out of the way
because we don't really have any real
content on this particular page of
consequence but what is important is
seeing things in our developer panel and
what I've done right now is it actually
kind of cleaned the application so that
nothing is cached and we'll go through
and we'll see how modified the code so
that we can do pre-caching now we're
going to start looking at the cache
storage part down here in the developer
tools and you can see right now there's
absolutely nothing going on I'm going to
go back over here to the serviceworker
panel you can see we've got an active
service worker that was running and if
we go to these sources you can see that
we have a serviceworker file which is
this one right here and we can actually
slip step through and debug it and
you'll notice there's a little bit more
code then we'll be finished up with
yesterday so let's go walk through that
code okay
now I'll put this in here so I could
actually clean things up before we
started running see what we would have a
fresh clean slate so the first thing we
want to look at is not these event
handlers but I've added a couple of
variables the first one is a name for
the cache that we're going to store a
pre cached assets and the great thing
about the cache API is you can create as
many caches named caches as you want and
you can control where do
requests are stored by that and this
becomes very important if you have a
more complex application okay so the
first so you can cache anything you want
in this case we're going to be pre
caching content here next is a list of
the files that we want to pre cache now
let me show you how I found these files
the first one this is an array a job
just a simple JavaScript array of
strings that reference the file and this
is going to be done either in reference
to the root of the website or a complete
URL so you can cache any assets you want
it doesn't have to be in within your
domain it can be any file that you're
referencing first I want to cache the
index.html file but notice I'm not using
index.html here and the reason is
because I want to be able to serve files
as extension with styles
so the defaults up on any web server in
this case would make the index.html file
be the default page so any reference to
whatever com for example would be that
index.html file so I'm just going to
reference it with a forward slash next
is the CSS files and we can go over here
to our HTML file and we can see where we
get those files just an important note
before I go to those we also reference
the web manifest file but you do not
want to cash that in cache because then
it may not necessarily get updated
that's a bad thing I'm also not caching
the icons you could cache those out
those icons it's not necessarily going
to add a lot of value to your
application but it might might be
something you look into what is
important is caching files like CSS
Styles font files SVG files you may be
referencing those are going to be
important to to go ahead and precache
now I'll get into how to determine what
files to precache more here in a minute
but we're going to look at the files
that are referenced by the index dot
HTML file
now these are static files here these
CSS files I'm not really going to change
too much so these are good candidates to
precache next you want to cache your
script files and notice we're going to
be caching modernizer we're also going
to be caching jQuery and we also have a
placeholder file for jQuery plugins and
then a main J's which is essentially a
placeholder file for any application or
page specific logic that you may need
now notice right here the boilerplate
project has a little fallback in case
the jQuery CDN is down that it will
reference a local version of the same
file and I won't get into the book
performance logic behind this but this
is also a good practice you might want
to pay attention to but we're going to
cache the one from the CDN because we've
got a cache locally in our serviceworker
cache it will come out of there and we
won't have to worry about the CDM being
down which identifies one of the key
components are one of the key features
that service workers offer is the
ability to work offline and control the
files in a nice granular fashion okay so
if I go back over here to this array
we've got the CSS files I'm also going
to cache the logo file that we're
showing on the page if we go back over
to our page it's because I'm rendering
out the image here is the default and I
also want to go ahead and cache that as
well and here are the four script files
that I just isolated out now normally
when you're defining the array of files
that need to be pre cached what you want
to do is you want to identify what we
call the above-the-fold files and this
is obviously going to be your websites
home page the core CSS the core
JavaScript and any court images and font
files you also may want to look at pre
caching any other top what I call
top-level files or files that may be
access kind of early into your
application or quite frequently that
also don't change a whole lot now the
rules about what how you decide what
that is are going to vary by application
and it's going to be that classic
developer answer with it depends so I
advise you to kind of play around and
experiment with what works best for your
application every application of work
done so far has a slightly different
need as far as what can and should be
pre cached so where do these files
actually get pre cached that's done in
the install event now the install event
triggers when a new serviceworker file
is registered now the serviceworker file
is the same as it's been this install
event will not get triggered so you need
to be conscious of that again this falls
into the realm of serviceworker
lifecycle and if you want to a deep dive
into serviceworker lifecycle you
definitely need to take our
serviceworker lifecycle course the what
I'm going to do here is inside of this
event handler I'm going to reference the
caches object which I think it's a
semester up there we go
and this is a globally available object
inside of your serviceworker and this
exposes the cache API to us and what you
want to do is you want to open a
specific cache up which we named up here
I'm calling a pre - cash - HBP just so
we know what it's called now if that
cache does not currently exist the open
method will create a new named cache for
you behind the scenes and it's going to
return a promise remember everything
instead of serviceworkers works using
the promise paradigm so you will need to
learn promises in order to work with
service workers now if you're not
familiar with promises a successful
return is going to give you a den
function and you can then handle the
response you're going to get a reference
to the cache object and that cache
object is going to have a method called
add all this at all takes an array of
URLs
in this case it's this knowledge is just
an array of strings that are references
to the files and it's going to store
each one of those files in the cache for
us it's going to make the fetch request
and it's going to subsequently put the
in cash for us now if any of those files
returns a 400 or 500 status code that's
going to cause the add all function to
throw an exception and anytime you have
an exception in the install event
handler it's going to cause the service
worker install to fail so you need to be
conscious of that issue now next how do
we make all this really work
well for next you're going to have to
actually do some stuff with the fetch
event handler you're going to need to
intercept all the requests and then
branch out and do some cash checking and
we're going to keep it very simple for
this tutorial first off we're going to
use the event respond with function
because we're going to put some logic in
there and this is what the event handler
is going to actually respond with I will
go into the details of that here just
know that this is how you need to do it
again we're going to call that same
cashes object but this time we're going
to call the match function and we're
going to pass in the request the request
is a member of the event object and this
is going to be the request of it it
would necessarily or normally get sent
down the wire across the network so it's
gonna have all the headers and the
request body etc like that and what's
going to happen is the cache is going to
underneath the hood when within this
match method it's going to look through
all the files that are stored in all the
named caches and see if they neither
request that our cache there match up to
the request that's currently being made
if so you're going to get a you're going
to get a copy of the cached response
which is represented by the response
variable here and then you can just
safely return that now obviously you
could branch out do all kinds of other
logic checking stuff like that that's
very balanced again our serviceworker
caching course will go into some of
those more advanced caching concepts but
if there is not a cached response what
you want to do is you just want in this
case we're just going to pass it out to
the network and so we're going to relay
this event request to a fetch call and
if you aren't familiar with the fetch
API you definitely need to learn the
fetch API
to start working with service workers
and service worker caching if you're not
familiar with FETs yet
that's just replacing traditional Ajax
of the xmlhttprequest object and it's a
much cleaner promise based API to
perform those Ajax calls we've been
making for the last 15 years or so in
this case we're just going to return it
where I can get into the nuances of
caching these dynamic requests or things
that are previously cached right now I
just want to show you how to do the pre
cache and how to take advantage of that
pre cache that's all we got to do to
make our service worker essentially
precache the entire application okay now
let's go see this in action and I'm just
going to stick here in the developer
tools because the web page isn't really
going to change or anything for us and
we can actually set a breakpoint in here
and all I'm going to do is I'm going to
reload and so you can see our fetch is
being caught right there I'm just going
to make that go and we'll go back over
here to the application again lifecycle
related stuff I want to tell it to skip
waiting if we go over here to the
console you can see installing pre cache
files and if we go here we don't see
anything yet and this comes down to the
way the life cycle stuff works and this
is where I was having problems earlier
just visualizing it I may have to close
the site and reload it which is fine
which it looks like that's what I'm
going to have to do okay so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to do that but
what I'll show you is here is the
network waterfall now if I go up here to
the top under this localhost notice how
it's being retrieved from serviceworker
now and notice how these times are
almost instantaneous it'll let me expand
this out nicely which it doesn't look
like it won't - well sort of what's up
okay you see these are seven really five
sixteen nineteen twelve
these are milliseconds that they're
responding back there's no network
traffic
going on that's because they're coming
straight from the local cache and it's
returning extremely quickly okay now
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to kill
this and we will kill that and I'm going
to go do this do we should be able to
load it back up believe this is the best
way to get the cache reference here okay
so here we go
noticing that the chrome developer tools
are not updating the way I'm wanting to
but you can see here all of our requests
that we just specified in our pre cache
have now been cached notice that there
is a response okay for everything but
the one that came from an external
domain it's there it doesn't necessarily
give us the response status code I'm not
totally sure why we don't get that here
to me it should show us okay but trust
me it's all fine so any requests for
these files are now going to come out of
cache and if we go back over to the
actual page you notice that it's loading
almost instantaneously the part that's
keeping this from this causing the text
to show kind of loading it's the
analytics fall coming from the Google
Analytics stuff and that's what's
triggering that so if I kill it reload
just knows how fast it's coming now
obviously it's coming across the
localhost bus but now it's actually
coming within the browser so there's
literally no network latency so pre
caching is a great way to make your
application feel like it's loading
instantly and obviously if you've got a
more complex application a lot more
logic you may need to put in place to
really drive the whole live experience
but you can definitely give the user a
great initial experience that instant
loading this is one of the main reasons
why Twitter has moved all their mobile
stuff to a progressive web app and have
started deprecating their native
application that's because this is way
faster and it's much easier to maintain
and deploy across different platforms
