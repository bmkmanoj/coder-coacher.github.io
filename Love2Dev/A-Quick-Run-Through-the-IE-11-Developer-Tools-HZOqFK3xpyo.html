I've recorded video for my youtube
channel and I thought I would try to
show off some of the new f12 developer
tools and internet explorer 11 and I
thought I'd have a little fun with the
site from a product s on shark tank
Wednesday night which was chasing I wish
a couple nights ago that well the person
was very interesting i'll say the least
the product I don't know but somewhat
terror website and as I'm want to I see
things that I'm like ah gotta figure out
how they do stuff well how you do that
initially will the developer tools and
any browsers are great places to start
so I thought I'd actually kind of go
through this site for the cool wazoo
product I saw the other night and just
kind of see how it works using the f12
tools because I like to kind of hack it
stuff the site it's got a lot of things
that I think need to be worked on but
what first caught my eye is it's a
single page application day comes up
love my single page application stuff so
that made me even more intrigued how the
heck does this site work well alright
let's start off with the f12 tools
something I love right click inspect
element yay finally got that and it
should pop up the f12 tools there we go
and this is the wow they're using a
paragraph tag for the navigation that is
scary okay so they have a paragraph
instead of a div for their nav did they
actually have a navigation item it's
sort of how I will go through and break
down sighs I should have a nav tag up
here but they don't so it's a little old
school on html5 using stuff you can
though it as a single page app go figure
but we can see how the styles are
applied that got some inline styles for
with auto line-height 50 and then
they've got some really ugly selectors
man
amer ever have a selector that looks
like an old AFV on that view state or
control ID tag that's like forever long
that's a that's way too big be a little
more direct with ear selectors also
makes it easier to kind of override use
the actual cascading stuff maintain but
I can see these with the you have 12
tools fairly easily now I found say I
turned off the width of a line height we
go back to that we can see that now that
is just really tiny and also note that
now that I have that element selected
I've got some lines here kinda
identifying where this element actually
is so the little ones you can see it but
this is like a light blue line it goes
on the outside of the text that kind of
shows you the boundaries of the text and
then the actual boundary the element is
this orange has nothing to do with the
background color the olin this is what
it is and then it's also got horizontal
lines here marking the top and the
bottom so you kind of see how they line
up with the rest of the stuff on the
page so that's pretty cool go back to
the tools and obviously I turn that off
dynamically I could change this so going
to you I could bang it out come on there
you go let's make it 200 pixels blink go
back now it's really wide of course if I
had these shrunk down I've got my screen
resolution pretty small for recording
purposes but this is pretty cool he
didn't have layout issues and explore
this developer tools are fantastic for
solving those issues I do a lot of
responsive design stuff now so what time
they'll have the posting our browser
just kind of gradually size it to the
you know the content box on me as I
pulling you know just the CSS and
definitely i'll make a new rule instead
of a media query to actually drive you
know how the layout works i'm just going
to keep going with this i got a trace on
all the CSS can kind of see
where it's actually getting a style for
a little easier obviously I could see
that here as well that it's kind of a
long path it's just a different way I'm
looking at how the CSS actually gets
cascaded down to it and stuff so that's
pretty cool and the computer from the
best I can tell is a see which one's
longer yeah competed competed actually
is the overall styles and those are
including the default browser settings I
think too here's a cool thing if I
wanted to say get all the styles with
left in it I could just type that filter
it that's pretty cool I'll say find
stuff really fast that's not their
entrees it's not there either because
it's just a different way they're
structured this has been around for a
while they have 12 tools most of CSS
stuff though anyway but again it's a
good way to actually see how the element
is positioned the box wise what the
shape and stuff is here's the padding
inside if it got border a margin and of
course the offset from where it actually
should be and here's something that I
think is new if that event if that has
any events down to it you'll see them
listed here we don't actually see here
where if there's any of these other
elements that look like it but you get
the idea there would be a list of
elements here as well so already let's
go look at let's go see without those
ought to turn that off the highlight
boxes over here are also turned off
which is kind of X gets it out of the
way I remember that when I'm doing
presentations I keep forgetting that and
then of course I could manually go
select a melon on the screen to now you
know I've got the normal console
experience that we're all used to seeing
we also have the ability to filter the
messages that are being you know console
dot log error it or whatever we can
filter those out and which also clear as
well down here is the actual console
think so i could do you know boron plus
two and it will spit out three obviously
but I
to do things like this 0 and that
actually gives me a markup for the last
of the current element that I'm actually
got selected up here in the Dom Explorer
and that's pretty cool but watch this
watch this dog should this would work
there we go it's the previous one and
then to see how this works getting the
actual access to that market so i can
actually see that the neat little trick
you kiddo c0 duh inner lips I believe
works yeah don't else because I got
three ends ah oh well I thought that
would work but I guess it does oh well
but at least the markets there you could
actually do some other stuff off at
chrome supports all that there's a bunch
of other things i'm not going to go
aunty there's a lot of the commands you
can drive it or conde de ie11 i don't
think they're actually part of crow
neither so here's our JavaScript
debugger a Mousehole or Kevin Mouse
issues team sense but so here's the
debugger here's the the core markup I'm
not going to do that oh here's a bad
thing around here they should not have
this tag in there well not like this
they should have IE edge not mine don't
make your side compatible something
that's outdated hello do IE edge you
don't need to chrome one thing in there
either so just do the IE edge so make
sure it's it's the most current engine
that you can possibly use you will use
an outdated engine so effectively I'm
using an outdated engine let's go see if
I can fix that but see here's the
problem alright let's go make this
actually render in the good engine let's
go see what it does like an alt tab over
so it's reloading those it's slow the
site is slow for various reasons we'll
look at those here in a second but you
can see it works just fine which is nice
they need to fix that ok ah alright back
to the debugger mean
on the back of the debugger okay here's
all the JavaScript files this is one of
the reasons why the site loads so slow
there are a ton of JavaScript files bad
site bad come to one of my web
performance optimization courses you
your site will load in a second when
you're done guaranteed but here's minify
though so let's go look at this so we've
got one of those beautiful minified
javascript files that the machine loves
but we don't it's actually of that wow
this is a very small file but that's a
go prettify it here we go blank and that
really didn't show the effect so much
let's go find another problem maybe none
of us usually sites like this have like
four versions of Java Script we can go
hit or jQuery let's go see if there is
there's a libs this is probably got
jquery and hoss is nice and long look
how big this is there we go and it's
gonna take a second there we go doesn't
completely unknown afya it actually does
structure it so it's easier to read so
you can actually set a breakpoint here
and it'll just blime one right and
that's what we want we're trying to
figure out a bug so that's a that's a
cool new feature I think its new of
course you can change Barry point you
can set conditionals on break points on
heroes just go set one another and
condition to zone and you can say 1
equal to and obviously don't ever be
true so sprite points never going to get
hit but you can specify finally Thomas
traffic and stuff like that obviously
when we're stepping through you get
normal debug functions I always feel
like the chrome dev tools are out of
whack because they're not along with
what I'm used to but you know f11 steps
into a method if 10 steps over a message
you're looking at and then that steps
out of the method which is stuffy if
you're doing normal debugging like
c-sharp you're going to get 20 we can do
word wrap makes it so you can see the
whole line that's nice I could poss
debugging I could go find stuff and file
so let's go say number
and this is nice shoes every little line
it has number on it so that's pretty
cool you can set watches you can just
quickly add a watch so you can say a go
down and it's not a variable of course
if a variable are you talking about
littles anyway let's go see define so
that is be 50 jquery oh do they aren't
using jquery good for him uh anyway you
get the idea so all right that's the
debugger you also get a calls back when
you're actually stopped at a breakpoint
I'll show you kind of what the pass it
called we call that particular point i
can add if you gotta watch that way with
some hamburger there delete all the
watches them there you go that's pretty
cool here's one of my favorite features
that's been there for a while is the
network summary you do have to turn it
on like chrome it just naturally runs
when the tools are open you do have to
actually tell it to run and here's all
the freaking files that paid floats good
lord can you believe this guy's hello
that is way too freaking much ok it does
a see 110 files sad the average of
websites holding 9 which is still fat
let's take the images out it should be
four files more or less for maybe six
plus the images and I'll probably most
these images could probably be combined
and further optimized and so forth so
again performance is number one also
find it interesting here we got kind of
like a version number here and then like
a another version another version number
I got wondering if they're kind of
stepping on each other a little bit too
much there I don't know how they
actually manage their code but that this
seems that way to me here's probably
their images let's go look at an image
a response body edit a gift but it is it
a one by one gift how about that I
picked one by one gift see when I got
don't like if I can't just filter by
types oh here we go see I want to pop up
again that's one by one only one by one
images do they need but normally you
would actually see the image here but
here you can see the request headers
there's any request body the response
headers came back and talks with the
body there's any cookies associated with
it you can be those there what file
actually kicked off the actual request
of that and then here's the timings on
the actual file now this was 304 so it
specially pretty fast if it wasn't 30
Ford then it would be able to slower if
you always want to refresh the server in
other words endure the cash political
browser cache you just turn that on and
that will do that for you if you want to
clear the bars or cash all together do
that I don't know I do that just do this
one if you want to clear the cookies for
the domain force that kind of reload
here's how you do that if you want to
clear all the stuff out of the list and
that's again all you gotta do if you
actually want to export the capture
traffic you hit that and look sport it
for you so you can bring it up later so
that's pretty cool it's all good stuff
now here's the UI responsiveness tab now
you actually have to kick off a profile
let's see what we got here let's kind of
go through the site one time there you
go and let's just open up a page Wow for
a single page app that just took about
four seconds to load that should have
taken about 50 milliseconds at most for
this content to come up again come to my
performance workshop stuff so all right
let's stop this and let's just go
through this real quick okay so here's
like a breakdown of what happened and
there's some like points they're showing
us where we navigated here there we go
I'm going to isolate down on this
particular part right here
down here is the actual digital
throughput 60 frames per second is your
typical monitors frame right and you
want to match that as much as possible
so you want to use you know CSS
animation keyframes transitions and
stuff instead of JavaScript don't do
jquery animate anymore just forget that
ever existed that's gone use the css3 to
do animations if you're going to drive
anything like single page app changing
content try to do a request animation
frame basically what that will do is it
will sync it up with the actual frame
rate of the screen so you a better
seamless flow to your content but you
know it's really nice it breaks down
what's happening by color codes to the
orange is the garbage collector coming
along the red is JavaScript the purple
is rendering just how long it took for
the styling to be applied any kind of
image decoding that need to be done you
can see that sorry for the got smaller
real estate here on the screen but you
can see all the stuff you get kind of
timings on the key you want to do here
is you know find out what's causing it
so here's a timer function it's
anonymous somewhere in here and let's
just pretty print that puppy can and
remember i'm going to stay the same may
take a little while go through there we
go and here we got a timeout and it's
actually calling a method here and
passing some variables to it obvious i
don't know what it is but that's just
getting called and let's go back to our
responsiveness thing and so you can kind
of see where sometimes being initiated
seeking maybe go address something like
a few are you say use jQuery animations
and driving an animation using
javascript instead of what you should be
doing with CSS and when you can go find
it to replace the slow javascript with
fast CSS make your application better so
again the goal here is to try to be as
close to 60 frames per second as
possible as much as you can the profiler
who it's been a lot of talent profile or
likely hunting memory leaks let's go
look and see what the memory still
print actually of I was at the profile
profile let's just what we're going to
do so different feature what I've been
looking at okay let's just go open up a
new one here if you went back to what is
it and we'll do this ditto so here's
like going through all your javascript
kind of seen how it was actually used
and this has been around a little while
to focusing the chrome tools as well
sorry guys here's a network profile what
i was thinking i was looking at let's go
look at that first off we got to kick it
off and usually it's like a heap
snapshot up front that's a lot of memory
guys they go home they're going to have
a lot of leaks in here it does take a
little while for these snapshots to get
created there's a lot of data to keep a
track of chrome to the same way just
take a little while for those to get
created notice how this is just kind of
ramping up here it kind of tells me this
application has some memory leak issues
there's probably Congress and stuff
running and it is taking a little long
so we're flattening out at this point
usually you'll see a spike when the heat
Profar does kick in that may be what was
actually happening there i'm not sure
but let's go do this let's actually go
hit something else how to use which we
already loaded so that popped in fast i
guess they're costly caching things
let's do that one too and this pin is
that heat proof shop finishes it will
kick off another one here did it it did
do okay there we go let's take another
one then we'll come back how's that well
let's do it let's look at this real
quick I colisÃ©e hate that they put this
back in here but this is so you could go
to different versions of Internet
Explorer and actually use that rendering
engine though they put five here that's
if you don't have a proper duck type in
your document you fall back to corpse
mode which as I understand is and
explore five you never want to hit that
okay honestly
you don't want to use these old engines
they're slower but I was optimized I
don't support as much stuff don't do it
the world needs to upgrade talk to your
look fight your local IT pro do the
right thing upgrade to ie11 here's other
things I don't play with these enough
yet but you can tell the profile as a
desktop or a windows phone remember how
iron explorer is designed to work only
on Windows it's designed to be the best
browser on Windows and chronically it
actually is and a lot of ways but
definitely hearing are there in this
talk you can change the user agent
string to what you want remember the
user agent string doesn't actually
identify as Internet Explorer
traditionally it actually would come
across as far as Firefox now and they're
doing that because there's so many bad
websites out there doing a huge your
agency string detection I'm going to
detect Internet Explorer business thing
with IE six or seven which is terrible
in ie11 this is not I e six or seven
it's 2013 it's not 2007 get over it
folks stop you and detection but you can
like taste in any string you wanted iPad
stuff like that I wish it did have a
full drop-down of a bunch of I think it
used to and they've changed it before we
release you can also change the
orientation but it's reporting to
landscape profile change the resolution
I don't play with these too much but
basically that's pixel densities and
stuff here's something I love though I
just actually do decent mileage EO
location stuff so they want to turn this
on or off and you know designate
different types is great too because
this helps you really debug things more
accurately several times I've built
geolocation stuff for people on working
remotely for and of course I'm here not
where they want to have the location
stuff work so if I thought if I could
actually put the false coordinates and
that's great let's go back here real
quick oh well they actually have a bug
that's really bad there's a big bug in
their app okay so we've got a big memory
footprint but one thing I want to point
out here well first it shows you how
many megabytes the actual web pages
using and then how many JavaScript
objects and stuff are actually being
used but what I really want to go
is the potential issues what's shown
here are places for memory leaks and
they got five just at the base of their
application and that's not uncommon most
of these applications are going to have
memory leaks if you use especially
third-party libraries they're notorious
for memory leaks because they weren't
designed for today's modern single page
application world which is still in its
infancy folks it's still new of course
we've collected a lot of data so it does
take a lot of time to actually get this
up if you've done this in the chrome
devtools it takes a little while for the
stuff to pop up as well but what's going
to do I like this better than chrome it
actually points out where the potential
memory leaks are right up front and puts
those at the high priority in the list
whereas chrome you have to really hunt
and you're not necessarily sure where
the problem is okay so we've got some
document fragments that are just kind of
dangling around then we've got a root
node that's a problem too and these are
identified by this little blue circle
here with the exclamation work and then
you can kind of see the object
references to this particular thing but
get this to expand up to do we don't
have too much there but you can see page
handlers gives you a way to figure out
wearing your code you're creating this
variable is just not getting released
and that's going to create the memory
leak so this case this object is a Megan
sighs I think or know a thousand
thousand bytes of kilobytes it's not
that big but still problem if we go over
here these are other problems this was
probably the bigger 1i think bigger
memory leak so here this isn't too bad
but over the course of time if this was
a lot of business happens to be a real
problem thing and it was look at this
I've got dissidents look how many object
references are being hung on to it this
is probably the culprit of if everything
else is this particular one I got
actually dig in further and eventually
probably figure out why this is being
hung on to so but it's a real quick run
through the f12 tools hoping this video
is going to be able to be hosted on
YouTube we'll see so thanks a lot hope
this helps you out
