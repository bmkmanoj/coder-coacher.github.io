Microsoft is killing the groove music
service this is the service that
originally started out with the Zune and
then migrated over to Xbox music and
then typical Microsoft fashion they
changed the name yet again because what
else with Microsoft do except change
names every few years and confuse
everybody and they wonder why they can't
build brand recognition in the consumer
space so this is just another sign that
Microsoft is completely giving up on the
consumer space speaking of that this is
actually the second thing like this that
they have killed in the last year they
don't for me personally when I say
second thing is some talk about
personally was the Xbox fitness now I've
actually been a subscriber since the
Zune came out and unfortunately it just
never really caught on I was thinking
for the fraud sense but we got the email
which if I go over here I think I've got
the email up and it talks about keeping
the music that you've actually purchased
and I haven't actually done in this yeah
but I thought I'd walk through so you
would know what to expect here I don't
know that I ever actually purchased
songs because everything's available
with a subscription but if you recall
back in the early days every month you
got ten credits I believe - technically
purchase songs every single month so I
should have a decent amount of songs
available so to do that you need to go
to my music which I've already got up
and runnin here and then they said find
the filter and this is to me ossama bad
UI because this is really tiny and it's
textual usually you see like a funnel
icon but it does that it doesn't really
matter since we're killing the
application in any way and then you
select all then you got available
offline streaming on this device and
then purchase
and this should be what's available this
is interesting because I don't think I
purchased all the actually you know I
think it did at least down here maybe
back in the day but that this is right
and this is a pressing I'll just don't
remember doing the law Rendell Lambert
let's see yeah so download so what we
can do let's see if I can you know I'll
have to go through every one of these
there's not a select all no that's
unfortunate
another bad UI decision oh and you see
down with bottom right you see a
download there don't have to right-click
so I don't have to do is I'm gonna have
to go through I'm gonna do this I'll see
these first ones here and we'll see what
that looks like I'd rather do it on the
larger screen I got it always have to
change the resolution to record these
videos anyway so this is downloading I
don't know where it's downloading it to
but it is downloading that so I should
have these songs now permanently now
they recommend switching to Spotify
which I've got really no problem with
except I am an Amazon Prime member and
they have music service that's a little
cheaper and I've already kind of been
trotted out anyway had been
contemplating migrating over to that so
anyway I will follow up with you on that
one but I just thought I'd do this like
you said you would have a visual
reference as to what to do and how to do
it to start your groove music migration
now they're gonna kill the service at
the end of the year so you've got
basically just under three months to
take it your music in order and move
over to something else so hopefully this
was helpful you like it share it with
your friends and give me any feedback
that you may have never really have any
answers for you but it's kinda sad to
see the service going but you know I
hope this will help you keep enjoying
the music you've actually acquired</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
