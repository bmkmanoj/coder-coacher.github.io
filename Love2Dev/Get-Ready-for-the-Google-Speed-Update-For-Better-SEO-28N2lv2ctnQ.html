coming in July of 2018 called the Google
speed update this is gonna affect some
of your SEO strategies in this video I'm
gonna talk to you about what it is and
what you can do to get ready hey guys
Chris love the owner of love - dev and
today I'm gonna talk to you about the
latest Google search engine ranking
update or at least the latest one
announced and that is the Google speed
update now the google webmaster team
posted on its blog recently that in July
of 2018 it's going to start implementing
page load performance more than it has
in the past in particular this Google
speed update is they're calling it is
going to affect the mobile index and if
you've been paying attention to SEO in
the last year or so Google is also
announced ahead of time that the some
time in 2018 they're gonna flip the
priorities of their two indexes now
first you may be wondering what are
these indexes well google effectively
has two search indexes one for desktop
and one for mobile but since 2015 the
vast majority of searches online that
means basically Google a little bit of
being have come from mobile devices now
we don't know the exact split on that
but I'm pretty sure it's 60% or more
probably more like 70 and getting bigger
each day and that's because things like
voice search and the fact that people
pretty much interact on the internet way
more on their phones then they do their
desktops these days so Google is making
their primary index the mobile index but
up to this point even though speed has
been a factor on desktop it hasn't been
a major factor as far as the mobile
index is concerned but according to this
update that's changing
now what they did say is that this
should only affect the absolute slowest
pages on the Internet
now that may be you they did say as well
if you've got the best absolute content
that people will actually wait for it to
load then you may not be affected by the
shrinking but I'm here to tell you
making a page go fast is not that hard
to do but unfortunately most of us get
in our own way and make this an almost
impossible task so what should you do to
get ready for this update at this point
when I'm recording this video we still
got about five months to get ready so
there's plenty of time to get things
done but you should act sooner rather
than later
and that is make sure your pages load
faster now there are several areas you
can target to improve your pages load
performance and if you paid attention to
what Google said over the past year you
may have heard that the value 19 seconds
they're saying that their analysis is
showing that it's taking an average web
page 19 seconds to load on a mobile
device
honestly that shouldn't be hard to beat
and to be blunt you've got a lot of
things going against you when it comes
to being on mobile cell your connections
are very flaky and intermittent which
means they're not reliable and here in
the US they may be fast but again
unreliable I live in a very populated
urban area or suburban area but there
are several places that I go to
frequently where I've got spotty cell
phone coverage including a couple of
Italian restaurants near me which means
I got no connectivity while I'm out
eating which probably is a good thing to
be honest with you so what can you do to
make sure that your page loads fast well
the first thing is make sure it's built
mobile first and that means making sure
that your design is built to be usable
on phones now if your web developer or
designer is not starting from a mobile
first approach and then using media
queries and their CSS to define
some design as it gets bigger then
they're not doing it correctly for you
if you're going desktop down to mobile
you've probably got issues start mobile
it helps you keep your content cleaner
and leaner which means it loads faster
next you need to isolate out two
different parts of the page load time
the first is what I call the time to
first byte this is that short amount of
time where listed should be a very short
amount of time it takes a request to
your server to get that first document
or the actual HTML page for the rest of
the page to load try to target 250
milliseconds for your average page time
to first byte anything beyond that
you've got a little bit of work to do
now I've seen many pages that that part
sometimes takes one to five seconds if
you see that kind of statistics you've
got major server-side issues and I'll
produce some other content about that if
you've got questions about it please
leave those in the comments below and I
definitely like to interact with you
but once that document loads that's
where the real work starts that 250
milliseconds should be 25% or less of
your actual page load experience and
that's because you really want to try to
get to one second and there's some
psychology behind that one second number
and at 3 seconds over half the people
that tried to visit your page have
already given up and moved on probably
to look at videos of cats most likely
well what about that actual page load
part well my number one tip is eliminate
the amount of JavaScript you're using
today far too many sites are loading way
too much JavaScript and most of that
javascript is never used and javascript
is the code or the engine that we use in
websites to actually drive what we call
front-end user experience or some of
those cool effects that we see but the
reality is most websites don't really
implement that many cool effects that
actually need javascript in fact most of
those effects should probably be really
focused on what we call CSS javascript
is what we call a blocking
and that means that the browser stops
everything it's doing is it come when it
comes to a JavaScript file and it stops
rendering anything it has to load the
file and evaluate the file and then
execute the script before can go on
there's a lot of technical reasons
behind that but in general you should
keep your JavaScript to a bare bare
minimum if you're loading more than 50
kilobytes of JavaScript most likely
you're loading way too much JavaScript
most sites these days are loading
upwards of one to two Meg's of
JavaScript and I've even seen a few
sites that are even over 10 Meg's of
JavaScript
it's outlandish guys to try to eliminate
the amount of JavaScript you're using
next minimize the amount of CSS you're
using just like JavaScript CSS can also
be a blocking process and most sites use
way less than 5% of the CSS they're
loading and there's tools that you can
put in as part of your build or
rendering process to help you minimize
or eliminate the amount of CSS that
you're loading next optimize your images
most images on the Internet are just
taken from a camera and slapped up on
the server and we're done right
absolutely not most cases those high def
video photos that we're taking on the
phone can be optimized at that size and
probably eliminate half or more of the
actual bytes without reducing the
quality of the photo next we should
create what we call an a responsive or
image array that means you should create
multiple sizes of that image targeting
different types of viewports I want to
talk about a deport I'm talking about a
mobile phone a mini tablet a tablet a
desktop and a large screen desktop and
you may want to have even more sizes
than that normally I generate 10 to 12
image sizes depending on the actual
starting size of that image and we use
something called responsive images so in
that image tag that renders out your
image you should look at adding a source
set attribute with that array reference
there now I'm gonna produce some more
content on worse
lots of images and the coming days so
make sure you subscribe to the channel
so you won't miss those now those are
some low-hanging fruit that pretty much
any site can apply to improve their
performance so that they can be ready
for the Google speed update now I don't
want you to suffer from falling search
engine ranks in fact I want you to
improve so if you get any questions
about what performance optimization
page-load improvement definitely those
in the comments section below and
definitely subscribe to the channel
because I'm gonna be producing a whole
lot more content on this and also go
check out the blog I've got lots of
resources about web performance
optimization it's been one of my
passions for over a decade now so again
in July 2018 Google will have officially
switched over to its mobile index as its
primary index and one of the key ranking
factors that they're going to emphasize
more than they have in the past is page
load experience and you need to upgrade
your website so that it loads faster
sooner rather than later
don't wait till July to make your site
load faster go ahead and get started
right now not only will you see better
search engine placement which will also
see happier and more engaged customers
because they don't have to wait on your
content to load and that ultimately
gives you the competitive advantage that
you need to succeed online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
