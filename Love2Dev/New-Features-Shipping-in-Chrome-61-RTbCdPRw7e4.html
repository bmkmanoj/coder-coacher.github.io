and in this video I want to talk to you
about a few things that just been
released in Chrome version 61
hey guys Chris love the owner of love to
dev and today we're talking about chrome
61 and some of the new features that
were released now I'm actually pretty
excited about some of these features
when I first heard the announcement I
was like oh wow hey this is awesome
so I thought I'd take take some time
make a little video and just go over a
few of the features that are being
released and tell you why I think
they're pretty important now in the
description with this video I'm going to
provide links to some of the other more
deeper resources that the chrome team
has available that way you've got some
other references to go a little bit
deeper in what I'm going to talk about
here but at the top of the stack is
JavaScript modules now I have not done
very much with JavaScript modules yet
but I totally see the value of
JavaScript modules and the core concept
there and just real quick it's the
ability for you to essentially
dynamically load module little
JavaScript files more succinctly I guess
and it's going to give you access to
more that that import the object or
import the syntax and I started using
that in serviceworkers and this is kind
of a similar type thing here is the
first time I've really seen it bubble up
to the surface into a real release
browser so it's good to see this
technique making its way through the
specification making its way through to
become common now don't know the status
and other browsers just yet because I
haven't really paid much attention to
that but I think there's going to be
very very important very popular and
this is also going to work eventually in
node so you can have a consistent coding
strategy between the two now another
reason why I think this is going to be
very key is because this can really take
advantage of the great performance boost
that you get with HTTP 2 and the way it
manages cache a lot better so that you
can use little tiny files and not have
to worry about updating one big giant
file if
make one little tiny change the little
files will work and I think this
JavaScript modules process will just
really take advantage of that HTTP 2
technique and we're gonna have to we're
have the ability to make some even
faster web experiences so that's really
awesome to hear next the payment request
API is now shipped to the desktop I
wasn't aware that it wasn't in Chrome
desktop last year they shipped it inside
of chrome on Android and this is a great
API if you're not familiar with it I
haven't really talked about it a whole
lot yeah but I've got on my roadmap so
hopefully we making some content on that
here in the near future but basically
instead of customers having to go
through the tedious notice of having to
type in their name their address and
their phone number their email their
password and their credit card payment
information because PayPal aware or
maybe they can go ahead and have that
kind of pre-configured inside the
browser ecosystem and if your site uses
can't it takes advantage of that you can
use the web payment API if the browser
supports it and just prompt them with a
nice little dialog that's really outside
your scope outside of your code and
ultimately your application gets a token
and you can go back and query the actual
payment information not necessarily get
the payment information but get the
payment transaction taken care of like
again I said there's a lot of detail to
it and I haven't really I have not
produced any content on it at this point
yet but it's definitely my roadmap
because I think this is just an awesome
thing now the main reason why this is
super awesome is this is a user
experience benefit here and I know
you've tried to type things in on the
phone and it gets just frustrating at
times right and that's what stops a lot
of people from making purchases on their
mobile device is having to go through
all the little tedious neces now I've
ordered a few things on the phone like
pizza and things like that and it's a
very tedious process I know places like
Chipotle for example have the burrito
button on the on the iWatch and the
reason why they do that is you can go
ahead and designate your favor
item on the menu and just hit the button
and they'll just go ahead and make it
you can come pick it up at the at the
restaurant and then Domino's has also
taken advantage of that by tweeting for
pizza and essentially they were trying
to take the friction out of that
purchase process and that's what this
payment request API really gets down to
addressing and just making it something
native in the browser next they have lit
up the web share API and this is another
great benefit because I see so many
sites getting slowed down because
they've got all these third-party
scripts so that they can put share
buttons on their website first that's a
terrible practice to begin with and
there's other great ways to do it but if
web share supported then you've got in
interaction directly with the native
stuff there and you can take advantage
of that without having even write any
code of your own code which is even
better next the web USB and I really
didn't write that's a be not Appy effort
that really poorly the web USB API is
gonna be supported and this one is the
one that I've liked well that's really
awesome kind of wish I had it a few
years back though now a lot of things
that may be accessible by the USB port
are kind of abstracted away through
maybe the file system or maybe the audio
infrastructure and stuff like that that
you would normally have access to but
then there's a lot of times that you can
get into where you may have an external
device and it's not something in that
particular realm where it's just like a
normal thing on the platform and one of
the things they talked about was
educational and research type stuff and
and I know exactly what they're talking
about so if you want to know a little
bit about my long ago past when I first
really even in school and once I got out
of school I got into the manufacturing
world I got into like factory automation
and Emma Mayen SCADA type stuff back in
the early 90s and even back in school we
were doing a lot of research projects
where we had external devices that were
logging data for us and so I saw a lot
of things where I in effect my graduate
research project I had a energy
monitoring equipment
that was connected to a PC via a USB
port so this would be a web USB right so
there we go so we've got USB the serial
port connection this this can allow you
to build web interfaces to connect
directly to those devices now I think
this might be a little bit too late in
some aspects because now we're getting
into the world
we're obviously Bluetooth is being used
a lot for a lot of things but IOT is
taking over the world with individual
devices and things like that and so I
think this may be just a little bit late
coming but a still very useful API and
maybe I can find something I've seen a
few demos already where they're wiring
up raspberry pies and things like that
but again you can make a Raspberry Pi an
IOT device and solve the problem a
slightly different way probable more
scalable too so there's that but then
there's some some new peat and some need
a little coding features too that you
may not be aware of and the first is the
scroll behavior and this was a very
interesting one it took me a minute to
kind of grasp what is it trying to get
at and I think the best example to think
about here is the single page site this
is where you've got one page and you've
got a menu at the top and what if you
click the menu at the top it zooms you
down to a section somewhere down below
and it's not necessarily using the
anchor and the a tab the way you think
it is it's usually there's a lot of
JavaScript involved to kind of make a
nice smooth scrolling behavior and
that's what this is gonna do natively
you won't need that javascript anymore
you can just make it a nice smooth a
natural smooth scrolling if you just set
the scroll behavior to scroll and it's
just going to automatically create a
nice what they called a easing function
for you so you get a nice kind of blue
kind of thing in there that looks good
for the user without having to write any
JavaScript code so that's an excellent
feature right there anytime you can
avoid animating with any kind of
JavaScript code and offload it to CSS
natively you've got a big win right
there next doing alpha transparency on
your CSS color's your hex code so
instead of doing
hex ffffff you can also add a CC or
something like that or nine or something
like that afterwards and that'll give
you that transparency thing so now you
don't have to do the opacity part as
well or do the funky the funky function
thing where you have that fourth
parameter where you put like a point
five or 0.6 or whatever transparency
level you want now you can just add it
in there as part of your hex code that's
pretty awesome now I got to see if
that's gonna break things and some other
browsers Safari in particular is always
been notorious about being so hyper
specific about things so I'm gonna play
with this a little bit I'm gonna get
back with you on this one and see how
well this works just in case it's not
supported by particular browser is it
going to break things so your colors
don't come through correctly that's an
important thing to understand though
that was pointed at alpha transport and
finally this visual viewport API now
again this is another interesting one
and the article will point you to use
written by Jake Archibald he starts off
did you know that there's another
viewport that you didn't know about well
yeah evidently there is so this one goes
into working with that that viewport and
this is going to get you away from
having to write some gnarly JavaScript
again so that you can essentially detect
what's actually being seen on the screen
and make some adjustments to your layout
that way and this comes in really handy
in particular around when pages are
pinched and zoomed and I have to zoom in
on pages a lot so that I can read what
the heck are y'all using these super
tiny fonts for old people can't see them
okay so I have to zoom into a lot of
pages and that breaks a lot of layouts
and I get a lot of things overlapping
the text that I'm trying to read so this
visual viewport API can really help
solve that problem I really think so
chrome 60 ones currently kind of in the
deploy path it has not updated on my
machine as I'm recording this video but
if you go get Chrome Canary and then you
can probably test out some of the things
ahead of time and then way you kind of
see what's going on so I'm pretty
excited about some of these things
dropping into the latest version of
Chrome and hopefully they get you
excited as well and if you getting
questions or comments
about these api's let me know I'm going
to try to make some content around some
of these topics over the next month or
two and hopefully share those with you
so stay tuned and let me know if there's
anything else you want me to cover you
know Chris love I love to death I'd love
for you to like and share this video and
