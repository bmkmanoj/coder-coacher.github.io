quirk in working with service workers
and thought I'd pass along what I think
the the reality is now cannot familiar
with service workers I do recommend you
go check out our course on service
workers we've got three available right
now including the intro to service
workers the service worker caching and a
service worker life cycle course and
especially in that service worker life
cycle course where we talk a little bit
about controllers as they relate to
service workers and I'm trying to post a
message which is a way to communicate
between the UI thread and the service
worker thread and I'll go into the
details of that but basically that
uncovered an issue that was a little
funny to me and I got to looking into it
and I think I figured out what the issue
is now if you look at my code here I'm
trying to access the service worker
controller here in the client-side
script this is this would be the normal
JavaScript as you used to writing and
where this is getting act accessed is
I'm going through the registration
process that you go through every single
time a page is loaded but if the service
worker is already registered and active
then the promised get it then the
promise it's going to return a reference
to the registration and that
registration is going to have a flag
called active and that will be set to
true basically this means that your
service worker is already installed and
running and should be in control of the
page that you were on and then what I'm
doing is I'm actually posting a message
back to the service worker because I'm
trying to trigger some activity to keep
my pre cached URLs up-to-date now the
problem is I was I was finding out that
the controller was null and that was
though it's like hmm why is that null
because if the service worker is active
it should have a controller because the
controller should be running things
but I figured out what the problem was
but let's look at the error first so I'm
in Chrome the latest version I'm making
sure it is anymore doesn't really matter
with the service workers because they've
been out for a while in chrome but
you'll see something like serviceworker
registered well this is serviceworker
registration failed because this is the
message that i'm sitting here in the
catch and the error message is getting
dropped because this is failing here
okay so just kind of want you to
understand the chain of messaging here
and here is the actual error type error
cannot read property post message of
null and in this case null would be
referring to the controller object so
basically what the browser's telling me
is it could actually execute that fog
that method because that method doesn't
actually exist on null because the
controller is equal to null and not the
normal controller object good glad you
got that so basically I had to do a
little troubleshooting now if you go and
look at the actual spec I think it's a
pent API here's a clue the serviceworker
controller returns null if the request
is a force refreshed
which means you hit shift refresh now
this is a hard refresh and this is built
into the serviceworker specification if
you say do a ctrl shift refresh for
example or whatever just did that hard
refresh in your browser
it's going to bypass the serviceworker
and so basically you're going to be
running without the serviceworker it's
kind of a common interesting little
quirk to the spec that you do need to be
aware of when you're developing with
service workers because a lot of times
if you're a developer you probably have
a built in habit of hitting that hard
refresh because you're trying to bypass
local cache and this a little way that
they kind of built in to allow people to
kind of break out of something that was
broken in maybe a serviceworker or in
with a developer world that's not the
reason why we also have the local host
relaxation if you will to some of the
requirements too so let's keep reading
the serviceworker objects return from
this attribute
get er represent the service work in the
same object okay but let's go back to
this this shift refresh this for shift
refresh okay
eh I was doing that a lot but B I also
remembered if I go over to the chrome
developer tools and we go over to the
application and the Service Worker
choice here notice I've got a bypass for
network and stuff like this set up I
think it might be a combination blunt
one two or both of these choices this
bypass for network and also the update
on the reload because basically I am in
developer mode this is the way I've got
my environment configured and I think so
this is why I think if I uncheck the
bypass and I just do a normal refresh
which would be just f5 there we go
that looked a little better and oh we
aren't there yet so step into it let's
see what happens this time literally I
haven't checked this out yet we do have
we do have a controller so we should be
good and if I go back over here so what
those errors are those errors or
something else completely which is good
because I'm actually in the middle of
troubleshooting some Service Worker
things as I'm adding some new
functionality to one so I believe that
is where our issue is now let's just
double check got the update let's do the
bypass on network and let's do an f5
here and see if we get the same thing
okay so I just did an f5 but I also had
the bypassed or network checked so
basically that's almost that's pretty
much mimicking the hard refresh which is
what I thought okay so if you're seeing
that error go check to see if you have
bypass for network or check your muscle
memory and see if you did a hard refresh
or not but I think that's that's where
you're going to encounter this issue and
so hopefully this will help you
troubleshoot the issue with having
something like this kind of read a
property
of the serviceworker controller that you
may be looking for most likely like in
this case the controller doesn't exist
because the service worker is not
actually in control of the page so just
keep that in mind and hopefully it will
help you from wasting time in your
valuable development cycles it's Chris
love and remember we do have several
courses on service workers available on
our academy site that's Academy love -
dev comm we'd love for you to sign up
and take the courses and course give us
lots of feedback on that as well and we
appreciate it thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
