about anything else in HTML and CSS has
always been a source of frustration but
in this video I'll show you how the text
align property works and how to use
flexbox to finally absolutely Center
elements in your page or parent elements
everybody this is Chris the owner of
love to death and in this video I want
to go over something that seems to be
very frustrating for most of us and that
is how to actually Center elements in a
webpage horizontally vertically and
absolutely in the center with a center
vertical and horizontal for some reason
this has been the bane of a lot of web
developers existence over the years so I
want to go over some principles of how
to Center things and what we're gonna do
this is a blog post that I recently
posted about this and the video will
have a link in the description below and
we're going to go over some of the core
concepts now first off I want to talk
about just aligning text and this can be
done using the text align CSS property
and then there are different values that
you can set here that will cause the
text to align differently now I have a
demo set up and this link to the github
repo for this demo code is also in the
description below but what we'll do so
I'll just choose this particular element
here and of course we don't have the
text aligned and I set on this of course
oh actually I don't know it's here in
the header that's where I put it I
believe there we go so I have
text-align:center here now if I did
justify you can see we all doesn't
really justify I guess let's
not the way I wanted it to you Shh I
guess it's because it's not big enough
but all right and yes but if I did do
you justify wait let's say we had more
text in there shall we can edit this
make that kind of big you can sort of
see how it's justified to make sure that
it fits and aligns to the sides of the
actual element let me just refresh this
to get it back and if we go and select
now put that fly the styling to the
parent wrapper element so that weak-ass
Kate down to these two header tags
that's because it just inherits down and
that's just standard HTML CSS cascading
rules now can make it line to the right
we could also do some interesting things
here if I can get the thing to cooperate
we can also do end and I believe the
restraints start and end by or thick
what I wrote in the blog post is that I
wrote it in here here we go basically it
deals with the how the language works
now there are some languages that
actually read right to left which is the
opposite of what in glitches which is
obviously my native language and so the
start and end will actually correlate to
the language instead of just by left or
justify right so it would actually
follow the language rules away if you do
have content that is multilingual
instead of using left and right you may
want to use start and end so that it
follows the the rules of the the culture
so now that's that's real quick how you
can use this to just a line text but you
could also align some child elements
using this so again using on the parent
element you could also use that to align
some
I was gonna see if we can do this let's
say 50% yeah I think like yet nope
doesn't do it I didn't think it would I
think it's because it's not
display:block I think this might fix it
nope
here we go inline block that's the trick
to that so now when I do the inline
block on that particular child element
it actually centers itself in the middle
of the available space now typically
we've used that to Center images I'm
going to show you how to send your image
with Flex box here before we finish it
up but what I want to do is I want to
kind of show you how to do a kind of
perfectly centered menu or nav bar at
the top of your page and to do that
we're gonna actually use flexbox which
is one of my favorite things in CSS
today now flex box is sort of new I
don't wear I hesitate to call it new
anymore because it's been around for I
don't know 5 it seems like five years or
so now in fact the latest version of
bootstrap uses all that's laya or all
this layout classes about the containers
and rows and stuff are all based on flex
box now rather than percentages and
stuff there's a lot of goodness behind
that because flex box was created to
make it's called a a one dimensional
layout system but honestly it's xx and Y
is what it is it for the most part but
it really was designed to do
layout now there is kind of a big
sibling or different kind of sibling for
a thing called CSS grid that's more
relatively new that actually came out of
Internet Explorer and honestly really
has its roots back in sam'l but I want
to cover that here I want to try to do
some demos on that maybe in a few weeks
I could get to get some reasonable demos
ready to go for that so just look
forward to that but I love flex box when
using flexbox for several years now it's
got ubiquitous browser supports you not
to worry about that that kind of stuff
so anyway what I've done is I've kind of
created some CSS classes to help us out
the first one being flex and then I've
gone ahead and done
I got a flex vertical Center and then
I've got a flex horizontal Center and
we're gonna look at each one of these so
first is just the Flex class that sets
the display type to flex as you saw what
it did previously was added blocked an
inline block to get the the H tags to
Center up but here are doing flex now
that means that all the layout rules are
gonna follow the Flex system and
probably if you haven't done it yet it's
gonna take a little just a little bit of
time to get used to but I think after
maybe an hour or two just playing around
with it you'll feel fairly comfortable
with it for the most part now to make
things line up in the center you just
choose the you set the align items
property and she's a sinner now this is
gonna vertically align them let's go
actually let's go down to the horizontal
look since we've been talking about
horizontal here
I made the navbar a hundred percent of
the width of the available space but I
set the justify content property on this
to Center and what that's going to do is
it's going to Center our child element
which is our list or nav list that we're
working with okay and just scroll this
down just a hair you can see how we're
applying all this stuff down the line
here so you can see that's actually
display:block display:inline-block which
is pretty standard for a menu now you
could you could actually cascade down
and make the menu thing actually use
flex etc etc but anyway I just wanted to
focus on making it centered so to do
that we did the justify text to justify
text left right center and with Flex box
we have a very similar property called
justify content and here I can Center we
can obviously Center things which is
what we chose to do I can make it
stretch which you're not gonna see too
much there we could choose
rights not giving me what I want that's
because
what's not doing that anyway all right
well you can see all the different
properties here flex I'm new to flex and
it moves it over to the end of the
available space almost going to move it
around a little bit so you can kind of
see that it does flow with that so
that's kind of a way to get a
right-aligned let's see if I choose
right just moving there why I normally
use like flex and flex start but most
time I use center to get the center
stuff in there those are the three that
I tend to spend the most time with so
anyway so that's how you can do left and
right which is horizontal positioning
and then to make it all on it vertically
on the parent element of the actual
navbar here I'm gonna line I'm gonna
choose the align items property which
controls the y-axis and here we're gonna
do Center and again we've got basically
the same choices here we could you flick
start which puts it up at the top notice
that moves it up to the top if I do end
it's going to drop it down to the bottom
if we do it right I don't think it right
shouldn't matter but yeah so we'll do
center because that's the way you like
it so that's that's how you do how you
can make something horizontally centered
and then also vertically centers so now
you can get a perfectly centered navbar
on your header now but also do we have
here okay let's go down here to our cat
with the shiny ball you know so this one
we're going to Center an image both
vertically and horizontally and this
time just picked let's see what we got
here move this down just a hair
I'll say you flex being applied of that
oh we're know what we're doing we're
doing the text-align:center trick here
that's what we're doing and because I
set the sometimes the developer tools
take away elements on me here we go
think the body nope don't have that I
thought I had it set differently that's
okay
alright so what we're doing is we're
actually going to Center this vertically
and horizontally and there's really
nothing to it more than I've got some
margin to actually kind of give it some
space there that's what it is so I've
got margin for the top and bottom five
percent and on the right it's just
automatic there and I've set the actual
width of the image example to be sixty
percent of the available view space and
I've used responsive images here so the
browser's going to automatically resize
and reload different images for us but
because I used I just went ahead and use
the text-align:center that actually
moves the image to these middle of the
available space for us here and that it
is how this particular trick works
there's really not much more to it as
you can see so basically if you look
over here to the right you see it's got
the margin for us highlighted that's
also showing up in orange as I pass over
so that's going to be the margin around
it and then we also have we don't have
any padding or anything like that but
the background of the the the image
example is kind of an office kind of
that gray color so I got the see there
at way you can see because the actual
image is in the middle here and that's
because it's not as wide as the
containing element and that's what we're
trying to do we're trying to center it
there in the middle so though so
basically we're just using the text
align property so you know that's kind
of it folks centering used to be hard
you can find all kinds of what I
consider hacky ways to do centering
and that's because in the past that was
the best we could do there especially
vertically vertical centering was a real
pain to do in the past but because
flexbox is available now you have pretty
simple control over how to lay things
out both horizontally and vertically so
you can get that absolute centering
position that you're after and of course
if you want to make things you know like
push to the right push to the left or up
and down kind of thing that's actually
very simple to do as well with Flex box
now there's a lot of other things about
Flex box and I got some plans to do some
more videos on doing some other kind of
interesting things with Flex box and of
course CSS grid so you want to make sure
that you subscribe to the channel if you
think this is helpful to help to get you
make your centering a little easier give
me a big like below if you've got any
questions or comments leave those in the
section below there's a link to the blog
post and a link to the source code on
our repo and hopefully you'll find those
helpful as well thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
