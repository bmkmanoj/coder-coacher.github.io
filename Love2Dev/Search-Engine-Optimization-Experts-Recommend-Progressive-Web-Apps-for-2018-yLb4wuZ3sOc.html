think about progressive web applications
well in this video I'm gonna review some
of the things that I read recently on
search engine journal hey guys this
Chris love the owner of love - dev and
today I want to talk to you a little bit
about search engine optimization and
progressive web applications
you see progressive web apps are all
about the user experience it's about
delivering the best experience possible
and if you know anything about search
engine optimization that's exactly what
Google wants you to do provide the best
experience possible for the end user
that I can be mean a lot of things and
there's a lot of aspects that are
technical when it comes to search engine
optimization and progressive web
applications provide a great blueprint
for you to follow to deliver the best
experience on the web possible and when
you do that Google will reward you not
because Google really wants to reward
you for your technical prowess but
because the consumers and end-users
you're trying to reach will ultimately
connect with you at a better level and
Google watches and knows what resonates
the best with the general public in
their search engine audience and because
those consumers are engaging with you
more Google will reward you with better
search engine rankings which means
you'll connect with more potential
customers and that's what we all want
so yesterday I was on search engine
journal which if you're not familiar
with search engine journal this is one
of the main website the search engine
optimization people follow and learn how
to do their craft it's sort of like
going to see sharp corner for a.net
developer and they had a like roundup
article see I know the search engine
terms guys so they had a guru roundup
article where they have 47
search engine optimization experts
predict what they think is probably most
important for 2018 or what are some of
the emerging trends in search engine
optimization and search engine marketing
for 2018 and out of those 47 at least
five point out progressive web
applications now there was one dude who
didn't think PW a.s offered any value
and he seemed to be irritated with them
he made two comments he said they don't
scale and they provide problems the
problem is he didn't say what he meant
by scale and he never defined the
problems so I'm gonna do some research
and when I find out I'm gonna give a
good reply here so you definitely want
to subscribe to find out what happens
there but the other folks were really
bullish on progressive Web Apps but this
isn't the first time that I've seen
search engine optimization thought
leaders and experts tout progressive web
applications but I thought I'd just go
over a few key points that some of these
people talked about when it came to
progressive web applications and search
engine optimization one of the first
things that I saw and I thought wow this
is great
he's like progressive web apps are still
young and offer lots of potential
opportunity here and I think he's
absolutely right
even though progressive web apps have
been a thing probably for four years the
real energy per breath behind
progressive web apps is probably less
than a year and a half old at this point
and that's because we had to kind of
wait for browsers to start shipping some
of the native functionality before it
really caught inertia but as I've talked
about many times over this doesn't mean
that you should limit yourself just to
the browsers that support service
workers and web manifests capabilities
and that's because you can polyfill a
lot of those capabilities if you know
how which is something I know how to do
but beyond that some of the other things
that were pointed out and I'm very glad
to see the message in it is resonating
with this particular crowd marketers and
that is both Apple and Microsoft are
elevating progressive web apps to
equal standing with native applications
and the reason is progressive web apps
are designed to make websites look and
feel and behave just like native
applications without all the native
application hassle like an app store but
I also saw them even acknowledge the
fact that Microsoft is accepting
progressive web apps for the Windows
Store and I even saw them at least
hinting or thinking that Android was
going to do the same thing in the Google
Play Store now I've never seen anything
official along those lines and my
friends at the chrome team have never
acknowledged that's the path so I can't
guarantee that's what's gonna happen or
even if the app stores are really gonna
stick around because the other thing
that they acknowledge which I was so
glad to see is that no one's looking for
native applications anymore despite the
fact that people keep building and
submitting new apps to app stores the
consumers just aren't there
they're just not looking for new
applications and the ability to reach
them is becoming harder and harder
whereas controlling your marketing and
managing your message and getting
traffic to your website is still hard
but it's easier than ever before and
there are great I sent past blueprints
recipes funnels these kind of things
that you can do with the web that are
practically impossible to do with native
applications and this is another reason
why I think the search engine
optimization and search engine marketing
crowd is bullish on progressive web apps
and finally just like I posted here
recently Apple is starting to push
progressive web apps albeit indirectly
and that's because they're starting to
reject more apps to the App Store and
also cleaning house of app apps that
they don't think are app like and if you
read their guidelines they clearly state
if your app really should be a website
they're gonna reject you and now if
they're going back and kind of purging
things they're probably gonna pull you
as well and this leaves you one key
option make a good progressive web app
and that's because
pretty much anything you were probably
going to do you're gonna be able to do
with a progressive web app without the
app store hassle heck if nothing else
Apple's not going to take 30% of your
pre-tax revenue that alone is enough
incentive for almost everybody to avoid
doing a native application in my opinion
and on top of that businesses are
reporting great results with progressive
web apps on iOS despite the fact that
Safari currently does not support
service workers or the web manifest in
AD homescreen process that progressive
web apps offer however you can polyfill
some of that functionality and if you
follow me long enough you'll understand
how and if you want to dive deep into
that topic I really encourage you as a
developer to enroll in my progressive
web app from beginner to expert course
where it's got about 20 hours of
developer training around progressive
web apps yeah of course we're going to
do deep dives into how to do
serviceworker caching and polyfill for
platforms like iOS and Internet Explorer
so that you can get the most out of your
effort and provide as much great
functionality to your end users as
possible so progressive web apps are
going to give you a great opportunity to
increase your search engine ranking
profile because you're going to be
offering a much better experience to
your potential customers and that means
you're gonna have higher engagement
rates even on platforms that don't
support service workers and web manifest
just yet like iOS so if you want to know
more about progressive web apps either
