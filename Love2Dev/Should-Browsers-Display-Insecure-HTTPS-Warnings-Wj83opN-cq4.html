amplifying if your site secure not just
because you have a password field on
your page is this a bug or a feature hey
guys Chris love here owner of love to
dev and today we're going to talk about
browsers and visually indicating to
users if your site is secure or not if
you have a password field earlier this
week I saw that the Mozilla team posted
their bug of the week somebody was
complaining on their bug board that they
were showing their login page and site
was insecure because they didn't have
HTTPS enabled on this particular page it
was like I said a login form which means
i had the username and password fields
there now all the browsers are getting
more aggressive in their visual cues to
end users if your site is secure not a
key part of that is implementing HTTPS
now a few weeks ago we did publish a
video on five reasons you should
implement HTTPS today and one of those
reasons is because browsers are going to
get more aggressive in showing customers
that your site is not secure so the
owner or technical lead for this website
complained to the mozilla team that they
were showing a message to the users
saying that the site was insecure and
this was causing a lot of problems for
them because their customers were
getting the feedback that they were
worried about using the website now the
person reporting the bug complained to
Firefox saying that we've got our own
security measures in place and they've
worked for years and we've never had a
problem I love the reply that the
Mozilla team made they explained the
simple technical reasons why the HTTPS
is important first of all
repeals without HTC 58 without HTTPS are
transmitted across the network or across
the internet in clear text and as they
astutely pointed out in their response
this means that anybody who might be
listening to those requests across the
network can see those passwords playing
this day and love them and this is what
a lot of hackers will do and this can
leave your system exposed the Mozilla
engineer went on to explain that just
because his website if they're if
they're login credentials passed on to
any other sites or possibly api's those
two would then be compromised as well so
not only would it compromise the site
that was being complained about but also
any site that was also relying on their
authentication scheme now the funny
thing is in this whole story is I went
and looked up the site mentioned in the
complaint and as you can see here it was
a very legitimate site because this is a
what I would call a rich card search
engine listing showing multiple pages in
the site as being highly valuable
resources on the site however when you
click on the domain you go visit the
site you can see that either they have
taken the entire site down or they had
been squatted on by somebody else
because they let the domain expire or
possibly network solutions just took the
site over so there's no telling what
what the real story is but I do think
it's a little bit ironic that this
person was complaining about their site
and their security levels now that their
site is gone and then very shortly after
the complaint about the security
flagging so again let me just resize if
your site is not implementing HTTPS you
should go and implement HTTPS as soon as
possible obviously the first step is to
get a certificate and install in your
server and then you need to audit your
website and make sure that it is fully
HTTP ready https ready excuse me
now as we mentioned in the previous
video https is not cut is not expensive
anymore and it's not very hard to
implement now other things they come in
the matter I know for the fact that most
of you have not implemented implemented
HTTPS because roughly about two and a
half percent of websites currently
support HTTPS let's make a pact and try
to flip that number over the course of
the year so that almost everybody is
supporting HTTPS we've got a safe and
secure internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
