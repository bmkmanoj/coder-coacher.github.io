web app world is forbes.com and they're
excited to roll out a brand new
experience for all mobile devices as a
progressive web app and they've already
started sharing some of the benefits
that they are seeing hey guys Chris love
owner of love - dev the progressive web
app experts and today we're sharing the
news that forbes.com is excited about
relaunching their mobile experience as a
progressive web app they said this is
part of a year-long effort to
essentially revamp their entire brand on
mobile and they're implementing two key
features progressive web apps and
accelerated mobile pages now they can
work hand-in-hand together if you're not
familiar with accelerated mobile pages
it is a new specification that Google
came out with that two years ago and
honestly we like a lot of it and we
don't like some of it and we'll talk
about that in other videos but the
progressive web aspect of the new
forbes.com should not be overlooked
according to their public statements
they are seeing benefits already in
their initial internal beta testing for
example the average web page takes
around 20 seconds to load on mobile
devices and now we did run a web page
test run of the current forbes.com
website on Nexus 5 device and as you can
see the the time to load was right
around 20 seconds their page load or
page weight was over 4 Meg's now that's
definitely bad signs for their current
mobile experience and a lot of that's
due to third-party scripts and just poor
overall web architecture being over 4
Meg's
obviously cost their potential consumer
public money to download those sites or
page
and it's definitely something you want
to avoid and as web performance
advocates love to Dev applauds them
adopting the progressive web app
approach because one of the key features
of progressive web apps is having good
performance according to their public
statements their internal testing is
showing that their new progressive web
app implementation takes about 0.8
seconds to load now you know you say wow
that's super fast and probably not
realistic to be quite honest when we
build and launch web applications 0.8
seconds is not unusual to see it comes
down to proper architecting of your
content and good infrastructure planning
now the other things that they're seen
benefits are the increased user
engagement statistics for example they
divided some of their beta testers into
two groups one called power users and
one called
casual users among their power users
they saw twice the amount of time spent
on the site and casual users they were
seeing around three times as much time
spent on the site now they also made
some other user experience changes to
the site which may figure into those
statistics it may be hard to break it
out since they're doing a vast overhaul
change to the whole experience for
example they're implementing a swappable
card interface which they're copying
from Instagram and snapchat now this is
also a good sign because when you find
good user interface metaphors like that
you might want to copy them if you see
that they are working well now one of
the things that their their public
statements have made is that the launch
of the new progressive web app marks the
culmination of a year-long
organizational transformation that
Forbes has under undergone to become a
product driven company and we've been
able to quickly iterate over this new
product to gather input and alignment
from all their stakeholders now this is
a good sign because we think that a lot
of companies need to go through a
digital transformation
and really adopt this mobile first world
progressive web apps are a great way for
you and your organization to be mobile
first now another thing that they talked
about is the fact that it progressive
Web Apps give them a big advantage is
over native apps because now people
don't have to go through the App Store
to download a rich user experience for
their mobile devices they can simply go
to Forbes comm and especially on Android
they were really excited about the
enhanced user engagement features like
the browser prompting the reader to add
the forbes.com to their home screen as
well as being able to subscribe to push
notifications this gives them an
enhanced opportunity to try to re-engage
users and turn those casual users into
power users and this will ultimately
strengthen their brand and their bottom
line
now love to dev is big advocates of
progressive web apps and we've been
building websites using the basic
concepts that compose progressive web
apps for about the past seven years so
we've got lots of experience architect
and web sites properly so that you can
get the great experiences and
enhancements the progressive web apps
offer if you want to know more about our
vision and plans with progressive web
apps visit love to dev calm /pwa and you
