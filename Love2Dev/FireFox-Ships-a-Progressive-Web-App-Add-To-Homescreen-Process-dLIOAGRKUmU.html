their developer summit and ironically
the Firefox team made an announcement
that I wanted to go over and review with
you hey guys Chris love the owner of
load two dev and what I want to do is I
want to show you how to use the Firefox
nightly to sort of get the herb to get
the new add to homescreen experience
that Mozilla is going to be adding to
Firefox this year now I've got Firefox
nightly installed on my pixel here which
is an Android device and this is going
to be in Firefox for Android there's no
indication if it's going to come to
Firefox for the desktop or not and of
course will we still got a wait to see
what's gonna happen with anything on iOS
because everything's basically Safari
there but anyway so we'll focus on
Android and Firefox but I'm gonna launch
it and as you can see I've got to love
to death here and there's this little
house icon on the top now but before I
get to that what I want to do is I want
to walk you through how to enable this
feature because this is actually hidden
behind settings now right now I don't
know how they're going to deliver this
in the final version of Firefox but you
need to go to settings which you get by
hitting a little obsessed at the top
right corner and then you will need to
scroll down to advanced and then scroll
down to the very bottom and you see down
here at the bottom of says experimental
features and you have progressive web
apps and a toggle button now did find
that I had to kill the Firefox and start
it back up to actually trigger a little
home thing now if you didn't mean to do
that now
if you don't see it necessarily you can
actually see what's going on you can go
to do at least I could maybe turn it off
oh yeah see now I've got this let's see
actually took it off before that I had
the add to homescreen as an option there
but now it's off and that's no because
I've got the little house icon and the
little house icon if I tap it we get the
add to homescreen thing and I can say
add to homescreen and it's going to let
me choose the the tile there and as you
can see over here on the right hand
corner I get the love to dev icon on my
home screen now it does have the little
Firefox nightly badge icon on top of it
and if you've followed any of the
conversation around the progressive web
app at a home screen thing and the whole
concept of a web APK and where things
are going on Android Oreo this kind of
is obvious now I think what's gonna have
to happen is Firefox Opera Samsung you
don't know etc are gonna have to figure
out how to do the web apk thing like the
chrome team is shipping as well because
you can see I've got Twitter light on
here as well as love to dev but I've
added those via Chrome and those are
actually web apks and I'll be going over
that in additional videos I got planned
for the near future so definitely want
to subscribe to the channel so you don't
miss out on those
but if I open up from the icon the love
to dev site you can see it pops open and
there's no browser Chrome to get in the
way now and you can just see that the
site works as expected
hopefully hopefully we go it didn't
respond quite the way I wanted to but
anyway but there's no browser chrome and
it Scrolls nicely so anyway it's good to
see that Firefox is finally getting the
Add to Home screen functionality in
there obviously Chrome's got it
operas had it Samsung's had it but
Firefox didn't have it actually have the
prompt they had the ability to do it but
you had to go through the manual steps
to do it so it's good to see them making
some progress on this now one difference
that the Firefox heuristics have from
the traditional progressive web app
heuristics are they only require you to
be served over HTTPS which if we go back
too far
 you'll see that I've got the green
padlock up there and you need to have a
valid web manifest file now valid has a
little ambiguity to it but basically
what that really refers to is you've got
to have some minimal fields like the
name the default URL that you want to
open up and probably a minimal set of
icons I have not seen where Firefox says
what the minimal set of icons required
is but I do know in chrome you've got to
have at least a 512 by 512 for splash
screen and you got to have I think a 192
by 192 yeah at least for that add to
homescreen but you're really going to
need a wider array I'll go over those in
another video and obviously I want to go
over those in the progressive web
application course that's about to
launch so you definitely want to pay
attention to that and anyway so this is
good news
hopefully this will help out those of
you who are actually using Firefox know
that this is coming I don't know the
exact ship date of when this is going to
go from nightly over to the actual
consumer version of Firefox for Android
but this is good news more features
there plus I don't require you have the
serviceworker which can get you there a
little bit quicker now I just want to
make sure you know if you go to love to
dev comm /pwa upgrade we have a free
ebook available for you and why you
should upgrade to progressive web app
you all you have to do is give us your
email and we'll put you on the email
list but we don't really pester you too
much maybe once every other week or so
and give you some updates on new content
and resources that we found especially
around progressive web apps so hopefully
you'll sign up for that and you'll also
be the first to know when the course
launches and get a massive discount off
the full retail price of the course
that's gonna be big so you definitely
don't want to miss that and if this you
found this video useful please hit the
like button tell your friends about it
and definitely want subscribe to the
YouTube channel so you are aware of
things like our course

I do not know how to kill this thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
