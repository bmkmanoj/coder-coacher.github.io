developer summit and one of the key
things that we were all looking for is
what is Microsoft edges plan to support
service workers in this video not only
will I'll tell you what the plan is I'll
even show you how to use service workers
and Microsoft edge hey guys this is
Chris the owner of love dev and today
we're going to talk about edge and
service workers that's right Microsoft
edge the browser and what are the plans
to ship service workers well I'm a
little late in this I'm sorry about that
I really initially planned on doing this
video probably about three weeks ago
when I got back from Seattle and the
Microsoft edge web summit but if you
missed the announcement and that might
be partially due to me last month in
mid-september
Microsoft had a web developer event
called the Microsoft edge web summit our
developer edge Simon anyway up in
Seattle and they had a whole day where
they were doing all kinds of
presentations really talking about what
KITT what edge can do what the web can
do and doing a lot of showing off one of
the main things that I think most of us
were looking for was what is the story
behind progressive web apps and service
worker support we got some answers on
both fronts in this video I'm going to
focus on the service worker aspect now I
may be the number one guy who has just
been super excited about service workers
in edge since I first heard about
service workers and I've been anxiously
awaiting for about two years for edge to
support service workers and I got a
little closer at the summit but not all
the way to where I wanted to be and that
is full consumer
shipping of serviceworkers so let's
cover what's going on right now
now as I record this it's oh I think
October 11th 2017 and on the 17th which
is next week believe next Tuesday the
fall creators edition of Windows will
ship to the general consumer and
basically that means that the most the
people running Windows are going to get
an update when I say most I have to
couch that in enterprises are always
super slow to actually deploy changes
which is very unfortunate these days
because they're really hurting
themselves in a lot of ways but at the
same time I do get why they do that on a
delayed rollout but I won't get into the
politics and nuances of that today let's
just focus on service workers now if
you're like me and you are on the
insider program which means you get
early previews of the latest version of
Windows you probably already have the
ability to turn on service workers in it
and that's what I want to show you right
now so the roadmap is the fall creators
edition is shipping a version of edge
that has service workers in there but
they're not little it lit up by default
they're gated behind an about flag and
if you aren't familiar with about flags
this is how browsers are shipping early
implementations of new api's and
features they're not going to be
shipping those behind vendor prefix type
stuff anymore that has just created a
giant mess again won't go into that
every browser as far as I know supports
the about flag semantics and the easy
way to do that is to go to your address
bar and a type about colon Flags and
that will bring up a page like this an
edge it's pretty short and chrome it's
like a million lines long because they
just play with a billion things letting
you get to it now the reason why edge
or Chrome or Firefox or opera or any of
these other browsers will ship things
like this is because they write their
implementation to the Specht see the
actual spec whether that be a w3c spec
around HTML or a web api or could it be
JavaScript and they're doing against the
ECMO script spec or it could be a CSS
implementation the CSS modules what have
you there's a variety of things that
they could be shipping preview - it
could be something internal right and
this gives them the ability to once they
feel like they've got a reasonably state
a beta version they can put it out to
people like me who will play with things
a little head of time and they can get
some telemetry on what is working what's
not working because they can't account
for every crazy scenario that we come up
with to write code and this will give
them more feedback so they can flesh out
potential issues without breaking the
internet so this is a good thing and
that's really that's where we are right
now with Microsoft edge shipping
serviceworker support in their browser
so if the first thing you'll see right
here is the developer settings but what
you want to do is you want to scroll
down to the standards preview section
and the main thing you want to look at
is enable service workers if this is
unchecked then you want do you want to
check this and I rephrase this you want
to check this if you want to test out
Service Worker
support in edge I don't necessarily
recommend keeping this checked on by
default because you may be breaking
other things simply because you're
trying to flush things out so you may
get some quirky behavior if you leave
this on just warn you but if you turn
this on you will get a little message
down here at the bottom and let's see if
I could do this maybe that message there
we go you need to restart your browser
for the changes to take effect and then
you will have to close all the instances
of edges you may have open and you can
restart back up again and at that point
you will have serviceworker
implementation that's honestly all there
is to it to turn serviceworker support
on in this fall creators
addition now before I go on to actually
demonstrate it
what is the plan well the plan is for
the fall creators edition to be that
beta timeframe and unfortunately edge is
not really decoupled from the operating
system as far as shipping updates just
yet and that's that's an unfortunate
thing I wish it wasn't but it is so I
think what they're really shooting for
what their goal is is to be able to ship
general consumer availability of service
workers with the spring Windows Update
I'm not sure what that's going to be
called be honest with you I haven't pay
attention enough to it but that's the
plan is hopefully by spring they can
just turn it on by default and everybody
will have access to this wonderful new
platform called service workers now how
are we as developers going to be able to
work with this well right now it's a
little interesting and I'll explain this
as we go through now I've got a demo
site that I'm putting together for the
course that I'm about to release on
progressive web apps and this is my
little fast furniture site I'm running
localhost here but I will have a live
version available for you in the near
future so just pay attention and we're
definitely want to subscribe to our
newsletter so that you can keep up to
date on when we announce that course
that you're ready to go now I do have a
serviceworker enabled on this and let's
go to the developer tools and this is
what we got okay now if you aren't
familiar with the edge developer tools
it's okay we'll deal with that in
another video maybe we'll go through
what's there now but first let me just
go to the console and you can see that
right here registration was successful
and that is actually coming from my
serviceworker registration code you're
not seeing the activate and the install
event messages echoed out here and I
think we should go to many other why
haven't looked because with you
but what we want to look at here is in
the debugger and this is normal
where you go to debug JavaScript and if
you're familiar with the chrome
experience for service workers there
would be a note down here for the
service worker but we're not seeing that
I'll explain that here in a minute
we are seeing a note here for service
workers and that's because we do have a
service worker that is active and
registered what we don't have is the
actual JavaScript okay now you can see
that we've got our JavaScript here for
our client-side our browser tab code
like we normally do and that's good to
go we also have access to the cache
which is what you would use inside of a
serviceworker to persist things and you
can see it's a little bit different than
what your experience in chrome and
Chrome you to see the request URL and
usually just ok or blank and I need to
talk about those in another video but I
do like this because we get the actual
body of the response now notice here in
the images you're only getting the mime
type you're not actually getting the
actual text part which you get right
here and this is I think pretty
interesting because you can change it
that's really interesting we may have to
play with that opaque design that's this
is this is a lot more informative than
what Chrome's getting this so I really
really like that and then I've got my
precache one here there we go
I noticed it's a little bit late and
building the list up I don't think
that's a huge problem but what the
internals are here but we do have access
to the cache and we have access to a
little more detail here so that's really
cool now if you're familiar with chrome
and the application tab there is a
serviceworker sub tab note whatever you
wanna call it and it's sort of similar
to this one now you can I haven't played
with the push and the update I have
unregistered one by hippolyte the push
yet I'll get to that later but right
here we have the serviceworker for this
scope and if you're not familiar
serviceworkers you need to definitely
take my course on progressive web apps
where we will definitely cover the
concept of scope but you can see here we
got serviceworker it is active and it is
running and we get a little version
number here which it's just nice not
good stop it or I can debugger which is
Specht now notice it's not here when I
hit this inspect we actually get another
instance of the developer tools now why
you may ask are we getting a second
instance of the developer tools I'm glad
you asked that question
well that's because your your client
which is what's loaded in your browser
tab runs on a single thread your service
worker runs on a separate thread now
this is where chrome and edge will
differ a little bit and I'll just try to
explain it real simply here but the
browser tab and the Service Worker
are two totally independent processes
and because of that the way the
developer tools do they attach to a
process and not a thread inside of the
browser and they're slow there's a lot
of reasoning for that I'm not going to
go into it here so basically there's two
separate applications that are running
and if you understand the concept of
service workers at a moderately deep
level you this totally should make sense
to you
now that means said the developer tools
attached to a process instance so this
instance of the developer tools which
you're going to be able to debug the
Service Worker are attached to the
Service Worker instance okay and this
will give you access to the actual code
where you can set breakpoints and
everything else that you're normally
used to doing watches things like that
so if we go with the fetch event we can
let's see here we go
I'm just gonna pop it in here and we'll
do this and I will go back to what I
didn't pop down we'll just go to the
categories page and hopefully things
won't break on me of course they break
when I'm trying to record why why are we
doing this oh I know why it's because
I've got a breakpoint okay so it's not
gonna pop back in front of your face
like I'm used to so anyway the reason
why it stopped is because we were caught
right here okay so we got the request
object and you can see that there are
the prototypes
which have there's the URL down there at
the bottom you can't really make it out
cuz my screen is too short but you see
all the other stuff that's going on here
what I'm going to do is do this and we
will hit f8 and hopefully we'll get a
response back there we go oh I just
reloaded the whole thing how about that
I wouldn't what I wanted to see so maybe
we found a bug like I said look a little
bit buggy at the moment so we got over
here
okay well anyway like I said it's a
little buggy at the point at this moment
but that's basically the gist of it I
hope this will help you get started in
seeing what's going on with edge and
service workers and hopefully well as
the day goes on I will be able to figure
out some of the issues that I'm seeing
right now and make a better video
definitely for the course because I
gotta get this stuff recorded for the
course so we can get it lodged so hey if
you've got any questions about edges
plan for service workers or even
progressive web apps be sure to leave
them in the comments below and I'll
definitely get back to you as best as I
can or maybe even point you to the right
resource and definitely like the video
share it with your other developer
friends because service workers
progressive web apps are super awesome
and developers need to be aware of these
and share them with your stakeholders
boss all those people who you need to
impress with doing and utilizing the web
to the best possible ability I think
this is gonna be a great way for you to
really enhance your web experiences your
web platform despite the fact that we're
hung up right now that's okay but
hopefully I can figure this out maybe
you can give us some feedback to the
team and that's just if you find bugs
report it back to the team they're
always looking for feedback from the
field and they will definitely get back
to you one way or another and hopefully
if you find a legitimate problem fix it
for things ship and I can tell you from
experience they are did they do a
wonderful job of doing that so alright
again Chris love with love to death
definitely keep touch with us so you can
stay up to
on the latest news and progressive Web
Apps service workers and what
performance optimization</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
