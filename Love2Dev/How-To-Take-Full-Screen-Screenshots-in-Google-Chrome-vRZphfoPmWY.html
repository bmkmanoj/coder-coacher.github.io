to death here with another little quick
tip and this tip is going to be how to
take full-length
screen shots using the chrome developer
tools now right now I'm trying to wrap
up a book for pack T on progressive web
apps and to do that I had to create a
few demo applications and this is just
one of them it's a podcast application
but that's not necessarily relevant per
se to this particular tutorial but I was
in the process of doing screenshots for
the book and I wanted to try this out as
an option because I want to be able to
do full skirt full-length screen shots
and when you're in a mobile view like
this obviously it's very tall and very
narrow and you're not gonna get the
whole webpage on on the screen even if
is desktop I'm still not going to look
at the whole web page on the screen and
I want be able to do some good screen
shots for the book now obviously I could
just do like a little snippet and just
you know take the section of the screen
that I need or I could do a screenshot
edit it and something like paint on yeah
really quick so there's a lot of
different ways to do that but one of the
things that I have to do from time to
time is take full screen shots now over
the summer chrome added this ability to
the developer tools and I'm going to
show you how to use it and then give me
my opinion of it right now but if you're
not familiar with developer tools you
need to hit f12 or ctrl shift I or I
think on Apple or Mac it's like open
thingy shift I or something I don't know
what the deal is Apple Denver does
anything by standards anyway and I've
got it in the the device toolbar and I
like this I don't have to go over this
in another video it allows me to edit
the responsiveness of my sites as far as
that the layout right not the
performance but the layout and this
gives me the view on a mobile
so right now got a nexus 5 up and I
could choose you know obviously a lot of
different ones but we'll stick with that
it doesn't really matter and the thing
you want to do is there's more options
up here in the right top right corner
now if you've got the chrome developer
tools docked you may have to shoot those
over to the side and get those out of
the way or dock them down at the bottom
which I really hate when I'm working on
like these mobile views because then it
just takes up too much of the screen but
that's just personal preference the
reason I say that is because this is
going to be hidden because there's not
enough horizontal space if you've got
the tools docked and this is over here
to the right now normally I don't really
hit these up that often but you may want
to do it for this particular deal now
the way you take the full screen is to
open a little menu from the vertical
ellipsis and here you're going to either
take a screenshot which I'm just going
to do that first and you notice it zooms
in and it comes back out you notice it's
saving it here we'll look at that here
in a second and then you can also take
the full size screenshot here so let's
see what happens when this is done yeah
it's gonna take a little bit there we go
I think it took a little bit longer
because it's a bigger area to have to
take the photo of okay now I'm just
gonna show all hopefully this will no
that's not what I want that's gonna take
me to there which I think kind of
thought was wrong but I do have it up
here okay now these are the ones that I
just took and if you already noticed
that sucks I'm sorry that just sucks as
nowhere or no way relevant except for
the footer it got the footer in there
and I can see I forgot to update a page
but that's okay and these are some other
ones that I've taken before our started
recording the video this is a love to
dev and it totally missed the top of the
page this is another page in the podcast
application
missed the top of the page big time
here's the one where we just took the
what's visible screenshot that actually
looks good the top of its kind of cut
off because the the little tool thing
here and the viewers getting in way and
this is another one I took and again I
think this one actually is decent this
is the first one I took I believe and it
just took like extra space down here at
the bottom I'm not sure why it did that
and then here's another one of the demo
site that I'm working on for the
progressive about course which hopefuls
gonna launch any moment now okay I get
some recordings finished up but again
missing the top of the page that's not a
good sign in my opinion and here's one
of the closer up shots so I think
there's still some work to be done on
the full screen capabilities of full
screen screenshots built into Chrome
developer tools but if you just want to
take a screenshot of what's visible then
that works pretty well and that's been
there for a little while but anyway this
is a great little way for you to to get
those fullscreen screenshots maybe if
they work it out but it's also a great
way to do basic screenshots of you now
realize there are some extensions to
Chrome that are out there that may help
you with the the full-screen screenshot
and I need to check those out and that
was actually on my list to do today so
if I find one that I like that actually
works maybe I'll make another video and
post that here soon as well so hopefully
this is helpful to you and maybe you can
use it if you want to give me some
feedback maybe I'm doing something wrong
that you know about leave that in the
comments below hit me up on twitter
twitter it's at chris love and if you I
think this is helpful please like the
video and definitely subscribe the
channel because I've got a lot of
content in the pipeline and you don't
want to miss any of that content over
the next month or so because it's going
to be coming at you probably fast and
furious over the next few weeks anyway
have a great day hopefully this will
help you out in your developer workflow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
