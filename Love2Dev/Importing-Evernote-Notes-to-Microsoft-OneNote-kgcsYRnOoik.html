user well I sure had been but today I
tried something I imported notes from
Evernote
into OneNote and I want to show you how
to do it here today this Chris here the
owner looked to dev and today I want to
do something a little different maybe a
little helpful for you I've been an
Evernote user seven years now at least
and the reason why I started using
Evernote is because well the one to
experience stunk people want but be
quite honest the Evernote experience for
the last four or five months has stunk
and I've played a little bit with
OneNote and feels like they've actually
got their act together and it's usable
again so I was talking to my friend
Mahesh and he's like oh dude man you
should just import all your stuff from
Evernote and to what note and he said
hey watch you even make a video so here
I am I'm making a video I haven't even
tried this yet just made break this may
be a disaster
we'll see but you know I've got
thousands upon thousands of documents in
Evernote and honestly I've been I write
my blogs my books and all other kind of
stuff in Evernote and honestly one of
the complaints I do have about Evernote
is I can't make dragon work with this I
can't dictate to Evernote on the desktop
I can do it on my phone which is fine
I'm also Evernote on my phone seems to
work just fine it's just here on the
desktop it's just terrible for the last
few months you open up a new note and
you have to wait a few seconds before
you can even type the title and you're
lucky if you can get all the word all
the characters typed in the title before
it hangs and then it finally just that
goes out the rest you have to wait
another minute or two before you can
even start typing in the body etc so
this is just really frustrating with for
me right now in Evernote and becoming
honest I've actually read
my machine three times since September
and this has not gotten better with ever
notice I don't I think they've got some
bugs that have shipped to the Windows
desktop experience so let's just I'm
gonna try this the first thing you gotta
do I just actually looked up import
Evernote to OneNote and got this nice
OneNote page so we'll download the
importer let's just run and see what
happens here this is literally the
experience real time folks alright so as
I expect you have to go through
basically a nice little wizard and Wow
I already picked up all the stuff there
are things I'm not really that
interested and mostly what I want to do
is well it's got all these notebooks
that's just I've got a lot of notebooks
cuz I try to work on eyes a lot of stuff
into ideas here's the one I really want
want this one and let's do that one
there we go there we go okay so we'll do
next let's see what happens here oh dear
god this is this is one of the things
Microsoft definitely us to fix is their
login experience it sucks well just saw
me ready and that's good hey this
actually works one of the few things
yeah I want my tags to go with it
because that's a big part of it yeah
we'll do that right and here we go this
is basically bringing in everything for
my blog now I've got I got five hundred
and sixty two notes in my blog to-do
list I know it sounds crazy but that's
probably building up five or six years
straight things that never got published
just ideas on how quickly that never
materialized
and then it's also got all the notes
that I have actually published now it's
seen eight hundred and eighty seven and
honestly that's probably close to right
I would think because obviously I didn't
I didn't write blog post you never know
begin with because Evernote didn't exist
when I started blogging I think I
started doing that sometime around
2011-2012 maybe
so I'm gonna keep recording but I know
this is gonna be boring to watch this so
when this is done we'll be able to kick
back in and I'll just seamlessly zap
forward here
and we're back and we have imported our
one notes or notes into one note and
looks like we're ready to go so I got a
nice little button here that says view
notes in OneNote so we'll do that see
what happens if anything there we go to
click it again
alright this may be the one place it
falls apart on me let's go see what we
do let's just start it up manual like
here here we go
did today so while we were waiting I
actually checked on my phone I had not
even installed one note on my phone I
got my new pixel two in early October
when it came out but I had put one note
on there cuz I just don't use it enough
and I started kind of seeing how things
were going with the import process on it
and it was great and I loved the way it
was organized on my Android I love if I
can take a video for that some other
time
but here we've got love - dev blog let's
see what's going on in there we got blog
post and that's not what we want huh so
this actually seemed to work better on
my phone that it is here wow these are
like notes I took a long time ago
interesting so this is unfortunate to
see that my new post are not here yeah
these are some things that kind of
started playing with the other day
that's all it is huh well that's very
unfortunate
they're not here
well I can't vouch for them being on my
phone and being there I don't know why I
can't see them here that's that's well
here we go it was kind of hidden perfect
okay now at least I found it maybe or
not
nope not finding it these are let's just
try this and see what happens you
feeling that's not what I'm looking for
nope not what I'm looking for
yeah these are all old this is from free
Evernote days right here this is kind of
unfortunate that's the right account and
well sorry folks sorry this kind of
flopped a little bit here looks like I'm
not gonna be able to use it on the
desktop at least for now it's not
synchronizing but it isn't my phone
which is nice and maybe I'll start using
a little more on my phone
you see that's 2011 that's kind of when
I decided to switch because I was
getting frustrated with things to me 10
yeah this is fascinating okay
bummer I should see something that
actually is what I'm looking for but I'm
not seeing it
so got recent notes yep these are it's
just not syncing up the stuff that I
just synched up so that oh well maybe
it'll sync up later who knows but it did
work on the on the phone I can vouch for
that one so yeah I sold
sorry guys okay so decided that maybe it
was the uwp version one that is broken
and like every other uwp up it's broken
so I decided to open up the one no 2016
which is not the you WP app and this one
seems to be working correctly I still
could not get the view and OneNote
button on the importer tool to actually
launch anything no clue why so guess
maybe they need to fix that but I did go
to my 2016 version of OneNote and bam
here are all the notes and it seemed get
a little message on how they were
imported and everything now I've got
tags that you saw me that's gonna have
the different notes in there so they
actually organized those into tabs for
me which is excellent so you can see
kind of how I've got these things done
now when I say blog these are actually
blog post I've either started working on
or just quick ideas that I had and see I
got quite a few of them here huh let's
see what I have another spas not that
I'm even doing the single page app thing
anymore you know if I should post that
it's a lot of code there's a lot of
article what if I did anyway that's
outdated anyway so but that's that and
then we've got the post to blog which
are articles that have been posted at
least in theory yeah
yep these are all posted blogs that have
actually tagged what if they're how I
find the ones I haven't tagged if
they're there let's see anyway but you
can see they're all there ready for
viewing and editing and updating as
needed there we go I was more
progressive about stuff so anyway I did
does work and to prove it just can't get
the uwp app to work which doesn't
surprise me because pretty much every
uwp app stinks so already hopefully this
is helpful for you and if you've you've
use Evernote and your shouldn't OneNote
this is a great way just suck all the
Evernote notes in I just did the ones
that related to my blog it probably took
about 15 minutes to actually sync it
over I had close to 900 articles it was
sinking just giving an idea of how long
things took so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
