easy to see information HTML has two
types of lists unordered and ordered but
the default bullet point style may not
be what you're looking for in this video
I'm gonna show you how you can customize
bullet point styles so that your bullet
points are nice and unique to convey
your brand and ideas hey guys Chris LOV
here the owner of ellipse dev and today
I want to walk through different ways
you can style a list in HTML and CSS now
we should all be familiar with the
standard list in HTML and if you're not
familiar with it there's really two
kinds of lists and ordered an unordered
list and they are designated by the UL
and oal tag and within that you have
list items which are designated by the
Li tag and by default you typically get
a round daughter around circle to the
left of each bulleted item and that's
the kind of the default style and that's
what we're looking at right now is the
default style which is called disc now
you can usually see what the default is
for the particular browser most of the
browser's for their default stylesheet
are pretty much aligned there are few
deviations here and there but nothing
major and for what we're looking at
today they're all going to default to
disk I believe and we got to display
block on the UL and because the list
items are child of the UL this style
will cascade down to the individual list
items on the blog post when I
demonstrated the styling I did it by
only list item list because I was going
to go kind of going through and
manipulating things at that level as I
was kind of testing some things out but
you can do it at the UL or the list pair
rapper Lowell if you want so what I did
was I actually pulled the HTML from a
recent blog post where I was talking
about how to absolutely Center things
and of course there's a video for that
as well but I do encourage you to look
at and what I'm gonna do here is walk
through manipulating the bullets for
each of this list multiple you know
through different iterations and I just
want to show you all the different types
of things you can do I just want to show
you if you do want to do this let's see
if I can do this this is always a trick
to get this to pop out there we go and
yeah we'll do it this way and if we do
list item start our list style type this
is how you control what is displayed
there now if I change this from disk to
circled now I'm in the chrome developer
tools and this gives us a nice little
guidance or intellisense if you will
I'll have us change it so here we've got
a circle that's a basically the disk
with a hole in it I can go back and we
can delete it and we'll go to something
different well go down to the bottom of
the list and we can change it to a
square if you maybe you can see that
that's a square now over here and this
is actually a good way for you to see
what options are available in that
specific browser now what I'm going to
get into next may vary a little bit bar
browsers but it should be pretty close
to it now if I choose decimal notice
that's just one two three that kind of
thing okay
now if I had a sub list here it would
start kind of given the outline order on
things which is actually really cool if
we go down to the next list notice I've
got a leading zero on here and that's
because we go to in the inspector you
can see that I've chosen decimal leading
zero so it automatically pads the number
so that they're uniform so there's two
at least two numbers here on each one of
these and so that can give you another
different option from just decimal so if
you need that that's that is something
that's available now sometimes you may
want to apply some sort of cultural
thing now what I've chosen here sort of
have random to be honest with you is a
kind of a cultural thing and I culled I
just randomly picked Devin gari
there are many cultural ones this one I
believe is something to do with a Hindi
which I am personally not that familiar
with but we could also just use this
first one here which is an Arabic one
and we could go down you can see
Cambodian which I think they're they're
character set is actually kind of
fascinating look to look at but let's
see I don't know what this one is
Kannada Khanna is this Canadian but
anyway so you can see you can do some
cultural specific ones if you would like
to hear Mongolian there we go that looks
pretty unique so if you need something
specific to your culture into your
language this is another way that you
can apply that if I believe if the
browser doesn't support this it will
fall back to the default which is the
the disk that we started out with so
just be aware of that this may be a
browser or platform specific choice here
and so that may or may not necessarily
be started but you can consider that a
progressive enhancement okay next let's
start having some fun okay because the
default stuff only goes so far as far as
entertainment and I thought I would show
you how to do an emoticon now though
there are a lot of different emoticons
available if you go to emoji pedia org
you can pull up the codes that you need
pedia dot-org hope that type that in
right yes it did
alright now you can see that there are
all kinds of categories and stuff and
let's just choose grapes because it's
the top and basically there's actually
unicode characters to represent our
standard emoticons and then each
platform displays them as it wants to
with its own built-in image but what is
actually pretty important here is what's
known as a as a code a shortcut point
here we go and this will give you kind
of the unicode character so it's in this
case 1f 3 4 7 and you can use that in
your emoji code let's go back here there
we go alright so what I have done is
done a list pancakes but what we had to
do was kind of play around a little bit
here and I'm not seeing what I'm looking
for here in the developer tools it's
just not good that's okay it's there
obviously so I'm just gonna go back up
to the top and we will know it's not
gonna show me I'll tell you what we'll
do we'll just go to my code editor and
the trick is you have to use a pseudo
element alright so here I'm using list
pancakes and I'm using this the before
pseudo element probably should actually
do that and anyway what would do is
using an empty content we actually put
that code point code or the Unicode
character code here and you prefix that
with a backward slash and then the code
here for pancakes is 1 f9 5 e now to
make this actually line up correctly I
need to give it need to push it over a
little bit here I'll just give them a
negative margin of 20 and give it a
margin on the right of 10 you could
probably actually use
do a transform translate kind of thing I
haven't played with that yet so we'll
have to see if that works someday too
but if we go back obviously we've got
our pancakes here and now we've got kind
of some interesting maybe a theme or a
topic appropriate bullet for our actual
list so all right moving on to our last
little demo is how to use images now you
may have some images that are used to of
interest for you and if we go down and
this should pop it up and here we go
well how about that
don't have the images there oh here we
go this is it actually put the style
only different on the individual Li
thing noticed it didn't work for some
reason when I just did the list with
image thing I actually know what it was
it was because I had my my URL path off
let's see yep there we go so that works
there we go so it still works so this
time instead of using the list style
type we use list style image and when
that is it actually overrides the list
style type in it it will apply the image
to do this you do the same syntax you
would do for a background image and
that's used the URL I call it a function
I only know that if it's called an
expression or something like that
there's always something different than
what I think now what I'm doing is I'm
actually referencing the root folder of
this particular demo site and so I
didn't need to put it into the quote and
then the slash image and then the /
iPhone and now it's referencing that and
now I have the little iPhone icon here
on the left side of course I have a lot
of different potential icons to use
there so the options are available for
you to do that now if you wanted to
there's some other things you could do
that I didn't get around to covering you
could actually say list
type none and set some margins and stuff
like that and then maybe do the if you
go back up to the previous one let's go
back up to our list item here where we
did the emoticon there we go
of course we're not gonna see it here
but if you wanted to what you could do
instead of doing an emoticon is actually
apply a like a font like a font awesome
kind of glyph font to it you could
actually do that as well I'm not sure
that the before would work for this
particular case what you could do is
prefix all the list items with a span
tag and do the positioning I thought
that was a little more complex to do and
it's actually I think a little easier to
maybe do the emojis or a specific icon
just because it's just less markup to
have to fuss with and so that's one of
the reasons why I kind of left it out of
here because I thought I thought yeah
it's probably not the best choice so
anyway I just want to scroll back
through it here is the list of things
here and if you want there is a blog
post that will also walk you through
everything I just showed you if I type
things correctly here we go you can just
walk through the same thing I just
showed you and give you a little
reference I do have these styles up
there the source code is also available
on the github repo which I have in the
description below so make sure if you
want to get the source code to hit that
up so thanks a lot guys if you think
this is useful hit the like button below
and definitely subscribe the channel
because I've got a lot more videos like
this I'll be posting try at least a semi
at least once a week if not multiple
times a week as well thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
