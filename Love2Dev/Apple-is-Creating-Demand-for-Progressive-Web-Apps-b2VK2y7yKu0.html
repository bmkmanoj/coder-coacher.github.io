from their app store does this affect
you and what is your alternative choice
that may actually be better we'll stick
around wait for the end of this video
for a special offer but I'm gonna tell
you how to get around the Apple App
Store rejection issues hey everybody
it's Chris love the owner of love to dev
and today I want to talk to you about
Apple's recent aggressive efforts to
purge hundreds of thousands of apps from
the App Store now at first glance this
may not sound like a bad thing because
the Apple App Store the Google Play
Store and every other App Store that's
out there have become extremely polluted
with a lot of garbage and we're trying
to purge all of this garbage out because
we want to get rid of it because many of
us feel like they're an opportunity for
viruses and malware to get on our
systems and that's the initial intent of
this effort by Apple now their first
wave removed roughly what's estimated to
be about a hundred thousand apps but
recently they started rejecting and
purging even more applications using
part of their application review
guidelines in Section 4 2.6 which more
or less says that if your website or
your application was created with an app
generation service or some other
scripted effort where it's essentially
the same app with slightly different
content and images like images colors
and text they're going to reject your
application and this is starting to
affect many businesses the question is
all on top of that is in this effect
ionic Cordoba react native well the
answer is not yet but reality probably
will because the way they were they
worded their review guidelines is very
open-ended and very vague in fact it
clearly states in the guideline
that your app essentially cannot be a
repackaged website that's very strong
words now they've let a lot of apps slip
in past that gate I guess over the years
in fact I've said since I first started
seeing the Apple App Store and then the
Google Play Store that for the most part
just about every app there should be a
web application and not a native app now
those are so no that's a very strong and
opinionated position but when you really
look at it there's really not any
benefit of being a native app on those
platforms the real benefit is most
developers never really learned how to
build web applications from a
mobile-first high performance
perspective and once you do that you can
build great web experiences for example
office 365 in Google Docs both fantastic
web application experiences that work
cross-platform develop once work
everywhere this is one of the big
drawbacks to doing native applications
that's because it cost a lot of money to
build a native app because you have to
build not only the native app for iPhone
but you have to build a separate one for
iPad and then you need to build one for
Android and probably even Android
tablets being a slightly different
application and this only multiplies
your cost and on top of that the cost to
develop a native application is much
higher than developing a web application
now this this policy change of this this
actually enforcement of their policies
is really affecting specific targeted
niches of small businesses and and
really businesses that just can't afford
those expensive development costs in
particular consistent industries that
are being society Darr like restaurants
Fitness Gym type scenarios in a lot of
local businesses that have decided they
have to have an app in the App Store and
I've talked to a few of these kind of
business owners and they're like oh I
have to have an app because people only
use apps but here's the reality no one
uses apps oh my god that's a big shocker
right there but the reality is it's been
over two years since any
but he even cared about native apps on
their phones comscore has done extensive
review and study and this has also been
backed up by additional studies by other
services that monitor the mobile
application space the average user no
longer downloads any apps in a given
month that's right zero apps and it's
the only getting more and more with
people not downloading apps now there's
two terms that are commonly used here
one is called app fatigue basically we
just burned out trying to figure out we
need the latest app or not
we got burned out trying to find the
coolest apps but at the same time it's
also called peak app there's really no
more space for us to use apps if you
actually break down the application
usage it's dominated by two companies
one's called Facebook and the other ones
called Google in the apps that they
dominate with honestly should just be
web apps Facebook let's face it Facebook
is a web app all Facebook is done is
they've created a closed-off browser
with their own proprietary formatting
infrastructure and that who's who owns
the top four out of five spots basically
in the app usage facebook facebook
Messenger facebook Instagram and forget
the other one that's Facebook but
there's four Facebook apps in the top
ten and that's huge
google has the Google search is
considered an app YouTube is an app a
gmail is an app in Google Maps is an app
those are four so right there eight out
of the top ten or Google and Facebook
snapchats another one and I kind of
forget the other at the last one that's
in there but I know after that first
five or six there's a big there starts
to become a big gap in usage and after
you get out of the top ten the gap even
widens more until there's almost no
usage at all in a very short run and as
I survey my friends who are not geeks
not techie types who might actually want
to download apps they almost always tell
me they can't even remember the last
time they downloaded an app in fact it
usually boils down to I
the last time I downloaded an app was
when I changed to my new phone and it
automatically updated to the apps I
already had that's very telling honestly
the only time I that I see their phones
getting new apps or they realize they've
got new apps is when their kids are
playing little games on them and their
kids are constantly downloading free
games to play and that's about it so
does that mean that the local business
is a small businesses should probably go
after and build native applications yeah
probably not
and so maybe apples doing everybody a
favor by enforcing these rather vague
rules now what are these vague rules
well there are things like it has to be
app like and I don't know what the heck
app like really is I tried to look
around for a definition and honestly I
found nothing out there but to borrow
language that they actually put in their
review guidelines that you could tell
was sort of written by a lawyer is they
were quoting the supreme justice about
pornography and saying that basically
they know when something's not
acceptable when they see it and that's
kind of what I think too you know an app
when you see it and that's kind of good
right we kind of had this idea now a
website a lot of times it's just
something you read and navigate through
and honestly that's what the vast
majority of apps in the App Store
actually are are just things to peruse
through content now you may be wondering
well what about the the revenue that I
can get from an app and the reality is 8
out of 10 applications never make a dime
that means they go through all the
experience of having the app developed
and then the marketing cost the
marketing cost of pushing native
applications is through the roof me
surveys and estimates that I see say
that it takes between two and a half to
$15 an advertising cost to get a single
app download and what makes it even
worse is only one in ten of those app
downloads are going to be used more than
once that means 90 percent of the the
dollars you spent or wasted or if you
multiply the cost to acquire those
downloads by 10 now the
to get a real customer on your
application is $25 250 dollars per user
and then account that that only 20% of
the apps in the App Store make any money
and then when you do make money Apple
and Google all take 30% of your pre-tax
revenue that's a lot that's a big chunk
of your revenue that can cripple a
business immediately well I think a lot
of people realize business margins are
usually in the sub 10% range to begin
with and when you're taking 30% right
off the top like that those margins
essentially are negative this is a very
poor story for apps in a very big reason
why businesses who probably avoid going
into the App Store so what are your
alternatives now I mentioned the small
businesses are the ones that are really
truly affected and this is because they
can't afford those development costs but
most of them already have a website and
what if you could just leverage that
website well the great news is you can
today's world we've got a new class of
web applications called progressive web
apps now here at love 2 dev we're super
excited about progressive web apps and I
can tell you that the browser vendors
are as well this is a term that the
google chrome team created and got
energy and support from Mozilla opera
and Microsoft as well as Samsung
Internet and here's some other good news
Apple has recently started work on the
features required to be a full-blown
progressive web app but more about that
in a few moments first what is a
progressive web app well if you haven't
seen some of my other videos or read
posts that I've made or maybe read
somebody else's post or watch their
video you may be a little naive to what
they are essentially they're just
websites but because of the way they're
developed they take advantage of new
platform features when they become
available to provide an app like
experience but on top of that those new
features are not that hard to start
adding in to get that progressive web
application
spheal but there's more to it
progressive web apps are all about
delivering the best-in-class
user experience and that means that you
need to have good practices for both
development and user experience apply to
your web presence and when you do all of
these things your web presence works
great for your business and what what
has this shown with businesses that are
already implementing progressive web
apps where they're seeing great positive
returns they're seeing increased sales
more customer acquisition with fewer
cost and they're seeing better customer
engagement numbers all across the board
and these numbers are not limited just
to browsers and platforms that support
progressive web apps today they are also
reporting increases as well on iOS and
this is huge because iOS right now does
not support service workers and web
manifest - the key three to two of the
three key technical features required to
be a progressive web app those three
features are be served over HTTP this
makes your website secure and right now
about 60% of websites are using HTTPS
but the gist right now is there's no
reason for you not to be serving your
website via HTTPS Google is starting to
make that a bigger and bigger signal in
their search engine ranking algorithm
and many platform features that you want
to take advantage of our being gated
behind a SSL and HTTPS the great news is
there's not as many barriers for HTTPS
as there was in the past
today you can implement HTTPS for free
and then you we have to go through some
gyrations to upgrade your site a little
bit your your references and things like
that but that's all easily doable next
you need a valid web manifest file now
this is a JSON document that your
developer can create and it's not very
big it's just a few pieces of meta
information that describe your website
so that when the platform add your
website to the home screen and reaction
to the user wanting to do so they will
know
what icon to use to represent you on the
desktop or the home screen and they will
also have a great launch experience with
your brand colors and you can control
the name that's associated with your
icon on that home screen now only takes
a few minutes to create a web manifest
file and then reference it in your
website so I encourage you to go do that
today finally you need a service worker
now service workers are a brand-new
feature of the web in fact they don't
actually work in the browser they work
outside of the browser now we won't get
into the technical details there because
basically your website rut will make all
the requests through the service worker
but the service worker can execute even
when the users not on your website this
is enabling great new features like
native push notifications just like
native apps have had for the last 10
years this is making it easier and
easier for businesses to engage with
customers also service workers want the
key features of service workers is the
ability to work offline now we've been
able to work offline for about a decade
through something called app cache but
it's not the cleanest specification to
work with and developers are not very
happy about it and that's one of the
reasons why serviceworker caching was
created to make creating a web
experience that works offline much
easier to manage so when you've got
those three technical pieces in place
you technically qualify as a progressive
web app but the there are obviously many
other things you should do and that's
what we call web development and user
experience best practices which I could
go on for days about those and I won't
bother you with those right now but when
you implement them your website should
and will load almost instantly and users
will be able to find the content they
want and be happy and not be frustrated
with your application hanging up or
hiding things so that's all great news
but I've mentioned that Apple and iOS
don't necessarily support the
progressive web app features just yet
but the great news is I've been building
mobile first web applications that run
like native apps on all the plot
forms for about seven years using the
principles behind progressive web apps
what I did has now turned into what we
call a polyfill or something that allows
us to add functionality to the browser
platform that isn't necessarily there
yet
for example I've been using appcache to
enable my websites to work offline but
because app cache was hard to work with
I crafted away for me to be able to
manage caching those files and network
assets that I needed to make my website
work offline in other storage mediums so
when service workers aren't available
I can still fall back and use those
mechanisms to make my web application
work offline and load instantly but what
about push notifications well the
reality is push notifications are not
used by that many applications but when
they are there they can be very
effective but there are alternatives all
browser support web notifications using
something called a web worker which is
kind of a precursor to a serviceworker
and those have been around for several
years now as well they do require the
browser to be open though
whereas serviceworker push notifications
do not but there's still an alternative
that I'd like to recommend as well and
it may even be the better one to go with
and that's text messages businesses that
use tech mess text messages do see high
rates of engagement with customers and
it may be the best alternative for you
and your business
I know I get several text message offers
from businesses that I've registered
with they give me special offers to have
me come in for example restaurants in
the area and I've seen studies that show
that text messages can get as much as
three times the engagement that push
notifications do so maybe you need to
consider doing that and we know how to
help businesses use text messaging for
their success so here's some great
alternatives to that and that gives us
some programmatic stuff but the web
manifest thing in the Add to Home screen
what about that Chris well if you
back to 2007 when the iPhone was first
released there were no native
applications Apple's recommendation was
a web app and they still have the
infrastructure supported in Safari to
make web apps capable in fact that's
what they call it in their documentation
mobile web app capable so when a user
adds your website to their home screen
on iOS and you've got the proper meta
tags set up for that you will get the
almost the exact same experience that
the add to homescreen experience is with
a web manifest file and we know how to
do that as well right so all in all you
can create most of the progressive web
application experience with polyfills
and paul backs on iOS and other
platforms but here's some really good
news about this Apple is actually
working on service workers and the web
manifest file support now apple is not
known for communicating with the
developer community at all in fact I
would go far so far to say that they
don't really care about developers
outside of Cupertino and that's a harsh
criticism on my part that I'll stand by
it but in recent months they have
publicly given us signals that they're
working on service workers by updating a
page on the WebKit status site which is
where they actually tell us what they're
working on
as far as implementing in Safari and
then there's another signal that I found
that they're actively working on the web
manifest file so these are all good
things and it all clearly indicates that
they're working towards supporting
progressive web applications now the bad
news is Apple never tells us when
something's going to ship it just shows
up one day and we all have to kind of
figure it out by debugging and hacking
at it ourselves but it'll be there
hopefully for iOS 12 that's what I think
is gonna happen but since I'm not inside
Cooper and chinos walls I won't know but
like I said we can make progressive web
application features on iOS and when
that stuff ships because of the nature
and way you build progressive web apps
the new features will take over and the
old features won't even be used so
you'll get the best available on that
platform
and remember like I said companies that
have implemented progressive web apps
are seeing great returns on that
investment on iOS so there's no reason
why you shouldn't want to do that now if
you're a business that's been thinking
about shipping an app on native
platforms
maybe after watching this video you've
realized that's probably a bad idea or
maybe you're one of the companies and
businesses that have been affected by
the 4:26 there 42.6 rule and have had
your app rejected or even removed from
the App Store you should consider
progressive Web Apps is the more viable
alternative and we're here to help if
you're interested in pursuing that
please contact us and we will be glad to
talk to you about what can be done to
help your website and web presence
upgrade to a progressive web app and if
you're a developer I've got a brand new
course that goes in super detail of
progressive web application development
in particular service workers Service
Worker caching push notifications
backgrounds sync and much much more and
if you click the link in the description
below I'll give you one of the lowest
prices available in this course now the
regular price is $200 but if you click
that link you'll be able to enroll right
now and start taking that course from
anywhere anytime you need to for just
$29 that's right a hundred and seventy
one dollars off the regular list price
if you just clicked the link in the
description below so I encourage you to
go do that and again if you've got
questions about progressive Web Apps
leave those in the comments section
below if you think this video is helpful
hit the like button if you think other
friends or business owners or developers
need to know more about this topic share
it with them as well and don't forget
subscribe to our YouTube channel or like
us here on Facebook that way you won't
miss any of the future content that we
post thanks a lot and even if you
haven't been affected by this 42.6 rule
you really need to consider the Apple
guidelines and how big they are and how
they might affect you and strongly
consider moving to a progressive web app
because no one can judge you there and
remove
view from the internet only you can do
that and that gives you complete control
over your brand message and brand
experience and that's the big power of
progressive web apps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
