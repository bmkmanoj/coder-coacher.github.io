I want to talk to you about something we
created last fall for progressive Web
Apps something we felt was missing
desperately and that is a common logo to
represent progressive web apps as we
looked around there wasn't really a good
logo out there to represent progressive
web apps the community could use so we
decided we would create one and offer it
up to the community and make it open
source and Creative Commons and I'll
share with you at the end of this video
how you can access that repo and add
your value to the logo as well let me
explain the logo to you as you can see
it here on the screen let's go look at
the different parts of the logo
okay so there's basically some messaging
that's going on with this particular
logo and each part has a different
message and aspect of progressive web
apps that we think are represented in
this logo first all progressive web apps
need to be fast and so we like to think
of yellow as being fast next progressive
web apps have to be reliable and that
we're going to represent with orange and
next they need to be engaging and we're
going to call that green now we could
also turn this around as well and we
could also make the colors represent
three of the key technical aspects as
well
HTTP a web manifest in a serviceworker
with a fetch handler if you want to look
at that way feel free outside I like the
fast reliable engaging a lot because
that's much more broad much more
understandable by everybody not just
developers
now next we want to make sure that the
web has some presence in this logo and
what better to represent the web then
our angled brackets and so our overall
logo is encapsulated within an angle
bracket to give you that sublimable
message that progressive web apps are
deed just websites that have taken those
vitamins and progressively become apps
and next because progressive web apps
have this great advantage over native
applications we like our little Running
Man here to kind of subliminally rec
represent being mobile and
cross-platform and just highly agile and
and just active if you will and so this
little guy right here kind of represents
that concept and I made some different
variations of this logo so we've been
looking at it with a white background
but I've also made a series of logos
with a black background so you could see
the contrast there as well and one of
the reasons why I went with black and
white is a because they're obviously
very simple but they also provide good
contrast with the colors included in the
logo because and I don't think red would
really look really good with this
particular logo to be honest with you
it's okay next now stole this actually
from something we'll talk about here in
a minute there's a community contest to
vote on a progressive web app logo which
actually prompted me to make some
enhancements to the project as well as
make this video and hopefully by the end
of the night of corresponding blog post
as well so I stole this image because
one of the things I wanted to do is kind
of show the logo and use and so I stole
some of the image the images that were
being used by some of the other things
the or logos being represented in the
contest just to show how this logo could
fit in as well and so here I've just got
the white logo and I'm placing it in a
series of logos here and you can see it
kind of stands out I've also got you
look at the actual
project I've got another variation of
the the big square logo we're actually
have PWA and text below the actual
iconic logo and just to add some
variation to it and show you how we can
do some various things with this as well
but do generally dislike it without
being lettering on it it's very very
simple in my opinion next this is
something I've kind of used in some of
my blog posts just to show that it is
truly kind of cross-platform
cross-device is just throw the logo on
have a standard responsive design
representational illustration or image
here this is one that I've used a lot in
presentations and for different things
around especially around responsive
design here I've thrown in the logo just
to show again that some conscious thing
that hey this fits everywhere which is
what we really want to think about
progressive web apps next another one
that I stole from one of the other
things is just showing it represented in
square tiles now right now we're
probably more or less limited in
sometimes our thought process on how
these home screen icons if you will are
going to be represented now Microsoft
hasn't like told us anything yet
but you got to think that they're going
to incorporate the tile the live tile
concept is on Windows with these so one
of the things you're going to notice
when you look at the repo is that
there's all kinds of sizes of the icon
included there's a really big one then I
get into Standardization of 600 by 310
310 by 310 340 about 340 so forth and so
on and a lot of those actually
correspond to the existing live tile
recommendations so when you look at this
lo gonna don't necessarily want to cage
at any square you want to think about it
also too in other concepts but because
this was being used on look the contest
I went ahead and kind of threw it in
there just to show now one of the
reasons why they did this is because the
logo that this came from was simply just
PWA at the bottom
actually I think using the same blue as
the typescript logo there and so they're
kind of keeping with that theme because
that's kind of something that's going
with JavaScript but to me progressive
web apps aren't limited to JavaScript
they are encompassing of different
technologies obviously some HTML
Javascript in the serviceworker we don't
really have CSS as part of the
requirements to progress about but it
does need to be responsive so you could
also think about it in those terms and
then you know we got security as well we
don't really have icons and stuff for
that so I don't think necessarily caging
it in what when I look at the JavaScript
or the typescript logos to me I'm really
thinking one specific type of technology
which of which revolves around
JavaScript so I think to me that's one
thing that does definitely separate this
my logo or our logo from from that
particular one and the offering and here
it is in white just to show you the
contrast there personally I'm a little
more partial to the white even though I
usually like dark backgrounds so another
one I used was a using it as a badge I
thought it would come at an odd usage
case but I thought hey I'll just throw
it on there to see what it looks like
through the white ones in here in this
presentation and the repo of also got it
in black just to show you that so I'm
not really sure that the badge would
necessarily be the right way to do it
but you never know what the browser
platforms are going to do as far as
representing a progressive web app on
the home screen they could overlay a
little badge to kind of visually
indicate this as a progressive web app
on top of your icon so don't let that be
a limiting factor in the way you think
about how a logo to represent
progressive web apps might be
incorporated so I said this is a a
public repo it is on github and it is
open source it's under Creative Commons
license I got to give a big shout out to
Adrian Bateman on the edge team because
he's the one that actually helped me
figure out which license to use because
that is not something that I feel like
I'm qualified to figure out creating and
maintaining open-source projects is not
my forte
now there's anything wrong with them was
just not worried where my strengths
but it's on github and it's one of my
many repos that I have sitting up there
and my main thing is doc love do CLU v
and this particular project is /pwa -
logo
feel free to clone it fork it add some
value to it
merge it back in and hopefully I won't
be too lethargic or lame on getting a
pull request and things like that
managed not again not something I'm
really that great at doing but feel free
to do that and hopefully you will appeal
to add some value like I said there's a
big array of images that are available
to you to kind of reference that I've
got some core images in there they're in
paint.net format because it's my primary
graphics thing because honestly I don't
wanna pay for Photoshop paint God knows
free it's available in Windows and it's
really pretty powerful there are some
tools to flip it over to a PSD file I've
been having problems with that lately
for some weird reason but anyway that's
why I don't have a PSD version of it
right now because those those those of
file filters where they are in paint.net
have been hanging up the application and
haven't had time to figure out that one
so sorry about that so if anybody out
there wants to do it for me that's not a
good example of a fork that's much it's
a would be greatly appreciated now
finally this is a July 4th and we have
till July 7th - for the community to
vote on a common logo that to represent
progressive web apps and so I want to
encourage you to go vote for Hire logo
if you like some of the other logos feel
free to vote on that I'm not going to
slap you on the hand or anything of
course I want you to vote for ours
because we've put some effort into this
and I'm glad I had a chance to take some
time and try to explain the parts of a
logo a little better the blog post I
posted back in November really didn't do
a good job of explaining I just said hey
basically here's a little go go play
with it so I'll make a little updated
blog post to go with this video and put
it up on the love - dev site
hopefully by the end of the night
tonight but I will get this video up
there on YouTube and all and our
Facebook page as well and hopefully
we'll go from either one of those over
to the github repo and like it and clone
it and also go to the voting repo which
I've got a bitly link to because link
was rather long and give us a big thumbs
up over there we'd love to get some a
lot of community support behind this
obviously share with your friends we're
going to be sharing obviously links and
to this video and to the to the
corresponding blog post on our social
media accounts that will be on Twitter
or Facebook page and we've got Google+
and LinkedIn and so forth so we'll be
sharing some stuff out there as well so
definitely help us out by sharing with
your friends and if you haven't heard of
progressive Web Apps definitely plug in
to our channels our different outlets
our blog download our free ebook on why
you should upgrade to progressive web
app and that's it love to dev calm /pwa
upgrade and that will give you access to
but I think it's about 25 26 page ebook
it's not a ton of reading into it just
to describe what what's going on with
progressive Web Apps and why you want to
upgrade your website to progressive web
app and then again we've got some online
courses that we're building out right
now so you definitely wanna stay tuned
because we've got a lot of activity
around progressive Web Apps and service
workers and this logo is kind of a way
for us to kind of give back to the
community to help give some identity as
well as give progressive web apps
exposure to the broad development
community and also business owners
because obviously without the business
hunters developers don't really have
projects to work on and we need them to
understand the concepts around
progressive web apps just as much as
developers do so thank you for engaging
us with this video about our progressive
web app logo and again please go support
the community voting and hopefully
you'll give us a big thumbs up and we
can use this logo to represent
progressive web apps in all the
different parts and pieces
that progressive web apps are all about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
