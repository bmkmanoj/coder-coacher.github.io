things about webpagetest that can help
you improve the quality of your website
so that you can engage customers better
and improve your search engine rankings
hey guys Chris love the owner of lo -
dev and today I wanted to go over one of
my favorite tools webpagetest.org
now if you are a web developer or an
online marketer anybody who owns or
touches a website this is a must
tool to put into your regular workflow
now this tools been around for several
years now
and it's created by Patric Mian who now
works for the Google Chrome team and I
think this kind of wanted his 20%
project things but it's an open source
project that meaning in the community
actually commit and participate in now
you can go to webpagetest.org and you
can plug in any public website URL and
run a basic test now let me just
before we do that let's go over what you
need to do to set up a test real quick
now the first thing I'm already mad you
do is to create an account and log in
and this is right now I have to set it
up with my little gmail account and this
this allows you to essentially keep a
test history that you can go through so
this is just today and I can go back you
know like say for a full year and update
the list and also filter it out it's
gonna take a little bit to build the
list because I got a few things anyway
so you can see that there's just you
know a bunch of different runs that I've
been doing that it's logged but back to
actually setting this up now the first
thing you obviously need is is a public
URL so you would just type it in there
I'm gonna go ahead and just put one of
my recent blog post in there and then
you can select the location and then the
device which we'll see here in a second
but as you can see there's quite a few
data centers or locations where they
have public instances of webpagetest
available and each one of them has a day
of different browsers and device
profiles that you can select some also
allow you to select the bandwidth speed
which is very important
now Dulles this one is the kind of the
default one and it's the mode it was the
original one but if you're trying to say
see how your traffic your experience
might be in India or Australia you would
want to choose the data center closer to
that because if you've properly used a
content delivery network that's where
your content will be coming from here
you can select the browser as you can
see this is the one that has the most
variety of potential browsers it also
has a nice battery of mobile devices to
check to test from I love this because
now I can test on different kinds of
devices as well
the default is going to be Chrome but as
you can see they have edged Firefox
Chrome Canary which is like the preview
release before it goes public the same
with Firefox nightly there's I 11 they
still have an IE 10 and IE 9 instance
although you should never do that
because those browsers are no longer
supported anyway and then obviously a
large list of mobile devices here now
I'm just gonna I'm just gonna stick with
Chrome now there's multiple things you
can do here most places most of the time
you'll have this connection thing and
what it'll do is it'll use different
connections some of these are real I
think they're all actually real here at
this one some are simulated but it's a
good idea to kind of do different tests
with different speeds that way you get a
better idea what your site really your
site load profile really looks like and
remember most web traffic today comes
from a mobile device so honestly you
want to you want to really emphasize
testing on those mobile devices if you
really want to get a good profile now
about a fault it's going to run one test
run in that default test run is going to
be a first view in a repeat view and the
reason why it does that is the second
view will be what your page looks like
once
you've already primed the browser cache
now if you've properly got cache control
header or set up on your files then the
browser should cash or store those
responses locally but if by default
meaning it doesn't have to make the
round trip to the network which means
the second load is much faster now
obviously things get a little different
when you start using serviceworker
caching but that's definitely outside
the scope of this video definitely
recommend capturing video if this is
available and the reason why I do is
because it gives you the ability to as
you'll see here in a minute actually see
what it looks like as your page loads
and that's really all you need to do now
there are some other options that you
can do here but I'm not going to go into
some of the deep stuff what I want to do
is I'll just let run but while we're
waiting I'm just going to go pull up the
last test that I did oh not the last
test there we go that's the last test
that I did okay so this one was already
finished the test runs can take a you
know a minute or two and if the server
is really busy it could get backed up
and it may take a little while another
reason why I like to have the profile
because then I can just come back okay
now the first thing you should see is
this visual scorecard up here and as you
can see I've got A's all the way across
on checkbox for CDM the only difference
is the cache static content now I'm
going to dive into this real quick
because it is AC to show you why now I
did upload a couple of images at the
last second for this particular blog
post and so it didn't go through my
normal deployment process and I missed a
cache control header on Cindy crumbs
image as well as Ryan Jones now because
I ran this test and notice that I did go
back and fix that so those are the two
assets that I actually control that
didn't have the cache control header the
rest of them all come from third-party
tracking stuff so things like my
Facebook pixel the Twitter pixel the
Google
it's pixel the Linkedin pixel all these
things do not set cache control and
that's because they're trying to track
the user so they're not going to set
that on there that they're outside of my
control and and honestly that's kind of
okay so let's go back so in essence
really this is as far as what I can
control a straight across the board if I
really wanted to make my page
technically load faster I would remove
all those third parties but then I would
lose my ability to retarget and market
to those people effectively now the next
thing is essentially this little
scorecard here of numbers and things and
this may not mean a lot to you at first
but I tend to like to focus on this
first row of the first view and I say
the load time is two point six nine one
seconds now personally to me that hurts
because I really want to have that
faster but as you'll see here in a
minute most of that latency is due to
those third party pixels and scripts and
again outside of my control and because
of the way they're loading they're not
necessarily affecting my user experience
like you would think now the time to
first byte is 0.30 two seconds I'm a
little worried about that because to me
that's a little bit slow but that that
that will vary this is another reason
why I tend to like to run make multiple
runs because then I can see how the
server varies a little bit we'll get
into what composes that in another video
in more detail and I will talk a little
bit about it here but this is one of the
more important things to me is the start
render this is when the the browser
really starts rendering the content and
we'll look at the we'll see kind of how
this materializes here in a moment the
speed index is something that Patrick
created that I think is a very good
metric and ideally you want to have a
speed metric score of a thousand or
below most web pages tend to have be
somewhere closer to ten thousand which
give means that there's a lot of room or
a lot of opportunity for you to tune
your page to compete against those
slower pages but basically the way this
works is he does a little bit of
calculus because the webpage
tool basically takes running screenshots
of your page loading it runs analysis
over those images to see how many pixels
have not been rendered and essentially
this score is the area under the curve
or effectively what's the typical
experience as far as breaking it down
one like tenth like every time slices
and we'll go over that here in a second
basically how many pixels are not
actually rendered over the course of
time it takes to render your page I know
this is a little bit complicated
complicated thing if you go to the site
he's got a really good explanation of it
and maybe I'll make just a video on
explaining that topic one day sewing too
but this is probably the most important
number right here and this is the first
interactive as some of the news came up
with and so I think they're gonna be
fine-tuning that I think this is a bit
delayed right here being four point two
seven seconds on my particular pages
because I know they're they render and
interactive more I think this is more
due to those third-party scripts but
basically this is that this is the
actual page load metric you really
ultimately need to be measuring it's not
really this this first byte time which i
think a lot of search engine
optimization experts fixate on is this
time to first byte it's more important
to fixate on this particular number
because this is a more holistic
representation of your page load
experience now there's some other values
over here that you can also look at now
I've got nearly a megabyte of content
being downloaded personally I'll
probably look at that and see what where
am I doing that we can also look at that
here in a moment the number of requests
all these kind of things there's also a
link out to a site that one of my
friends Tim Kadlec made that actually
calculates how much does it cost a
customer to download that particular
webpage over a cell connection in their
country and that's another interesting
tool that's out there I'll also cover in
an additional video here's one of my
favorite things right here and this is
the waterfall now you have access to a
waterfall
your browsers developer tools just hit
f12 and every browser developer tool has
a tab called network or networking and
you'll see something very similar
webpagetest provides probably a lot more
detail in there waterfall and so I
really like to go over it now my sites
all use HTTP two which means that there
is one simultaneous requests for all the
content again very technical but if you
have not upgraded HTTP two yet I highly
advise you to do so because your site
speed will improve anywhere from 10 to
80 percent depending on your site's
configuration now I have seen some say
even up to 95 percent but I would just
say 10 to 80 percent it is the range
which obviously is a big wide range but
you know 30 percent here 20 percent
there it all adds up now the reason why
the time to first byte is not
necessarily the best thing to look at
and this is where search engine
optimization people tend to fixate on as
Oasis's says to 261 milliseconds but
notice everything else happens after
that the reason why this is not the
place to fix it on is because this is
the first page this is your actual
markup and the markup has all the
references for all the other files that
compose your site and so none of these
requests can happen until that mark
markup is parsed which means it has to
be downloaded and then parsed and once
you can do that then all these remaining
requests can happen now if I click on
this we can actually break down the
details of this particular request so
you can see when I say break it down
obviously HTTP 2 is my protocol but
here's what that what I'm looking for
the request started at point 1 2 7
seconds the dns resolution took 27
milliseconds I'm very happy with that
time anything under 50 milliseconds for
DNS resolution in my opinions a good
thing if you can get it down to 10 even
better but 27 is a fantastic score the
time to make that initial connection was
34 milliseconds
because http/2 requires us a cell you
will need to go through an extra layer
to do the SSL that is a slight
performance hit but it's more than made
up when you use HT now the actual time
to first byte which means the time it
takes for that markup to go from the
server to your browser in this case was
175 milliseconds and then the the rest
of it the content downloaded was empty a
total number of bytes in of markup was
10.1 and this is a good number right
here if you know anything about the
technicalities of how HTTP works you
want your content to be under 14
kilobytes and that's because it makes
one single round-trip once you get over
14 kilobytes it has to make two and the
second one is 32 kilobytes and so forth
and so on up to four megabytes that's
actually the biggest frame you can get
to my knowledge over TCP now when it's
uh unzipped which means I've got all
this gzip compressed it does expand out
to fifty point two kilobytes so there is
that but that's that's basically
breaking this down and so it gives you
insight into where your potential
bottlenecks are so basically the most of
my 261 is the networking time from my CD
ends data center over to the webpagetest
data center which I think they're
actually on the same physical data
center so anyway but then this is going
to break down all the other files that
are being requested and one thing that I
think is kind of interesting is these
files even though some of them are very
small like I know this one is
uncompressed I need to I do need to
optimize my CSS that's for darn sure you
can see this one is 1.7 kilobytes but it
still takes write about the same time I
think this is because of the way the
multiplexing in h2 works and then here
we're seeing these are images all the
purple ones are images so you can
identify any image that may be out there
right now I've got most my images are
nice and small so I'm not really seeing
a whole lot there
the orange our JavaScript files being
downloaded now JavaScript and even CSS
the download part is just the start of
things JavaScript in particular is what
we call a brach a blocking process and
this halts the critical rendering path
because the browser has to download the
file and then it has to evaluate the
script then execute the script and this
takes time and this it gets amplified up
to 20 times more on mobile devices than
desktop and this could be a big reason
why it takes a long time for your page
to load is because the browser has to
stop everything and execute those
scripts to see if there's any integrable
damage or change to the Dom and if so
then it has to go back through and
rerender everything all over again and
unfortunately this happens a lot with
JavaScript especially third-party
scripts causing you to go back through
that critical rendering cycle and this
is why pages exhibit things like what we
call Genki Ness this is when you see the
page jump around as it's loading or you
may scroll and then it and then it jerks
up or jerks down all these kind of
things that's because the JavaScript is
poorly written and causing problems ok
now you can see this is my site and now
we're getting it into the third-party
stuff and this is where things kind of
go sideways as far as my network
waterfall profile and that's to be
expected because of the way those
scripts work and this is where the vast
majority of my load time is but notice
right here this gold line right here
this is Dom interactive that means that
that's when somebody can actually start
interacting with the page and I'm at one
point two seconds so personally I like
that number remember at one second
that's when people mentally start
disconnecting from a page waiting for it
now down here we've got an interesting
thing here one of the reasons why the
JavaScript stuff and everything is a
blocking process is because the browser
only uses one thread to actually do all
of the client-side processing rendering
etc and this line right this row right
here shows you how the CPU is being used
at the different points the load time
the orange being JavaScript and the
purple being CSS rendering I believe and
so you can kind of see where the process
is actually being utilized and here you
can see is the page actually interactive
greens means yes red means no and so
this right here this red that's janking
us ok and again this is because of
third-party scripts okay but here you
can see the CPU utilization you can see
how much bandwidth is being used at any
given point and so you get a good
profile of how your page is actually
being loaded now there's more stuff down
here obviously but I do want to kind of
keep this a reasonably high level now
the next thing I really like to do is I
like to look at the filmstrip view and I
like the filmstrip view because it
allows me to kind of break it down
really quick and because my page
honestly loads fairly quickly I don't
have a lot of images here if your page
takes longer to load this will it'll
break it down even more here it's
breaking it down into half SEC half
second segments but if you have a really
large one it may be a second I've also
had other profiles where it did every
tenth of a second but you can see here
the first one second there's like
nothing being rendered and then BAM it
suddenly gets rendered
so honestly I want to look at this a
little more to see what I can do to
maybe improve that and I think a lot of
that's going to be removing a lot of the
unused CSS I've been very lazy about
that with this particular layout this
year I've got a new version I'll be
launching soon and I'm gonna try to make
sure that my CSS is very lean and mean
so that I can maybe bump that over to
that half second mark and there bump
this over to the half second mark so I
really like that a lot now to get any
better experience here let's go to the
video view so we can actually watch a
video of our page being loaded if I go
click this will see bam and bam there we
go
that's all there is to it okay so this
will give you this gives you the tools
that you need to recognize that now said
I could break down where it where's the
weight of my page obviously I'm got to
read about a mix so right here I'm
looking at a third of it is images a
third of it it is JavaScript and the
reason is because I'm using some
third-party stuff and I think they're a
little bigger than I would normally be
and again I said my CSS is not as
optimized as it should be right now it's
a quarter of the page and the fonts the
actual markup and other not sure what
the other is off the top of my head but
anyway you can see how the content
breakdown is now honestly in the end I
could I can definitely reduce that and I
can definitely reduce that the images
like I said are pretty well optimized at
this point there's not a lot I can do
with that but I can definitely try to
trim this stuff down right here and that
will these two right here in particular
will really help my page load profile so
that's a quick run-through of just how
to do or how to use web page test
through the online interface now web
page test offers node modules that you
can use in an API and you can fully
integrate and automate this so you can
make this part of your natural
development and deploy workflow
part of your integration test if you
know what that means
the other thing too is it's also
available as a pride for private
instances there are docker containers
available and you can stand those up
fairly easily I haven't done it yet but
I know you could you can do this in
Amazon's AWS there are like stock
containers I believe available for there
as well as virtual machines and I know a
lot of companies will stand up private
instances you can also script
webpagetest so that you can make an
automated run through your site so you
could actually make it run through and
test it's a different you know user pass
and user story scenarios things
like that run smoke test for you all
these kind of things now this is not
gonna be the same kind of tool that say
using webdriver would be this is about
identifying performance issues and it's
going to provide you tons of data what I
showed you is just the tip of the
iceberg these are kind of the immediate
go-to things that I look at to get the
quick things that I can go address
there's a lot more information here and
you can get very detailed and you can go
way down the rabbit hole with with a
tool like this and I do highly encourage
that but once you identify a lot of
things that's going to propagate around
your site and you're gonna have a very
good loading profile for your site and
all of your pages and as a marketer this
means you're going to be able to engage
customers much easier you're gonna have
more traffic on your site because people
won't leave and that's ultimately going
to improve your search engine rankings
above across the board so if you've got
any questions about webpagetest leave
those in the comments below and I'd love
to have a dialogue with you again this
is one of my favorite tools and I'd love
to see what you think about it I want
you to go try out some of your pages and
let me know if you got any questions
about the results you're seeing or maybe
some additional tools to help you
address some of the issues that you
identify in a webpage test room so
thanks a lot and I hope you've enjoyed
