and you maybe you're trying to figure
out what a progressive web app is well
that's what we're gonna answer here in
this video hey guys Chris love owner of
love - dev and we are very excited about
progressive web apps and hopefully you
are too but even if you haven't heard of
progressive web apps or you've heard of
them and you don't know what that
release means I'm gonna tell you today
and give you a good introduction into
what progressive web apps are now let me
summarize it with a quote of alex
russell alex is the guy who created the
term progressive web app and he's one of
the great proponents at google trying to
build the infrastructure so that we can
build these great user experiences but I
like the way he said it he said that
these are just websites that took the
right vitamins and they progressively
become apps and what that really means
is that you add some superpower features
to your website that unlock all kinds of
brand new user experience features these
user experience features are going to
enable you to engage with your customers
at a much deeper level and at a much
lower cost and I'll explain a little bit
about that as this video goes along now
there's three key factors that you need
to understand about progressive web apps
first they are fast you need to build
your website so it's fast and this is
just a fundamental principle that love
the dev has been passionate about for
about a decade building high-performance
websites and we know how to architect
those sites to make them go fast next
they need to be reliable one of the
problems that the web has suffered from
is a perception that it's not reliable
and a big part of that comes from the
ability to work offline in a very
manageable fashion and not necessarily
even when it's just offline but also
when you've got that that phone that's
got connectivity indicated which are not
really connected that's known as well as
life I
and we can make your websites work
whether you're online offline or in that
purgatory of life I next they need to be
engaging they need to have that deep
user experience engagement feature and
some of that comes down to being on the
user's home screen or being able to
light up things like push notifications
and other features that had been a
little difficult in the past now to do
this to unlock all these great features
you need to make three technical
enhancements to the typical website
first you need to be HTTPS that stands
for hypertext transport secure amusing
need an SSL or TLS certificate installed
on your web server next you need to have
a web manifest file for your website a
web manifest file is a simple what we
call Jason or JavaScript object notation
file that has some properties in it that
describe your website to the browser and
the platform things like your site and
hame your theme or colors and a list of
icons so that when it adds your icon to
the homepage it knows exactly the best
icon to choose you can also do things
like designate a special URL for that
for the user to automatically launch
when they do tap that home screen that
icon on their home screen to launch your
experience finally you got to have a
serviceworker now this is a big
technical thing and it's a brand new
feature that browsers are rapidly
rolling out right now but what it does
is it unlocks a lot of features that in
the past were not very easy to implement
or at all able to implement and that's
because the serviceworker loads with
your website but it runs on a background
thread which is different than the UI
now that may be confusing to some of you
but just know that the stuff that you
work that you interact with on the
screen and the serviceworker stuff are
totally separate processes which means
they don't interfere with each other
however because the serviceworker is
tied to your website in your domain it
can do some magical stuff in the
background that enhances that actual
experience that you have
in the browser and it can work when the
websites not even loaded which is
extremely exciting one of the key
features that that unlocks is the
ability to do push notifications that's
right you can do push notifications just
like native applications and so this
unlocks a whole new avenue for you and
your brand managers to connect with your
potential customers on top of that your
your devops team can take advantage of
that technology as well to seamlessly
upgrade and update your application in
the background without ever interfering
with your actual customer these are just
some of the examples of great user
experience enhancements that progressive
web apps are gonna unlock for you now
you may be asking well what do I got to
do to get started well obviously the
first thing is to get an SSL key then
you got to add that web manifest file
and of course you gotta add the
serviceworker and when you may be
feeling a little overwhelmed about that
will love the dev has some services and
even an online course available to help
you and/or your developers understand
how to implement progressive web apps
correctly and with efficiency so if
you're interested in unlocking some of
