well I'm gonna do performance audit a C
sharp corner and talk about some things
that I think they can do to make the
site load faster some of them you're
gonna know if you know me but maybe you
don't know the biggest thing I'm going
to talk about to make them scale better
so recently I know that C sharp corner
has been going through some
infrastructure updates and I believe
they've actually got those deployed to a
new system basically they've got new
virtual machines set up and everything
but just over a month ago
Provine made a really quick post on the
site saying why is C sharp corner or why
C sharp corner is slow and I don't have
any historical stuff to determine what
it was back then but one of the things
he does point out here that personally
as a web developer I take offense to is
that he says download the apps they
shouldn't be slow
which makes me go because honestly apps
are slower than the web I said it okay
but if you program the web wrong then
apps could be faster but generally they
take a long time to load they're very
heavy file size and something like C
sharp corner does nothing to integrate
directly with the platform so therefore
there's not a lot of incentive to
actually make native apps to people on
it this is where progressive about is
more suited in fact 19 opera some of the
time progressive web app is the right
answer compared to a native app but
that's beside the point the performance
profile for the web it generally should
be much better than any native app but
one of the things that I do know about C
sharp corner and performance at about
this point is the server infrastructure
wasn't necessarily keeping up with the
demand and that really points to a scale
ability issue okay again sometimes some
of the things I want to talk about here
will definitely help you with your
scaling without having to add a lot of
hardware infrastructures so today's
world going big iron is probably the
wrong direction you need to go
honestly I say you need to go serverless
which scales nicely but I'm gonna give
you a key as we go through this on how
you really make your site scale and
perform super fast now
so they've at this point I think they
have deployed to the new servers and the
new server infrastructure but I just
want to look at this page because what I
did was a did a web page test analysis
if you're not familiar with web page
test I have at least one video already
posted on the YouTube channel just
introducing you to it but this is my
favorite go-to web performance testing
tool and this is the result here you go
to the home page all you do is enter in
a URL must be public if you want to use
the public web interface and then you
can select a location a browser and all
kinds of various things to run a test
okay but what I'm gonna do let's just
look at this page real quick so you can
get an idea we're gonna come back and
we're gonna we're gonna break down the
page as I kind of break down where the
performance bottlenecks actually are so
just notice there's it's mostly static
I'm pulling out a few things that
technically our dynamic is basically
this top corner up here you got some
badge opportunities and a profile setup
here or a login is what it would be if
you weren't logged in now if I scroll
down this little thing will pop out from
the side and then we've got comments
which in all honesty are not JavaScript
related at all these essentially are
should be rendered on the server at
demand time and one thing that they are
doing that I don't see a whole lot is
they've dropped in a third-party
component to allow you to make comments
using Facebook which would go on
Facebook there might be reasons you want
to do that I wouldn't be a fan of that
this right here is something that would
that bothers me I wouldn't want to see
that but everything else on here is
static and I want you to keep that in
mind okay just keep that in mind as we
look at the performance profile now
webpagetest gives you a lot of insight
into your your site's performance
profile so I give you a lot of grades
now we've got ABA up here we don't have
keep alive unable for something that's
not the huge deal to me but here's a
quick get right here the images aren't
optimized and you got a d4 that there's
not a lot of images on this the images
that are being displayed quite frankly
are ads so one of the thing they could
do is obviously optimize the ads the
other thing is they don't have their
cache control header Settlements of
things so let's just dive into those
real quick and we'll talk about why
these are important so obviously you
want to make your images as small as
possible and there's two ways that you
need to implement images today one is
you need to optimize them by running
them through an image optimizer like
cracking dot IO for example so you can
get the smallest physical size but the
other part of it is you also want to
make a responsive set of images and use
the responsive image things like source
set or maybe even the picture element if
you need to do what I call a little more
image gymnastics with art direction okay
but there's not a lot of images on here
so like you can see that there's two
that failed one that got a little
warning but the two that failed are
again this is an ad and I'm also seeing
like some naming conventions I don't
like I don't like to see spaces and
names they wound up being URL encoded
with the space the percent twenty that
can lead to some issues another thing
too is you can tell they've got some
problems here they've got an upper case
JPEG and a lower case JPEG that's the
Sun that they need to fix the naming
convention piece there another thing I
want to point out is honestly always
lower case your static assets for your
website well really everything as far as
a URL if you have a system that would
automatically just lower case everything
you're gonna have consistent URLs and
you're not going to run the risk of
possibly creating two different types of
URLs to the same resource honestly the
other side of that too is if you've got
an uppercase say in a link that you've
created in your markup but the file is
lower cased on the server most web
servers won't do that translation for
you and return it back and that's
because technically there are two unique
files okay so you definitely want to
make sure you've got a consistent naming
convention the way I would get around
this space thing is I would put dashes
or possibly underscores I prefer dashes
and I may I have actually have a
function that I've written a node that I
used to create what I call a slug name
for every file and it does make sure
that all the characters are lowercase
and things like spaces and other
non-conforming URL characters are
replaced with dashes and then multiple
you know couldn't you know sibling
dashes are truncated down to a single
dash that kind of thing I just do that
with some simple regular expressions
it's very simple to do but you can see
here that the image itself is 131
kilobytes but webpagetest calculates
that you could get this to just under a
hundred kilobytes and so basically
you're gonna save about a quarter of the
file size and that can add up over time
if you're talking about scaleable and
this is this obviously is an ad that's
going to be shown you know several
million times a month be honest with you
so you can do the math on this as far as
just bandwidth cost alone for hosting
that you're gonna cut your bandwidth
cost by a quarter okay so all it takes
is literally a few seconds to optimize
that image and make it smaller and you
can make that part of your such your
build or your deployment process just
make that a step it's empty in that
process and make sure that that image is
nice and small and you can say we've got
the same problem here with this next
image again uppercase characters that's
a pet peeve of mine and this one can be
yeah wow that can save two-thirds of
that file size
that's huge okay so again the hosting
cost in that alone is more than worth
just optimizing this one image I'm sure
pays for say a monthly cracking
subscription okay so
more than more than worthwhile now
progressive jpgs I'm on the fence about
that I don't really care about that as
much the one thing I want to point out
here is they're using HTTP handlers to
serve images and I'm gonna like raise my
hand is I'm probably a guilty party of
propagating this because over ten years
ago I wrote a lot of content around HTTP
handlers and HTTP modules in asp.net and
one of the things to do there was to you
know resize images via the handler that
seemed like a cool trick to do don't do
that the reason is because back then we
were like let's store images in a
database that sounded like a good idea
terrible terrible idea don't do that
don't resize your images on the fly
constantly okay if you're not say giffy
and honestly gif he really should just
off to my resize and optimize the images
one time when that particular size is
requested and then it's done okay and
maybe that's done behind the scenes but
you still got a lot of asp.net logic
you're gonna have to trigger through so
definitely want to avoid doing that okay
and instead actually it's again part of
that deployment workflow have the images
ready to go with the proper cache
headers and everything app uh compiled
and set on them okay that will help you
with your image stuff now the other side
of it is only half of the hundred static
resources have proper cache headers
notice there's no max age or expires
header applied to these resources and
that's a bad thing and the reason why
it's doing that is because you want to
take advantage of browser cache and then
if there's no expires headers satiric at
what we call cache control headers that
define how long a browser should cache a
resource before checking to see if
there's a new one on the server what you
want to do is you want to set a long
we'll call a long lifespan or a long
time to live now typically on a static
resource if you can if you can muster up
a full year that's like ideal because
that basically means that that file is
never going to be requested on your
server
again assuming that the browser cache is
not purged now granted mobile devices
which right now is the majority of
traffic on the web and will be in the
near in the future foreseeable future
for sure tend to purge their browser
cache rather aggressively so don't
necessarily count on that being the case
but it certainly does help now remember
the fastest network request you can make
is the one that's never made if the
browser the way the browser requests
things from the network is it first
checks its browser cache to see if it
already has that response and if it does
and that response is not stale then it
will just return it from cache without
making a call to the network and that's
what you ideally want now ultimately
what you really want to do is use
serviceworker caching but I was going to
call that one outside the scope of this
particular audit and video ok so that's
what we want to do so we want to get the
cache control header set on these
resources these are all under their
pervert purview so they they own these
images in these files so they should be
applying a cache control header again
that can be part of your deployment
workflow and just naturally apply that
my deployment scripts automatically do
this based on the file type and they
also will gzip compressed based on file
type now images do not need to be gzip
compressed because they are already in a
compressed format just keep that in mind
when I say gzip compressed let's limit
it to say CSS JavaScript and other text
files ok alrighty now let's go back to
our full audit
another thing it says here is not an
effective use of the CDN let's go just
bounce on that and I got a feeling
that's going to point to some things
yeah so see sharp corner is not
recognized as a CDN and and I'm not
really sure if they've got I know
they've had a CDN in front of this I
don't know if they still do or not but
right now it's not being recognized as a
CDN so then we need to work on that as
well and even if it is then that's fine
but if it's not then that's why that's
getting called out ok
let's look at the next vital piece and
this is the waterfall this is this
graphic right here and now you can also
get a waterfall in your browsers
developer tools it's under the
networking tab and it'll look very
similar to this
now the webpagetest waterfall gives you
a lot more information than what you get
in the browser tools okay
so let's look at the actual report we'll
dive into this now I just drilled into
the first run by default web page test
will make two runs it'll make an initial
unprimed request with nothing in the
browser cache and then it will come back
and make a second request with the
browser cache primed basically from the
first request that way you can see what
a repeat visit might look like well
we're gonna look at the first one here
and the first thing you want to look at
is this time to first byte and this is a
very very good very respectable time to
first byte basically a quarter of a
second that's that's generally what I
see from most servers these days now
this was made from the Dulles data
center a Dulles Virginia which is in the
mid-atlantic East Coast United States
okay now I happen to know that the C
sharp corner servers are located in
around San Antonio Texas so you can kind
of guess where the data center is now
okay but the quarter seconds good now if
this was longer that would indicate that
there's a problem on the server so right
now there's probably really not a
problem with the server and this is
where most people tend to focus their
web performance effort now that's that's
all well and good and you should have a
good server infrastructure that will
respond quickly and at scale okay in a
site like this is a site that needs to
be at scale what most people don't
recognize is that's only 5% of your web
performance profile and I say 5% because
again remember most of the web's traffic
is generated from a mobile device and a
lot of times that will be over a
cellular network and the average cell
your network in the world is not LTE
it's actually intermittent 3G if you
will I would say good middling 3G so you
don't have blazing
speed necessarily and I when I tell
developers you really need to develop
and test your website for relatively
slow and spotty 3G connectivity this is
that's really what I'm referring to
so with that the quarter second is going
if you get on with spotty 3G it's going
to be a lot longer now if you can get
that lower then that's awesome
the best thing you can do is actually
have a compressed piece of HTML coming
down
that's 14 kilobytes or less and the
reason is the way TCP works is it makes
round-trip starting at 16 kilobytes and
32 kilobytes 64 and so on until it gets
about 4 Meg's as far as the byte size
the top the last two kilobytes of that
16 hour reserved for headers okay now if
we look at this you can see that the
compressed size is 12 point 9 kilobytes
so that's very good on their part so
we're going on good high-five on that
one and this also breaks down the
different things 33 seconds for DNS
resolution that's a good number to have
and then the initial connection takes 58
seconds to make it to the server it has
to find out where the server is by doing
the DNS and then it has to connect so
now we are sitting somewhere around 90
milliseconds and then we've got a 120
milliseconds to actually get the content
back from the server ok and then the
full that's when if the first byte hits
and the rest of the bytes ticks take
them took another 65 milliseconds now if
I went through and ran another 20 or 30
runs of this you would see some
variation in these numbers but not a
whole lot you're still probably looking
at somewhere between 200 to 300
milliseconds it is going to be your
range for this time to first byte so
they've got their server configured
rather well right now so give them big
kudos for that
and now the fun starts because we got
the HTML the browser now notes knows
what CSS JavaScript images etc to go
download and that's what's happening
but the page is not actually rendered
yet what happens what has to happen is
it has to get enough CSS
to be able to render and it's going to
start going through what we call the
critical rendering path and ideally
you're gonna limit the number of loops
through this critical rendering path and
you do that by minimizing the amount of
CSS that needs to be parsed and rendered
applied whatever you want to call it and
you also need to limit the amount of
JavaScript and the Java scripts the big
hindrance okay and that's because
javascript a has to be downloaded then
it has to be parsed and then it has to
be executed to determine if it doesn't
eat
I call it damage to the Dom which means
that the browser has to recycle back
through from the top and start the rear
end during cycle all over again and Java
that's why javascript is a blocking
process and it has to be because of
things like document dot write which you
should never use anymore
but they're there all over the web
because it was there in the past and
that's how we did things say before
jQuery to give you a good example we've
got better ways to do that kind of stuff
these days okay so we're gonna look at
the waterfall now ideally that would be
using HTTP - and also be SSL which I
don't think they are either no they are
not SSL that's one thing I would
definitely say upgrade to SSL and use
HTTP to the page load will be much
faster for that alone and SSL
Certificates these days are real free so
they really don't have an excuse for
that right now and pretty much every CDN
supports HTTP - for the transport
protocol okay so we can see that we're
getting I'm not even sure what this file
is just yet let's see what we got here
the first one let's see what the
response type is you sir agent
I'm not sure what type of file this is I
know it's gzipped
content type I don't see content oh here
we go it's CSS okay so don't have a CSS
file extension again that's not required
the header is what the browser actually
used I could have put it any kind of
extension I wanted on it to be honest
with you so got a little CSS for asking
for a little gear
probably some more CSS some images and
some font files all the stuff now we're
hitting the JavaScript okay looks like
we're actually requesting the same file
twice let's see if we are nope slightly
different files and this is coming from
an ad server okay this is a pixel from
an ad server things like this I would
lazy load okay
defer those loading because that's just
going to block your rendering that much
more and again add double click add
stuff add stuff add stuff bad stuff that
stuff add stuff this is all adds stuff
right here that's dropping in there and
notice the page doesn't blow doesn't
actually render completely yet right
because it's being held up because of
those now I want you to notice there's
some lines here on this graph okay so
there's Dom interactive that's one
person can theoretically start say
touching and moving the page so this is
after four seconds and then Dom content
loaded those are pretty much in line but
here's like the big one the document
complete and this is when things really
can actually start being utilized now
remember you've got three seconds to be
able to work okay and if you can't
actually be usable within three seconds
statistically you've lost over half of
the people who tried to load your page
so the trick is to be fully rendered
before three seconds ideally if you
absolutely can one second because
mentally that's where people start
separating from their tasks okay all of
these files with the yellow row those
are files without content expires
headers on them typically you see that
and add stuff but we also know that a
lot of the stuff being hosted by C sharp
corner doesn't have those expire headers
as well okay now you see it's still
rolling it's basically just cascading
over and that's because all those
servers are using HTTP 1.1 and then here
we're actually finally getting to stuff
that C sharp corner needs to compose
from their servers these honestly should
be a feather okay and we're still
cascading over you see how we're
now we're back to ordering C sharp
corner stuff all this ad stuff that
stuff should be loaded after all of this
in a lazy load fashion here's where
they're starting to call the I think
they're calling the comet stuff for the
face book down at the bottom and notice
how this is lazy loaded that's actually
a good thing okay now I want to point
out down here we've got how much the CPU
is being throttled and you're taxed and
here you're basically seeing it maxed
out almost the entire time you want to
keep that as low as possible the amount
of bandwidth being used again that's
that's a relative thing right there but
it also lets you know kind of how things
are being downloaded but this is the
main thing the browser does all
everything in a single thread and what
we have migrated to unfortunately is
doing a lot of tasks and stuff that
really the browsers that the browser
thread that is not really designed to do
and a lot of calculations using
frameworks like angular and react and
whatever to do to do a lot of work that
really is not suited well for this
thread this thread is really good at
rendering the Dom that's what it is
that's pretty much what you should limit
it to and the cost they've recently
jumped to about three hundred and sixty
kilobytes of JavaScript all this kind of
goldenrod yellowish color here the
oranges yellowish color actually called
goldenrod that's that is JavaScript
processing the purple is CSS processing
notice how limited that CSS is but look
at how much JavaScript is being parsed
there's very little on the page that
requires JavaScript but because they
have up their JavaScript amount lately
this is what's called going on and this
is right here the number one thing
that's keeping the page from rendering
in a reasonable amount of time
is this okay you want to limit that
profile as much as possible because
JavaScript just takes a long time to
deal with and now I did this on a chrome
using Chrome on a desktop in a very good
bandwidth piece so that's what we got
about five
accounts of load time all right you can
see there's a lot more detail here so
what I do want to do I also ran this
from Mumbai the same exact test the same
exact URL and let's see what we get from
Mumbai again compress images use static
content and here's the profile from
Mumbai now I don't know what this first
view doesn't look quite right something
probably went wrong on this one because
that is not correct I can tell you that
right now
so let's go look at the second one and
maybe we want to rerun it here but let's
do that let's rerun it while I'm looking
at this sometimes this is happening but
with what page Tessa nothing been doing
some upgrades on this on the
infrastructure lately but I can tell you
right now it's not exactly the same
files being downloaded a bet that has
something to do with the location and
the ad network so but they're doing
slightly different stuff now notice the
time to first buy here is a little more
than twice what it was from the dullest
data center again if you had a good CDN
they probably would have a physical
presence closer to Mumbai which
theoretically means it should load
faster of course it does come down to
network congestion and things like that
and you can see the actual fully loaded
time 722 seconds now that's obviously
bad and that's honestly that's why this
waterfall looks straight down I didn't
even notice that
look at that 50 seconds one hundred
hundred and fifty seconds so forth
all the way up to seven hundred what is
taking so long oh here we go yeah okay
so there there this is a bad habit - I
see a lot of websites do they're
dropping in external third-party
JavaScript code from different social
networks to show how many times an
article has been shared
now that doesn't really buy you a whole
lot as far as what people really reduce
far as respecting an article or
popularity of an article instead what it
does is it drastically slows your page
load down which means fewer people
actually
read the article or interact with it so
it cost you a lot more than it gains by
actually showing those the social
metrics so to speak and this is very
expensive now ironically this you got
Google Twitter and LinkedIn all causing
problems because these files are taking
forever to download that's why the page
took so long
now if again if we go down here to the
CPU you'd resort out of this because
it's just it's so messed up because of
those ok so that's what happened on that
glad I caught that one so that's a bad
sign we don't want that and that's why
sometimes why the page will lock up
because it's sitting there waiting on
something like that so let's go see if
our test history has returned on this
one maybe the files loaded faster this
time around and it looks like they did
so this will be a more reasonable one
again a 17.65 five seconds just a quick
note right now the average load time for
the average page on the Internet is
around nineteen seconds which is
absolutely unacceptable ok now if we
look at this it looks very similar to
what we saw before
we're seeing an 893 34 milliseconds for
that time for the time to first byte and
that's bad some of the things they could
do to kind of speed up some of this
third-party stuff is prefetch DNS
prefetch in their header and I'll make a
video about that sometime in your future
I would also find out where this is
being referenced and remove it because
that's a 404 and that's causing latency
and you can see basically looks the same
again here we've got something looks
like from Google static these files this
file this file these files these are all
taking a long time to load across the
the pond now looks like the JavaScript
load is not near as bad as what we saw
in the US and I got a feeling again it
comes down to those ad networks and how
efficient they're working there's been a
lot more research lately about the
impact of third-party scripts on your
overall performance and just how bad
that is they will point to a few of
those in the description
of this video so you can see there so
the number one thing I would say to help
their Indian profile which is very
important to see sharp corner because
there's a very big audience in India is
to make sure that the CDN has a good
presence near somewhere in India if not
actually in India and this will also
help with places like Australia which I
know is also another good place for
developer traffic and so we can see
right here the DNS lookup took a while
the initial connection the time to first
byte there's just a lot of slowness
connecting to India so they need to
definitely have a physical location
closer to so what's another thing that
we can do to make this time to first
byte even better now I know the C sharp
corner is an asp.net site and there's
nothing wrong with asp.net that was an
asp.net MVP for like seven years I wrote
several books about asp.net and I know a
lot about how you guys feel that
networks and it's no different in the
end then say a PHP engine or Ruby on
Rails or WordPress engine the thing you
want to do is you want to take them out
of the equation
from where your website is actually
served instead you want to turn your
website into a static website and make
your CDN point to your static page
origin or your static website is your
origin if you understand how to set up a
CDN that's more of a DevOps task anyway
you want to point to that static website
and the way these things would work is
you'll essentially put a tool in place
that will run over your dynamic website
so your asp.net website and render out
the text from the actual web server and
then deploy or save that static result
to your static origin and you want to
make that something that's going to be
automated so as soon as that say your
your data that composes a page or a new
page is created that you get that tool
to run over your resources and put those
on the static site now one tool it's
really popular to do this is varnish and
I know that Stack Overflow is an asp.net
site but it has excellent performance
profile from the server primarily
because what they're doing is they're
doing that model now I don't know if
they're using varnish or not I've been
told they're not but it's something very
similar I don't know that I don't know
the exact details but I do know that
they're running a static site tool over
there asp.net infrastructure and that is
what is deployed when you request a file
from Stack Overflow and they've got this
completely automated process that kicks
in when content is updated to update a
resource and that is probably the most
efficient way to do any of this okay and
that's what I would recommend for any
site it is to have something like that
in place especially sites like C sharp
corner which get you know multiple
millions of views each month okay and so
that would definitely improve their
profile as far as the time to first byte
but again we're talking about the first
five percent of your web performance
profile now the rest of it is that
client-side thing and the number one
thing you can do is reduce the amount of
JavaScript you use because that is what
slows things down the most now if you
can get away from using javascript the
better now what on this page actually
needs
JavaScript let's go back to the actual
page and we'll point it out at least as
far as I can tell from looking at it
again the badges up here in this top
corner and the login profile that's
something that would be toggled based on
if there is an authentication token
present if there's not an authentication
token then this would say login so
that's that's a very simple toggle and
honestly you just change a few little
features here this is something that can
be done and just a few dozen lines of
code and the same thing for these badges
that could also be done in just a few
dozen lines of code the next thing that
I can tell is this little pop-out and
this is based on scroll
Oshin again another very simple thing
something that can be done in a few
dozen lines of code now the next thing
that they're doing is they're dropping
in a lot of third-party stuff and a big
chunk of it is this Facebook comment
system I would be curious and actually
go through and do an audit how much is
this being used because I've got a
duplicate comment system in place and
the first one is their own internal one
which may or may not be run by
JavaScript I don't know but I would make
the comments part of the render process
and make that available there and remove
this Facebook comment thing because I
don't think it's buying them the the
added benefits that they think it might
be I'd be interesting to see the actual
review of that so those are my my little
analysis to kind of go through go along
with this wise C sharp corner slow I
wouldn't necessarily say it's slow I
think it's got a decent profile but it
could definitely improve I think
honestly we could get that blow time
over a good cable connection here in the
United States down to under 2 seconds
consistently and let's try to get that
India profile to 3 or 4 seconds or
better now I didn't run it over 3G I'm
pretty sure if I ran it over 3G
especially from them by I think we'd be
seeing a very slow experience and
something that's not necessarily
acceptable and that's definitely
something we need to work on there's
gonna be a lot more that we can look at
to make that work better so hey if
you've got some questions or comments or
suggestions for C sharp corner and their
performance profile leave those in the
comments below if you think this video
was helpful for you
or maybe you don't necessarily agree
with some of the things I said again
leave those in the comment below if you
think some other people might benefit
from this please share this video and
with your friends or colleagues so that
they can also get some benefits as well
so one of the able to help everybody
make the web a better place and making
websites perform well is a big part of
making the web a better place and that's
the number one goal here thanks a lot
