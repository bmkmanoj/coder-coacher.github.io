and i am thrilled to deliver this course
on progressive web applications from
beginner to expert over the past 15
years i have been fortunate enough to
share with thousands of developers
advanced web development technologies
this includes speaking of hundreds of
developer groups and prominent
conferences around the United States
I've also taught multiple workshops to
help developers master these concepts
over the past 10 years I have been able
to author 5 web development books
including a brand new progressive web
application book due out any day now I
have also been honored to be a Microsoft
MVP and web platform technologies I have
been able to foster great relationships
with engineers on the Microsoft edge
Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox teams
this gives me a very unique insight in
to the excitement and enthusiasm
each of these browsers has around
progressive web applications but it also
has helped me understand how they're
implementing support for progressive web
application features and how to take
advantage of those I also have advance
knowledge of what the road map looks
like around progressive web applications
so that you can be prepared for what's
coming down the pipe in the future in
this course we'll cover all kinds of
progressive web application technologies
and techniques this includes how to use
a web manifest file to deliver a great
add to home screen experience we'll also
cover how to make your website secure
and why that's so important today and of
course well we will cover service
workers service workers are one of the
most exciting new technologies to hit
the web platform in years we will look
at the service worker lifecycle and of
course we're going to cover caching
you'll cover simple to advanced caching
strategies and how to apply those in a
real-world web application
and we'll also cover things like push
notifications and background sync plus
as new technologies are added to the
Service Worker stack I will add more
resources so you'll be the first on your
block to master those as well now I know
that not every browser supports
progressive Web Apps just yet
for example iOS Safari has yet to ship
serviceworker support but don't fear
I've also got content in this course to
help you had features and polyfills so
your website can progressively include
progressive web application features and
technologies on platforms like iOS this
includes the Add to Home screen
experience as well as being able to
cache content and data the course
includes a reference application that
will follow along so that I can explain
the concepts as well as demonstrate the
code and you can have access to that
code and you can try it out yourself as
well as experiment by the end of this
course you will go from being a novice
to an expert on progressive web
applications so come join me today and
start your journey to be an expert
