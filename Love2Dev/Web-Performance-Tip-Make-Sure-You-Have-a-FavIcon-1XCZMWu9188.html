optimization thing that you can do
before you go home today to make sure
that your site ranks better in search
engines is more pleasing to end-users
I'm gonna talk to you about the favicon
in this video hey guys Chris lot of the
owner loved to death and one of the
things that I'm very passionate about
was web performance optimization that's
because fast sites are liked by people
in a much higher rate than slow sites
and that just makes sense and as a
reward it's a search engine ranking
factor for both Google and B if your
site's fast you got a better chance at
ranking higher a lot of that comes down
to people just like sites that load fast
so they actually do the other things
they're also ranking factors like they
don't bounce back to the search engines
and they dwell on the page longer
because they feel more comfortable
reading them and one of the things that
you can do this is a super simple thing
that is often overlooked is make sure
you have a favicon now what is a favicon
well it's a little graphic image that
you see up in the address bar of the
browser it's not something that's
actually part of your page or your site
per se as far as the rendering process
goes it's sort of that meta information
that you have to now the reality is
every time a page is loaded if the
favicon has not been loaded yet the
browser is going to look for it and you
can decimate what image file is your
favicon now today it can be an ICO or an
icon file which is what it originally
was but you can also have a PNG I also
believe they can even do gifts with the
most popular format is a PNG and you'll
want to have a PNG that's at least 32 by
32 pixels but you can also use a 64 by
64 pixel image as well
and you'll want to reference them now
the reason why I buy cotton can be a
performance benefit is very simple if
you if you don't have the favicon the
browser's will request it and they'll
get a 404 response back and every single
time your page is loaded your servers
will need to process that request again
and again now one company in particular
that suffered major issues because they
didn't put a favicon on their website
was Instagram now I know you know who
Instagram is but when they launched they
were getting about 35,000 people signing
up an hour which is amazing anybody
would dream it out but their servers
were falling over and that's because the
web server was constantly having to look
for that favicon file and this should be
a lesson in general about having 404s on
your server if you want to improve your
servers efficiency make sure you don't
have any 404s 404 means the file does
not exist so what happens is when a
request comes into the web server for
that file it must hit the hard drive or
the disk to get the file off there if
the file is not present it returns to 4
or 4 and then the next person that makes
the same request and the same thing
happens over and over again now if you
were like Instagram they had 35,000
people an hour trying to sign up what
happens is the hard drive is doing
nothing but looking for that file and we
call this thrashing so the server was
locked up looking for the favicon file
which meant the server was unresponsive
now if you have the actual icon in place
the first time a request comes through
it will pull it off the hard drive if
you've got your web server properly
configured the web server layer should
then cache that file in memory which
means the next time someone requests
that file it will come
memory which is a much faster process
plus it does not involve the harddrive
so this means the response is much
quicker and that the hard drive is not
taxed near as much and ultimately your
server can be much more responsive so if
you don't have a favicon or you're not
properly pointing to your thighs icon
make sure you fix that today this is
something you can fix in a matter of
minutes and you can definitely do this
before you go home you do this and you
can improve your overall on-site
performance this is just one of many web
performance optimization tips that I'm
sharing here on the channel make sure
you subscribe so you don't miss any of
them and I'll be posting new ones or
constantly if you think this is helpful
share with friends and give me a big
thumbs up below and I hope that you have
the best performance for your website
and possible hey if you've got any
questions about what performance
optimization shoot me a line and I'll be
glad to answer them maybe make another
video for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
