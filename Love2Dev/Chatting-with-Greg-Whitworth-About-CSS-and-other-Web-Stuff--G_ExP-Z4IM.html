that's at us we don't have to pay
attention for that necessarily okay
alright anyway so I'm here with Greg
Woodworth he is a program manager what
are they yeah burger manager on web
platform team for Microsoft edge so the
rendering engine specifically primarily
like layout CSS mm-hmm space that's kind
of where I work so yeah I think he's the
CSS guy you also are involved in the
standards that define what's the SS is
yeah yeah something we have a few folks
francois melanie rosen from our team
don't work on the standards body yeah
Fresa so for people who don't know how
CSS is made like the sausage essentially
in the standards what can you kind of
wrap it up in a nutshell what kind of
goes on yeah it's basically we kind of
watch what web developers are doing
trends that they're working on and kind
of pain points if you will for lack of a
better term and try to start tackling
those in ways that are not only possible
and also allow the web to still work but
are also performance and I wouldn't say
necessarily easy to implement but easy
to maintain and like make logical sense
because there's a lot of things that web
developers want to do and like we would
love to make everything just happen but
there's architectures that we have to
take into consideration and you know
like all that wonderful maintenance of
software we have to consider as well so
obviously the big thing for you all
right now is the CSS grid is struck
normally with you all but basically
everybody else yeah but you know it
really started here just some extent
yeah yeah I mean there's
it's like it would be disingenuous to
say it completely started here but when
Internet Explorer the first one to ship
a version of CSS oh yes of CSS grid
there's there's quite a few folks that
have had ideas of grid like for example
we had Samuel we have grid in Sam all
right my impression from the outset is
that you'll kind of spec is the basis to
start and we did basically the person I
was working on so brulee in zamel came
over here and he said hey the web
doesn't have grid and it needs grid and
then we worked a lot with the standards
bodies like you were just mentioning and
they said hey there's all kinds of like
problems with this it's way too like
fixed and they improved it and that's
the great thing about that's a good way
to say some of my frustration with zamel
grid back in the day it was something
didn't feel natural to me for server
yeah and so we got a lot of wonderful
improvements because the web who was
already responsive like we couldn't just
say oh we always know we're going to
have three columns because we don't what
I may end up with only two and so
there's just a wonderful feedback and so
yes I would say that's where things
started to actually gain momentum
because once you get a browser
implementation there have been folks
that have wanted great tech layouts
prior to Microsoft bringing and bringing
a proposal but having proposals is one
thing having actual code shipping is
another kiss like I was saying it proves
that it can be implement and so a lot of
people like don't necessarily want to do
something because they're worried about
performance and the maintenance and all
that other stuff so yeah I would say
that's really what got the ball rolling
but there were other people that had
ideas now as far as evangelism to
developers and I know Rachel's part of
the team and she's really heavy into
with with Jessica some things like being
evangelist have a grid concept take on
this because it's very new and and
everything I think a lot of developers
that mentioned it too are a little
confused about things like well blue
stripes got a grid in it mmm yeah it's
not the same kind of thing yeah no and
then I just just for clarification
it was it's Jen Simmons I don't know if
you're going to a gentleman's is a
designer advocate for Mozilla this
wonderful job Rachel Andrew sir you
mentioned as well all of them CSS
working group members just stick to a
great day a great job and continue to do
a great job on everything layout and
design base getting that information out
there to folks because and I know both
of them have articles about this where
hey I've been using grid forever because
bootstrap has a grid and basically what
that is is it's using the layout
techniques of the time so floats and
grids have been in design Jensen's
actually has a talked about this about
how grids have been a design for ever
like forever and so I mean I mean you
can go entire locker room over there and
we have grid you know grid paper that
you can play things on you know just
catching it out and so yeah this is the
in actual paradigm that is true grid and
so like rather than using floats and
calling it a grid right it's true good
we're actually slicing up the page in a
certain way that you've asked us to and
then you're able place things within
those grid cells it also is
differentiated from flexbox
or voice box is more have some of the
thing one dimensionally going I think
it's really X Y but grids more of a
three-dimensional almost no no so flex
is definitely one-dimensional and
greatest to well I think about it is
two-dimensional is I can make it go
right or I can make it go so there's one
dimensional but yeah I think about an
expose sure sure that is definitely why
we call it one dimensional is because
you only have control of that one
dimension and then as the content lays
out similar to how like block layout you
don't necessarily have that same control
so you can control the flexibility in
one dimension where it's great you have
the control the flexibility in two
dimensions right and that's what really
sets grid apart and I kind of am I say
three dimensions thing my brain I'm
thinking kind of almost a ton of space
adding into you that's the way I can
that's the way my brain works but so
yeah I've been using flexbox a lot I'm
try to get my head around grid it's it's
one of those things I don't have enough
time bandwidth to do what I want to
really just sit down
separate day and get it lit sure it's
it's slowly happening I've got a few
little starter things I'm working with
yeah it's good that I can I've been
doing using media queries to make it
different for different screen sizes and
stuff like that yeah they're still
there's a lot to it and I feel like I'm
a little lost at times and some people
didn't know things happen yeah and I
think I think once it kind of clicks
because great I think the big difference
from grid in comparison to flexes grid
forces you to think about the grid first
rather than the content first at least
in my experience and I'm sure that
there's other designers that think about
differently but that's the the bigger
paradigm shift but once I think you get
some of those foundations fundamentals
on the grid once and then you're kind of
free and they work naturally to go to I
think almost like a golf club set yeah
you know ones ones the driver you get
the whole grid but the flex box is more
up around the green pitching and putting
yeah this is a really enjoy actually
just I saw today I don't know if it's a
brand new article but she was basically
talking about CSS grid one year later
and and I do think that that's a huge
misconception is people think grid came
out that means all of their layouts are
bad and each one like you were just
saying with golf clubs each one has
their place just like a floating images
using float is still the easiest way to
do that and having inline content wrap
around it floats are still your best
solution to that so but we should have
not been using them to create grids yeah
we've got a lot of hacks over the years
and we're saying this is stuff that
chisels that away yeah exactly
much cleaner code much less code and I
know it's I would say that's primarily
been the golden but not only emphasis is
working but many of the working groups
is hey and I mean you can kind of see
that with jQuery and tc39 like basically
stepping in and saying hey there's all
these things that people are having to
work or I want to me just adopt those
you know
the web manifesto kind of abhrush yeah
so another thing that I'm I hadn't seen
a lot of take-up on yet but I think has
got a lot of potential lay out coolness
is the shapes I'm gonna talk about like
the article I wrote a few days ago about
making stars and hearts and stuff but
like making shapes around images yeah to
make it look like it's like a magazine
layout yes yes a shape so that's
actually an awesome specification
Rasen Atanasoff who is our dead lead for
layout actually is one of the spec
editor zon that it's one that we
definitely have a desire to implement
but it's similar to your point we
haven't seen as much demand nor usage on
the web right and that kind of leads
into you know why haven't we worked on
it when we have one of the spec editors
it kind of always boils back to that
like we have only so many people so much
I think it's a combination most of the
web is done by developers who we aren't
designers you know and design folks
probably don't know about the technical
side of things much they don't know it's
there that's a good point
for everything photoshopped this is what
it should look like yeah yeah so maybe
they should start bringing some of those
things back to push the developers are
there but you to the point like you know
that does not be an implement a lot you
have something online with the data
visualization of what is actually in use
yeah we all run it through like the data
crawl by being effectively I think is
right and then you essentially do
gnashing learning just figure out what's
what people actually doing machine
learning is getting us too much credit
okay well I don't do that just basic
statistical analysis yes look at that
I'm like that's very fascinating if
that's gonna use that motion that little
because there's yeah yeah yeah yeah so
we use it primarily so shapes is
actually a great example because we
actually crawl it every browser because
if Microsoft edge doesn't support it
we're not gonna see it so we crawl with
every browser and we've actually worked
with every other browser out there that
they've made fixes so that it works on
our crawler so like huge shout out to
the other browser vendors that's
creative them to allow help us to do
that just so that we can see that data
and it just helps inform and it's only
one data point because people a lot of
times can confuse data and make it say
what they want but it's only one data
point that would take into account
but I like the fact that you share it
publicly yeah because any like I hear a
lot of noise around something and I can
go look at that and go it's only like
point five down to the pages and in that
that was actually why we made it public
was that we were hoping that people
would go to status and then go to this
data page and they would kind of be able
to plan for themselves easily do exactly
what you just said where oh well here's
why they're not doing it and now am I
saying everybody got their make their
pages break in Microsoft edge no but
like I really buy into progressive
enhancement like if a browser supports
something that you want to use similar
to like when we supported ms grid back
in the days
give that to that browser you know allow
the users and I want to have that richer
experience another browsers take note I
mean that's just the way it is and it's
something that I didn't know at the time
as a web developer prior to coming here
how much power I actually had maybe not
just Greg out there building a website
all of us collectively so there's a lot
of cool things in CSS and I'm constantly
finding ways to do things and just like
the newness of things but something that
I do like to use I don't know the LOD
what developers are aware of is like key
frame animations there's been around for
a while yeah and you can do a lot of
really cool subtle things with that what
are some things about maybe key frames
that stick out to you or like I think I
think the biggest thing that sticks out
to me is actually non CSS developers
primarily JavaScript developers and
still do animations every frame rather
than using keyframes in CSS and it's
worth noting you can still use keyframes
in JavaScript because we are able to
heavily optimized CSS keyframes were
able to actually pass those off to the
compositor on a different thread and
just let that animation play and that
allows like scrolling and everything
else that's on the UI thread just be
buttery smooth and so it's if you have
any animations in there is any reason
why you're like reaching for JavaScript
I mean I would be shocked if we're not
necessarily
able to do that in CSS keyframes I know
for example like I know some folks push
it really to its limits but that's also
where the web animations API comes in
and it is so fun user voice like that's
another one I really look forward to
Microsoft exporting but yeah it allows
us to heavily optimize that CSS
keyframes just awesome in my opinion
yeah the animations and javascript has
always been something that's bugged me I
know the background but most part comes
from like jQuery had that building
especially jQuery UI mm-hm
to make the growing and stuff like that
you got transforms yeah I kind of stuff
so got all kinds of cool ways to do it I
still see new code where the JavaScript
is doing it as well yeah I think a lot
of people just reach for the thing they
know I was there comprises it so but you
also talked about they like I'm big
performance will walk it right knows
that so the the layout and compositing
this is still kind of mystery meat to me
a lot of talk and well that's because of
the tooling whether it's your Chrome or
Firefox sure I'm not necessarily sure
what I'm looking at
okay the the dev tools yeah to find
where those bottlenecks are mhm I mean I
know the big yellow slope means
JavaScript right but I know there's like
purple and green that have to do with
the layout and compositing aspects of it
yeah and there's certain like another
key properties you don't want to like
mess with the time like you know animate
because it basically makes you recap the
whole page yeah stuff like that man was
it Jake referring either Jake put
together to come identify some of those
yeah it's a it's basically anything that
forces me out and and I actually have a
talk on this and it's on Vimeo you can
you can find it it's called braces to
pixels
okay and basically I just talked about
how your CSS ends up being painted and
the invalidations that occur for it and
it basically talks about this because
most of CSS and this is the thing that
like I would say is a pro and a con of
CSS most performance problems from CSS
are not just this silver bullet hey if I
just like with images it's like hey if I
can press this down look I say 400 K
right you know basically CSS is death by
a thousand
kind of situation and so what you end up
having to do is find all of those areas
where you're touching the box without
needing to touch the box for you and
having us recalc a ton of styles or hey
audio your styles and fine cells that
may be a developer left in there two
years ago and you no longer need but
we're having to still traverse the tree
and say hey should these Styles applied
to these boxes and it's like you know
and now we have optimizations around
that but every browser is also different
in those optimizations I can say yeah
point-blank like oh I finally figure out
how to get how to drive on CSS to give
me my CSS I'm actually using it yeah and
I can tell you that the performance of
my pages just shot through the roof yeah
just mmm I would I would say that is the
thing that I'm most excited about with
web components and I understand that
that's a little bit down the road for
the true support where your web
developers can just depend on at night
and day all of their users have web
components I understand that but I'd say
that's the thing I'm most excited about
because I'm CSS well it's great like you
hopefully have a very static page
because most of those aren't actually
spinning up a browser and then going and
saying hey was this Hubbard exactly and
so like technically it would come back
and say hey this hover thing wasn't used
and it's kind of like well that's
because you didn't hover the mouse
button right now and and that's similar
to crumbs audits and f12 and their their
dev tools well they're cool like it's
it's very similar thing and that's why
I'm saying oh you know where the
limitations are yeah like I think you
can have it like don't don't take this
class out don't take this for a while
yeah well and then that's and I think
basically web dollars have been fighting
against this problem that's where like
BIM and all this you know objects where
and CSS comes into play because it just
kind of helps you fight that problem of
basically CSS is right in the middle and
so like it's tying all these different
things together so how do you truly
audit what is and isn't used and I think
web components will hopefully at some
point help us solve that problem I
haven't had a chance to really dig into
web components enough I'm good one of
the reasons is I know that there's a lot
of hesitation to get so looking at but
it does make sense cuz you really yeah
it's just a single thing so like when
you
like pull that button out the style
should come with that right and so your
yeah your CSS says we're no longer like
calculating styles for something that no
longer bigger concern is that now it's
going to mean I'm gonna have more CSS
going down and it spectrally duplicated
because I don't know exactly how it's
gonna work out sure I mean I don't think
you'll ever like even in C++ or C sharp
an object-oriented programming language
you still have to you know have style
guides and make sure your whether your
developers are adhering to know what
happens especially Enterprise mm-hmm
developer ad comes in and he uses vendor
X's component library and then he leaves
the next guy comes in you almost vendor
Y and then they just both get dropped in
there but there's a lot of overlap in
the styles yes that's why I see a lot of
cruft kind of building up this okay
definitely and and basically what I
usually say is if you have no auditing
being done at all try at least just
starting twice a year mm-hmm just to go
through and at least understand all the
CSS that you have especially on the team
because they can quickly just add up
because you have a fire you know this
stays you just throw in a class to solve
the problem and then you know another
fire and but maybe somebody rewrote that
and that fire is you know gone standard
long from the do a well exactly and it's
so easy I think as browser vendors to
like forget that at times like that is
reality so you know that's the world I
came from here it's like we need the
Senate this weekend we don't care about
anything else just get it up so without
actually looking at the developer tools
what can I look at in the performance
tab that's going to clue me into like
some CSS issues that maybe I can look at
and to address so I would say the
biggest one the hurdle is first of all
like calculating styles so similar to
you looking and saying that big yellow
slug I think the colors are different in
every browser dump tool but basically
those he has another problem yeah you
see a lot
like CSS or style calculation occurring
and I actually love I'm not sure if
crums does I know ours does it shows
your every elements underneath and so if
you start seeing for example your
recalculating styles on the body a lot
right why like you actually wanna like
be very focused like you only want in
validating of like small yeah yeah
exactly you want to be in validating the
smallest amount you can you don't want
to be involving the entire body and a
lot of times that actually comes back to
JavaScript the majority of the time
really is somebody applying something
that's right on the body that CSS has
been invalidating usually somebody's
touching something with JavaScript right
that is requiring us like you know you
know what is my client distance from
this box to another box and then it's
got to go relay out everything to answer
that question so usually it comes back
to JavaScript another one is if you see
a repeating pattern anywhere yeah I
don't even care how big the formatting
piece so when I'm sorry I'm using
internal and go but style calculation so
like if you have CSS or occurring over
and over again and you can have like
script right before yeah so you see
script CSS and then layout just over and
over again you see a pattern it's it's
very we call it readwrite modifying
usually what that is is hey how big are
you and then it goes it does layout and
then it's like oh I'm 500 pixels and
it's like sweet okay cool well now I'm
going to totally replace you and destroy
you throw you away and insert a new box
that's bigger because I want like some
type of scenario but that's a very
common common pattern people do
sometimes you can't avoid it so I'm
thinking what would it be it's like when
I go to the new site and they've got a
small space where they add in the ads
like this whole yeah shoots everything
down and I'm readjusting also in the air
goes away then this she's sure
another common example and so this is
all again very I have examples of this
in that talk another very egregious
examples where they're painfully obvious
but some I would say practical real-life
example ones that we have is when people
want to do like ellipses and they do it
in JavaScript and so basically what ends
up happening is they check the size of
the box did we overflow yes okay well
now we're going to go in and we're gonna
cut down the characters would be able to
guess what just happened you're no
longer overflowing so now we have to we
layout and that's a good example of
maybe they had no other choice in the
designer you know steadfast and I guess
what locate line clamp is coming in at
17 it included the CSS property to do
ellipses yeah yeah yeah so so that is
actually now shipping an edge because
it's actually a non-standard property
but it's one that's like really popular
and solves a very common developer to
point that's how I know that was there
and I was like really excited to see
that yeah it's a very tacky weird thing
but yeah it solves the problem and weird
that's another good example so we're
trying to standardize into something
called max lines that takes away the
need for like WebKit box and stuff of
that nature but very exciting that at
least that's shipping it's weird but
goodness it's needed on the platform
yeah it's gonna solve a lot of problems
oh yeah okay so especially with
responsive design you really have no
clue yeah yeah yeah that's it's a very
common request and due to all the bugs
and look at length lamp we've been very
you know apprehensive to implement it
but we're finally at that point so
exciting so I'm starting to see style
sheets with CSS variables in there
mm-hmm and I'm pretty excited about that
because I've been used then using less
and now other things kind of seemed like
a very moving sass but hmm
but if I can just do the variables in
the straight CSS I'm because I'm not a
big fan of like pre compiler or
transplant and stuff they so good
because I like working the actual code
is going to be there sure so variables
are really cool maybe people don't know
what variables are
no thing like sass unless you sure can
you give us a little summary of what's
going on yeah so CSS variables also
known as like CSS custom properties they
basically what they are if you never use
sass or less I'm sure you've probably
done some theming on some website at
some point where hey you have primary
secondary colors from some brand and you
have to use that you know 70 times
throughout the site and so you just copy
those hex colors everywhere and then the
designer comes back and says you know
what we actually want to just you know
just a little bit darker and so they do
the find/replace and hopefully they want
true find/replace I've had instances
before where it's you know we only
wanted actually in the header or these
other areas the the beauty of custom
properties is you actually now get the
capability of basically defining a
custom property which is just - - foo
and then you can give it any string it
actually doesn't matter it doesn't you
don't have to go into it thinking hey
this is ain't I'm gonna use this other
background or as a color you can shove
whatever you want in there but normally
makes sense to think about what you're
going to be using it on so in this case
we could take that primary color and
assign it to - - foo and then anywhere
else within the code that we want so
let's say we go color colon we go VAR -
- foo that now references and that's
within the Cascade and I would say the
biggest benefit of CSS custom properties
over variables and sass and lasses that
they're dynamic because within sass and
less once you've compiled it that's its
value for good so if you ever wanted to
change colors or something you would end
up needing to just actually change that
same hex value or key word whatever it
is
whereas this and I'll really replace the
stylesheet exactly now you can just
actually update that custom property on
the fly and it works so I'm pretty
excited about that
yes that's getting pretty broad support
model of mainstream browsers yeah yeah
there's
pretty much everybody supports it at
this point we should at last release and
it's yeah it's it's another good example
something that's just been needed yeah
and it actually what's interesting about
it is how it quickly actually exposed
some Missy gaps and various browsers
where like calc support wasn't necessary
be or wasn't necessary is the wrong word
wasn't necessarily supported well we
actually did a lot of work in supporting
cap within like color modifiers because
quickly we were ahead we're working on a
demo that was using you can use cap to
change the color yeah so you're gonna do
like RGB a you could basically take like
there's plus two yeah exactly and so it
allows you to just do basically color
modification so you could say hey this
is red and then I want to add plus two
so that's pretty cool because I've been
I've been trying to use more and more
material I CSS because a lot of material
is I'm sure and it's got all the mixin
functions affectionately darken -2 so if
that excites you you should go look at
the new college specification this is a
good example of one where I really
really want it and they actually have
those same methods wait and darken where
it's just doing color math okay we're
basically hey if you do - - foo and
that's the color red I actually just
want it darkened by 10% that would be
possible so that's a good example one
I'm really excited about a future color
property
nobody currently implements it but it's
a very exciting because that one yes
everybody go to gecko got a blink tell
them you want it I know designers and
developers would love it I just think
it's one of those things where not many
people have written about it yeah
because it's kind of just in the spec
just sitting there and so it's actually
remarkable again I go back web
developers you have way more power than
I think you realize yeah I think we'll
go back to keyframe at I mean keyframes
you can design your own busier whatever
curve math if you want you can go nuts
with that sure I don't have time to do
yeah it's been a long time I took those
math classes over
you know there are a lot of web
developers that we get bugs from that do
just that yeah and do remarkable jobs
much better at math than I am so yeah
matrix math but yeah more power to a
little bit yeah I love if I couldn't
just say Bezier curve and give it I
think there's a function part two or
sometimes that loss if I should define
yeah I don't I don't have many needs to
use Bezier curves and my day-to-day but
the theming we actually made a demo
that's kind of a silly name but it's
custom properties bootch so you can look
that up on Microsoft edge and it
basically it's a dog sitting in front of
a city and you can make basically the
sunset and everything changes colors and
everything gets that cool and then the
Sun everything goes warm and that's all
just through changing very you know I
was actually sitting down thinking about
how could I make any like weather
progressive way up that would be no
that's a yeah that's a perfect example
of just being able to adjust the you
know basically you're changing the
warmth or the coolness of the color okay
on using Celts within our GBA yeah all
right so is there like any kind of cool
CSS feature that you just really get
excited about they haven't talked about
oh goodness gracious
so that we haven't talked about okay
because I've already talked about a few
of them I get excited for so many of
them I would say one that I'm really
interested in trying to solve is me and
I still don't actually have a great
solution for it besides is starting to
step into the Houdini stuff okay so it's
container queries because I do agree a
lot of web developers have have a desire
for that problem which is because of a
subset of media queries I don't think a
part of the show yeah yeah container
queries is basically hey I actually
don't care about the size of my viewport
to a perfect example of this is if you
ever abused Outlook okay and you have
your left side column with all your
folders if you drag that window
the icons change and they maybe show
text or something yes now you've never
changed the size of the window within
the viewport but you've changed the size
of essentially if you were to rebuild
that in yes yes yeah and so the problem
with it stems from they basically it's
recursion in a lot of respects or it's
really unperformed
the second we'd like because most people
call container queries now rather than
element grades because of the fact that
hey if we put it on the container we've
broken recursion so we no longer have
the recursion problems the problem is
it's really like on performance so if
you take like for example grid and they
have all these auto based things it's
just very own performance it's it's a
very unfortunate thing but I think that
there is a way to solve it and Lego
saying Houdini is a good example of like
trying to go after that and solving in
that way because right now if I did
something like just say a dashboard with
little outside of navigation of icons
yeah the way I've done it in the past is
okay if I'm at this this media query
breakpoint the width then oh don't I
know I need I don't have enough room for
the icons I don't have a reform of the
text and now the icons show yeah I have
to do it big level and just assume that
I have that much space yeah so I would
say I would say a few things one is
there's actually a feature called resize
observer mom currently it is only in
crumb it actually is very similar to a
feature that we removed a I remember
which personally removed it in but it
was actually a elementary size a mess
elementary size and basically what it
does is it fires when that box is
resized and so resize observer the
beauty of it is is a synchronous tom and
basically it just sets up a cue mini
task and so basically what happens is
hey when that box is resized
you've now registered hey I care about
this div and when he gets to the size of
500 pixels let me know and it lets you
know at lea
the match media yeah yeah well it's its
match media except for like it's now in
the middle of the pipeline so what's
happening at layout time and so this is
kind of trying allowing the browser's to
kind of give web developers what they
want but somewhat because basically the
argument against resize observer is it's
in JavaScript yeah people wanted in CSS
the problem is is to answer the question
of is it a certain size happens at
layout which is after CSS has occurred
okay so basically what you know it like
to CSS your title we then going to
layout to resolve all these widths well
those are basically the CSS is the input
into layout that's a very good this is
this for the inside stuff I get it
hanging on with y'all this is well how
do the browser's actually operate what's
the what's the workflow in them yeah and
by talking to y'all I've been able to
design my pages to directly run better
yeah Levi understand the process
underneath a lot better yeah so that's
that's like that kind of stuff is very
valuable I think it's just
understandable this is why this doesn't
work because CSS has already happened
yeah yeah in its I totally get the
premise I get the desire and I would say
I actually used to be one of the folks
that would say well this needs to be in
CSS and at some point I think we'll get
around to that and I guess that's kind
of why I keep talking about Houdini is
because at some point you'll have ways
of writing your own custom things to
teach the parser well what is we see is
this really I know you can excited about
it I've seen some some chatter from
Mozilla and chrome yeah I would say I
don't get super excited about it I've
seen you get excited about it i I did
there are aspects about it I get excited
about because some of it is just so
plain painfully obvious that it's
solving pain points that web developers
want an example so the typed om is
technically in CSS Houdini
okay but basically the tech doe am is
making it so when you do get computed
style and you say I want to know how big
this boxes and it says it's 545 pixels
it tells you that any string okay so
thanks thing like thanks get computed
style I appreciate you
how big that is but now I'm in
JavaScript how do I work with that right
okay well now I need to cut off the PX
and then also like wrap it in to convert
it to an integer and yeah exactly
and type - and basically it's now just
an object that web developers are used
to adjacent object that says hey for
this CSS property here's the types that
it's going to contain and we're just
going to shove it in this object where
you're already going to use it so you're
just gonna actually say hey element dot
you know I can't actually remember all
the syntax I'm sure the spec has changed
so pray actually isn't good to even say
what it is but basically you would be
able to say hey what is your background
color and it will say 45 comma 65 35 and
it'll say and then there's another item
that says a unit and it'll be RGB it
sound like it's already broken up so you
can manipulate it and work with it
okay right from there and that's a good
example of I think some things with in
CSS Houdini may be a little bit harder
and are maybe a little bit loftier I
think that they're still doable but
they're going to be harder problems for
us to solve whereas some of these are
just things the web platform means in
general like it just make api's that we
kind of have right now that are a little
bit pokey just perfect now another good
example that I was just on Twitter
probably excited about making one that
you saw is the parser API which is every
engine has a CSS parser and yet so many
of us end up writing like that pixel
example I just gave you letting a subset
of the parser so that we can get
something out of it and why not just
make it so I can pass you an entire
stylesheet if I want to and you return
me basically a set of tectile objects
and so that's why it's the reason that
one's kind of been delayed is because
we're waiting for the tech time to kind
of okay flush out but that's a good
example of stuff that's coming out of
buddhini that while they may not be
solving the initial like true goals of
Houdini which is to allow you to extend
CSS okay they're great stepping stones
to just improving the platform as we
know it now okay so I know another thing
is kind of was a variable foreign server
yeah yeah so this is actually coming in
at 17
so shipping soon and very exciting
Microsoft has been heavily involved in
the open type spec folks much smarter
than me and fonts I've been working on
this and we actually have some wonderful
fonts already in Windows that are
variable fonts in and what it allows you
to me the big takeaway for variable
fonts as performance right basically we
had web fonts come in and the excitement
around them designers like finally you
know everything I've been doing in
prints I can finally do now they throw
50 of them on there exactly the web
developers are like wait a second why is
it taking like 10 seconds for my my web
page to render more the designer saying
yes it may be immediately renders in
case of IE because we show it if even if
thought isn't downloaded but I need an
edge sorry and and and then it like
switches out you know and it looks it
looks not good yeah exactly
ya know this flash of unstyled text yeah
yeah and but but basically what variable
fonts allows is the font designers now
can just have a set of axes so rather
than downloading 50 different fonts you
download that one and then you're
telling that fonts hey the width axis I
want you to you know stretch to make it
so that your the with the the wider type
of texture bolder text or hey I want you
to wit to be really narrow and be really
convinced and these are all animatable
it's very similar to the variable so
that we're talking about earlier so
rather than it being separate font files
we're only done letting water so be like
soy segue then segue bold yes different
instances and it's not where I'll be one
fun it's not like with what I've done in
the past is with taking font Ella which
is a service mm-hmm and then just take
the glyphs out of fun awesome that I
need to put the answers will have a bomb
in white 12-person I mean that's pretty
something you'll still know what to do
it's it's still a good good
to be in but this would allow if you end
up having let's say you're using likes
to go everywhere which currently I don't
believe is called a segue I'm not going
to claim I know how to pronounce it the
best way somebody on the phones team
will have to have to step in and correct
me probably different but yeah bond
shrift is one that we do ship in box as
of last release and we've now have the
plumbing through to edge we can control
it with font variation settings within
CSS we also support font optical sizing
currently Safari is the only other
browser that supports that and what that
does is it changes the x height and also
makes the strokes thicker so that it's
more legible at like smaller font sizes
and it just keeps its it's a it's
designed by the font designer correct so
it's more legible and it's just it's
just a very exciting time because I
think we're going to start getting more
of those creative designs that designers
have always wanted to do out of the web
because now we can potentially done with
maybe one only two font files but they
still have that extreme range of
condensed you know extra condensed thing
wide extra wide extra bold italic all
I've been you know one or two font files
rather than meeting you know seven to
ten a few of my colleagues and I are
actually working on a guide for variable
plots that actually digs into this quite
a bit we should hopefully be shipping
able to the next week or two yeah yeah
and it's a goes through all of these
things and shows them what how like
beautiful you can animate these variable
fonts all the different axes just it
unleashes a lot of creative capabilities
there on the web that well we had that
before they weren't performance and we
know performance is money and so a lot
of people cut back on things yeah so was
there anything else like like that that
developers anywhere those emerging and
some emerging because there's always new
stuff like I constantly body sure
there's new things so so have you heard
of
Oh okay I've got that on my big to-do
list so that I can find images until I
need them yes so I would say that's one
that I don't see used enough yet and and
it's a good performance technique where
for those of you unaware basically it
allows you to define you can either by
default use the viewport and you can
then say this box let me know when it
intersects the viewport but you can also
define and this is where I get excited
because I can define my own viewport so
I can make one box of viewports
and I've actually I have a coupe and
example of this so before we support
what get like BAM
I would use that to basically detect
overflow this is a similar to where I
also I kind of call into question
container queries because a lot of times
people say they care about the weather
but that's not actually the case they
actually care about overflow and so
basically you can use intersection
observer to watch overflow and so the
second that it overflows that's actually
when you want the Styles to change you
don't actually just want them always to
stun to change based on the size because
you may not be overflowing you may
always want that you actually don't know
if it's 400 pixels or 300 pixels you
don't know that because a lot of us
build sites that are dynamic so how do
you know when you should show that I
kind of shouldn't you only care when it
overflows all right and so I actually
have a top coming up CSS day in
Amsterdam where I get into this very
different techniques and that's one of
them as intersection observer and only
firing when you actually need it rather
than and that's a good example of if you
set those pixel sizes you could be
recomputing because you're smaller than
that width when it actually doesn't
change anything to the end-user yeah so
when you do any other kind of cool new
features that are getting supported
across the board or I'll say something
getting getting supported across the
board I mean I what's something you
think developers need to be aware so
ships I think is a good example of one
that people need I would decide for
people to start asking for resize
observers another good example goes
while I understand it's not in CSS it
solves your container a problem okay
and I understated to Jess and a lot of
people really don't want that
disconnected but it it's also in a
performant way kind of now and yeah i
think i think CSS is actually really in
a great position there's still work to
be done but like with grid shipping you
know variables and a lot of the Houdini
stuff coming down down the pipeline we
just have I feel like we're in a really
good place like it's almost like a lot
of the things we're wanting is a nice to
haves nine necessities I would say a
little bit subgrade for grid is
something that I think we need to tackle
and figure out when it comes to spec I'm
not necessary talking about implementing
at this point but ensuring that the
specification I'm glad you're saying
there's that's something I have sort of
thought about I'm like it'd be nice to
define this little you know I think I
think I think I know what you're talking
about like an asp.net world like a
master page and then a little layout
inside but basically what's up grid is
is hey I have a grid and right now the
only things that you can place on the
grid are its direct children of the grid
and dust grid items and sub grid says
technically you may have something
that's multiple levels deep that I still
want to snap to that grid okay so that
may be what you're referring yeah but
that's basically and what what is one of
the larger things that I foresee the
working group continuing photographer
because I know there's wonderful folks
the spec editor czar already looking to
that Rachel Andrews Jen Simmons looking
at that another good example for grid as
well I know Jen Simmons says ideas for
styling of grid areas even though you
may not have a
to go into that as well as something
region space that's another one that I
wanted to see throw a non-breaking space
character in there right well well and
then that's that's kind of I would say
what they want to avoid because most
what I do that to throw in an empty div
so they can place it so they can style
that contained right but you know
technically under the hood we can have
boxes there already so maybe we can just
style those yeah I would say it's a very
exciting space but I just feel like when
I look at CSS when I first joined
Microsoft edge and I look at it now we
are in such a noob remarkable but I
should go was that what did you it's
roughly four to half years ago okay but
I mean you think about it we when I
first joined the first feature that I
worked on was upgrading our
implementation from MS flexbox to the
actual current standardized flex which
is a huge difference and then grid we
got updated responsive images there's
just so many things that on the passive
and responsive images my my violent
person besides with Jason Briggs meters
using effect I don't know there's a lot
of ICG folks that I use it and and now
that it's kind of in the trunk of like
WordPress and other systems which I
actually think is the right way to do it
where people aren't having to really
think about it issues right
I upload the image and it takes care of
it for me I think that's the right
approach for the responsive images but I
just look at how far front end has come
and I just feel like yes there's things
that we should go tackle but I feel
we've made a lot of progress so I look
forward to the progress we make in the
next four years yeah so yeah it's
definitely exciting and it gets more
exciting all the time I think - I think
we may be developers have made it too
complex
they don't know that necessarily from
the CSS and layout enough of them know
about that yet but they made the
JavaScript side of it too complex okay
there's too many tools I mean lately so
yeah any steps
agree with that I would say that there's
there are times that it's useful and
yeah I think there are times where hey I
just wanna you know play with this
little you know demo I shouldn't have to
NP installed you know seven hundred
packages and built I was on one project
and every time you changed anything in
the JavaScript or anything in more ago
there was a two-minute no build process
it had to go through before you could
see it yeah because there were so many
things they wanted to do it yeah yeah
it's it's a I think I think it's one of
those things where JavaScript is I would
say just web development general is
starting to try to learn what C++
developers I've had for years like you
know we've had testing we've had build
tools we've had all those other things
so it's not like this is new it's just
more of how do you make it so it's
useful it's not just getting in the way
right and I mean I went through that
same phase every single website I built
had to have a CMS and that's not every
website needs a CMS and so like my own
personal site it's just static the only
the only thing that I actually have I do
have a build step two for you here but
but I basically run doc pad which I
learned from a colleague here which is
basically I can read it in markdown yes
and then they just converted over to
HTML and that's it like essential in my
work but because I just like I don't
need all these dynamic things popping in
and it slows everything down and I don't
change my site enough anybody so I just
think that's something that what
developers are learning and I think
we're starting to see these I mean you
think they had angular and then react
came in and said hey we can give a
little bit better and then you have
pre-act that said hey we can do the the
majority of what you have but faster
right and lighter and then oh by the way
now we have you you but I think the
summer will have some policy and I think
that's okay I think that's one of the
about web development is that we do have
such competition competition yes we end
up with I think some pretty decent
products to development in and the great
thing is you don't have to use them yeah
exactly I mean that's that's I think one
of the great things you don't have to
compile so yeah so Gregg I really
appreciate your time yeah yeah thanks
for sharing with everybody has always
been useful and yeah I hope it's been
useful
oops CSS I think is a lot misunderstood
a lot overlooked but I have the vast
majority of developers especially ones I
tend to interact with it user groups and
conferences and stuff like that yeah The
Economist I think I spend the majority
of my time tweaking what I call it
pushing pixels with CSS to you know
especially with our memory getting
response at this I think that a lot a
lot more the type of matrixes let me ask
you a question then if you don't mind
okay
okay so um how do you test all of your
different browsers I use the chrome
responsive thing okay and I just sit
there and go through it you know I also
have a small device lab that I've
accrued yeah and I deployed up to this
server and pulled up on those and what
does it actually feel like because I
don't think it's important to actually
have a device yeah and to see what
that's gonna be like because most
developers you see too many developers I
think actually sigmak books that don't
have touch on yeah and something maybe
deploy yeah right yeah and it's hard to
debug on the phone so there's just like
no inside of that in my opinion yeah
there was better insight back in 2010
then I can get now like winery or
whatever helped me and that was like
what manifold we go ahead the other tool
that allowed you to get into my Apple is
now PW a builder you're gonna spin the
wrong person this is a great question
for like Krupa or krill great I think
Greg 2d or whatever built it okay yeah
it was like for some months ago that you
launch it over here I can't remember
where it was
I feel like a terrible Microsoft I was
like it was like a new version of wine
three okay I haven't actually seen to
get ready for it but I would love to
have developer tools easily integrated
into the phones there they do it with
Android and Chrome but you know I will
say I've seen like Visual Studio do a
lot of work and I like a we have done
like remote debugging windows hardware
it was hard for not Microsoft people to
do that okay yeah they didn't like to
open it up to us okay so we could do the
emulator which is terrible but I don't
like emulators in general the Android
illusion that I've worked with have
always been terrible - yeah no I
definitely agree on actually having a
few physical devices there just so many
androids that gets impossible have all
of them I don't think you have to have
all like just a few yeah I've got I've
got a very old crappy one of them did I
probably have to turn out of the year be
honest with you but I've got - I got a
Samsung three I've got a no there was a
little lower powered Samsung then I'll
get my own pixel - yeah but I've also
got a nexus 7
I've got another tablet that I've had
for six years now yeah so okay you know
our crew probably 15 devices I could
potentially just run so that's another
because no you know the chrome
responsive design tool mhm
I would say gives me pretty close to the
to the gym to making the hole in the
green all right yeah but getting those
devices are and actually testing it yeah
I also ask people to you know pull up on
your phone if I say they have like a
different phone because I said I still
got an icon before I'm gonna block one
of the newer ones so you know get
friends that have someone else it'll
keep bring that up for me yeah you know
what we used to do like six or seven
years ago I would go down the street to
the best bar and play them their phones
so that was like in the early days I
didn't have I don't have one phone at
the time yeah I was racing to build a
product we're trying to launch a new
service mm-hmm it was my first but it
was really the first single page app I
did and we launched with like 400 pages
in the side you could see where's the
what has a lid on this device in this
device because they kept telling me
they're going to buy me the devices I
run down there at lunch and go -
goodness gracious
like I'm getting stressed out it was it
was a lot of fun but you know I built
I built the spa infrastructure for that
way before any of the colorfast we
framers forever thought of there there
was no term single page app I just said
this is how it has to be done because I
was under mandate do a live app that
looks like an ad about contra and he
figured it out I've you know I think it
I learned I had to dump jQuery which
filled me at the time yeah because
jQuery just blows so slow especially
over 3G yeah and like even read manga
with tons of the jQuery foundation yeah
I actually had learned with him at the
time he said that at that point iPhone
wouldn't even cache it using browser
cache because they cut everything off
with 25 kilobytes anything above that
kind of cached on browser cache and it
was I think 29 30 kilobytes compressed
and like we just have all kinds of
performance issues because of this stuff
I know it's a CPUs or you know as far as
the JavaScript engines could do it
yes that's not as bad as it was but
still is an issue that I don't think
developers appreciate yeah I know the
chrome guy was a couple years ago did a
demo where they put it on dry got put on
dry ice to get the overclocking of the
phone so the faster
oh goodness so but no yeah then I think
there's a phone I agree you have to kind
of touch them few um and actually like
is that truly a response it like is
responding to my gesture well but the
layouts might not necessarily be
represented by that you don't also have
a little bit of their response in the
developer tools yeah but it has I don't
think it's nice I've been maintained as
a first class thing over the years I
think that's a better like discussion to
have with like Jacob Rossi who works on
our doubles because yeah I can't really
speak to well no I know I know and
Andy's team put it in when he was in
charge balls yeah yeah but it was it was
like one of those things I did they
threw it in there but then they got
sidetracked on other important things
yeah and they just never really got you
know full of it really deserves sure
sure so it happens yeah exactly
but those kind of things are super
helpful when I'm actually what I call
pushing the pixels yeah yeah yeah when
you're doing your initial work yeah I
mean it makes a ton of sense like I
actually I'm to give away the keys but
yeah I wouldn't mind just having like a
multi up you know where you can have
just multiplied with multiple windows
right yeah you can have your 1024 and
then just you know have like three or
four others a difficulty orientation we
failed this single viewport I guess is
my point there we can make a whole
launcher to have more well but then I
guess that's kind of what I was trying
to avoid is you don't necessarily want
you know for Microsoft edges or crumbs
for that matter open you just want that
one viewport split up at the mall
suppose could then you could have your
live refresh on that single file you
know what I mean yeah I just I think
that would be Ben if there's something
else I started playing with in the last
few weeks though I'm kind of regretting
I didn't could've been wanting this for
a long time didn't dot me to do it was
in chrome you can do the worst picture
you can actually make it live editing on
the file system so basically the chrome
dev tools now my editor oh yeah yeah I
didn't realize it was as good as it was
because you know I was changing you know
colors or sizes or whatever and it was
immediately being reflected yeah there
yeah
that was like so many below so I know
vias code uses that same whatever it can
you know yeah yeah so that you can just
see it live happening they've done a
remarkable job yeah the to learn that
the asp.net came team care was five or
six years ago through using WebSockets
I've never really liked because it
through jQuery in there and it would
step on some things at times and
especially since it was a longer version
of jQuery from whoosing or didn't want
jQuery in there I was I would because I
wrote my own little jQuery library
called dollar bill it was like twelve
cats and it would step on that you know
I would get bugs the Liberals were bugs
until we tell what using it and stuff so
I just yeah I stopped using it because
they wrote that dependency in there yeah
yeah assumptions are bad yeah exactly
but it was running in the same it was
potentially running in the same space
the global space so they're stepping on
what I had yeah so yeah and that's
that's just a general that practice is
having multiple versions of the same
library which you see a lot yeah yeah
yeah time especially I got and WordPress
tanks or a few bugs with other plugins
and those come bundled with jQuery right
well I see it I see it may just be out
net so it's because the the master and
child page scenario where you have one
developer who's working on the nested
page and he drops all the JavaScript
references in it but the master page
also hasn't yeah it doesn't work on the
other occasionally yeah yeah yeah it's
pretty good pretty bad yeah so well I
really appreciate your talking about
doing my pleasure
yeah and hopefully this is useful for
everybody oh I enjoyed it good deal so
I'm gonna try the interview and some of
these guys a little more frequently over
the next few months and if you got
questions just yeah and I think
I don't know if you're on Twitter I've
got fifty four thousand tweets that day
seven yeah there you go there yeah yeah
I'm on Twitter as well at Gregoire you
hit me up if you have any questions and
one link text and the MS edge dev
Twitter handle is a great way to yes yes
hit that up as well
and people will realize if these guys
really want feedback they've got
multiple three channels from edge
they've got the user voice account yeah
the they must edged out of occasionally
I'll do have asked me anything or
something yeah yeah yeah we would keep
that one a little bit yeah we don't do
that one as often because it comes with
make as many comments as you can imagine
although you know yeah we haven't done a
