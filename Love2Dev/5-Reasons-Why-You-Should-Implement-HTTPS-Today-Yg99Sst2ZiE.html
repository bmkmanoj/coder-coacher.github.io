sure you really need to have an ssl
certificate for your site we're going to
tell you five reasons why you have no
more excuses to be insecure
hey guys Chris was owner of lots of
death here with you today we're going to
talk about the secure that's right
implementing HTTPS for your website now
traditionally HTTPS or hypertext
Transfer Protocol secure has been really
reserved for say the ecommerce sites or
sites that have been collecting like
vital information for example a social
security number however this is quickly
changing these days because search
engines and browsers and many other
factors are coming into play potentially
requiring sites to be secure these days
so we're look at five reasons why all
sites should have HTTPS now the first
reason you want to do that is to build
customer trust in your brand and to do
that browsers will indicate if your site
is secure they will give them visual
queuing to let them know that the site
secure but they'll really let them know
if they think the site's not to cure for
example the latest versions of Chrome
will now visually indicate if the site
is insecure just because it has a
password field so if you have a login
form on your town anywhere in your site
then your page will probably show up is
insecure to the person using it and
they'll probably see or think twice
about you know even just logging into
their account and if they have if they
sense that you're collecting credit
cards or any other kind of sensitive
data they'll also do the same thing so
they're getting much more aggressive in
showing what they consider to be
insecure sites now how do you make your
site secure well your server needs to
have a security certificate there's
going to be known traditionally as an
ssl or secure socket layer certificate
they can will probably also see a TLS
which is another transport security
layer certificate which is really more
what's accurately
days now you have to set these up on
your server now the process really goes
through a verification step and it
doesn't have to be as strenuous as it
was in the past for example 15 20 years
ago when i was saying that certificates
for clients we had to have proof of
business with licensing agreements and
all those kind of things with
municipalities or state tax documents it
was kind of a rigorous process and the
certificates were rather expensive back
then as well and there are some other
technical issues that may be more
complicated to issue and also implement
it's not really the case so much anymore
so that barrier is kind of dwindled okay
and so that's kind of big one of the
other points we want to make is if
they're not cost participative and
passed it was several hundred dollars a
year to have a certificate and while you
still can buy certificates that are
several hundred dollars a year those
tend to be what I would consider very
complex certificates and they also tend
to have like a insurance policies it's
built in with them pretty much most
certificate providers will have some
sort of liability insurance built into
it but the more you pay obviously more
insurance you get now all of love the
devs websites even our quick launch
website package which is about 300 x300
are secure they all have SSL implemented
on them every site that we manage is SSL
and we can do that because security
certificates are not cost prohibitive
and the technical requirements to get
them set up not as high barriers they
used to be so that eliminates one of the
biggest barriers to implementing HTTPS
now the other thing that you really
another one you look it's important is
search engine rankings both Google and
being has publicly stated that beam SSL
is a ranking factor so when all things
are equal if your site's secure and your
competitors or is not you will rank
above them in the search listings now if
you've gone to a lot of effort to build
a good back
infrastructure to an on page off page
SEO and all kinds of technical SEO if
you're still missing ssl this is a very
simple piece of your SEO strategy to
implement and the benefits go well
beyond SEO as well because customers
will trust you more when they see that
ssl now that one of the reasons why the
browser's want that is no because it
does indicate a better user experience
that it really indicates true ownership
of the site and typically search engines
spammers are not going to go out and get
an ssl certificate because there is an
identity verification step involved in
that and they don't want to be known at
all to the search engines and they want
to keep that private so if a site is not
secure then it's a bigger signal that
maybe it's not as authentic as site as
it plays out to be so go ahead get that
script it so you'll get that search
engine boost next deliver not SSL or
HTTPS is now faster than regular
unsecured HTTP of our HTTP and for years
this has not been the case because when
you have a certificate II significant
employee both the browser and the server
have to do essentially encryption and
decryption processes on that step but
certificate has to be transported back
and forth so there's there's a little
bit of extra overhead to it however if
you've implemented HTTP to which we
highly recommend you reckon you
implement HTTP to your site will load
faster being SSL than non SSL especially
over HTTP two now here's another funny
thing you can't be HTTP and use HTTP to
because HTTP two requires a secure layer
so you have to have that to turn that
piece on and this will give you a
significant speed and performance
benefit all modern browsers support HTTP
two and most server infrastructures do
however you probably will have to turn
HTTP you too long and it may require you
migrating from
older server and your providers
infrastructure to a newer server because
they probably won't go back on the
retrofit old servers also if you're in
the windows world only Windows Server
2016 supports HTTP two and since there
was a big gap between the previous
version of the server operating system
and the latest one which has only been
out for a few months at this point most
places have not got those set up yet
however if you've got a CDM over top of
your website's most CDM do have a key
could be two on you may have to turn it
on and because it may not be on by
default expecially if your site was
already configured finally you really
want to be https because most modern web
AP is require this to turn all the new
features on for example if you want to
be a progressive web app you have to
have HTTPS sound enabled on your site or
else the browser's don't feel like they
can necessarily trust you so they are
going to give you those API benefits
that you would get if you were secure
because they want to have that level of
trust so you're not gonna be able get
into the app stores I mean I can be able
to have access to some of the newer AP
odds like push notification API etc
you've got to have those things turned
on because that gives a browser an extra
level of trust and who you are just like
the search engines are looking for that
as well so to wrap this up five reasons
why Union you should go ahead and
implement HTTPS today our browsers will
go either way to indicate if your site's
not secure it's not cost prohibitive or
technically prohibitive anymore search
engines are looking for secure sites and
giving them better search engine ranking
ssl sites are now faster than non secure
sites when you use HTTP two which is
another thing you should turn on and
modern web api s are now making it a
requirement to be secure to have those
features turned on for your sites to
take advantage of so if your site's not
secure and you needed security
