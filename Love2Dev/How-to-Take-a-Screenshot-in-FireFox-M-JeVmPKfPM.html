love to death and in this video I want
to go over a neat little feature that I
found in Firefox to do screenshots now
last week I posted a video on how you
could use the new fullscreen screenshot
capabilities built into Chrome and as I
was kind of playing with Firefox doing
some debugging this morning I just
happened to notice something in the top
right corner of Firefox that I thought
was kind of cool that is the ability to
do screenshots now they've taken a
totally different approach theirs is not
part of the developer tools but in the
top right corner if you see the little
scissors up here you've got this enabled
I'm cannot recall if I actually enable
this by hand or not don't know that I
did I don't see anything here for that
catches my eye but you never know I
don't think I did though but anyway so I
got Firefox screenshots it might be a
plugin I don't think it is though but
look at this it's kind of cool the eyes
follow me around that's kind of neat but
what I can do is I can actually just
select and I can drag this around they
get different sizes I can move it around
the screen which is really cool now
another thing that I noticed with it is
as I move around it's going to actually
highlight the different elements that
I'm focused on and I think that is
really nifty say Luiz so here we go just
do my entire header now I can either
download the screenshot and that's going
to save it in my download folder or I
can take another screenshot here this
time I'm gonna do a little custom one
here I can save it essentially to a
little cloud space and there we go and
if you notice here I've got this little
my shots thing and you can see it's got
a collection of these now it says it's
gonna keep these for about 14 days and
this is a public URL and which I think
this can be extremely handy if you need
to
send a quick screenshot to a colleague
or maybe a client to show them something
it does give you a public URL to just
pass off so I think that's pretty cool
and I think this is very easy to use now
the one caveat is obviously I can't do a
full screen screen shot but as we saw
last week the what's built into Chrome
right now
not necessarily the best thing yet so
anyway I like this this is pretty cool
pretty easy to use and I think this can
come in extremely handy so if you think
this is useful let me know by hitting
the like button and getting questions
about this maybe put them in the comment
section below and we'll see what we can
do about that and if you think it's
useful
hey share it with a friend or two and so
what they think as well hopefully this
will add value to your web development
workflow and this krislov the owner of
love to dev thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
