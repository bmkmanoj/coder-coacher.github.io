for the desktop to prompt you to add
your progressive web application to the
desktop and on mobile Chrome for Android
will prompt the user to add your
progressive web application to their
home screen based on some heuristics
that the chrome team currently is
running with and I say currently because
they tweak the algorithm a little bit
based on basically what they've been
learning but they have not enabled this
feature on the desktop yet however you
can manually override that and I think
this is a good practice for developers
and to do that you need to go to the
chrome flags and this is where you can
enable a lot of the future and
experimental features and I'm actually
using the full the the regular chrome
that's released I think chrome 63 is
where I'm at right now and obviously
you'll have possibly a different set in
Chrome Canary and definitely all nightly
but to do that you need to open up in
the address bar chrome colon whack-whack
flags and this will bring up a giant
list of things that you can turn on or
off and you'll need to scroll down looks
like about halfway where I'm at and this
is gonna get you to where you need to be
now I did try to search for this and in
there in like none of these came up so I
don't know if their search is not
working all that great or not but when I
did type that in there I got like
nothing so I did scroll down to find
what I needed and what I want here is
the app banners which is this first one
and you could also just go directly to
it and I will put a link to this in the
in the description below but enable the
display of progressive web application
banners and prompt the user web app from
the shelf or whatever okay so we're
gonna do is choose default change it
from default to enabled and now that's
going to be enabled now you will need to
relaunch Chrome to make this work so I'm
gonna do that and hopefully things do
not blow up on me all right
so we're gonna go open up chrome there
goes and we're right back to where we
were so this is good all right okay so
this is what you get when you bring up
this page okay so I'm gonna bring up my
live furniture site which I have been
tweaking a lot lately and I need to test
to see if this works or not so let's do
this will load the live demo and if all
goes well there we go
add this site to your shelf to use at
any time and if I do that it's gonna
prompt me just like it would on a mobile
phone and if I go to the desktop
I should see it there it is right there
if we launch it it should launch without
the browser chrome it's still using
Chrome but we the browser Chrome will be
like the address bar and status bar and
things like that
and you can see that we've got our
progressive web app now so this is good
this is what we're wanting to see and
that's how you can enable this feature
and be able to test if you were at the
home screen prompt will work or not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
