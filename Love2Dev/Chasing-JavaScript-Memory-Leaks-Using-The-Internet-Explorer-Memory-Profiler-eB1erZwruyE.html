channel this is Chris Love and today I'm
gonna show you how to chase some memory
leaks using Internet Explorer's memory
profiling tools today I'm joined by my
friend McCool Harry McCool is a
developer Express product manager and
works with developers building rich
client applications so McCole how are
you doing today I'm doing great Chris
thanks for having me on because as you
remember last month you and I we were
chatting about JavaScript memory leaks
well I had asked you about them and you
said you know what it's an important
topic and that we should actually
discuss this and you show an example so
can you show me what's going on with
JavaScript memory leaks and how you
chase them down because it seems kind of
kind of odd right I mean these
client-side application these days right
how does one figure it out okay well
it's a little bit of a dark art but what
I'm going to show you is I've got an
application here and I've got a pretty
standard memory leak pattern in play
here and I'm going to show you how I
chase it down I'm going to teach you a
little bit about some of the the tricks
that I've kind of come up with to kind
of chase these down the first one I want
to point out is I'm using Internet
Explorer's in private browsing every
browser has the ability to do something
like an EM private chrome is called it
incognito and what that does is it kind
of disables some of the plugins and
extensions as well as kind of give us a
kind of a clean base to start from so I
always want to start from like a clean
fresh browser the way I don't have any
kind of interference going on from like
previous sessions or our pages or
something that might have caused
something else to happen just gives me a
clean place to start that's good idea
and we're going to go to the these are
the f12 tools the developer tools and
Internet Explorer now all the browsers
have these and they all have something
similar to this memory tab here and
they're going to give us the ability to
do a profiling session and they'll all
show us is kind of graph that's being
built here and it's just this kind of
the base memory now 150 save them eggs
is quite a bit and they all kind of show
a different amount for the same page
which can be a little scary
this isn't because the page is actually
hundred fifty-seven Meg's as we'll see
here in a minute it's only about
nineteen Meg's for the page but I've
actually been using this browser kind of
building up for the this recording a
little bit and it's so it kind of has
built up a little memory footprint so
that's why I like to start with a clean
fresh one so let me stop this and we'll
start it from scratch and what we're
gonna do is we're gonna take a heap
snapshot and what that's gonna do is
it's it you see the memory spiking
that's the this profiling tool blogging
all the the memory allocations
associated with this page now like I
said we're right at nineteen megabytes
just under it for this page and we've
got you know like nearly seventy six
hundred objects that are defined now
this is why I like the Internet Explorer
profiler I think it makes it a little
easier to get to the possible causes of
memory leaks and it says right now we've
got one potential issue and I'm just
going to go ahead let's stop the overall
profile and it's actually kind of
building a little deeper dive into our
memory footprint and what it looks like
right now so I'm just gonna kind of
drill into this and we can see this is
pointing off to a div and it's saying
this is a disconnected note node and
this is kind of a common thing in spas
because you want to be adding and
removing dom elements as the application
is used and so a lot of times developers
will set references to those dom nodes
like even a jquery reference or anything
like that but they don't do it in a way
that can be cleaned up
and so the garbage collector can't clear
that memory reference up thus releasing
the memory therefore you get the memory
leak now know in this case this
particular one is not an actual memory
leak so what kind of let that one go but
what I'm gonna do is show you how to
chase them down to find the one that is
a real memory leak for us the these does
profiling first of all is it possible in
other browsers yes absolutely all right
and I and I understand like for example
maybe you might not be as nice and let's
take
or Firefox in terms of long I say nice I
don't know if I think Chrome I'm not
sure if it has a timeline I I you know I
use Chrome and I've seen this profile
it's a little different in there right
but but what really treats me is you
said when you clicked on that number one
item right that's really interesting so
IE or at least this profiler tool is
actually doing some smarts for you and
saying oh hey I've looked at your Dom
and it looks like you've got an issue in
there so that's that's pretty sweet yeah
it's it kind of helps I think the the
user experience in tracking these down I
think it does a little you know a little
better job visualizing it like in Chrome
with our the the last time I tried in
chrome I think there was like red lines
and yellow lines and it wasn't like
obviously clear so and and they seem to
change the way they do this a little bit
like every release or so so this has
been pretty consistent and these tools
actually started off in Visual Studio
and then they dropped him in here so
they've they've they're kind of amateur
alright so what I'm gonna do they took
the snapshot on the home page here and
this is this page has got about 40
images in it and what I'm gonna do is
I'm just gonna go drill into the taken
here and this is taking us to the movie
details which should be a lot smaller
because we only have one image and the
text now but the reason why the images
are important and it really shows how a
memory leak can build up really quickly
because images are in a really highly
compressed format when they're in files
but you know when a browser or Photoshop
or paint.net actually loads the image it
decompresses it and that image is you
know five or ten times the size of what
it is in a file and so that's what
actually gets rendered and that's why
the memory footprint can be rather large
so we started off just under 19 Meg's
now we're up to 19 point to notice we
have a 2 here instead of a 1 let me do
one more view because I always want to
do it before during and after sort of
kind of experience so I can kind of
really compare what's going on
see when you chase these down you want
to actually do things in your
application and take snapshots as you go
through each point all right so you can
see we still have the two
I'm gonna stop our profiler here and I'm
going to drop into this real quick
there's a lot of data that this tool is
parsing through now before we had this
one which we kind of drilled into but
now we've got this new one that's under
a spa now when I say it's a dark art I
know this code really intimately so I
know where to go find this stuff now
with a little if you were and had found
this memory leak and tried to find it
you would probably found yourself a
little lost and I found myself lost
trying to chase memory leaks and other
people's code I think it's so dark that
I have no idea what that pxs container
home means exactly I would call you up
and say Chris what the heck is going on
right and I see the I see these comments
and some of the JavaScript libraries on
github that I follow people trying to
find memory leaks and they get lost -
and I think you have to have a little
intimate knowledge of the code you're
chasing through now I know exactly where
this markup is and we're gonna go look
and right here I've highlighted the
mark-up already I know what it is
it's it not home view and well let's go
over here I also know where this
variable is defined I've got this
function called setup panorama and in
here I'm studying a local variable I say
local it's local to this particular in
this case it's a controller object so if
you're familiar with I can be see I've
got these base controllers and I'm
setting it equal to a new instance of
the panorama library or another it's
actually another object I won't go into
the details of that but inside of there
there's actually a reference to that Dom
node that can't get released because
this variable right here is out of scope
so Chris could you go back to the
profiler real quick so and you know like
I said I don't know your code at all I
haven't seen the sample code obviously
if it was my project I'd have an idea
like you do but you know somebody might
be wondering okay so you've got this
disc
didn't know room right and it's just
pointing at this div element that's all
it's pointing to you don't really have
any other much richer information so how
did you go from that div to that object
variable for panorama well okay so I
knew the code like I said I knew whether
I knew where this possibly was in the
mark-up fact I've got a few other
references to a similar one now the
thing is I know this old scope this is
the reference an internal variable to my
spa library that references the
controller for the view that was being
replaced so on a single page application
you go from view to view to view to do
things right
so in this case I went from the home to
a movie detail and then to a search view
so this old scope is the actor is the
controller that is the previous view
because if I'm as I'm switching views I
want to instantiate the new controller
for the new view and on the way out I
want to essentially close out the old
controller from the old view because
there's ich close out what happens for
that only what I want to do I want to
delete it effectively is what I'm doing
right because it's no longer needed so
the way I do the transitions in there
have a little dance that I have to do to
kind of make one go away and one come
into focus effectively and so when you
delete it from the dom are you just like
removing a reference or you specifically
doing something to remove okay so what's
going on when when I remove a view from
I actually removed the mark-up that is
the view so if we actually let's do this
I'll destroy click here well inspect the
element just give it a little heads up
on what's going on here's the the view
code and if I do you'll see this is the
context of the area that holds the
content for this particular view the
around it is kind of a layout kind of
deal as I switch between views if we
just go back you'll see this change you
notice it's it's a it's the movie views
before is the search view I want to do
is I add
move the mark up for the views but to
make it kind of animate it I have to
leave the old one on there while I've
got the new one on there and so there's
kind of a dance that goes on and so I
have a reference in my small library to
both controllers simultaneously and I
kind of move them around and set the
references accordingly and whatnot so
what's happening is I'm deleting the
mark up for the previous view but in
this case that home controller was still
holding a reference to the panorama
control which had the reference to the
mark up in it right
I see so when you switch the views you
so not only did you know that what
element and what object which you also
knew that during this action hey this is
what I was doing so that give you a clue
as to oh I'm doing this thing where I'm
deleting something and that could
possibly be the issue right so
single-page applications a lot of memory
leaks are created because you're you're
kind of injecting and removing dom
elements and you're setting those equal
to variables that are not in a scope so
that the so they can easily be reached
so uh does the framework usually take
care of that for you you know a lot of
libraries and frameworks are really bad
about memory leaks yeah that's actually
one of the things I do when I evaluate
whether I'm going to use a library or
not if I try out some like examples and
I do want these profiles and I see a lot
of memory leaks that's probably gonna
make it not what I'm gonna choose yeah
and and I you can show me any angular or
any ember any black backbone built
application and I guarantee there's lots
of memory leaks in it jQuery has got
memory leaks in it and you know the past
it wasn't important because we were you
know loading the page we hit a link load
a different page and everything would
kind of start all over with a single
page application it all hangs around for
a while so you can really build up
memory pressure and that ultimately
causes the browser to just crash or the
experience to get extremely sluggish and
then it crashes
I think is a great technique to learn
them yeah and I can crash any browser
it's just give me a chance I'll I'll
crash it so let me fix this bug well I
know how to fix this one pretty easily
so I'm gonna kind of Julia Charles this
one for us alright so here I've got this
local reference to the panorama a
variable and it's inside like this the
base controller class that I'm using and
here's the panorama object that I'm
using to actually drive that experience
and inside of it that's got the
reference to that Dom node that's
getting removed that we're kind of
hanging on to now I know that the
problems coming from the home view now
I've designed my controllers to have an
unload function if you look up here I've
also got an onload now my spot library
will call those methods in response to
kind of an unload event in an onload
event and so the own load is to be used
to essentially hydrate the view get you
know drive it so that it makes any Ajax
calls it needs whatnot to actually build
what it's what needs to be on the screen
unload is essentially the opposite clean
up after yourself so what I just
uncommented here is a line where I'm
setting that internal panorama variable
to undefined which Mason basically means
is that variables nothing now and so all
the references in memory are now
released and the garbage collector can
come along and clean it up so let me ask
you that unknown function is called her
window well it's actually initiated from
the spa library that I wrote as part of
the animate the transition between I
call it view swapping because I don't
have a good scientific sounding cool
name for it so I was explaining that one
view goes in one give you goes out is
that that one goes out it triggers this
event that makes this callback if if
this function doesn't exist it doesn't
get executed what not so but I put it
there so that you could you know kind of
clean up after yourself so it's just you
know good practice if you will yes all
right so let's let's go ahead and reload
go back to the home we'll kind of do the
exact same walkthrough we just did I
just reload this alright and we are
going to run our little memory profiler
take a snapshot and notice it's 200 most
tune or 50 Meg's it keeps building up
because we keep running the profile on
the profiler adds memory to the base and
we'll do our movie details take a
snapshot and this time we're only gonna
see one up there in that top right
corner the original one that's not so
really exactly
or so you say yeah it might it may
eventually I may figure it out and look
at that yep and then if we go let's just
do our search one so we are consistent
but already it looks like you've dropped
from 19 Meg's down to 9 exactly and the
reason honestly the reason why this is
even 9 Meg's I'm getting the data in the
images from Rotten Tomatoes and they're
high resolution movie posters are huge
now anyway they kind of doink me when I
launch this oh hey we got a we got
another memory leak here
I bet we got the same thing on the movie
view I probably have to do it yep same
one oh but that's great seed night now
you've got and yeah but I know this one
I know this one's on the on the movie
detail view because I'm using the
panorama on that view as well so it's
it's effectively the same issue here's
what it is you can see this is the
panorama of Hamels and you can see the
movie details show times review and if
we go back that's these individual
panels now if I go down to like a
smaller width which nor less for a phone
here we go I can swipe between the
panel's this way little responsive
design trick nice yeah so so I know how
to fix it but I would ultimately do here
is put it down on my base class and
it'll it'll take care of it
consistently for me that way so
well that's great I mean anybody should
at least now have an idea of you know
let's say you can use something else
ah he's kind of nice and it gives you
these snapshots but I like that it gives
you some hints as to hey you got
possible memory leaks in your and your
dum-dum your uh yeah you know I'm really
big on web performance and things like
that so this is a big piece of that too
and you know I I for fun sometimes just
go do this come on random websites and
it's I'm amazed some of these sites I
can load and I'll have a gigabyte memory
footprint all of a sudden from it you
know and they'll be like five hundred of
those things reference saying that
there's possible memory leaks there and
that's really scary a lot of third-party
libraries or services like a lot of it
like ad-serving
things like that they're really bad for
memory leaks so the codes really poorly
written so you know when you're when
you're doing these applications like
you're looking at you know a potential
third-party libraries or or services to
use I always try to do a memory profile
and see if you should be using them or
not you know I think it's good practice
and always do it on your own code yeah
that's great thanks yeah I mean start
there
right because it'll be easily debug at
least yeah you know you know where your
code how your code works at least you
should you can find it and sometimes
you'll if you're using third-party stuff
you'll trace it down to that third-party
library if you can fix it and do a pull
request but that's a possibility that's
great you know so but yeah I know where
the stuff is in my code and I can
usually track them down and fix it and
sometimes it's caused me to have to re
our context some things so just you know
be ready to do that as well so well
who'll do you have any other questions
or comments no no I am enlightened with
your client-side browser debugging thank
you very much Chris
all right thanks a lot and I hope you
learn a little bit today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
