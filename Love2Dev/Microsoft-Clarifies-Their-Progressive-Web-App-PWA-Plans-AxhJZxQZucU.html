about progressive web apps what their
plans are and a little clarification you
can take advantage of progressive web
apps on Windows so what did they say and
what can you do
together hey guys Chris look here the
owner of love - dev and as always a big
fanatic of progressive web apps and
today Microsoft released brand-new blog
post kind of detailing a little more
about their plans for progressive web
apps and if you haven't paid attention
they've been very excited about
progressive web apps for a while and
last month or actually back in December
which is the previous month now right
before Christmas the windows insider
bill to think 1706 3 released with
serviceworker support turned on by
default and the plan is to make service
workers live for everybody as soon as
the next major Windows operating system
release goes out to the general public
right now it's in the insider preview
builds which I have on my desktop and
have been using but they wanted to more
or less clarify what their plans are
what the strategy is behind progressive
web apps and they put it in written form
I didn't feel like this really gave us a
lot more insight beyond what we've
already done and or what we've learned
basically krupa gave a presentation at
the edge developer summit back in
september where he hallowed most of the
content that was in the blog post today
and also I had a chance to sit down with
Krupa and talk to him for about an hour
a few weeks after the edge summit and
that's also here on the YouTube channel
so be sure to check that out if you want
like an actual conversation with him so
what I thought I'd do is actually go
through some of the notes that I made
based on their blog post see if I
couldn't clarify some concepts and ideas
for you a little bit and maybe speculate
a little bit about what things are gonna
be like and also talk about where I
think things might be a little short and
also what you as a developer can do to
get ready
is progressive web apps are a major
player in the development space when it
comes to building client experiences
this year and over the next few years I
guarantee that and that's because all of
the major platforms are excited about it
including Apple now Apple hasn't
necessarily said anything directly
publicly about it but their recent
actions are definitely indicating that
they are trending towards making
progressive web apps a major player on
iOS so let's talk about Microsoft and
progressive web apps and more
importantly Microsoft edge the Microsoft
Store and how being plays into the
progressive web application story on
Windows so the first thing like I said
they are really in on progressive web
apps and if you've got build 1706 three
or above which I were somewhere in the
80s or know where we're at right now but
it's been a few months since that
release came out that we've had two
major updates since then on the insiders
track and obviously serviceworkers had
been turned on there and so we've got
the ability to do that okay now
basically what they announced in the
blog post is that they're gonna start
amping up essentially the way they're
indexing progressive web apps if you
haven't known they have been using the
Bing crawler which is Microsoft's search
engines to think Google and they go out
and crawl the same sites that Google
does and they've got this essentially
the infrastructure in place and one of
the things that Microsoft does with the
crawler and Google does as well is they
evaluate what are people doing with
their sites essentially what
technologies are using how are they
writing the code and from a browser
perspective what they look for are what
are the actual trends that we need to
maybe improve our engines to work with
to make sites work a little better and
also keep from breaking the web which is
a whole separate topic but they're going
to use that to their advantage here with
progressive web apps because they can
detect if a site is being served via
HTTP which is a progressive web
application requirement does it have a
valid web manifest
using a service worker now those are the
three core technical tenets of the
progressive web application and
obviously there's more to the story than
that but those are the those are kind of
the minimum guidelines from a technical
perspective and what they're doing is if
your site meets those criteria then
they're gonna take it to the next level
and they're gonna evaluate whether or
not they're just gonna automatically
submit your progressive web application
to the windows App Store and that can be
a very big deal now the trick is here
they don't really define what's gonna be
qualified as something they're gonna
automatically submit and what's not
gonna be automatically submitted and I
think that's kind of one of the the gray
areas that I've been mobile troubled
with is there's no clear guidelines to
this now they're not alone in this kind
of story
recently I posted information about how
Apple has been rejecting and removing
apps from the iOS App Store because they
don't feel like their app like enough
and basically a lot of sites there are a
lot of applications that are generated
with app generation services are the
prime candidates to get tossed out of
the App Store and when they do this
they're actually telling the application
owners that they feel like they should
go to the web and I take this as a clear
signal that they're basically telling
these app store owners become a
progressive web application because
that's where you really need to be and
get out of our store okay well I'm a
little extreme there but that's okay
okay so and that's and so Microsoft
feels the progressive web app should be
discoverable and I got my notes here
because there's a lot of stuff going on
with this and that's what they're doing
they're basically using the tool that
they have to go out and discover
progressive web apps and evaluate what
how websites are built and they're
finding the sites that qualify now up to
this point they say they found about a
million and a half websites that meet
the three core criteria being HTTP web
manifests and that registered Service
Worker
but there's there's a few more things
that I wanted to try to articulate what
does it really mean to be the
progressive web app that could get
submitted to the store and so it goes a
little beyond that one of the things
that the criteria that they talked about
is sites don't really have what I would
call a valid web manifesto
they said that a lot of the web
manifests that they're encountering are
basically being generated by of icon
generators there's nothing necessarily
wrong with that but these favicon
generators are not giving you a true
valid web manifest file they're looking
for certain fields to be populated like
like name description these kind of
things and these favicon generators
aren't getting that part done for you
and I'm not even sure if I've really
seen a favicon generator truly give you
the base set of icons that you need to
be a progressive web application that's
one of the reasons why I made the video
in the blog post on creating a baseline
set of icons for your progressive web
app no the being thing will
automatically submit some a small set of
progressive web apps to the store it
doesn't mean you can't manually submit
on your own you're absolutely perfectly
free to go do that you do need to create
an app X or a PAC tf-x file for that I'm
not gonna get into the details of that
it's kind of technical stuff but what I
will tell you is if you want to make
sure you've got the right icons you got
a valid manifest file and even got at
least a baseline Service Worker and you
want to automate that submission to the
App Store to the Microsoft Windows app
store go to PW a builder com this is a
fantastic tool that the Microsoft edge
team has created it used to be called
manifold J's but now it's called PW a
builder to make it a little more
appropriate and while you got to do
submit your URL walk through the wizard
maybe upload a logo if it doesn't pick
up one automatically from your site it
will automatically create the image
array that you need as well as package
things up for you and handle the
automatic submission to the Windows
Store for you you will still need to do
some stuff to kind of verify that app
submission
it's got details and guidelines on there
I'll tell you what I'm gonna make a I'm
gonna post another video walking through
the PWA builder to show you how that's
done
that way you can reference that and I'll
also make another blog post to
supplement that okay now pwe is really
awesome about that okay so some of the
questions that they kind of asked
well should you create should you focus
on creating a uwp or you a universal
Windows platform application or a
progressive web app and well here's the
trick progressive web apps are Universal
Windows platform apps or you WP apps
that's because edge is a key component
of being of a uwp it's something you can
use in a UWP but basically if you make a
progressive web app it is equivalent to
if you made it in xamarin or C sharp or
whatever you may have made now here's
the here's the real reason why the App
Store is kind of the cool thing right if
you need platform integration with
Windows this is the only way you're
going to get it okay you're not gonna be
able to hook into some of the deep api's
that aren't say web standards like
hooking into the platform contact list
or using Cortana for example or maybe
getting into some of the virtual reality
stuff that hasn't been dropped saying to
web VR necessarily there's a lot of
interesting things that you can get into
for the most part for me it's not
something that really gets me super
excited as a developer just yet but I
know some of you out there it does get
you super excited and that's this is the
cool thing about it now as a business
owner and I have basically a Content
presence on the internet with love to
dev comm does my love to dev qualify as
something that would be a p-- candidate
for the Windows app store this is
something that I don't feel like they
really articulate well enough they talk
about stuff being app like and so does
Apple but neither one of them really
talk about what does that really mean
now honestly I don't really envision
love to do calm being in the Windows app
store and that's because it's basically
an informational site and it's also
really my sales tool to get people to
hire me to do progressive web
application developing and consulting
that kind of stuff but I do have some
other apps which I tell you what I'm
going to do I'm gonna go through the PWA
builder with one of these to see what
the app store submission process is and
that's going to be my 2048 app if you're
not familiar with that it's a cool
little game that I got addicted to a few
years back
and there's a nice little web version
that I made into a progressive web app
so I'm gonna see what the submission
process is like and see if my app
actually gets accepted
we'll see anyhoo so so that's that's the
quick that's the the question is it an
app or is it not an app and is it store
worthy or not store worthy that kind of
thing I think it's a little ambiguous
the best I could get out of my Microsoft
contacts is it's ambiguous so part of it
and they did allude to it in the blog
post is they're trying to figure out
what the criteria really should be and I
think they're only gonna do that if they
get a lot of more experience they're
looking they're looking for data
basically to do analysis they're looking
to get experience what is what are we
what are we seeing out there
what are business owners asking for what
are our consumers our end-users actually
asking for and they're gonna try to
merge the two together I think as the
year progresses by next year we'll have
a better clear vision on what that
really means but for now I say just go
ahead and try see what happens maybe you
get in the store maybe it is a benefit
to you now something that they did
allude to that I thought was very
interesting is if you do get into the
store and your application your PWA is
say installed from the store you can
store analytics and these are things
that are kind of valuable I know a lot
of the progressive web app advocates
like myself have actually been
interested and curious and we've asked
the chrome team about this and they're
different anyway that is the number of
installs and number of uninstalls
and then other constant istic surround
app store type actor app activity that
wouldn't necessarily be captured in your
web server logs or google analytics and
this can be very valuable in
understanding how well your application
is performing from an engagement level
and that's a very key aspect of
progressive web applications so that
alone may be worth it for you to get
that app store presence just so you can
get some stats and maybe start getting a
little vision of what's going on with
your actual users as far as consuming
and engaging with your brand in your app
or whatever so
all righty I did have some other
questions and this is one that just darn
it just keeps bugging the crap out of me
and I just don't feel like I've been
getting a good answer on this and that
is it's either windows position right
now seems to be there you're a web site
in or a web app in the browser with the
address bar and the edge browser Chrome
or you're in the store and you're
launching that way to get the full a
window kind of effect and all the other
benefits like a start menu presence well
there's still no answer on that right
now now in the past under Windows 8 with
the metro version of edge you could pin
to the Start menu and you could actually
do a live tile and I love that but they
took it out with Windows 10 now you
would think well they had it working
before walk why isn't working now and be
honest I'm not there I don't have access
to the code but there are some technical
challenges to that and I don't want to
get into because you know that's
honestly not my my place to be
I guess but basically I would say it's
on the list but it's a low priority to
them right now but I think this is kind
of one of those things where Microsoft
has done something that the chrome team
or the Google hasn't gotten to yet and
that is progressive web apps in the
Google Chrome store or whatever that's
going to be or even the Play Store they
kind of jumped way over that but they
didn't give us that Add to Home screen
experience and of course Microsoft
versions kind of joke at mango we don't
have a home screen well yeah you jumped
out of mobile we got it ok but you have
the Start menu and you have a desktop
and I can do Chrome on desktop to add to
the home screen or how to add to the
desktop if you will and launch it with
the full screen experience
I really wish they would add that
capability there right now if you do pin
your site to the Start menu it pins it
to the URL that you're currently on
it doesn't honor the web manifest file
to actually let you define what that
start urls going to be and it also
doesn't give you the ability to do your
brand logo so those those are some
shortcomings right now I really do wish
they would put a little bit
effort and to try to make that work
because that would be super awesome
because I really honestly don't feel
like the majority of progressive web
apps will really be App Store apps per
se in the vein of that and honestly most
people discover content online via
search engines and right now that number
is 93 percent honestly that to me is the
real progressive web app store is search
engines and I know they kind of tossed
around the idea of possibly giving some
sort of visual clue you in the search
listings if a site it would do that I
know there are sort of legal at the goal
implementations about that but you know
Google's doing their amp stuff why not
do this I really wish they wouldn't
being but I know there's internal
political battles why not but for me I
vote for giving in some sort of visual
cue so anyway that's my two cents worth
okay my next questions were what about a
lot of business applications the
enterprise's may want to make available
through the App Store to get that uwp
experience and since I don't have any
real experience playing with the App
Store Enterprise story because I just
don't play with uwp apps I don't really
have a good answer on that what I was
told is it's probably gonna be basically
the same story you would just create an
app pack submit it and then it would go
through that same channel experience so
with that you know that's dying I'm
dandy on that I need to play with that a
little bit cuz I've got some ideas
around enterprise apps and progressive
web apps and I need to kind of flush
that out so as I do that I will
definitely post some information about
that as well now my final question and I
didn't quite get an answer on this one
and I think it's gonna wrong people
because they weren't really app store
people right they were the browser
people because that's right anyway what
about payments through your progressive
web app because normally if you go
through an app store you got to give the
App Store 30% of the cut right they take
the Vig and normal credit card
processing fees are somewhere between
two it's really lucky one and a half
but usually two to three percent of the
actual transaction fee that app stores
are usually 30% which is just massive
which is another reason why I have
really stayed away from doing apps
because I really just think that's just
evil so I didn't really get an answer on
that one so can you still use your
existing credit card processor or are
you required to go through Windows or
Microsoft to actually get the payment I
don't know yet sorry guys I may be an
app store policy that I just haven't
come across maybe they've changed it
like I said I just haven't really paid
much attention to app store stuff
because it's just not somewhere I play
so maybe if you've got a the answer to
that question feel free to leave that in
the kind of comments section below in
fact if you've got any questions about
any of this stuff please leave those in
the comments section below and you know
I talked to the Microsoft edge guys all
the time if it's something big I can
maybe ask them if I don't have the
answer but a lot of times I may have the
answer for you know if you think this is
kind of fun useful hit that like down
there and definitely hit the subscribe
button because I don't want you to miss
some of the other videos I'm gonna be
posting because I'm gonna be doing that
PWA submission video sometime in the
next few days and you definitely want to
see how that goes so anyway again
you got a questions or comments about
Microsoft and progressive web apps
please leave them in the section below
and if you were a developer you want to
get ready for progressive web apps like
I said they're huge right now all the
platforms are really getting excited
about them you got Google and chrome
pushing things really hard on Android
and you got Microsoft pushing things on
Windows you got Samsung Internet is
super hot about these and Samsung's like
the biggest phone manufacturer right now
and Firefox is excited about these and
believe it or not Apple is is getting
excited about progressive web
applications and there's clear signs
they progressive web apps are gonna be a
big deal on iOS sometime later this year
you want to know how to build
progressive web apps and it's more than
just upgrading your site to HTTPS it's
more than just having a valid web
manifest file and it's more than just
registering a serviceworker there is so
much to building an awesome progressive
web app there's
massive story behind service workers and
then there's a whole user experience
story web performance optimization
tooling and automating some things so
that you make sure that you ship the
best experience possible and don't ship
some sort of subpar experience that
makes your out your stakeholders not
happy with you because stakeholders love
this idea I can't tell you how much
every time I've talked to stakeholder
type people and show them this stuff
their eyes get big with excitement cuz
they see the potential from there and
you don't want to mess this out and
that's why I've created the the online
course progressive web application from
beginner to expert and I definitely want
you to be on it and if you click the
link below you'll get the best price
available right now and you'll be able
to sign up and get started hit the
ground running actually walk through
building a real ecommerce store with me
so you can see how to apply a lot of
different principles of progressive web
application development to deliver a
great experience to your end users so
with that I'm gonna leave you and just
keep being excited about progressive web
apps learn all you can and start
shipping things and see what happens if
you put things in the Microsoft Store
you may be pleasantly surprised</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
