around high density high quality photos
typically utilized in a full screen hero
image well
sometimes you want more than just a
background image you want to also be
able to do some transparency and do a
color overlay all this can be done in
CSS without affecting any text that you
may want on top of that image in this
video I'm gonna show you how to use HTML
and CSS to do just that hey guys Chris
the owner of left dev and today I want
to do what I think is a pretty cool walk
through some code to give you a tutorial
on how to create a full screen hero
image using a background technique so
that you can apply some opacity without
affecting a text overlay and for good
measure we're also going to add a color
overlay to apply a little color tint to
it and we're gonna make this a fully
responsive solution that way smartphones
don't download really large image files
so when this is all said and done you're
gonna have some great code to reference
for your websites to make these great
stunning big fullscreen hero images now
the source code is available on the
github repository and you can see the
link in the description below
I also had a log post that you can go
through and read and reference as well
and that description that link is also
in the description below so make sure
that you take the time to like the video
so that you can come back and reference
it more often and make sure you get to
those descriptions from your device
because you may be watching this on the
phone you never know
and maybe not necessarily that easily
get to the description anyway so let's
let's get right down to it so what I've
got on the screen right here
I kind of move this out of the way a
little bit and move this down so we can
kind of see where we're going is I've
got our final product and right now the
the width is about half my screen so
it's triggering some breakpoints that
we're gonna cover in this tutorial but
I've got a nice beautiful background
image that we're using it has got a 40%
opacity applied to it so it's a little
transparent and then on top of that
we've got a purple color overlay that
also has a 40 percent transparency
setting to it so that you can actually
see the image behind it and then on top
of it we have a absolutely centered both
horizontally and vertically
text overlay and so you're gonna get a
lot of different little features out of
this tutorial that maybe you've been
trying to solve in a lot of other places
I know this is something of the when I
finally got this solution working I was
super happy because I've been needing
this solution for several sites in
recent years and there's a lot of what I
consider hacks and legacy ways to do
some of this stuff but none of it's
really good some of it involves
JavaScript and you definitely don't want
to use JavaScript this is pure HTML and
CSS so it's going to render very
efficiently and not be a performance
bottleneck for you so without further
ado let's just look at what we've got in
the markup and as a roll over this the
left side is going to kind of highlight
what element we're looking at and so the
main thing is our hero element and this
is designed to be fullscreen okay so it
actually starts even above that so we're
gonna go I'm gonna do is I'm just going
to go to our sources and we're going to
just move this over and move that down
so we get a little more view space what
I've done is I've got a single HTML page
with all the code necessary for this
well the images are external but that
goes without saying
and I've inline the styles so to start
off with I just added a quick little
basic
CSS reset to make sure that all of our
margins and padding are set to zero and
then the HTML and body elements are
designed to be the full viewable screen
so that least the page is the size of
this the screen or the viewport of the
browser and this is just a basic CSS
reset if you're using bootstrap or
materialized or some other CSS library
or framework they will generally have a
more robust reset in place that will
most likely have these same settings
there but I didn't want to point this
out because without this this may be
that may not necessarily work as desired
but this should be a pretty standard
thing that most sites have these days
next is our main hero element and we go
back or go now I'll just go down to our
markup and we can review it okay so
we've got a hero element and this is
where all the big hero image magic will
happen is off of this particular element
and then inside of that element is the
text overlay if I go over here to the
elements panel you can see that that's
going to be the whole thing and that's
just going to be the text overlay and
within the text overlay we've got a
couple of headings h1 and h2 tag just
but to hold the text and we'll get to
those in a little bit but let's start
off with our hero here now we'll come
back to this Flex Center in a little bit
I'm going to look at the actual hero
here and I've just added some dimension
stuff here with the height and width
making that a hundred percent notice I
also set the min width and Heights to be
a hundred percent just to make sure that
the element does fill all of the
available space which in this case is
going to be the actual viewport that way
this is a full size image and everything
next I set the position relative just to
make sure that it lines up if we take
this off I think we get a little bounce
in it no actually we don't but I think
it's a kind of a safe keeping thing at
all
so helps us work on some of the
centering here that we'll look at a
little bit later on obviously they
didn't affect anything that I think it's
just good practice to do that and you
can see there's our reset now notice
there's nothing with the markup and the
CSS at this level to reference our
actual big image that's back there in
the background and that's because this
solution is going to take advantage of
pseudo elements if you haven't heard of
pseudo elements they've been around for
a few years and this is kind of a nice
secretive way to do some kind of more
advanced layout techniques if you follow
along in the CSS shapes video or blog
post you know that you can create a lot
of really cool shapes with transforms
and border-radius tricks but some of the
stuff work utilizes these pseudo
elements to transform and move those
around for example I created stars and
heart and some other things with the
pseudo elements so that's what we're
gonna do here as well and the reason why
is because we want to be able to apply
opacity to our hero background image and
we don't want that' pasady to effect the
overlay text that's because there is no
background opacity property in CSS but
if you apply opacity to an element not
only does it affect the opacity of that
particular element but it would also
affect all the child elements and since
our text is a child element of the main
hero element if we applied opacity here
then we would also see the opacity of
our text fade out as well so we don't
want that and let me just take this out
so what we're gonna do instead is you
see right here I can just select the
before and that's a pseudo element now
this element doesn't physically exist in
our markup but it does exist in the Dom
and we've got the ability to manipulate
it and we're going to be able to make
this a responsive solution I'll come
back to that here
in a moment first I want to look at how
we're doing this because I've got a
responsive thing it's showing us that
this particular property has been
overridden by an additional rule and
I'll get to that here in a moment but
let's just assume that this is the one
being used this is how we're going to
reference our background image and
that's just a standard background -
image selector now I do encourage you
not to just throw background in there
with a bunch of the property set and
it's a lot better practice to explicitly
set individual properties it makes doing
responsive design a lot easier because
if you're gonna override those
properties as soon as you override like
one of those properties it's going to
kind of Cluj up the rest of the stuff
especially if the descendant or the last
ones that are applied would use just
background then it would just wipe out
any individual things so it's a better
practice to do individual properties
like this so that's why we got the
individual image here
and next is the background size we're
choosing cover because that causes the
browser to render the background image
so that it fills all of the entire space
now it's not going to try to change the
aspect ratio of the image what's going
to do is going to make it match up as
best as it can and in this case we've
got we've got pretty much of a square
visual here but the actual image is a
basically a twelve by nine I think it's
1920 about 1200 or something like that
was the original image uh I can remember
what the actual original dimensions are
but that's okay we'll see that later on
I guess but anyway so basically it's
going to pick the best one so that it
and it's going to stretch it out we'll
see if I actually changed that say move
down you'll see that the the fruit or
the vegetable the food whatever starts
kind of moving out of a picture that's
because it's kind of trying to keep the
aspect ratio set so that the image
doesn't like become distorted okay so
that's that's really
what's going on okay now in pseudo
elements we have the content property
and this allows you to actually drop in
text and you could also even drop in a
reference to an image and a few other
kind of hacky tricks I'm not really
worried about that in this case but I do
encourage you to set this to empty I
have found that if I don't set this
property some of the other things don't
necessarily work as intended as you can
see right there that really kind of
messed everything up and actually took
out the whole element so you do need to
set the content property on the element
you just go back here there we go
inspect and we'll expand this back out
and choose before so we definitely want
to set the content property next we'll
make it a block display and we're going
to choose absolute positioning and we're
going to make it fit on the top left and
we're going to make it a full hundred
percent 100% to make it take up all the
available space now if I change take
this out the background image gets a lot
wonky and actually becomes kind of one
of the things right there but it seems
we make it absolute it allows us to
start positioning you know a little more
explicitly and that's what we're after
next I set the z-index to negative two
now it's gonna push it all the way back
and I set it to negative two so instead
of negative one because later on we're
gonna put that color overlay and we'll
set that one to negative one to make
sure that it is on top of the image so
for now it's negative two if you want me
to say negative 9999 feel free you
basically get the same kind of effect
now last but not least we're going to
set the opacity to point four and the
reason why we're doing that is because I
really want to show all the different
tricks you can do now this is the key
reason why we're using the pseudo
element instead of the main element to
set the opacity that's because when you
set the opacity on the pseudo element it
doesn't affect the main element and
that's because they're in the Dom two
separate elements all together now if I
take this opacity off you can see that
the image shows up at full force and
that may be what you're after
it's totally up to you but for the demo
and tutorials sake we're gonna make it
semi-transparent and that way we're
gonna that way we're going to get a
little softer effect in the end okay so
that's how you make the image
semi-transparent without affecting like
the main content area in this case it's
going to be the text overlay that we're
really after now I'm going to move on to
how we're gonna do the responsive images
and if you haven't heard there's ways to
do responsive images using source said
in the picture element but because CSS
naturally does responsive design through
media queries we're going to take
advantage of that now by default we're
using a small image and this is because
when you do responsive design you always
want to start with the smallest screen
and then progressively set breakpoints
and media queries to apply styles as the
viewport or the screen gets larger so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
assume we're on the smallest screen to
start off with and so we're gonna
reference the smallest image that I've
created 320 by 212 and I've got an AWS
lambda routine that I've set up where I
can just upload an original image and
it's going to take care of creating an
array or a set of different sized
versions of that image so that the image
at a is gonna be loaded most optimally
for that particular device so that say
smartphones not going to download a 3000
pixel wide image when it can only show
say 480 pixels wide it's going to
download the one that's gonna fit best
in that 480 pixels or whatever space
I've given it to render in and that
means it's going to take up a lot less
bandwidth etc etc but in this case we're
going to start with 320 and my scripts
going with my script or my lambda
actually created the whole set of from
320 all the way up to the full size
image and at the same time ran it
through an image optimization service so
that now the images should be relatively
as small as they're going to be able to
get without distorting the
actual visual quality but that's a whole
nother ballgame just know that that's
being done and to be also be helpful it
also creates a responsive image tag for
me that I can use and if you look at the
actual blog post and you view the source
or inspect the elements you'll see that
all my more recent blog posts all use
responsive images all created through my
little lamda tool but it also creates a
CSS a responsive CSS script for me as
well so that I could literally just drop
it into my code and have those available
now the way it works and will scroll up
you can see I've got the next breakpoint
is at least 320 pixels which matches up
to the width of the first image and the
next image is 460 by 305 so it gets a
little bigger the next one breakpoints
going to be 460 and that's the one we're
actually using because that's the width
that we have now if I expand this out
just a little more you can see we're all
the way up to 796 so now we've hit that
720 breakpoint and the next image was
loaded so that's what's happening it's
going to use it's going to load the most
optimal image for the display that it
needs at that particular moment now if
you're on a phone and you say rotate
from portrait to landscape then that may
trigger a breakpoint it may not trigger
a breakpoint but the browser is going to
pick the best image that it needs and
it's going to just download that image
instead of the whole set and this is a
neat little trick to make our background
image load the right image so we aren't
downloading a you know 2 Meg image file
when we only really need 36 kilobyte
image file it's much nicer to download
the smaller file especially when
somebody's on a cellular connection than
it is to download the big fat one so
that's a good trick to know and you can
take that one home with you and apply
that to a lot of different places ok so
before we go to our color overlay I want
to talk about doing the text now on our
main hero image we have the Flex Center
and this is just a
Little Helper CSS rule that I created
CSS class if you will and what we're
going to do is we're going to use
flexbox so I set the hero elements
display to flex and this allows me to do
a lot of cool things to manipulate the
layout and now if you're not familiar
with Flex box and let's say CSS grid for
that matter these are great new broadly
supported layout sets that you can use
to more easily control how your content
is rendered now in this case I want to
make sure that the child elements of the
the Flex box
element here that which is our main hero
image are lined up perfectly centered
now to do that the main two properties
are this justified content and aligned
content and this is going this is
telling the browser that a we want to
Center the child elements horizontally
and vertically one controls the x-axis
one controls the y-axis and then for
good measure
I set the Flex direction to column that
means that all the child elements will
line up vertically stacked rather than
the default which is left to right so
they're going to do top down in this
case now there's a lot of other things
we can do to flex box and I do
hopefully plan on posting some tutorials
on using flexbox sometime in the next
month or two we'll see how the time
alots itself but fantastic way to
control layout and that's how we're
going to get this perfectly centered now
if I undock our tools here and we go to
a full size screen notice that we also
have some responsive pieces in play here
and our text our text overlay is
physically centered and because I've got
some responsive stuff that also kind of
resizes so that it doesn't take the full
width of the screen and that's because
the larger screens it's going to look a
little better just having that buffer
around that margin around it whereas on
the smaller
I don't have as much space I want my
text to definitely stand out you could
classify that under the area of say art
direction this is one of the nice things
about using responsive designs that you
can apply different rules based on
different viewports and screen sizes so
if we go down here to our hero message
which is our child element that actually
wraps the text elements this is the one
that's going to actually control not
only the positioning but the actual size
that we're using to kind of put that
little background behind the text and I
do that it's kind of normal trick just
to make the text a little more legible
this works great when you are putting it
on top of an image like we're doing here
because the image can be kind of busy
and you want to have some sort of
contrast between the text and that busy
background image now the image I've
chosen for this particular one isn't the
worst is being busy but I still want to
show you some techniques here so again
I've got a breakpoint set at 1024 and
that's where we're going to drop down to
make the width at 50% and there's the
other stuff is basically just setting
the colors and we're also making the
position relative just helps the
positioning aspect of things now how did
I get the color background well the same
technique that we did to make our
background image a little
opaque is I used the before su element
this time instead of a background image
I chose a background color and again
made the z-index behind the actual text
layer miss it negative 1 in this case
made the the display a block set the
position to absolute and that allows it
to actually and then we also set the the
width and height and we make it match up
more or less to the parent element now
one thing I did have to do was set the
margin left to 25% on this particular
one I'm still kind of troubleshooting
why I had to do that
I felt like it should have lined up with
the parent element but I think there's a
little disconnect
some of the things that I kind of
learned and what the reality is so I am
looking into that so pay attention to
the blog post cuz once I figure it out
I'll update the blog post with the
latest content on this one but for now
this works and that's how I keep the
background in line with the actual text
wrapper so again just using a co element
another fantastic way to leverage these
so you can do some pretty cool effects
alright last thing before we go I want
to make sure you know how to do a nice
color overlay because this is kind of a
cool way to do some artistic design to
make your your hero images or whatever
stand out above the crowd
now CSS does have the concept of
filtering and I could have I say I could
have applied some filters here but the
filter that I wanted really was just a
color and there's not a color filter per
se I think there might be a way to do
some fancy mathematical filtering stuff
that I didn't want to mess with that
it's just you know too much work but
there are filters to do you know black
and white grayscale kind of things there
are sepia and a bunch of other like
things you can do they're pretty cool in
fact this is how Instagram actually
started the filters that you apply an
Instagram an Instagram is actually
originally released was a hybrid
application using web technology to do
the filtering and it was all kind of
faux stuff while the server was actually
doing the image of manipulation behind
the scenes but that's neither here nor
there just let you know if that was
there let's look at this I'm going to
use another pseudo element this time
we're gonna use the after pseudo element
and I chose purple and this purple is
the actual bootstrap purple if you want
to have a good reference on it and
basically did the same thing we did with
the hero image made an opacity of the
40% the only difference is I set the
z-index to negative one that way the I
made sure that the purple overlay was on
top of our background image and that's
all there is to it really and that's why
we that's how we get our background
color now if I say took this off
took that off and we roll roll back you
can see that we've got the regular image
with the slight opacity that also looks
good but if you wanted to say theme it
up with your site's color scheme in this
case then you can do this color overlay
and so this is a nice little trick that
allows you to just take it up another
level okay so I hope this has been
helpful to you again the source code is
