and you like to have a lot of tabs open
in your browser and you're afraid of
losing all those tabs I want to show you
a great way to manage those tabs in
Microsoft edge as well as get a nice
thumbnail preview so you can tell
exactly which tab you need to open Chris
love owner of loved to death here and in
this video I'm going to show you two
features to help you manage tabs in
Microsoft edge now these are new
features that have shipped with the
latest version of Windows that if you've
been on the inside a ring like me you
have had access to these two features so
I guess the beginning of 2017 or maybe
the end of 2016
it'll kind of blurs together at me at
this at this point so I'm not totally
sure but now right now it looks like
I've got melon or maybe 10 tabs open
it's not unusual for me especially
during the week to be doing research and
stuff on coding techniques or testing
different websites out to have sometimes
as many as 40 tabs open in a browser of
course that can be unwieldy to manage
because the tabs that come really tiny
and stuff like that now the other the
other scenario that you got to worry
about is you need to you want to try to
curb those up but you don't necessarily
want to lose all of those and you don't
want to go through and add those to your
favorites you don't want to maybe open
to reading list that sort of thing
alright so what are some ways to manage
that well first off when you've got a
lot of tabs open and they're really
narrow basically just showing you the
favicon up there and you want to kind of
see what's going on there's a down arrow
now to the right of your plus the plus
will create a new tab at the down arrow
is just to the right of that they'll be
on the right side of all of your tabs as
you can see the little tooltip is
telling us show tab previews and all you
got to do just touch that down arrow and
you're going to see some thumbnails for
each one of the tabs and in this case I
can just
scroll to the left and right to kind of
trip through them all you can see can
open up that thing up right there so
that's really good so you can kind of
get a thumbnail preview of course we've
had this feature for a little while I
can't remember what it actually ship
because you roll over a tab you're going
to get the sub mail preview - that will
drop down lets you see every single one
of them at the same time so you can
maybe make that decision to navigate a
little quicker now the next feature I'm
going to show you is super helpful I use
this a little more often than I probably
should and as you can see I've rolled
over this this button here on the top
left corner now it's not these two tabs
these two buttons are related first off
does this one set these tabs aside and
what that's going to do is it's going to
now move all those tabs over into a list
of saved tabs now I'm going to do is
these are a list of tabs that I have set
aside and of course it's not going to
open for me now if I'm trying to show it
to you let's see there we go
and these are the ones that I set aside
well toggled out a little late I think
we got a little latency here because of
the Camtasia piece sometimes getting
away now I've got a lot of these set
aside the way I can go back and reload
stuff rather quickly now when you do
load items out of these lists it will
take it off the list here so example for
this one this is a about serviceworker
caching this is an article I read and
reference a lot as you can see it's
opening up right here I can actually
close that tab that there we go and
caching best practices max-age blog over
okay now if we go back over here it took
it out of that list just want to let you
know that that's the case wait for it to
open up up there we go
now you can restore all the tabs of one
shot so if I want to restore the ones
that I just showed you it's going to
restore all of them and it's going to I
believe remove those for that entire
list from these stored tabs I'm all this
way for that to pop up too you can see
it's sort of tried to load every single
one of those up for us come on
normally does not take it usually just
pops right out on me
of course I've got the early buggy beta
version of the operating system and it's
just got the update them had a couple of
little issues since I updated this
morning with things opening well anyway
I almost let that go but these are two
great features if you're looking to use
a Microsoft edge that I think will help
you manage big sets of tabs
it certainly made my life a lot easier
so to speak so that I can bring up
resources that don't necessarily want to
lose but I realize I've got you know 40
or 50 tabs open and maybe there's I just
want to show them off the side and I can
go back and pull up the ones I need as
needed hopefully this will help you out
and if you get any questions about
usability of Microsoft edge over Chrome
