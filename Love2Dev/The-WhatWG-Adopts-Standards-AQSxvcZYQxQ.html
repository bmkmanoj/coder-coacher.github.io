changes that could have a dramatic
effect on the way web standards are made
hey guys Chris Lowe owner of love to
death here and today I want to talk to
you about an announcement made yesterday
by the what WG
now most of you may be saying though
what WG the what and I'll be quite
honest most of you have probably never
heard of the what WG I guarantee most
developers have never even heard of it
or thought what the heck it is I bet
most developers especially web
developers don't even know what the w3c
is well today I'm going to tell you not
only what these two groups are but what
were the major announcements made by the
what WG yesterday that could have
positive or possibly negative ripple
effects on the way web standards are
crafted now back in 2004 Apple Mozilla
and opera three big major browser
vendors at the time got together and
decided we needed to do something to
counterbalance the w3c well as I've read
the history a little bit they were kind
of miffed that they had gotten a
proposal turned down to effectively kind
of guide HTML in a different direction
honestly the direction that we've headed
in long term see back then the w3c which
is a standards body that we tend to rely
on for what we call web standards these
are the standards around things like
HTML and other kind of platform api's
that we hook into all the time to make
these great web experiences that we have
well you see back then these browser
vendors were kind of like hey let's
let's don't worry about making this part
of a standard XML or dtdt d kind of spec
and honestly I agree with them because I
hate XML and they said and so they kind
of I understand it correctly they kind
of made a proposal to make HTML
something a little different then strict
a xml which i think is a good thing
and if you're not familiar with that
what I'm talking about basically the
reason why we have things like
attributes inside of HTML tags and
stuff like that is because of its kind
of XML skeleton or roots if you will and
so there was a lot of debate on how the
web should go and of course back then
their net Explorer was the big browser
at the time in fact we were in ie6 days
like the heart of ie6 days and we all
know that that is awful anyway back then
it wasn't awful it was actually the
standard basically Netscape had died
away but it had become what we now know
as Firefox because of the Mozilla
organization you know an apple had
Safari and apples Mac OS was probably
about seven to ten percent of the market
share at the time and then there was
opera which many web developers are talk
to have never heard of opera but this is
a browser that still to this day has
over 300 million active users now for
the most part opera has been on feature
phones and you probably used opera and
did not realize it back in the day when
you had that Nokia flip phone and it had
that web browser that took forever
because the network connectivity was so
horrible that was an opera browser those
browsers are still used a lot especially
in developing countries but anyway long
story short what they did was they went
off and formed this other group called
the what WG now what WG I don't know
what the heck that really comes from I'm
pretty sure the WG e stands for working
group and basically what they were
trying to do is create a living standard
for the web now living standard means
that it's it never kind of sits still
it's just constantly growing and it's
constantly moving well back then they
invited a couple of editors to the group
to kind of oversee the whole thing
one being Ian Hickson who is still there
today he actually works for the google
chrome team back then I'm not polisher
who he worked for but that's beside the
point they also invited Chris Wilson who
at the time worked for the Internet
Explorer team and honestly today are
actually today he works for the Google
Chrome team so anyway but it's time
Chris politely declined because the wot
WG head
you very key missing features that I
think Microsoft felt was needed and this
is these are features that Debbie 3c has
built-in and and that you know innately
I guess you get saved and that is
intellectual property rights governments
so to speak or protection if you will
and kind of a formal standardization
process or oversee or code of conduct
kind of thing you see the W through the
what WG was kind of thrown together as a
place where I feel I've always felt like
people could just kind of hash out their
ideas and say this is the spec right and
I think some developers actually look at
that and go hey this is the spec this is
what I got to deal with right and I
think part of that is because ian works
for the chrome team now no offense to
Ian I don't know Ian and but the lack of
oversight to the what WG has been kind
of a sticking point now I never really
read through what WG documentation
because it just kind of felt kind of
creepy for me to go over there when I
knew that the real web standards were on
w3c but it had got into the
serviceworker thing especially around
the fetch API I know I had to spend a
ton of time over there because that's
where the real documentation seemed to
be was about the fetch API was on the
ywg now if you're not familiar with
these specs and standardization
processes these are very very crucial to
building websites that anybody can use
that's because these are the
specifications that browsers take and
then build in support so you and I can
actually write code and trust that it's
going to work in all of the browsers now
if they don't follow this specification
then we can call them out in public and
say shame on you and we can also kind of
grade how well do they support a certain
standard right but if there's no real
governance over the process and the
standard so to speak is constantly
moving that's bad for you
and it's also bad for these browser
vendors because how to know if they
actually really support what the
standard is because the standard that
they shipped
six weeks ago if you're talking about
chrome may have changed because it's a
living standard and somebody decided to
kind of change it overnight one night
and when they have to wait another you
know two or three rev cycles of chrome
just to get support for that and it
because it has to follow through Chrome
Canary and all nightly and all that kind
of stuff just to verify that it doesn't
break things and the number one thing
that I think most the browser's
constantly agree on is the term don't
break the internet and none of us want
to break the internet but by by
supporting things that are non-standard
the Internet can easily get broken
because what happens is developers will
write towards a sort of speck in time
and then that speck goes through
migrations meanwhile the code that we
wrote a year or two ago still
proliferate and suddenly breaks and that
means the web is suddenly broken now
there's a lot of standards they
eventually get deprecated for example
right now we're in the last few years of
app cache support and I also think we're
in the last few years of XML HTTP
request support which is what a lot of
websites use for Ajax so these are just
examples of why specifications and
standards are super important to all of
us now yesterday the wot WG announced
that they're adding intellectual
property rights protection to their
guidance and they're also adding more
structured governance so that there is
kind of a proposal specification that
actually has to go through kind of
standardization process and then it sort
of I guess it's going to become like a
recommended standard after you're not
familiar with how the w3c works that's
effectively how the w3c works first
someone says hey I got this great idea
in the w3c kind of says hey it goes to
this committee over here and then the
committee kind of talks about it is sort
of like Congress if you think about it
and that's the problem the w3c works
like Congress it goes really slow and
that's one of the problems that they had
with this kind of organization as it
moves really slow so the wot WG moves
really
fast and but the problem is they don't
have any of that governance around it so
it's kind of half hazard Lea put
together in theory right so now that
what WG is going to have some sort of
approval process in place that we can
kind of look at and say this is the flow
that a specification or a proposal has
to go through now part of being accepted
as an actual recommended standard is
having browsers that actually implement
the specification and usually the rule
of thumb is once two major browsers
implement support for a certain
specification then that is a strong
candidate for formal recommendation and
so this is kind of good now the problem
that you may be thinking is okay now we
got w3c we've got what WG and they both
kind of have similar governance is over
them they both have intellectual
property rights protection for the
browser vendors and also what that comes
down to is each one of these browser
vendors have engineers on their teams
and they come up with cool ideas and
then then what they do is they get
patents on those ideas so who's to say
that Microsoft or Apple or Google or
Mozilla doesn't go out and sue Microsoft
Apple Google Mozilla for infringing on
their property rights because they've
got patents
well the way I interpret all this stuff
and this goes along with having
conversations with people on these teams
about the patent rights is basically
these guys are getting patents and they
own the rights to those patents and
honestly it's one of those things where
I've got a patent cool I'm the guy who
came up with it and I'm always gonna be
able to say I'm the guy came up with it
but I'm not really seeking any royalties
or financial compensation for coming up
with these ideas I'm just taking the
satisfaction and I've made the web an
awesome or place that's that's
effectively what's going on here when
they come up with these ideas they want
to get the credit for it but they don't
necessarily want to get the money for it
if that makes any sense they've got
other ways to monetize if you will so
the thing is in the end everybody wins
because the web gets to be a better and
better place and that's what I really
hope that what w/g going through these
steps does it makes the web a better
place now
honestly we're gonna have two competing
bodies to produce standards now the
reality is if you go through and read a
w3c w3c specification and a lot w/g
specification they're almost identical
there's been accusations of copy and
paste convenience and stuff like that I
don't know I don't care not my problem
to worry about but they're very close to
each other now there may be some slight
differences of opinion of how things
actually just state so to speak and come
out or how they might be interpreted so
to speak but in general they're pretty
close and spot-on to each other and
that's a good thing now ultimately I
think what this really means for us is
that the web's gonna get specifications
probably at a faster pace and that could
be dangerous because now that's gonna
spread engineers out on these browser
teams even further it could be a good
thing for some of us because maybe the
browser's will hire us to implement some
of those specifications
expand their teams I think this comes
down partially to how well we as
developers start leveraging some of
these specifications and there's so many
fantastic specifications that are
getting support every single time of
browser revs itself and it's hard to
call most almost really keep up with all
this stuff I know Microsoft edge and
Chrome both maintain pages where you can
go and see what specifications are
currently supported and what's under
development what's being under
consideration what's not even being
considered just yet and honestly you
those are usually like brand new ideas
it just popped up on the radar and
here's the cool thing
even with w3c the dawat WG
you can participate in both groups I
think it's a little harder with the w3c
but what WG is much more accessible to
the average person in fact you can go to
their participation page and you can
sign up right now there's to be an
official participant after these rules
going in effect sometime in mid-january
you will need to have signed like a
document that basically says you're
going to
gonna died by the rules so to speak I
don't think that's a lot to ask and to
be fair a lot of the discussions that go
on the w3c are actually out in the open
on their github repo in fact I've been
watching the serviceworker repo a lot
over the last year and even chimed in a
couple of times so maybe I am a
participant I don't know but I can tell
you what I am gonna do I am gonna go
through the process I'm gonna saw in
that document just so I can say I'm
there I can at least see what's going on
and who knows maybe I can even
participate because I got some ideas I'd
like to see some things and the reality
is I actually try to implement some of
the support through the implementations
based on these specs and I can probably
give them some feedback that they
actually need so I'd love to hear what
you have to say about this maybe you've
never heard of the wot WG or the w3c for
that matter and I encourage you if you
haven't go look them up and see what you
think if you've never read a
specification for the web I encourage
you to go find something that you're
interested in and sit down one night and
just try to read the specification
warning you may fall asleep now but the
wot WG the w3c are not the only
standards bodies that we as web
developers rely on there's the IETF
there's a comma there's I so there's the
Unicode consortium and a few other
bodies that also make standards that we
rely on and these bodies are very
important and they've got to have rules
and they've got to have rules that the
browser vendors the people who are going
to implement these specifications agree
upon because if there's no common
agreement with amongst them they're
probably not going to essentially honor
the specs coming out of those bodies so
to get questions leave those in the
comments below share it with your
friends and I'd love to hear what you
have to say about the what WG adding
intellectual property rights coverage
and new governance standards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
