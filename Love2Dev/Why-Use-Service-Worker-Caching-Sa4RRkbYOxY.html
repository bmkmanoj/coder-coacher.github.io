site work when your customers are
offline
have you tried to use app cache only to
walk away and defeat fear no more
service workers offer a rich caching
experience for to help you slay the
dinosaur the majority of web traffic
originates on mobile devices
comscore says mobile devices have an
unquestionable role as a consumer
primary digital tool this means
customers are often on flaky connections
or offline completely in the developed
world 4G and LTE cellular connectivity
is ubiquitous this does not mean it's
reliable how often have you been out and
about only to check your phone and
realize you have no connectivity or
worse the phone says it is connected but
you cannot access the Internet your
intent is blocked by the dinosaur what
is the dinosaur it's the scary t-rex
that appears in chrome browsers when you
lose connectivity it has become a symbol
of frustration and angst it can even
confuse customers leading them to
believe your site is broken your app
stopped working your email can't be sent
and you can't load that website you
desperately need to access this is
called Wi-Fi that point when your phone
says it's connected but it is really
lying to you
what happens when customers try to
access your site under Wi-Fi they see
the browser loading bar of despair and
who do they blame you
serviceworker caching empowers you to
flip the experience from a sad emoticon
to a very happy emoticon one where your
customers may never realize they walk
through the dinosaurs lair the web has
been able to work offline for many years
using nap cache
however if you try to use app cache you
probably pull your hair out and gave up
the app cache developer experience is
horrible to say the least it is
confusing and lacks explicit controls
needed to manage the offline experience
what about browser cache this is where
you define cache headers that tell the
browser how long to retain a local copy
of a file once it is downloaded
according to HTTP archive only half the
web uses browser caching so chances are
you're not using browser cache for your
sites a Facebook study reveals about 25
percent of the assets they expected to
be cached were not cached instead
browsers purge the cache to free up this
space this study tells us you cannot
rely on cache headers for offline access
browser caching and app cache fail to
solve the local website caching needs
browser engineers realized this was a
problem and heard cries by many for a
good solution
so they created service workers and a
proper caching solution serviceworker
caching makes managing web at site
assets easy for offline and superfast
access unlike app cache and browser
caching serviceworker caching gives you
full control over every aspect of the
website caching you can store HTML
Javascript CSS fonts images and any
other file your website might need what
is serviceworker caching and how does a
cache websites well in the words of
Smashing Magazine a serviceworker is a
script that stands between your website
and the network
giving you among other things the
ability to intercept network requests
and respond to them in different ways he
accomplishes this feet through the fetch
event handler this is where you can
write code that evaluates requests
checks it against your cache and decides
if a stored custom or network response
should be returned to the browser the
serviceworker cache API provides a way
to organize your website's assets making
them easier to manage and putting you in
control over every aspect of your
website's files this specialized cache
has the power to change the way the web
is perceived by everyone in fact Jeremy
Keith inventor of responsive web design
calls serviceworker caching the biggest
effect service workers have and I quote
the biggest effect that service workers
could have is to change the expectations
that people have about using the web
especially on mobile devices right now
people associate the web on mobile with
long waits in horrible spammy overlays
service workers can help solve that
first part serviceworker caching starts
by intercepting every foul request from
the browser before it hits the network
the cache API lets you quickly check if
the target file has been stored before
making a time-consuming and unreliable
network round-trip instead you can
instantly return the file so the user
experiences an instant load the fastest
request a browser can make is the one
never sent across the wire at least
that's the conventional wisdom and
that's what serviceworker caching
delivers properly cached websites can
start faster than comparable native
applications wait did I just say faster
than native applications that's right
properly cashed in architected websites
can load faster than native counterpart
finally yet another case you may not
realize serviceworker caching Souls and
again I'm gonna quote Jeremy Keith I had
been thinking about service workers as a
tool to help in situations where the
user agent goes offline but of course
it's an equally useful tool when the
server goes offline that's right if you
need to bring your web server down your
website can still function on devices
where service worker has done its job
caching may be more important when files
are served from the serviceworker cache
they are not served from your server
this means you can save money on
bandwidth and processing in short this
means your server can scale with fewer
resources because service worker caching
is flexible may caching patterns and
options are available so many you might
be overwhelmed as to how and when to use
different techniques there are 15 core
caching patterns related to service
worker caching they range from bypassing
the cache all together through racing
the network and the cache against each
other
you can also pre cache files so your
site can load instantly delighting your
customer how do you know when and where
to use different caching patterns where
can you learn serviceworker caching best
practices you could look up blog post
and videos trying to organize the
information you could also start writing
your own service workers and try
different caching strategies to see how
they work and if they fit your
application needs or you can register
for love to Dad's practical
serviceworker caching course in this
course you will learn details about
serviceworker passion api and 15
different caching patterns after the
learning service worth of passion
concepts you will be guided through
applying these techniques to an example
website once you have completed the
course you
we'll have the knowledge and experience
needed to implement an effective caching
strategy so your website's and the
lively work without the network you
won't have a reason to fear the dinosaur
any longer your customers will love your
website and never realize it is not a
native application don't ignore the
features offered by the web any longer
learn why and how to use serviceworker
caching so your website's will delight
customers whether they are on a fast
reliable or broken network and every
connection scenario in between until the
end of April 2017 save $10 on the
