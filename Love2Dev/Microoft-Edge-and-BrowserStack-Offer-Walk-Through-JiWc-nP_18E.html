be brave and I'm going to actually try
to walk through the browser stack
Microsoft edge testing experience and
see what this is like again I have a use
browser stock in a few years I have not
done webdriver stuff in a long time so
I'm not sure how far I'm gonna get with
this guy thought I just walked through
just as a new user bite and maybe we can
see what this is going to be like so if
you go to the page that's make it that's
talking about the offer I will put this
in the description that way you've got
direct access to it as well as the
Microsoft blog post announcement but I'm
going to click the get starting but get
started by which i think is probably
going to shoot me down to the bottom of
page yep so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to type in an email let's try this
I've been changing my live ID account
lately so maybe that's part of the
reason what's going on here the data
address probably was a previous account
there we go and we'll do the recaptcha
deal hopefully won't ask me for street
signs it didn't good all right let's say
we get here
okay alright so wow this is pretty
interesting i have 30 minutes left on my
free trial that's very interesting you
only get 30 minutes and click on a
browser to open it directly okay so
we'll just say got it and as you can see
we've got the latest and you got 13
which is the previous version here's an
explorer here's different versions of
firefox different versions of Chrome and
opera and there's the Yandex browser and
there is Safari and that's Safari was
read past by one I things up to 10 or
something but what do I know okay um
again just this is the general browser
stack environment here so you've got
android oh I know why that's 51 that's
for Windows okay so if I went over to
iOS for example we would get the
different versions of iphone okay so
that's that's probably fine so it looks
like they limit what you can access with
this free account which is fine and
still do XP let's see Mac Syria yeah
these are different ones on there notice
yeah okay let's focus on windows here
and so we've got edge a free testing on
edge it's got the thing learn more which
is great okay someone check on edge
please install or enable flash to use
browser stack for optimal experience yo
you got to be kidding me oh this is
funny okay so that's not good I don't
know why they're still using flash
because flash is a bad thing to use be
blunt I thought I was going to be using
WebRTC so it's interesting I can't test
edge inside of edge so it's want me to
go over to let's just we'll go open up
an instance of chrome special entrance
instance here
should make me login hopefully I type
the right password in there we go all
right yeah we'll test that well yes I
would enable local testing this is
pretty cool so it's automatically asking
me about the local testing i did not get
prompted for that and in the previous
login now i did go over to chrome and
second need to add an application to
enable local testing all right that's
good all right so let's see what happens
this time when I hit edge and we are
launching it starting real edge 14 on
Windows 10 at Santa secure connection
there we go type or paste the URL you
want to test okay it's so let's see okay
here we go so this is looks like edge
and it looks like edge running inside of
chrome say what I'm going to do just for
sanity sake I'm going to hit f11 let's
see if this will go fullscreen for me I
guess not all right we'll just ignore
that for now I generally in this case
will rather be full screen alright so
you get a little things you can switch
your resolutions fishing take a
screenshot their time to an issue
tracker different settings we won't
worry about those per se all right so
what I'm going to do let's just go to
love to dev com since the new that site
well then there we go as you can see
it's it's my love to dev site and it
looks good
and if we go to the blog here we go all
right so nothing too exciting there
let's go see what we got here we get
different resolutions and this is very
important Oh looks very interesting it's
going to really switch things out on us
and this is really good because this
gives us the opportunity to do a little
responsive testing to make sure it lays
out correctly and yes I know there's not
a margin there that's one of my to-do
list to fix so let's turn bug to capture
here we go all right see we're going to
generate a screenshot see what that does
there we go sweet all right now how do I
say that all right you know there we go
okay well that's pretty cool all right
so is able to do that honestly that's so
that's bad right there definitely got to
fix that I don't know if I wanted to
test my site all right so I'm saving
some bugs here oh I can even now now i
can write it out actually let's
highlight this to show off some of the
features of the browser stack platform
like so it's been a while since i've
tried this out here we go this is going
to be very useful I think all right okay
so let's go back like that really big
see how it's going to switch
environments and like how it's got the
loader basically fills in me logo there
for so that's pretty cool so that's
going to be about it but let's go check
those sorts of features our test local
URLs I think I have one oh I'm not gonna
sure that because i have to go fear what
the port number is
so we get with we get developer tools
okay so that's possibly going to give us
some developer tools it did open up
another tab over there for us so I'm
kinda getting off into leads into the
specific browser stack stuff but I think
this is great now my previous experience
with browser stock unless I wasn't like
the best it was like a little window and
it was a remote machine that I had to
play with I would just see if I can get
touch to work okay touch does not work
this is one of my this is one of my real
complaints about the browser stack
environment is because of the way the
virtual stuff works it's not a deal
breaker necessarily but you don't get
touch and that is very important when
you are trying to test modern user
experiences every platform outside of
mac supports touch and users are going
to spend more time touching the screen
and you give them credit for so you
definitely need to test your layouts and
stuff with touch that's one key feature
that I think is important to test and
the fact that not all the browsers yet
support pointer events which is on a
very unfortunate thing chrome and edge
obviously support them now belief
Firefox might have already shipped that
but that's that's the example of
something that would be great to be able
to test in this kind of environment but
because you don't have that true touch
experience little heart attacks test
this is one of the reasons why i still
have physical devices to verify things
on so but that's not a deal breaker the
browser stack things actually pretty
awesome the fact that you can script
these things script out to your tests
and everything is pretty cool i said i
haven't really got good experience using
webdriver so my to-do list so hopefully
I'll be producing some videos and stuff
on that in the coming months as well
this is an exciting announcement today
from Microsoft edge and browser stack to
form this partnership this is going to
allow developers and all kinds of
platforms be able to better test their
websites in edge and it also removes the
key barrier that a lot of web developers
have since they tend to be on max doing
their development these days they don't
have access to Microsoft edge the same
way that I don't have access to Safari
for example so I think this is great
hopefully the broad audience of web
developers is going to get the message
and take advantage of this free offering
from Microsoft and browser stack so that
they can test Microsoft edge on any
platform possible and as you can see you
get an experience where edge essentially
feels like it's running on your device
so you get a good experience now this
eliminates the need for you to set up
and download bulky and complicated to
manage virtual machines one of the
problems that Microsoft had and offering
free virtual machines for testing is
maintaining the virtual machine images
on their free offering there was like 90
some or 100 some different variations of
all the virtual machines and that's just
a pain for them to manage not to mention
a pain for developers to download these
large images of the operating system
you're talking you know gigs and gigs of
data having to come down for these
virtual machines not necessarily the
best experience they've also tried the
remote ie which is a very similar
solution to this but there were some
technical complications in there that
kind of kept that from scaling I think
so the fact that browser stack has a
good scalable multi-platform testing
environment available is is just better
for them to just take advantage of
something that works and works well and
already has a good audience so this is a
great offering hopefully it helps you
test your sights on edge it also exposes
you to the browser stack platform and
when everything's said and done I think
everybody wins because now we can be
everybody can make sure sites work
nicely in edge as well as get exposed to
doing this cross-platform testing that
really does need to be done with your
websites so hopefully this has been
helpful leave comments below so that
maybe i can i can address them or maybe
somebody from the edge of browser stack
teams as well can address them but
hopefully you'll take advantage of this
offer
and access the free microsoft edge
testing if you're a web developer and
you want to stay up to date on some of
the latest information around Microsoft
edge and its capabilities you definitely
want to subscribe to the love the devil
