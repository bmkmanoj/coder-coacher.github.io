tutorial now I'm going to go a little
bit into the basics of db2 so I'm not
really going to go into how to install
it and all that because that's really
super boring but I am going to tell you
where to install it so I made this handy
dandy link right here just go to bitly
slash db2 community edition and that is
a very convenient link secretly I want
to track you that'll take you to this
page and you can see my beautiful face
anyways you can click this download now
button and as you can tell my internet
is extremely fast once you get to this
page it's going to ask you to sign in
and then it'll give you some options and
just download the full thing when you
are deploying you can get smaller
versions of db2 without all the extra
tools and stuff but since we're
developing we're just going to get
everything so once you're here
sign in if you're a first time user
click yes and then make sure you read
that good book and then click I agree
then what you want to do is download the
version according to what operating
system you're on so I am going to go
with the Mac version right here when you
download it you're going to go through
the installation process it'll ask you
for a db2 user and also a user for
something called data server manager
which I'll talk about all of that but
just make sure you write all that
information down going through the
installation you're going to install
something called docker and it has this
cool little boat wale logo thingy and
this is a container software if you
don't know anything about
containerization well we're on the same
page but essentially it's just a way to
have a consistent infrastructure for
your applications it's kind of like a
virtual machine except it doesn't have
the entire operating system if that
helps you understand it any any whoo I
think I'm getting into way too much
detail the most important thing is that
you get to this page here so when you
get here you'll want to use your data
server manager username and password
once you get in you're going to want to
put your db2
credentials so I believe it was db2
instant then just whatever password and
then you can click save credentials to
repository and click ok there are all
kinds of things you can do with this
tool generally data server manager is
the tool used to manage your database so
there's all kinds of administration
monitoring and you know all kinds of
other fancy things in here I just wanted
to point out a couple things so if you
go into administer and then tables
you're going to see all of your tables
so if you click a specific table you can
go in here and click this data button
that's going to show you the data of the
table so this allow you to see the
columns and the data types and all the
data inside of it this will help you see
the way our data is represented in a
relational database another thing you
can do is run SQL or sequel this is
where you're going to type in all of
your commands to communicate to the
database a couple other things is you
can click this little hamburger panel
thingymajig I don't know click that and
click data studio now this data studio
is an optional thing you can install but
I would highly recommend it especially
if you're going to be doing anything
with stored procedures when you open it
you're going to get prompted with this
right here and you can think of this as
kind of like Eclipse and if you don't
know what Eclipse is it's just an IDE
used for programming so you can click OK
it looks kind of funny because we're in
this virtual machine sort of thing but
once you have it open you get used to
and it's really not so bad so you can go
in here and you can connect to your
database here so you can use this tool
if you want to get more into the
development I'm sure there are ton of
tutorials online this is not going to be
the start of my focus I just wanted to
show you that so you know what it is and
how to get into it so let's go back and
let's look at the connection details one
interesting thing here is if you scroll
down you can click this little link here
and this will allow you to use data
server manager in the browser there you
go and you can change your database up
here so I can go back to the sample
database and yeah that's that let's go
back to the windowed version and that's
basically all I really have to say to
start you off in the upcoming videos
we'll be running all of our commands in
this run sequel panel so you are good to
go thank you for watching guys and I'll
see you in the next video where we'll
start talking about some more concepts
and then we'll come back and learn some
hands-on things so see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
