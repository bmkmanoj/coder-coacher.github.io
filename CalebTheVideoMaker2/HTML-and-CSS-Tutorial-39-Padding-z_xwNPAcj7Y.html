you who have been watching the series
and welcome to those of you who have
just started watching this series I'm
going to move all this out of the way
and we're going to learn about something
new here so we learned a lot about
getting the text and these borders to
look nice but still I don't think the
words fit nicely within the border be
honest I think it's kind of packed and
ugly in my opinion so I'm going to be
talking about something called padding
so these boxes I think they're too close
to the end of the div so if we look at
the div we can inspect elements and if
you guys didn't know this you can do
this yes it's pretty cool I should have
told you a little bit about this but if
you hover over the div it shows you the
dip it's 660 pixels by 596 pixels and
within this div you can view the other
content so you have the h1 and then the
paragraphs and you can see each
individual paragraph and how thick they
are and so forth so I want to have this
stuff not so close to the end of the div
I want it over some to make it less
cramped so that's what we're going to do
now so in order to do that we can't go
into the div styling I have a lot of
stuff here but you can just ignore it
just makes it look certain ways so to do
this we go padding then we can say what
side of the content we want to pad so we
can say padding top padding left let's
go right right padding bottom padding
left and then we can give a pixel amount
so 10 pixels 10 pixels
and I don't really need these two right
now so actually I meant to do left up
here so left awesome I'm get rid of
these two so when we refresh we see this
content kind of moves over which does
look nice so the way it works is by
adding a number to this it's going to
push this content down ok sigh let me
compare from 10 so here's 10 you can see
it's closer and if I crank it up to 15
it comes down so once again i decided
i'm going to start trying to inspect
elements some more so we can look at the
styling in this div here and we can
change some of it so if you look over
here they got padding top you see and
that's the top part of the padding as
well as the left the top is 15 pixels
the left is 10 and what's cool about
this inspect elements is you can modify
things like in the web page so you can
see what it looks like by increasing the
padding of the top so this is great to
figure out what looks nice although it's
not going to permanently save it on your
web page see if i refresh and then go
look well it started at 15 so it didn't
change but if I change this to 24 and
then refresh it goes back to 15 but this
is great for trying things out so we can
change the padding left increase that
song and now our content isn't so
smushed up against the left side of the
web page all right so that's really cool
i also want to do that for the comments
because if you look here the words are
kind of cramped into the curved edges of
this as well as the top of it so we're
going to do the same thing right here
padding top it's smaller so i'm going to
give it a smaller number adding left
so now that is what it looks like I
actually think the padding left doesn't
mean you then much because yeah there we
go so that does look pretty awesome we
have a text indent here so that's why I
don't really need padding but if i
delete this you can see the words are a
lot closer to the side now so instead of
using indent actually I'm going to keep
indent for the multi-line ones and I'm
going to have a padding of five pixels
so this is what it would look like and
actually when you look at a big
paragraph it looks a little small so I'm
going to preset up to 10 and you can
compare you can do some tests and figure
out what looks nice by trying these so
let's let's try this one we're going to
scroll down find text somewhere near
padding left double click it press the
arrow keys to increase it up or down and
this is what our page can look like all
right so not only can you do left and
right I mean top and left you can also
do right and bottom so adding bottom
five pixels so that'll keep it kind of
spaced out from the bottom so now if we
zoom out this is what our website looks
like a at a far angle it does look a
little better things aren't as crammed
and it's starting to look nice so
there's some shorthand versions of
padding so you can just use padding this
plain old padding and put like 10 pixels
this is going to put 10 pixels all the
way around left starting on the top
right bottom left I think maybe top on
the order doesn't matter but we can also
do some more shorthand versions by
putting all for batting so good 10 10
pixels 10 fixes 10 pixels so it's going
to be the same well maybe not see all
right padding 10 pixels and then we
could say
ya see it looks the same so that is one
way so I believe this is the top padding
so if we inspect the element to you we
can adjust these open the div open the
paragraph and then take the styling we
can increase oops we can increase the
padding take the 10 increase that to 11
so that increases all of the top next
one increases all of the right adding
next increases all the koala time
padding and the next one increases on
the left padding awesome so now we have
this which that looks pretty awesome if
you ask me well we can also have some
other shorthand versions for example we
can just have just two on here 10 pixels
and then 20 pixels per se refresh that
and here's how this is affecting it so
over here spec this element alright
awesome so you take this 10 and you can
see that 10 goes for the top and the
bottom at the same time e 20 is the left
and the right at the same time if you
have three though like let's say 15
pixels now the first one this affects
the top the right and left is 20 and
then the bottom is 75 so we can adjust
this some top
left and right oops left and right
bottom I don't know I didn't think of
using this inspect elements earlier oh
well so yeah that's pretty much all i
have to say about padding in the next
day the next video we're going to be
talking about something new called
margin which in way is similar but kind
of different and the difference confuses
people sometimes so we'll be going over
that and i will see you in the next
video thank you and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
