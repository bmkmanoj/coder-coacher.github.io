this is your ninth JavaScript tutorial
what's going pretty well in this video I
wanted to speak specifically on
comparison comparison operators so I
didn't mean say that twice but the first
time I didn't really I like stuttered
there so just ignore that but anyways
I'm going to talk about comparison
operators and logical operators so let's
get started subscribe to my youtube
channel anyways they're designed to
compare two values here are all of our
possibilities equal to not equal to
greater than less than greater than or
equal to less than or equal to so let's
let's look at these in English basically
this is how it works
comparison operators in English insert
the name of the operator into the space
so is five blank six so you could take
one of these let's say equal to right
here is five equal to six
no it's not what we could say is 5
greater than 6 no it's not
basically geologists JavaScript runs
this test like this 5 greater than 6 is
it no so it's going to return false
oftentimes we will use this to return
true or false for conditionals an if
statement although we're not this video
is not specifically designed to describe
if statements in detail I'm going to be
explaining them a little bit so we can
understand this concept although if you
want to learn more about this check out
my if statement video in the future so
basically although we are already just
so that basically here's how an if
statement works if this is true whatever
we put in here then we want to do this
code so you can put what's known as the
expression within here the expression is
either evaluated as true or as false if
it's true then this code will be ran
whatever we put right here so let's take
a look at this here we have two
variables here's an example
simple tests we could run with
JavaScript we if we wanted to we could
get these values from inputs on the
website so people could put their
answers in the the code is going to
process that and it will give back an
answer so we have money in bank and then
price of movie these are both declared
variables and then we run a test if the
price of the movie is greater weight
then the money in the bank this is
supposed to be less than the so if the
if the price of the movie is less than
the money in the bank
go to the movies basically that saying
if the price is less than what you have
so we have 60 dollars the movie only
costs 6 that means we can go to the
movies because we have enough money to
do that so what it does if the price of
the movie is less than the money in the
bank and it is because it's 6 and the
money in the bank is 60 then this code
will get initiated or initializer
processed or whatever you want to say it
doesn't really matter the code runs so
here are some more example that these
all evaluate as true 5 is equal to 5 6
is not equal to 10
9000 one is greater than 330 is greater
than or equal to 10 30 is also greater
than or equal to 30 10 is less than 100
10 is less than or equal to 11 10 is
less than or equal to 10 so now we are
getting into I guess we could test test
those before we get into something new
so basically here I have a new HTML and
a script I could say
we can make an if statement here and it
looks like this usually make the outline
first and what's in here we could say
five equal to six and then right here I
could say oh man I'm sorry about that
guys I'm so I'm sorry about that I'm
sorry this is true so once again to
explain this if this evaluates is true
this code is going to be ran so we're
going to alert something well this is
not true because five is not equal to
six therefore this is not going to run
when i refresh the page as you can see
nothing happens although if I make
something true within here five is equal
to five then i refresh the page and this
alert comes up this is true and we'll be
getting into better ways to display our
information rather than alerts because
alerts are annoying but we'll be getting
that into future video so that is an
example of an if statement all right so
now we have logical operators and or and
not these can be used to test multiple
things within the single if statement so
here and evaluates true if both tests
evaluates true so basically we have this
really big thing within the if statement
the expression I'm sorry so basically we
put parentheses between we put
parentheses around each expression for
visually to visually see what's going on
so if this and this evaluates as true do
this code so if X which would be
declared earlier in our program so we
could say x equals ten
if X is equal to five it's not so and X
is greater than three well these
evaluate this one evaluates to true this
one evaluates to false so this is not
going to work because they both have to
test as true but if I made this five
well now five X is equal to five and X
is greater than three
therefore this code is executed or
evaluates is true if either of tests
evaluate is true so if X is equal to 5
or X is greater than 10 so I could say
var X equals 11 well all right this is
false it's not equal to 5 but X is
greater than 10
therefore this code will execute if I
make this 9 well now look X is not equal
to 5 and it's not greater than 10
therefore this will not be ran and now
for this one specifically these will
both never be true because if x equals 5
well then it is automatically less than
10 not greater than 10 although because
this is an or state or a or expression
sorry that means it will still be
executed so that's good the not
evaluates is true if the test evaluates
as false so that's a little confusing so
let's look at this if 10 is greater than
20 well it's not so it evaluates as
false but because of this exclamation
mark here it's actually going to
evaluate this entire thing as true so
you can read this in English as if 10 is
not greater than 20 then execute this
code so that would actually evaluate as
true this up here and the code would be
executed so we can look at that
example we're so we could say let's go
to 10 is greater than 11 all right well
the reason we have exclamation
parenthesis is 2 when we add the not
operator that makes more sense
so right now this alert is not going to
be R and because it's false 10 is not
greater than 11 but when we add this
exclamation mark or refresh it does run
now let's explain that a little bit
better if we just had is not 10 greater
than 11 that doesn't make any sense we
want to test this entire expression with
the knot so now it's saying if 10 is not
greater than 11 without these extra
parentheses it wouldn't really make
sense so that's what we can do for this
specific example
alright there's something you know about
called short-circuiting a test so this
is an and short-circuit if a test
evaluates is false the first one
JavaScript does not waste its time to
continue testing the expression so look
v if v is greater than 10 and well this
is ignored that's because this is false
and for an an to work they both have to
be true so if one of these is false that
means it doesn't even matter if this
one's false or true because they both
have to be true in order for it to run
so if one is false automatically the
whole thing is evaluated to false it
doesn't even look at the rest of what's
in the parenthesis so this is going to
evaluate as false and the code is not
going to run we can also short-circuit
or if the first test evaluates us true
JavaScript does not waste its time to
continue testing the expression so 5 is
less than 10 sorry I suppose to be an
over here this is ignored why is this
that's because this one is automatically
true because once it's test its true
therefore one of the total possibilities
in here is true and the whole thing is
considered true that's how an ore works
only one of these have to be true either
this one or whatever would be in here
but because this one's automatic already
true that means JavaScript does not have
to test this one it's ignored and the
code is run is ran so that is a method
to increase the speed of our program so
that's all I have to say for this video
hopefully that was helpful
sorry I kept stuttering the entire time
but yeah that's all so be sure to
subscribe to see see what I'm saying
guys I literally cannot say it like ten
words without the yeah yeah you get what
I'm saying
so hopefully that improves in my next
video so I will see you then and be sure
to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
