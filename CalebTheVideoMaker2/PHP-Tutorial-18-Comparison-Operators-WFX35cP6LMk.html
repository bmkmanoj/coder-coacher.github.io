tutorial this video we're going to be
talking about comparison operators which
comparison operator will take two values
compare them and either return true or
false so basically there is a couple
we're going to go over and I'm going to
write them out over here there is the is
equal to is not equal to greater than
less than less than or equal to and
greater than or equal to and we're going
to go over each one of these pretty
quickly and you will understand them
pretty easily because they're pretty
basic so Z is equal to that one you got
to be careful with because earlier we
assigned values to variables such as
this X has the value of 5 well this
right here this is an assignment
operator but this it's a comparison
operator
so you may think from math classes or
something ok X has the same value as 5
but that's not true basically we're
assigning it to the value of 5 so for a
new beginner programmers that's
something you have to be aware of if we
were to use 2 the equal sign that you
use in a basic math class you would use
double quotes so like this 6 is equal to
6 so basically if you want to turn this
into English instead of math symbols is
equal to its question so let's try it
all right five is equal to four
well that's not true because for an
order for it to be true it would have to
be this five is equal to five so this
one is going to return false
this one will return true and no if you
do this rather than equal equal that's
going to not work out so well because
this is trying to assign six to the non
even if not even a variable five and
thankfully that's not going to work
because then we'd be like five plus five
and we'd get the value 12 and it'd be
like way what but so yeah that is that
that's the is equal to operator
comparison operator next one it's pretty
simple it's actually just the opposite
so we replace one of the equal signs
with an exclamation mark and this is to
say this it would be is not equal to so
if you wanted to read this five is not
equal to five well because it is this is
going to return false
now if you used five is equal to five
this would return true so basically this
is going to return the opposite of
whatever is equals to returns so let's
try another one
six is equal to seven that would return
false six is not equal to seven that
returns true you also have to be careful
because this one only has one
exclamation mark and the assignment
operator also has one exclamation mark
but these two are not related
this is an assignment operator you have
to keep that in your brain this is used
for assigning values to variables it is
not used as a comparison operator so be
careful be careful be careful do not use
that as a comparison operator and we'll
be getting into using these things in it
after a while it's pretty much second
nature and which one to use but you just
gotta be careful make sure you know that
this is the opposite of this not this no
its opposite of this all right let's go
to the next one is less fan that's how
you vocalize that is less than so 5 is
less than 6
that is true because 5 is a lower number
than 6 if you have 5 pies that's less
than 6 pies so this is going to return
true 5 is less than 4 this is going to
return false what about this 5 is less
than 5 well 5 is not less than 5 so
that's going to return false
now the opposite of this is is greater 2
is greater than sorry
so we could say 5 is greater than 4
that's going to be true 5 is greater
than 3 true 60 is greater than 59 true
60 is greater than 61 false because it's
not 61 is the higher number so this is
going to return as false
all right now what if they're equal such
as five is less than five well that's
going through each other false what if
we switched this five is greater than
five that's also going to return false
so we actually have two more operators
used for when they're equal so this one
is is less than or equal to this one is
is greater than or equal to so let's try
it out five is less than or equal to
five
well it's actually equal to so it
returns true five is greater than or
equal to well it's equal to so that
returns true five is greater than or
equal to four
well it's greater than so it returns
true so oftentimes you will use these
when it can be either below or above it
or equal to so five is less than or
equal to five or any number above it
we've used math charts think of it like
okay so you have a number line and then
here's five and you want it to be
greater than or equal to five
well then we include five and anything
above five if it was not if it so that
would be right now a big five it's less
than any number and that's going to look
like this so yes so let's say we have a
variable X we want to know is X greater
than five or equal to five so we could
say X is greater than or equal to five
and it's going here on this test okay
it's easier five or it's above five and
let's say it's three hundred
oops that wouldn't be there it's 300
well that is greater than five so would
return
all right so um there's another one that
I'm not really going to get into much in
this video but it's the triple equals
this is what it looks like it is known
as the identity I believe and it says if
something is identical data type so for
example five and five well this is a
number this is a string a drift string
anyways these have the same values five
and five so this is going to return true
but this test if it's equal value and
equal datatype and it's going to return
all alright what about where we have two
numbers but one six well it still has to
be equal values so this is also going to
return false
now comparison operators are often used
with if statements so we do a and then
our expression is going to compare two
values so if the variable X is greater
than 20 echo you mamas so that's just a
stupid example but that is when a
comparison operator is most commonly
used so that's all I really have to say
about comparison operators thank you for

see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
