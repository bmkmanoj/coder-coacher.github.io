publisher now if you think about this
you could just list the publisher in
here because it should be a one one of
many where books wouldn't need another
table for publishers but if you want
more information about the publisher
you're going to need somewhere to store
that as in where the publisher is
located so if you're just going to list
the publishers company you could do it
in here simply just like that but I
don't like that so what I'm going to do
is yes make a new table and make this
about the publishers so very first thing
polish your ID of course this would be
primary key now you can have the
publisher first okay now over in books
over here we can get rid of topic now if
you look at this publisher is one of
many because a book will have one
publisher and a publisher can publish
multiple books so now we want to edit
the books oh I already have it open
under foreign keys we're going to make
one for publishers but first let's make
a new column change this to publish your
ID because it's gonna be a foreign key
to publishers set that to int and then
in foreign keys now it can make it
publisher I'll be this will reference to
the publishers table now which column
obviously it'll be a publisher ID and
this will connect to of the other
publisher ID so this one's the foreign
key this one's the primary key so now
you hover over this you can see the
green right there is connected to the
publisher ID and I like to drag the all
the IDS up to the top see what you can
do now is you can actually add more
information about the publishers
so if you need to know the city of
publication you can just say the city
and also anything else like the year of
when the publishers started publishing
any of that could be stored in here
but if you'da stored this up in the
books then that wouldn't have been
possible okay
genre this is what we're going to deal
with next now think about this a little
usually a book will have one genre such
as science fiction so it's up to you do
you want to make a new table listing the
genres which will be tied back to the
books or do you just want to list the
genre right with the books well see I
always like making a new table because
it makes things so much easier but you
don't technically have to because you
can just have it listed with there if
you needed more than one genre then you
could have a new table for it but I
would recommend this see this is the the
thing about normalization the more
normalized you get and the more tables
the more mess there is and it can make
things kind of slow so it's not always
good to normalize the database to a
certain extent at one point it becomes
too much so we're gonna make Jonas
because that's what I want
genre IV but also an have anything else
if you need to put more information
about the genre but there's nothing
really else I could put so now back to
the books table we're going to make a
foreign key wait first let's change it
so it's ready to get in just as on our
ID and set the step in this makes it
able to be a foreign key with this genre
ID because they're both of the type int
now under foreign keys we're going to
make genre I Chandra genre sweet now
everything is connected it look there is
right
that's pretty messy so what you can do
is click these little arrows
once you're done with them and it makes
things a lot easier to see Gander books
way now is book named number of pages
okay now a number of pages if you really
really wanted to you could have a table
with the books and then the number of
pages for each book cuz a certain number
Kenneth that technically could be a
many-to-many relationship but that is
where I think you're crossing the line
of two normalized if I had a book where
it was like book ID and then a number of
pages ID and then down here I had a
number of pages table where I said what
ID was what I'm out of numbers or my
pages sorry that's just too much so this
is as far as I'm going to normalize this
books table and now everything is
connected here and thank you for
sticking me in this sticking with me
this far and you better watch the next
video okay thank you
