video maker to this video we are going
to be talking about the cool stuff fine
oh yeah after wasting your life for like
20 videos we're finally moving on to
algorithms how to make models and all
that awesome stuff so to begin we're
gonna just have a brief overview of what
an algorithm is and a machine learning
algorithm and kind of a review of the
model and how that relates to the
algorithm and the differences and all of
that so I'm going to use an example so I
hope it doesn't get redundant but over
the next section of videos we're going
to be going through a particular
algorithm that I'm going to use as an
example to learn how these kinds of
things work okay so let's begin what is
an algorithm an algorithm is just a step
by step process that you can use to
process some information so I like to
think of it like this here's an
algorithm and you have an input and you
have an output so if I told you for
example to subscribe to my channel okay
so how would you do that well you know
you're going to take your mouse you're
gonna move it down to the subscribe
button you're gonna click click and then
you're subscribed that's the algorithm
for subscribing and then what you do is
you can parameterize that algorithm to
take input to where I could have what
user is going to subscribe so you could
say like oh user X is going to take
their Mouse and drag it down and use
your X is going to click Subscribe and
so forth so you can kind of think of an
algorithm as just a section of code that
you can reuse there's all kinds of
different algorithms there's different
ways of measuring their efficiency and
you know I think may be a good algorithm
series would be pretty super awesome on
this on this channel but for now you can
kind of think of an algorithm as a
function so if you didn't get that
function vibe that's okay but a function
is essentially the same thing you just
take input and you have output and you
process that input and somehow get an
output
using some lines of code so the machine
learning algorithms are specialized
algorithms designed for machine learning
it's just a category of the algorithms
that are out there and these algorithms
are going to be used to model our data
so is the algorithm the same thing as
the model is the model the same thing as
the algorithm not really but they're
really really closely related and maybe
it hoped just to look up the difference
between a machine learning algorithm and
a machine learning model but in the
example that I'm going to be going
through we have what's known as the id3
algorithm and this is going to process
our data and the output of this
algorithm is what we would call our
model so the output is going to be a
decision tree the decision tree is
basically a way we can represent our
data you can also think of it as like
the very complex if statement that is
one way to model our data the id3
algorithm is essentially going to create
that very complex if statement and the
output is going to be you know a bunch
of cases where you hit a roadblock and
you branch so if this go this way if
this goes somewhere else and then you're
going to repeat that process and you can
see it branches and the program is
represented as a bunch of decisions
that's all the decision tree is so the
decision tree is the actual model of our
data the id3 algorithm it doesn't
actually do anything like predictively
it just takes our data outputs a
decision tree as you continue your study
of machine learning the difference
between a model and an algorithm may
become clear but more than likely it's
going to not really matter that whole
that much you know I in my youtube video
ISM I try to define language but then I
usually end up saying and really doesn't
matter because people use terms
interchangeably so I gave you an example
of an algorithm and an example of a
model and you're probably going to end
up hearing people refer to models as
algorithms and algorithms as models and
try not to
be annoying about it like oh-ho that's
not an algorithm bro that's that's a
model it honestly doesn't matter because
the two go hand in hand as you use these
algorithms the algorithms are the things
that allow you to model your data so
yeah that's that's essentially that and
yeah okay so in the next video we are
going to be talking about different
classifications of algorithms and this
is where you get those fancy machine
learning terms like supervised learning
all that stuff so it's gonna be pretty
brief but I think it'll help just kind
of classify things and I'll be sure to
make it awesome so be sure to check it
out and subscribe peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
