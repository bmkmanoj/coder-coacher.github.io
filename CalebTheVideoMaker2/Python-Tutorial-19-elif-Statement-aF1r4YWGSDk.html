I want to talk about an amped-up if
statement where multiple things can be
true and let me just think of an example
of this all right let's say you have a
treehouse right in an order to get into
this treehouse you have to be super cool
and your name has to be Caleb Jimmy or
Sally right that means we have three
possibilities of people can who can
enter the treehouse so let's think of a
way we could implement this let's try it
we can make a name that's a variable and
we're going to assign it the value Caleb
and then we can make an if statement if
name has the value Caleb
then I want you to print you sir are
welcome all right and then I could say
we could make another if statement in
our program if we wanted but you see
this only gives us one option Caleb and
then we can make another one with the
other name but that's that's just too
complicated what we want to do is you
want to make it where it's like if name
blah do this and then test it again if
your name is this do this and I'm going
to be teaching you how to do that in
this video so let's look we you have to
use the keyword Elif which basically
just means else if which is just another
option for a true statement so this is
how we would write this we start with
the normal if statement if name has the
value Caleb we want it to print welcome
Caleb
and then we can go back and put in L LS
and then we could say Jimmy right and
then we could say if we if it's Jimmy we
say welcome Jimmy and then we can create
a third test
welcome Sally so now we have three tests
so if the name is Caleb we want it to
test I mean we wanted to prank
welcome Caleb if it's Jimmy we want to
print and welcome Jimmy if it's sadly we
wanted to say welcome Sally and then if
for some reason their name is not that
we can create an else statement oh we
don't have to put anything there sorry
so here's our final thing and we can run
this and see what happens it says
welcome Caleb so that's awesome because
the result that it gave us was dependent
upon the name of the value of the
variable name which we defined up here
as Caleb this is better than doing
something like if name is Caleb or or
Jimmy or Sally print welcome because
then it doesn't specifically say their
name and I just think that's really cool
so this will allow us to have multiple
options for the true but only one is
going to be executed all right so you
can see that it goes through here and it
reads if your name is Caleb print
welcome Caleb and it was and then it
goes down to this one and says if your
name is Jimmy welcome Jimmy but you see
it doesn't even have to run that because
this was already ran as true it doesn't
go down here and say oh it's not Jimmy
we better go go down to the if the else
statement and say you're not welcome it
doesn't do that it assumes that because
the first one is true then your
statement is complete and it skips down
it just pretty much ignores all of this
and it just prints welcome Caleb so that
is an awesome thing you can do for
programming I'll show you another way
you can visually see how this thing
works let's say we have a club right and
you have to be 18 so let's make an age
and we'll make the age 52 okay and then
we're going to make an if write if age
is greater than or equal to 18 print you
are welcome into the club yo all right
then what we can do is we can say L if
age is greater than 21 we wanted to say
you get the SPECIAL pass dog all right
and then we can make a third one l if
age is greater than or equal to let's go
65 well then we can make it say you get
the elderly discount oops
so now I have three options and then
finally we can make an else print you
are too young so I'm going to be
explaining how this works when Python
runs this it will first always test the
first if and then it looks ages 52 so we
insert 52 for this
if 52 is greater than or equal to 18
print you are welcome into the club bill
and you can see that it is there for
this one will be implemented even though
when we created this program program we
would probably want it to print this one
you get the special pass dog because he
is over he or she is over the age of 52
you see what I'm saying
so this is where technical errors can
happen in your program not due to your
syntax but because of your program
structure so when we run this it'll
first test the first one it'll be ran as
true therefore it skips over everything
else and the end then it prints out you
are welcome into the club yo let's try
it
you are welcome into the club yo so now
you can see that this is going to cause
a problem so in order to fix this you
might have to say if age is greater than
or equal to 18 or oh oh
claire's the texting me man that's but
it's been a while she isn't texted me in
like a good two hours anyways you might
have to make a range if your age is 18
through 20 say you're welcome into the
club yo then 52 would not pass is true
and
going to be implementing all of that in
this video simply because it's kind of
off topic but we will be doing that in
future videos to come so be sure to
stick around and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
