what looks like a tile most but it's
over a bunch or a group of notes so you
may see this note the snow that note
that note that's an eighth note and you
may see like this little half loop
thingy arc looking cool thing imaging
this is what is known as a musical
phrase and what you do for this phrase
varies for spaced piece but typically
you'll see multiple phrases beside each
other like this and this will be like
I'm like okay you're going to breathe
here and to play the next spot it
doesn't always necessarily mean you play
them connected or anything that depends
on the other articulation within the
song but that is a phrase now like for
stringed instruments instruments such as
violence that may be a time to switch
the direction of the bow or anything
like that or for wind instruments to get
their breath this is because the writer
of the song the composer may know what
sounds best and they may want you to
breathe between specific points as in to
not interrupt the song et Cie so that's
a phrase and music you may see what's
called a turn now this is a way to alter
the way a note is played so rather than
having this snow you will have the note
above it before it the note below it
back to the original note it's a way it
looks like ok so you have this note you
have this little loop thingy it's hard
to draw it looks like this and it's
basically telling you to do a turn
between the main note right here let's
know whatever pitch this is on on the
staff for example a more common thing is
a trill I don't know if that's brown
straight oh well it's real now this is
an alternation or a fluctuation between
two notes so you may have let's say this
is AC but when you're playing it you're
going to quickly alter from
see to be so let me lower the pitch of
this one C to B C to B and you're going
to continue that for as long as notice
that's called a trill and it creates a
new style of music now when you see a
trill it looks like you have a note and
then above it you'll see like a really
fancy tea and then a little R I can't
draw the teens like I don't know but
yeah that's what a trill is so if you
little see a little TR above a note that
means a trill another thing you may see
is what's known as a glissando I'll
leave is how you pronounce it go to
Sandow now the way that glissando is
written is you'll have a note and then
another note and they'll be like this
little wavy thing between it and it will
say goal is what this means I'll sure if
has 2 s's or not oh this will tell you
this is basically telling you to play
every single note between the two
pitches very quickly so basically I like
like that I don't know how if that lines
up but basically if you for example good
way to think of this is a trombone
player which has the horn and then a
little sliding mechanism rather than
going C so C then up to G you can go see
C sharp D d sharp and so forth all the
way up to G very quickly same thing for
other instruments you just won't get
every single pitch in between the two
because the trombone can have specific
pitches because the trombone can reach
every single pitch between the two nodes
but that doesn't matter that's what it
goes up now another thing is when you
have a glissando 'he's more than one
it's actually glissandi una is why i
don't know and i don't know why it's
like that some guy made it that way so
you can also have Lassonde
is going down obviously and it should
had to us as afraid that out that's what
I go Sandow is
