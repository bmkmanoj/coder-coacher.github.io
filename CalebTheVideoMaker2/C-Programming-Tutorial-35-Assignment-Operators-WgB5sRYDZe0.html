makeup to hopefully you guys are quite
enjoying this series I am personally
enjoying it quite a bit so let's get
started okay so the very first thing I
want to do is I actually want to work
with the file from the previous video
but I'm going to expand and start
introducing some more operators so if
you type in LS and assuming you've been
following along this whole time the file
that we just worked on in the last video
is increment decrement I'm going to
rename that to better explain what I'm
trying to do so I'm going to move that
and I'm going to move the increment
decrement file and I'm going to rename
it to increment decrement assignment see
you know it's got to make it longer and
longer and now when you list your files
you'll see that it is now appropriately
named so let's open that in here you can
see that we have a value we're assigning
that value to output and then we're
decrementing that value now if you
remember in the last video I mentioned
this was kind of like doing this you're
taking the original value of pizzas to
eat subtracting one from it and
assigning it back into pizzas to eat
well the benefit of this line is that
you can actually decrement by larger
numbers for example I could subtract you
know 30 that's way better than having
the decrement operator 30 times this is
actually going to come up a lot where
you need to decrement by some certain
value or increment by some certain value
but you don't want to have to type out
the variable name twice and do all this
crazy stuff anytime you type out
something twice you increase the chance
of typos so I'm going to be teaching you
the shorthand in this video so let's get
rid of this line and we'll also get rid
of the output so now all we have is the
pizzas to eat now in any reasonable
situation eating only 100 pizzas that is
totally not enough to fill the average
American so we need to increment that by
100 so the longhand way to do this would
be pizzas to eat
equals pizzas to eat plus 100 oh man
nearly died typing all that stuff I do
not want to have to type that again so
the easy way to do this is to actually
say pizzas to eat plus equals 100 that
is the same exact thing as this line
right here
the thing is though it takes only one
variable name it takes a little while to
get used to this syntax but once you get
used to it it makes a whole lot of sense
basically what you're saying is that the
new value of pizzas to eat we're going
to add a hundred to it that's all it
really means so let's get rid of this
top line here and let's print the value
after we increment it by 100 and to do
that I'm just going to copy this value
up here using YY and then P perfect and
now let's save it and run it boom there
you go one hundred two hundred the
technical term for this increment
operator is called the plus equals
operator huh totally didn't forget there
for a minute
and it is not the only one of the fancy
assignment operators there's actually
ones for other you could say other
arithmetic operators combined with the
assignment operator so let's go over
those now pizzas to eat - equals that
will subtract the value a certain amount
pizzas to e multiplied equals that will
multiply the value by some value so at
this point we add a hundred then we
subtract 100 and then multiplied by two
so we should be at 200 if we've done
everything right next we have the
division equals so this one will
actually divide the value by some number
so we can divide it by four and this
will give us 50 now the last one this
one's a little confusing but once you
figure it out it's very powerful we're
using the modulus equals so it's pizzas
to eat % equals and then you can divide
it by some number such as 5 and this
will give us the remainder and the
remainder is actually 0
these operators are great because once
you are familiar with them they more
clearly Express what you're trying to do
they also reduce the chance of errors so
there's just a whole lot of good things
about them please try to familiarize
yourself with them and as a last thing
I'm just going to print the value just
to make sure I didn't go wrong all right
let's run this and just make sure we
didn't do anything crazy wrong okay we
have some errors oh I just forgot to
send me : so at the end of this we need
to add a semicolon save that got those
fixed now let's try this and there you
go the final output is zero so thanks
