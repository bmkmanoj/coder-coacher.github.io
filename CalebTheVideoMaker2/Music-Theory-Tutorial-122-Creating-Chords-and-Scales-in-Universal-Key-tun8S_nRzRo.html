about representing notes using universal
pitch we talked about that a couple
videos back that's just a way instead of
having a b c you can have one two three
well we're basically just taking the
scale degrees to represent certain
things that way it's Universal no matter
what key were in whether we're starting
in c g or d or a or anything really
let's go with a d sharp major scale
because that would be fallen that's yeah
so so basically we're just going to
raise everything up a half step so d e f
g a b c so now we have d sharp G sharp F
double sharp G sharp a sharp be sharp
and C double sharp I don't know why I
decided to do that I just wanted to so
here is a major scale so rather than San
ok we're going to play d sharp followed
by f double sharp we can just use the
scale degrees one two three four five
six seven so the third is f double sharp
now why am I telling you this all again
I just wanted to go over more of how we
can represent chords and scales and
everything else so for example we can
have a major chord we can represent this
with a major third followed but followed
by a a minor third we can represent as a
major third and a perfect fifth from the
root or we can represent it using this
universal what did I call it this
Universal key system so we can have the
one or the route we can have a third and
we can have a fifth if we want to make
it minor we flat the third now this is
very common and you will see this all
often so basically we're taking the
major scale and altering it so let's say
a minor scale we will have 1 2 3 flat 4
5 6 flat
seven flat and then the octave so this
is a way we can represent the minor
scale because we're altering the third
sixth and the seventh from the major
scale rather than saying the whole step
half step pattern we can just say take
the major scale subtract this node a
half step this one half step and this
one half step that's common for triads
also so we can have see eg or we can
have 135 so if we get into that we can
create the Triads 1351 flag third 51
flatted third flatted fifth one third
and a raised fifth so this is a way to
represent major minor diminished and
augmented triads and this is very common
method so what does this mean well it's
basically the same thing we've been
talking about forever although I just
wanted to say when you have an
illustration such as three flatted fifth
this is telling you to alter it from the
major scale unless stated otherwise so
for example if we can have we can create
a minor scale by flatting the third the
sixth and the seventh now if we're
talking about a different type of minor
scale such as melodic minor then you can
tell people to flatten the notes in
relation to the minor scale so you have
to figure out what we're relating back
to typically it will be the major scale
well often you may see it as the minor
scale the natural minor because you can
actually figure out the other minor
scales from the natural minor scale so
that is that you may also see it from
pentatonic scales if you know about them
I may have taught that as I remember so
you may see a minor pentatonic which
just tells you to flat the third or
whatever and now that is all I have to
save on
that next video I think I'm going to be
going over something else so see that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
