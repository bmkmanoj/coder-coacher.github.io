are all hello everybody in this video I
will be talking about slash quartz you
may have seen these in your music
adventures they look something like this
you have the name of the chord and then
a forward slash this is forward the top
so this is not a forward slash that's a
back slash for those who you don't know
so forward slash and then another note
this is known as a slash chord so what's
this this is telling you that we want an
f-sharp in the bass so this is saying a
D major chord with an f-sharp in the
bass so just in case you didn't know a D
major chord consists of a D F sharp and
a so if we're on a piano we may play
this on the treble and then down on the
bass the left hand is going to play a D
so we have a D in the base and a diva's
your chord in the right hand well if we
want an f-sharp in the bass instead of
playing a D we are going to play and
f-sharp that's the idea behind slash
chords now just to say one more thing
the but no in the bass does not always
have to be a diatonic no it can be out
of the original scale so I get I could
be an ID /f to create something new now
we may hear something known as a bass
walk down this is very common when it
comes to slash chords this is so the
base goes walks down pretty
self-explanatory this is common with op1
fifth and sixth chord so let's say on
this scale of g WG a b c d sharp and G
and we harmonize the major scale we get
G major a minor B minor C major D major
a minor F sharp diminished and ng
excellent escape that skelter might as
well so now if we play the one chord
followed by the fifth chord we would get
G major this chord would be G a B C D D
major and then the sixth chord minor E
minor but then if I want to show you
something cool if we take this fifth
chord and we can put a slash to alter
the bass instead of having GV d D F
sharp a e EG b we can alter this so the
F sharp is now on the bass for this I
get F sharp D F sharp so now if you look
at the bass it goes from G to F sharp to
eat we have a descending bass walk down
so that's really cool and that's
something that's very common with flash
chords so yeah basically all we did was
just add an extra note in the bass we're
still playing the D major chord and
we're just we're just changing this note
right here everything else is the same
all we did was move ivan extra f-sharp
in the bass right so yeah
hey guys I have one more thing to say
just a little addition to this this
video because I have another thing to
say about I'll have enough content to
create a whole another video about it
you may hear these things called
compound chords compound chords and they
look like this almost like just like we
had this
be sure not to get these two things
confused because this one is telling you
to put the note put another note in the
base this one is telling you to play
both of them so if you see something
like this that means you play a C and a
G so you actually a c e G B D which is
actually AC 11th chord yeah cuz this
would be a seventh chord would be a 9th
chord sorry this would be a c9 chord so
if you don't know much about that will
we get into that soon so stick around
and that's all I have to say for this
video subscribe and that's it
what are you doing stuff too but mostly
subscribe and watch all my videos see
you around
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
