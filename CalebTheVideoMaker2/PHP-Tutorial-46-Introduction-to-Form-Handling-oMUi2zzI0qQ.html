tutorial and I'm gonna get started but
first I just wanted to talk with you for
guys for a little bit all right so I'm
going to tell you a story so I woke up
the other day the 24th 24th yes and it
was like super late I woke up like 11:30
p.m. so I was like dude bro mom bro mom
dude
Christmas is in like 30 minutes I gotta
make a video right
I gotta make a Christmas so I'm like
what's up mom making some vids but then
anyways after I got got my gangster out
and I was like mom I'm gonna go make
some videos and I'm gonna do it all
night and I'm gonna party so I thought I
was planning my um my brain and I was
thinking last year I set up this booby
trap right to catch Santa and he this
this manipulative loser
lured my parents into this booby trap
and I caught my parents and I had to
wake up in the middle of the night to go
release my parents from my own booby
trap to catch Santa and this is not
right so I've had this garage against
Santa this whole time let me tell you
this year he's gonna get paid back she
likes cookies right right right yeah
yeah yeah how's it feel she's not gonna
know what hit him
all right now let's start the actual
video so this video I want to talk about
form handling and the basics of that so
I don't really remember if I explain
form handling but basically with PHP one
of the most common things you do is
handle forms what is a form
well I form is when you go to a website
and they have like text box such as your
username and password that's a form you
put your information in there and you
click Submit or enter or whatever
well that form all of those values are
sent to a PHP script which then takes
those values does something with them
and returns a new page to your web
browser so for example if you're logging
in you'll give your username and your
password that form all those values get
sent to the PHP script the PHP script
checks if those values are the same as
what's stored in a database to make sure
you're an actual account because if you
put some random stuff in it's not going
to match any database content and it'll
say oh incorrect password but if it
matches well then it just handled that
form it did something with that those
values it tested if they were in a
database and then it will grant access
to the website and go to the user
specific content that's the basics of
handling forms well when you're creating
HTML forms there's two things you really
have to pay attention to there is action
and then there's a method and you would
have saw this in the last previous two
videos or so where I explained what
exactly these are alright so you create
for our examples the first examples are
going to go through we're going to have
two pages we're going to have an HTML
page and then we're going to have a PHP
page now as you get more advanced you
can put all of this content onto one
page but as we get started I am
introducing all of these concepts
I can't just dive into this super
advanced stuff or you're not going to be
able to follow so keep in mind what
we're learning is not necessarily how
it's going to be taught in future videos
because I'm kind of adding more as we go
so basically now we're going to have two
pages in the future we'll probably have
one page for some
samples and also validate data better
but for now we're just learning the
basics how things work and then we can
add security and extra features like
that so action this is where the pH the
HTML form page form gets sent so just to
illustrate this better here we have to
form PHP validators or whatever here we
have an HTML form within this web page
so over here is our HTML and here we
have two PHP scripts all right well this
form data that we put within this form
where is it supposed to go is this
supposed to be validated by this script
or this script so let's say we created
this script in 2011 and it has weak
security features and as we got better
at programming we made a new PHP page
which did basically the same thing but
tested the results to make sure they
were valid inputs well we would want
this HTML page to use the updated
version so that is what action does
action is what PHP script are we sending
this form data to are we sending it to
this one are we sending it to this one
or are we sending it to another one
that's what action is for all right so
I'm not going to be going through all
the syntaxes and stuff because we just
did that in the previous video and when
we're doing that in upcoming videos I'm
just explaining concepts so when you
create the HTML form you have to put an
action and you have to put a method
basically you just put that with with
the P the HTML form tag alright now what
is the method I'm not going to get super
into this right in this video but I will
be explaining it in depth and upcoming
videos
the method is how we submit that data
and there's two main ways we
what's known as get we have what's known
as post all right so as we go on in this
series we'll be using these two terms
and basically this is a this will treat
the form differently so for example if
you're working with something that has
to be secured you're going to want to
use post what get does is it actually
adds the form values into the URL which
you can then bookmark if you wished and
I know you don't really understand
completely how each one works because we
just learned about them but basically as
we go you will see two methods so it'll
be like method equals post for example
that means we are using the post method
and then we can retrieve that data on
our PHP page and when I first started
learning PHP this was the most confusing
thing because I don't understand why do
you have to get in post
don't worry about it too much all you
really need to think about is uh there's
two types get and post post is use for
secure things
the only time gets really used is when
we are retrieving information just think
getting information from something
because that's you can you can do that
so as you go on think that we have post
and that we have given and in our
upcoming video we'll be explaining what
these do so um that's all I'm really
gonna get into that for this video I'll
be sure to check out my upcoming ones
what we can do then is let me draw this
out we had our HTML page and let's say
we used the post method and the action
sent this to a PHP script so we send
these form data to a PHP script
that means anything we put in that form
gets assigned to a super global array so
if we had a name and password for
example in our form these are taken from
the form stored in this array which we
can then access using our PHP script and
work with those values all right so
basically that is how the in-depth
beginner version concept kind of works
these values are stored in a global
array which we'll learn about arrays it
stores multiple values so for example
this will be stored in one variable and
it stores this and this all right then
with our PHP script we can access that
data in really this video is just to
understand concepts I'm not trying to
teach you the actual programming because
I can do that better when I'm focusing
just on that so now that you understand
the concept as we go into future videos
you're going to understand oh this is
this this is that blah blah blah blah
blah all right so hopefully I was
hopeful if you have any questions be
sure to subscribe and also be sure to
check the upcoming few videos where I'll
be teaching this in depth so you finally
understand how data is retrieved from
HTML forms and used within our PHP
script thank you and be sure to
subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
