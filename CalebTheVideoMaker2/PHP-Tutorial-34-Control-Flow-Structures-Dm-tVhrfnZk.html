from Caleb the video maker - if you like
this video be sure to subscribe in this
video I'm going to be talking about
control structure
it's basically loops and ifs and all
that stuff so first when we learned
about was the if and the way this works
is it will test a condition if it's true
it will do something for us such as echo
true okay obviously I need to enclose
this within PHP tags so to do that we do
PHP and then we close it like that all
right
and we name this an extra PHP source so
on the same page alright so this runs a
test so if v is greater than 6 that go
true it's not so nothing happens or it
can be if 6 it's greater than it greater
than 5 that's going to be true so it
runs true we could also add an else to
this so this works basically if it's
false it's going to do something else
and we can't we don't have to just that
go out true or false we can pretty much
do whatever you want there so let's try
flipping these again if if 2 is greater
than 5 it's false so it's gonna go to
the boss you could also on top of that
add an else if so the way that works is
it's going to do a third test so you are
going to have to hat I'm sorry it's
gonna do it's going to do a second test
so you're going to need parentheses if 5
is greater than 2 do whatever is within
the bar of code 5 is greater than 2 so
obviously the second one is going to
read run that's because the first one it
test it if 2 is greater than 5 it's not
so
this is not get ran it goes to the l-sit
and that is true so gets ran but if this
was a 1 it's going to go to the else
boss alright cool so those are the three
basic if statements we also learn about
key switch so the switch looks like this
it's a little more complex so here's the
basics it's going to test something
within here so basically you're not
going to actually make an expression
you're just going to put some things
such as a variable and then if it's 0 so
let's define it so I equals 0 if it's 0
it's going to echo equals 0 and it does
equal 0 so that is run as fruit we can
also have other cases within this so if
it's a 1 what it's going to do is echo
equals 1 and then it's going to break
and I'll explain that in a second so now
it's still 0 but if we change the value
of 1 alright well now it's 1 so let's
add two more so case number 2 equals 2
case number 3 equals 3 alright so
obviously it's still going to equal 1
because we never changed it let's try
changing it to week 3 and it's going to
go for the the case 3 we can also have a
default
all right so now let's try making this
100 and it's going to go for the default
all right so what does the break do well
the break just stops the program the
barcode from continuing so if we never
had any breaks it's going to cause some
problems because every single line of
code after the break is still going to
be ran so let's see what happens now
let's set this equal to zero and we get
equals zero equal 1 equal to equal three
and none of the above so it's important
that we have the breaks within the
switch statement we put one on the
default in case the default does not go
at the bottom in some cases so as you
can see if we did not have the break on
the default this is what we would get
equals zero and then it breaks so I'm
not going to lead on the breaks just to
show you that again but that is
important to have the break and I also
like to have the default at the bottom
all right so that is the switch
statement next we learned about the
while loop that's pretty simple I really
need to pick either single or double
quotes because I'm using whatever I feel
like it's time while loop is going to
execute while a condition stays true so
it's going to continue to test something
okay like is the user signed on if so
grant access I mean that's just a stupid
example probably not very impractical
but that is how the while loop works we
also have the do-while loop which looks
like this
and then within these you were going to
do something such as echo while and then
we test something so let's create a very
lobs outside of here x equals five and
that can change it's just temporary so
while actually let's say x equals true
so while variable x equal to true it's
going to okay we'll see it's always true
so it's going to print like a limited
and it's probably gonna cause my
computer to like explode so if it's
false well man all right show you all
right first or true the reason I put
first or true because even though it's
false this is still going to be ran at
least once so this is the first time
running it which is why it's echoed if
it was the second time running it's not
going to run so the final one we learned
about was the for each which we just
talked about so let's quickly make an
array I'll just use the same one I use
last time just to keep that within the
list though it's not all by itself in
another video
and then within these parentheses we are
going to put the array name
oops are not equals as and then we can
just put the variable only one and we
could echo that very let's try that all
right so now it printed one two and then
9000 one you could also echo a line
break well so those were all the control
structures that we talked about we also
talked about the ternary operator which
I'm not going to get into in this video
but you can learn about that in my
previous video or whatever so thank you
for watching all of those hopefully that
was helpful comprehensive review so if
not I'm sorry for wasting your time but
I just wanted to make sure you had all
figured out and easily seen on the
computer so thank you all for watching
and I will see you in the next video
please be sure to subscribe because it
really means a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
