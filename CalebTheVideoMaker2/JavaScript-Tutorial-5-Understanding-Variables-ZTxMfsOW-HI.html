I'm going to be specifically talking
about variables in JavaScript a lot of
this will carry over for other languages
though but we're specifically talking
for JavaScript so be sure to subscribe
to my youtube channel that would be
extremely helpful and I would really
appreciate that
alright so variables are assigned a
value temporarily that's not to say that
the value is going to change basically
temporarily means it's not permanent so
it's not going to change automatically
it's not going to magically disappear
basically it means that we can change it
or update it if necessary because
variables are only designed to
temporarily store value that doesn't
mean has a time limit that just means it
can be changed if necessary or by
accident in some cases which can cause
some errors or different results than
what is expected so the variable has the
name name so that's kind of confusing so
I guess you could make it something like
first name but this example this
variable has the name name so this is
what we call the variable the names
technical term is identifier so this
right here is known as the identifier
this variable name has a value of Caleb
so the variable identifier x' must start
with a letter underscore which is this
right here or a dollar sign there's no
spaces or punctuation within the
variable you can't use a reserved
javascript word which we'll be getting
into that and there case-sensitive
that means name is not the same as name
with a capital n if you if you
initialize this variable with this name
and then you want to use it later with
this name it's not going to work out
right and you're not it's going to cause
an error
in JavaScript it's common for the coders
to use what's known as camelcase for the
identifiers names so if we look back
here actually not use an example so this
means we do not use spaces for our
custom names which we already talked
about
we don't use underscores usually either
although you can we start with a
lowercase letter and each word after
that is capital so if you look here the
first word has a lowercase letter the
second word has a capital letter the
third word has a capital letter if we
had more words than that it'd be a
really long variable name but if you
wanted to do that then each letter would
be capital this is just a convention for
JavaScript this is not required to
program in JavaScript
this is just what most people are going
to do and if you want your JavaScript to
make sense to other programmers probably
be helpful if you use camel case these
on the other hand the ones I talked
about earlier these are required we
can't have spaces in our in our variable
because that will cause an error in
JavaScript so if we start from the
beginning we declare declare that's a
vocabulary word a variable like this var
and then we type in the variable
identifier we declare the variable with
the var reserved word or keyword a
reserved word and JavaScript is a word
that is already defined and cannot be
used for identifiers such as far so
basically this is a word that is
recognized by JavaScript and basically
when JavaScript runs into this it knows
you are trying to declare a variable so
it wouldn't makes sense to use a
reserved word for your variable name or
your identifier there's there's other
reserved words but that's just an
example of one you can find a list of
all of them online so if you notice we
did not give favorite food a value all
we did was declare it and give it an
identifier well we don't actually have
to do this the value of this variable
food is undefined we can assign the
variable later in our program so
basically when we're working with
JavaScript oftentimes you're going to
want to tell JavaScript okay I'm going
to be working with these variables and
you will give them all of the vit you'll
give JavaScript all of the variables at
the beginning of your script or function
or whatever and then later you can
assign values to that variable so we
assign a variable value when when we
assign a variable value it's said to be
initialized this means the identifier
now points to a specific value by being
assigned that value so now if we if we
erased all of our code we started with
this var favorite food is equal to
celery the variable with the identifier
favorite food is assigned the value
celery once a variable is declared it
can be initialized right then or later
on so here we type var to declare a
variable we give it an identifier
favorite food camel case writing so
first letter lowercase second letter
uppercase and then we can write now we
can give it a value favorite food is
equal to pizza once again this is just a
comment so you can ignore that or we can
do it later within our program but here
you see we declared the variable and
assigned it a value so this is different
than this up here I'm going to delete
this comments distracting me all right
so these are both different let's say
these are two different scripts so not
on the same script this one you declare
the variable favorite food and then we
assign a value to favorite food with the
assignment operator so that's the equal
sign
oops down here we're declaring the
variable
giving it an identifier and assigning it
a value as you can see this is basically
the same thing as this only it's
condensed down to one step and it's
declared and initialized all on one line
so for this we could separate this and
we could basically define the value of
the variable later this one it's
automatically defined I want you to
realize though if we're going to
initialize the variable by giving it a
value we do not say var again we only
use that when we give JavaScript the
variable we're going to use so we
declare the variable so here we say var
we're going to declare a variable
favorite food so if we did if this was
all one script like this this wouldn't
be right because you can see we declare
a variable named favorite food we assign
it the value pizza let's say I want to
change the value and then we declare it
again
well if you look up here it's already
declared so this isn't this is not good
for our JavaScript script so if we
wanted to reassign the value all we
would do was put that we would not put
var again but if you want to declare
them both at the same declare it and
initialize it at the same time that is
how you would do it that was a lot
hopefully that made sense so there's a
little bit I haven't really talked about
scope yet and I'm not going to get into
it very much but basically you can you
can create a variable without using the
keyword var and you can just
automatically assign it a value this
will create a global like variable which
basically just means it's accessible
anywhere within your script typically so
basically I'm not going to explain this
too much right now because it make this
video too long and I need an entire
video to explain that concept but
basically just now you may see variables
that are not defined and this is
different than declaring it like this so
they're not exactly the same that's
something you need to know
all right so on to the next it's very
important to understand that variables
do not have types the values do so when
I'm talking about types basically
there's different types or data types in
Java Script
such as string number boolean or
anything like that so the variables do
not have types so here we have a an
identifier of a variable favorite food
so now we have a variable named favorite
food and it has the value pizza this is
not a variable of type string it's just
a variable this is a variable with a
value of type string so that's very
important in JavaScript the variables do
not have values I mean sorry the
variables do not have types the values
have types this goes along with knowing
that javascript is a loosely typed
language but there's more to that than
just this so that's basically long when
we talk about right here but all you
need to know is that the value has a
type such as string or number and it
doesn't matter if we we don't have to
tell JavaScript that oh this variable is
a string oh this variable is a number
all we have to do is assign it a
valuable a variable and oh sorry all we
have to do is assign it a value and
JavaScript will do the rest for us so
it's a weakly typed language this means
variables are not defined as a certain
type so variable favorite food is
assigned the value pizza this is a
string value you see favorite food is
now reassigned the value 5 without
quotation marks there's no quotation
marks on it it's just 5 this is
basically reassigning a number as the
value so now this is
a number data type in a strict language
this would cause an error because we
would be changing a string variable to a
number variable so in a strict language
javascript is not a strict language it's
a loosely or a weakly typed language it
is not a strict language so this would
cause an error in strict languages the
variables have types in a weakly type
language the values have types so this
is just to say that we don't have to
tell JavaScript what type of value were
assigning it and if you're new to
programming that's really not that big
of a deal and you you're probably like
why are you explaining this 50 times
well if you're coming from a different
language that's a strict language it's
it's probably confusing how JavaScript
works with the variables we'll all you
need to know is that the values have a
type not the variable itself so favorite
food can be a variable that stores a
number or a string or an object or a
function or anything like that okay
because javascript is a weakly type
language that means the variable
favorite food does not have a permanent
type but can be assigned any type of
value so once again variables do not
have types the values assigned to them
do so favorite food is the variable the
name of the variable the identifier
pizza is the value of type string this
is not a variable of type string that's
just something you need to drill in your
brain now a data type is the type of
data assigned to a variable for example
string number array lien et Cie anything
like that now we also have objects and
array like we'll get into that in the
future video but anyways there are two
groups of data types with a total of
three different classifications and we
will be discussing the
and the next lesson so hopefully that
was helpful and I can I'll see you oh
yeah here's a review here's all of our
vocabulary we learned a variable
temporarily stores of value identifiers
is the name of the variable sign
operator is how we assign it a value a
value is what the variable temporarily
holds camelcase
is a convention used by JavaScript
programmers where we leave the first
letter uncapitalized and then the second
word with no spaces capitalized reserved
words are words known by JavaScript
already such as var and so forth to
declare declaring a variable is to say
that it exists and it will be used in
our program initializing a variable is
giving that declared variable a value a
weekly type language is something that
does not give variables datatypes
it gives the values datatypes and a
datatype is just any type of value such
as a string a number boolean or a null
or anything like that and that's what we
will be getting into in our next video
so this video is kind of long sorry for
dragging on about the same thing but
hopefully that was helpful and helped
clear some specifics up with JavaScript
and I will see you in the next video be
sure to subscribe and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
