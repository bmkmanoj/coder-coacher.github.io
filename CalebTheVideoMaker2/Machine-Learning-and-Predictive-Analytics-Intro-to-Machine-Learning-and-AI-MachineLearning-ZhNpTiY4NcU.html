it is Caleb coming at your pre-recorded
and as you can probably tell them a
little bit under the weather so if I
don't make it to the end of the series
thank you for watching this video in
this series we're gonna be talking about
machine learning and this is this is
like a super buzzword nowadays I mean
you can watch like a Cheerios commercial
and they'll throw machine learning in
there just to get more views I mean it's
crazy but how many of these people
actually know what machine learning is
so my goal is to take this fancy magical
word and break it down into steps of how
this thing actually works and I don't
just want like a simple definition this
is what machine learning is I want to
know some practical uses examples and
all that so this series is gonna be
pretty sweet it's gonna be kind of like
your overview survey 101 course and
we're gonna go in more depth as we go
into it so hopefully it's a lot of fun
and yeah it's gonna be really good for
your resume so let's get started to
begin machine learning is part of
artificial intelligence so if you
consider the circle to be artificial
intelligence machine learning is a piece
of that so essentially machine learning
is used to make computers seem
intelligent and by definition machine
learning is like teaching computers to
learn so rather than programming every
single possible outcome what we do is we
take a computer and we feed it a bunch
of data and it's going to learn from
that data and be able to improve over
time
the reason machine learning is becoming
so popular now is because we have so
much data at our hands think of all the
social networks out there think of IOT
Internet of Things that's essentially
where normal household objects or
sensors or any little tiny things are
now connected to the Internet and we're
getting so much data that we don't
really know what to do with it and we
can't analyze all that data ourselves so
we are turning to computers to do the
analyzing for us and this is really
really super popular in something called
data analytic
so when you hear analytics just think of
the charts and graphs that document data
and show trends and our data well we can
add to this discipline by having
predictive data analytics so what that
is is that's going to take data and use
that to predict the future and machine
learning is huge when it comes to
predictive data analytics that's just
one of the applications of machine
learning but if you start with
predictive data analytics you can kind
of go into the other fields as this is
kind of the basis for machine learning
we are going to be using machine
learning to look at data that we have so
consider this to be our data we want to
get insights from that data that we
normally couldn't get so if I gave you
you know tons and tons and tons of data
just terabytes or petabytes and ask you
to come up with something useful from
that data it would be very challenging
but using machine learning we can come
to new insights that we normally
couldn't do on our own yeah so that
means we can basically predict the
future simple as that so when you hear
all of these companies using machine
learning and their advertising and their
products essentially what that means is
they are taking all the data they get
from you and they're using that data
with algorithms that are going to
improve their products so you know you
might have a facial recognition app with
machine learning and that's going to be
able to use all the historical data of
images of your face and other people's
face to better recognize faces and to
better recognize your face and changes
in your face but I want to know what
machine learning is beyond just that
like how do we actually go about doing
machine learning and there's a lot of
learning to this a lot of the series is
going to be that foundational knowledge
needed to understand how to use machine
learning so I'm really excited hopefully
you guys will get a lot from this series
and if you have any questions or
suggestions please leave them in the
it's below and I will be sure to read
those thank you guys and please be sure
to subscribe as that really helps out my
channel also I just wanted to mention
before I forget that a lot of the
content from this series I developed
using a book called predictive oh shoot
I refrain I was going I developed using
a based upon a book machine learning and
called machine learning for predictive
data analytics I will put a description
in the link below so be sure to check
that out alright peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
