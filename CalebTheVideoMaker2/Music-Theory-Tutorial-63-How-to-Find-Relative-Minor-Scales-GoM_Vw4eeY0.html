something else that's very cool about
relative minor scales if we have a major
scale such as the C major scale C D G a
B and then we go up to see you don't
live higher if we take the 3rd note from
the top we get the relative minor scale
also known as the 6th so the scale
degrees 1 2 3 4 5 6 the 6th the 6th note
in the scale we can get the relative
minor scale so let's try it for a G
scale G a B C D F sharp G 1 2 3 4 5 6
the relative minor scale for Ag scale
isn't easy now if we look at the circle
of fifths again one more time hopefully
the last time ever this legacy G and the
relative minor case scale is in fact e
and so forth so let's try 4 D we just
saw that it was B we're gonna prove it
so here is a D major scale cos D F sharp
D sorry I forgot the de F sharp G a B C
sharp and then D get so the sixth one 1
2 3 4 5 6 so B is the relative minor
scale
that's very cool when you need to figure
out the relative minor scales because
the relative minor scales once again use
the same notes as the major scale so I
can I can show you this by following the
patterns of the minor and major scales
and then a half step down to D that is
the D
major scale now let's go for the one two
three four five six relative minor scale
B minor start on B take a whole step up
B to C C to C sharp B C sharp half step
from C sharp will become D whole step
from D would be e whole step from E to F
sharp so far I got these four and then
half step from F sharp is G whole step a
and a half step whole step sorry would
be B so now we can see the sharp notes
in here F sharp and C sharp same four up
here that's why it's said to be the
relative minor scale because they both
use the same notes on the keyboard or
any pitched instrument such as a guitar
trumpet you know anything that makes
notes xylophone poco all concealed so
yes subscribe and in the next video I'll
be going over something awesome whoa see
ya click subscribe some around here
probably follow me on Twitter like this
video down there or up there wherever
they move it who knows thank you bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
