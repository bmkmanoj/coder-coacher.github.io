going over something called the half
diminished seventh chord
these markers stick piece of crap
okay this one's still alive after min I
can't complain now I got these markers
for free so thank you old teacher no I'm
not calling you old saying my old
teacher I used to have who gave me these
I swear if you're watching this I'm
sorry
you know unless you watch just 30 years
but anyways half-diminished now
basically this will take a minor triad
which consisted of the root a minor
third and a minor third and it's going
to add a major on top of it it's gonna
give it more of a major sound but it
still do it's more diminished than it is
major so me trying to make one of these
okay example of a half diminished 7th
chord so it's called half diminished
because if it was fully diminished this
would be a minor third so this is a half
diminished 7th chord the reason we can
have a half diminished is because
there's more possible options for a
fully diminished blah blah blah blah but
on yeah so let's try make one of these
on sheet music or we're gonna make a G
half diminished now let's go eat half
diminished so I make the four circles
sweet now we have to figure out steps
I'm gonna use a piano to demonstrate
this better we're on e c e we're gonna
go three half steps up one two three
which gives us G boom G three half steps
up from G one two three we get B flat
not a sharp because we skip to a
remember because we take the third four
the first third and fifth circuit's yep
G B C D we're taking the first third
fifth and seventh so basically we're not
taking the a which means it has to be B
flat since it's B flat we travel up from
B flat one two three
well I can't okay I'm just gonna read
four so we get D so boom we have a half
diminished E chord so yeah that's that's
all for half diminished chords next
video we'll be going over fully
diminished chords and then I think
that's about all four chords switch for
now anyway so see you then and subscribe
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
