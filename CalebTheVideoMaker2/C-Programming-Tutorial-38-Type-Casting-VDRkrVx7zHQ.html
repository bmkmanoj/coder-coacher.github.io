the house this video we're gonna be
talking about typecasting and so on the
previous video I mentioned how C was a
strongly typed language the reason I
tell you all of that was primarily so
you would understand the content in this
video so we need to imagine the C
programming language as an old grumpy
man you owe this man a dollar so you go
up to him and you're like hey man I
finally got your money here you go
here's four quarters and four quarters
are going to add up to be $1 but the
problem is you didn't borrow four
quarters from this old man you borrowed
a dollar bill so he was expecting a
dollar bill and this my friend is
unacceptable so he beats you over your
head with this cane and says yo bro give
me my money even though you gave him the
correct amount of money you're probably
wondering what this has to do with
anything but it will start to make sense
in just a minute
essentially he wanted one dollar but you
gave him one dollar and it seems like
the same thing what if you think about
it the datatypes behind these numbers
are different this is considered an
integers and this over here is
considered a double so to fix this
problem you can go over to the bank and
exchange your quarters for $1 so you
hand your quarters in and outcomes and
dollar now that you've got an actual
dollar bills you can go back give it to
the old man and he's happy in computer
science terms you could say that your
dollar was typecasted to a dollar and
this one being of a double data type to
an integer datatype you probably could
have gone without the story but the
moral of the story is that C is very
picky when it comes to data types so we
often need to typecast things there are
two main categories of typecasting
implicit and explicit when it comes to
implicit typecasting this is something
that can happen automatically we don't
have to tell the computer to do anything
and you can think of the result as being
Lossless so when I say lossless
essentially what I'm saying is you could
typecast an integer of one to a double
of 1.00 and you can see you didn't lose
any data at all
you're essentially storing the same
exact thing just in a different data
type the other type of typecasting is
explicit and what that means is you have
to tell the computer to do it you
explicitly say yo bro I want you to
typecast this and you can think of this
as lafi I think is the word you can
imagine starting with a double of 1.85
for example and typecasting that to an
integer of just one and you can see
you've actually lost some data that's
why it's explicit you have to tell the
computer the computer doesn't just
assume what you want to delete and all
that you have to be very specific and
say hey I wanted to typecast this value
to an integer it doesn't happen
automatically a great example of
implicit typecasting is if you do
something like this you can see in this
situation we are assigning an INT to a
double so it's automatically going to
get stored as 1.0 I'm sure you really
want an example of an explicit type
conversion to so an example of that is
if you have a value such as 3.5 oxide
and before that in parentheses you put
the datatype you want to convert it to
and this is going to convert this value
to three we had to specifically say hey
we want to convert this the next video
is going to go over examples of this
concept and also go over some problems
you're probably going to encounter and
how to avoid those problems so thanks
