are all of them are nerds modes we have
learned it learned and that's all of
them there isn't any more but basically
in this video I'm going to be teaching
you how to pronounce them all and how to
memorize them and I know I probably
should try to pronounce them as I was
going but oh well well a short way to
remember them
well first things first they all end in
e'en like the name Ian I in so that's a
good way to remember it
so first one it's pronounced I own and
I'm gonna write in black Ionian Dorian
Phrygian Lydian mixolydian so those are
all pretty simple they all have normal
English words I own door fridge lid mix
a lid then it gets weird you may hear
this Aeolian aureolin I pronounce it e
oh yeah Yeol I don't know how to write
that in an English word then this one
lock LOC r la creme so Locker e in oops
that's how to pronounce every single one
out Ionian Dorian Phrygian Lydian
mixolydian aeolian or Olien I'm sorry yo
lien or Aeolian so yo lien and then
Locker Ian that's how to pronounce them
all now
the way to memorize the order of these
is with a stupid little mnemonic thing
we take the first letter of each of
these and we get I DPL oh my friend came
up with we were thinking of tricks to
memorize this he came up with in dark
places love makes hey white and dark
places love makes a light take the first
letter of each one of these so in Ionian
da I mean sorry in deed dark hey Dorian
places would be Phrygian love would be
Lydian yes then love makes mixolydian a
would be eel in light would be a low
Korean that's how you can remember eyes
them all so that's all I have to say for
this video and in the next video we'll
be going over some more things about
these so see you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
