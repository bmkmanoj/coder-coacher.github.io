video you are officially going to learn
how to start programming well I mean
developing it probably the better term
but yeah programming and CSS so I showed
you how to use inline external and
internal style sheets within your HTML
but I never really told you how to use
it so when you are using CSS to edit
something you put what you are editing
over here so let's say I'm editing div
this is going to edit every single div
on the page if I just put div like this
well unless I'm using inline then it's
just that specific div but we're using
external style sheets from now on so if
I put div here yeah needs alright so if
I put div here then I put two curly
braces that is right beside the P and
then I put a what's called a property
such as color right and then a colon and
then a value to this color so I could
say red and then I close the second
purpose this is the second curly brace
always be sure I'll almost forgot to put
a semicolon after each of the values so
let me explain what's going on here we
have the div I'm gonna get some red
marker here we have to dip here this
will affect all divs we are turning the
color of the text to read so color and
what color do we want it we want it to
be red and then that that then we are
done with our
raishin then we are done commenting for
dips so that is the entire diff
declaration and I'm just gonna cross it
out now because it cool it looks cool
and it's fun it slow let me make another
one just just for fun
actually let me type it and be a lot a
lot a lot cooler if alright so often
times you will see me type out things
like this alright
the white space does not really matter
so I can put all the stuff right here
like this although when you have a lot
of stuff you may be like background
color equals black and it starts to look
a little packed and hard to read and
confused so what I like to do is I put
the element I mean the selector sorry
I'll go over the vocabulary in a minute
up with the selector and then I put the
curly brace and then I press ENTER then
each element I press ENTER again and
then I close the element or the selector
the curly braces below the the selector
so this lines up with the curly brace
this is how I type my CSS all right now
let me go into a little more detail here
we're going into to talk about
vocabulary this right here this can be
anything that is on your page that's a
tag so for example it could be it could
be a which is anchor it could be h1 it
could be h2 it could be h3 h4 it could
be paragraph it could be input it could
be list I yeah unordered list ordered
list list item so forth it can be pretty
much anything you put on
your page and your HTML let me get my
source code up here alright so it can be
take me ed it could be title it can be
link any tag on an HTML page can be used
in place of div right here I'm just
using as an example hotels pour where oh
this right here is known as a selector
that's because if we're selecting what
what what element I'm sorry
we're selecting what tag on the page
alright then we have a open curly brace
then we have back out this right here
this this is called a property there are
a lot of properties so far we have
learned color and background color
there's a lot more but I'm not going to
get into them right now we're getting
into them soon
this is known type of table here as the
property all right great now we also
have this this is known as text you
we're on air it's known as the value
valued the value of the property
all right then
those two together this entire thing
this is known as a declaration so
selector property value declaration so I
can make background blue I can make
background red they're all separate
individual declarations and with the
entire CSS language there are literally
thousands and thousands and thousands
and thousands of declaration
possibilities so you don't have to
memorize them all you'll figure them out
you'll figure out the patterns oh that's
pretty
so yeah that is what we need to know so
let's take a look at our code if I can
find it you alright there's that in our
website right here so here's what we
have and we have our style sheet over
here in a different tab and just to show
you how it works again in case you just
jumped in randomly we have it links to
the style sheet with this little code in
the title oh this is I'm sorry
this is supposed to be in the title oh
not the title this is supposed to be in
the head it was correct sorry
probably just confused you it's supposed
to be in the head all right
so it's referencing this style sheet
right here go over here and it's over
here refresh the page this is what it
looks like so we can we can put a
selector and then we can put curly
braces and then within the curly braces
we can add a property such as body no
sorry that that's not property property
such as color and then we can say blue
so this in the in all is a declaration
save it refresh and it turns paragraph
it turns all the paragraphs text blue so
if we look at the index find those we
have a paragraph here and we have a
paragraph here which is exactly what's
affected so that's great for that and
that pretty much explains how CSS works
and in the next video we're going to be
using a great example so I shall see you
then thank you and subscribe like right
now it's a good idea guys come on I make
so much content and I put a lot of work
I just ah come on
be my friend and subscribed thank you
and goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
