visiting a website at www.att.com/biz
if you want to look at this page here
are some new elements in html5 so I
haven't really gone over a lot of these
that's because there's various like
Firefox web browsers I'm sorry I kind of
drew a blank there various web browser
incompatibility with certain one of
these so I taught you the very basics of
HTML that will be useful probably
forever may not be used quite as often
but like lists and such are things you
should know even when you're working
with html5 for example and as well as
the divs and all that so when you're
working with html5 you have these things
such as an article which can explain a
specific article on a page and you can
have a side as well as a footer and a
header but exactly how these are to be
used is so confusing and unstable I
think in my opinion that I'm not sure
the best way to use these and I feel
that the way people use them the most is
not the way they were originally
designed so I saw a sweet article once
about it look up like problems with
html5 so I decided to just take the
basic html5 I mean the basic HTML tags
and teach those the ones that will
always be useful so I tried to make this
series timeless but you may need to look
at some of these new html5 tags to embed
them in your website you may be
interested in that such as audio tag
which defines sound content and so forth
so these all work in different ways
and you may have to figure out how to
get exactly the perfect web browser
Pat ability because if you're
eliminating a percentage of your
audience by using a tag that's not
properly supported then you will be you
will for one look unprofessional for to
lose viewers and three lose money if
you're making money from your website I
mean unless I mean if you have a web
development website then the chances are
most people are going to be up to date
with the content that you are posting
but if you're running something that a
lot of old web browsers will be using
sometimes the html5 tags are not the
best thing to use and do not turn out
correctly when you want to display them
so that's pretty much all I really had
to say about the html5 tags so I decided
not to use them for compatibility
reasons for one and for two I don't know
proper ways to use them and I don't want
to teach you something wrong so in the
future if I learn more about HTML and
CSS I'd love to do and awesome like
bossed out like like a lecture series
that'll just teach you everything like
that's what I like to do but right now
I'm just teaching the basics because
this originally was a plan to create a
quick course for the people are going to
take watch my PHP series who need a
basic understanding of HTML so that's
pretty much all I have to say I just
wanted to say one more thing real quick
