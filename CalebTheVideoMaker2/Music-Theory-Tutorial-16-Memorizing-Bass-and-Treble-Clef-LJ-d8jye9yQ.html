with music you don't want to spend the
time to figure out what notes are on
what line of the staff that it's too
time-consuming and when we're playing in
time at consistent tempo we don't have
time to figure that all out so we should
memorize where the notes are
now the first clef we learned about was
trouble glyph and if remember we had the
grand staff was both the bass clef and
the treble clef but for now we're just
going to use a triple cliff and it has
five lines two three four five now
typically this will wrap around on here
but I need more room so to remember I
memorize this this remember is a G so
there's a little trick e G B D F so e G
B D F we typically remember this with
every good boy does fine or every good
boy deserves fudge that's the two I've
heard so or you can make up your own
every good boy deserves fudge now the
space is if we can't count this once
between E and F I mean Ian G gave it
away F G and B would be a B and D would
be C and between D and F is e and this
comedians he says face so all we have to
remember his face like a human face or
an animal face and that's FAC e so now
we know we have egbdf so we're thinking
oh what's this note right here well it's
actually a D because we know every good
boy D deserves basically the best way to
memorize it is just to use it if you're
playing an instrument for a good while
this is going to come naturally but if
you don't so that's why I recommend
playing an instrument or like going
through this on the guitar or piano or
trumpet or anything really we're on a
keyboard application
tablet or phone hopefully that helps
that helped me a good bit fact I
probably wouldn't have survived how that
we met
now if we move on to the base cliff
oh and another good way to do this is
like set your Facebook password or
whatever to egbdf so you won't be able
to go into Facebook or whatever social
network is without memorizing it that's
a great way to memorize things but don't
tell anybody that cuz you want to want
to think that's your password or
anything okay so now we're on to base
clef we have five lines four spaces and
for this one remember this is an F right
here this line right here and the trick
to remember this is because this is a G
B D F a G B D F a this both the Clay's
great big dogs fight animals
only until I read it out I write else's
sloppily great big dogs G B D F a great
big dog spy animals now in between the
spaces G and V is an a being DS C D and
F de the FAA would be G so a c e g ace g
or all cows eat grass
except for zombie cows cows eat grass so
now there's the two tricks great big
dogs fine animals s g or all cows eat
grass for treble cleff we have every
good boy deserves fudge every good boy
does fine either one and face fac II
know for this we have great big dogs
fine animals and all cows eat grass you
can find pictures of it online I found
this one just doing a Google search
Grandstaff we have every good boy does
fine bass yeah what sound say all cars
all cars cars don't eat grass what the
oh geez get it right people cows eat
grass not cars but anyways in the next
video we're going to be moving on to
some more advanced stuff so I'll see you
then and there I am shooting you again
but yeah I'll see you then subscribe
follow me on Twitter click like you got
the subliminal message here put those
there for a reason
it's a three-step process and it's very
helpful and I like it so help me out
thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
