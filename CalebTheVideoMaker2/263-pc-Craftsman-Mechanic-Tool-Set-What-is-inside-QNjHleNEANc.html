going over piece by piece all of the
content within this craftsman mechanic
tool set so when you first get it this
is what it looks like here's the content
of it I mean the actual stuff you can
see if you are interested it's pretty
big box not too big and yeah so let's
open it here's some more content if you
would like to read this so the actual
box the cool thing about it that I like
is that everything within this has its
own spots so if you're missing something
you will easily know because it will no
longer be in this so this opens folds up
you have some extra room to store some
content here then there's three trays
you can open these by pulling these out
and then each one of these trays comes
out to have to show more content within
the box it's also cool that when there
is a spot for something it'll tell you
the label of what that thing is so then
you'll know what spot each one goes in
and it's like that for everything so you
can see over here there are some more
labels pretty sure my camera is not
focusing very well right now but that's
okay but here here you can see a label
for each thing so the first thing we're
going to go over is the wrenches when
you open the container all right so
everything has its own spot first thing
I should have mentioned is that these
are in fact ratcheting wrenches as at
least for my set so um if that's not
what you're interested in you can look
for another set or like that so yeah
sizes here 5/8 9/16 half-inch 7/16 3/8
5/16 and then for metric ten twelve
thirteen fourteen fifteen seventeen
and they're all ratcheting so yeah
they're like wrench here are all of the
pieces within the set besides the
wrenches that I just went over and as
you can see all of the trays do come out
of the box the first thing I want to
look at are in fact the ratchets there
are three of them and we'll also look at
this so the first thing we're going to
look at is the bit handle alright so the
bit handle we can use of different
socket sizes that come with it here we
have the a five millimeter six
millimeter 8 millimeter 10 millimeter 11
millimeter and then for English we have
three sixteenths one four nine thirty
seconds five sixteenths eleven thirty
seconds 3/8 and 7/16 those are all of
the different socket sizes we also have
this bit set collection over here so for
example you see if I'm getting this out
all right so this would go into a D bit
handle as so which can then be used from
there you can also use the bit to
one-fourth inch drive converter or
whatever which can go in here and then
can be used as a 1/4 inch drive so for
the ratchets there are three distinct
types or sizes so we have the quarter
inch drive size we have the 3/8 drive
size and then we have the half inch
drive size so for each of the three
different drive sizes you can actually
get extensions so for example the 1/4
inch drive size has a three inch
extension this can then be attached to
other sockets to give you a
longer socket I guess so for all of the
extensions you have a 1/4 inch drive
size 3 inch long and then when you move
up to the 3/8 you have a 3 inch long
extension and a six inch long extension
now when you move up to the 1/2 inch
drive size you have a three inch
extension those are all of the
extensions that are given with this set
all right I'm going to turn this around
here because it makes more sense
the letters face this way alright so for
the 1/4 inch drive ratchet we have
standard and deep sockets so as for the
sockets we have four through 14
including a 5.5 so four five five point
five six seven eight nine ten eleven
twelve thirteen fourteen millimeter
those are all X and then for the inch we
have 12 and then we have hex here so the
six sided ones we have 5/32 3/16 7/32
one for 9/32 5/16 eleven thirty seconds
3/8 7/16 half and 9/16 and then for the
12 sided ones we have 3/16 7/32 1/4 9/32
5/16 11 30 seconds 3/8 7/16 1/2 and 9/16
over here we have our English deep
sockets so we have 9/16 1/2 7/16 3/8 11
30 seconds 5/16 9/32 1/4 7/32 and 3/16
remove this down we have our metric we
have one I'm sorry
we have four five six seven eight nine
four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12
13 and 14 also for the 1/4 inch we have
these converters here so we have T 15 to
20 25 30 40 45 and 50 so I'm going to
look one of these up close now we are up
to the 3/8 drive so here are all of our
sockets for that so the first thing we
have here is a 5/8 inch spark plug
socket so this has a different material
on the inside to help you get spark
plugs all right so we have the deep
sockets and then the standard sockets so
for the standard sockets I can go
through those and flip this around here
first thing we have is the metric we
have 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
19 20
it's kind of going out of focus here 21
and 22 those were all in hex now we also
have the 12-sided ones which go 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 now for
English here we have X here we have 12
sided and then here we have 8 sided so
first thing we have is fourth inch 5/16
inch 3/8 seven sixteenths 1/2 9/16 5/8
1116 3/4 13 16 7/8 and then we have on
the 12 sided let's start from the bottom
here 1/4 5/16 3/8 7/16 1/2 9/16 5-3 11
16 3 4 13 16 and 7/8 and finally on the
eight-sided ones 1/4 5/16
3/8 7/16 and 1/2 now for the deep
sockets we have an metric over here 12
13 14 15 16 17 18 and for English we
have 3/4 1116 5/8 9/16 1/2 7/16 3/8 all
right now we are up to the 1/2 inch
ratchet all of these sockets for the 1/2
inch ratchet or 12-sided but those will
still work with the X all right so first
we have metric we have 9 10 12 13 14 15
16 17 18 and 19 and then we have in
English 1/2 inch 9/16 5/8 11 16 3/4 13
16 7/8 15 16 and 1 inch this set also
contains a variety of different
miniature wrenches and 40 different text
keys so those are all of the contents
within our craftsman mechanic set
