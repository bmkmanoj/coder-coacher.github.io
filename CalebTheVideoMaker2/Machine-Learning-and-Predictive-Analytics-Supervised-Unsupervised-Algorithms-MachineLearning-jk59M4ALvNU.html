learning series in this video we are
going to be classifying machine learning
algorithms and there are two primary
groups that you will want to concern
yourself with and those are supervised
and unsupervised algorithms also my
throat is like like convulsing and like
Thor so I'm talking like really quiet so
I apologize if I sound like a raspy
idiot I'm just I really don't want to
stop making videos now as I mentioned in
previous videos the art of machine
learning is classifying things that's
one of the the main did I ever say that
I hope I said that goodness classifying
things so we take a bunch of people and
we want to classify whether they are
going to have diabetes or not we take a
bunch of people we classify whether
they're likely to watch this movie or we
take we take a bunch of images and try
to classify them as cats or dogs or
people those are all things that machine
learning is apt for so when it comes
down to it these are both going to be
used for classifying things but the way
it does it is a little bit different and
there are tons of algorithms you can
just look up machine learning algorithms
get like paragraph description of each
one and it will say if they're
supervised door unsupervised well my
goal here is not to teach you a list of
algorithms but to teach you how to
understand what that means and why it
really matters so you can think of it as
teaching a child when you teach a child
and you supervise this child you are
able to give this child instruction to
learn unsupervised it's more like
throwing a child into a room and hoping
he figures things out on his own it's
like two different approaches to
parenting
okay so supervised this is what we've
been kind of using as our basis for
understanding machine learning and this
is a good place to start because it's
easier to understand and it's easier to
pick up and then unsupervised learning
is you know once you got the supervised
learning it's really easy to pick up the
unsupervised learning thinking back to
our example of whether or not someone
has diabetes we have this
a set and part of that data set is
complete so we have a bunch of
historical data and we can say someone's
a male they're less than 50 years old
and they have a history of diabetes in
their family and this person ended up
having diabetes okay well we can use
this kind of has our learning for our
supervised algorithms so what this means
is that when we get new data this
provision that we've put upon our
algorithm I don't know what is with my
language lately I've just been using
like the weirdest words okay so someone
comes into our office who's a male and
is less than 50 and they have a history
of diabetes in their family the obvious
result is going to be yes this person is
going to have diabetes before they die
and that is based off of the historical
data that our algorithm has learned from
so that puts supervised learning into
perspective unsupervised learning is a
little different so think about it like
this we give the algorithm a bunch of
data and we want to find correlations or
groupings in our data so we feed this
algorithm like millions of photos and
without having a historical data set
where we know this is the end result the
unsupervised algorithm is able to look
at this data and based on what algorithm
you choose the way it does this is
different but it's going to be able to
group this data based on similarities
between this data so you know this might
be chocolate kisses because it kind of
looks like one so this is a picture of
chocolate kisses and this is a picture
of balloons yeah so my definition for
unsupervised learning was pretty
terrible but that's because I haven't
gotten to unsupervised learning nearly
as much as I have with supervised
learning so as we go on in the series
hopefully I can give you guys a better
understanding there is also something
called semi-supervised which is like
this hybrid between the two you could
research that too the book that I've
been using fundamentals of machine
learning for predictive data analytics
has a chapter over a different type
of I believe supervised two algorithms
so it groups it by first we have
information based then we have
similarity based and then probability
based and then error based if you think
a categorization like that would be
beneficial to you check out the book I
will throw links in the descriptions and
yeah that's really that is like the
fundamentals I know I didn't really go
into a whole lot but I am my goal isn't
to make you an expert on everything I
just want you to have a rough
introduction and that we can move on to
the next topic so thank you guys for
watching hopefully that was adequate
please leave me some suggestions and
comments you need yep that's basically
all I got hopefully my voice its kicks
back in a little bit here soon thank you
guys and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
