CSS tutorial it is a new day I decided
to go to sleep so I worked on videos for
11 hours I think I don't know ten and a
half or eleven or something but I mean a
lot of that's editing all that other
stuff so ever it is now eleven thirteen
I decided to go to bed cuz I think Robin
company today and I don't want my room
to be a disaster and all that stuff so
we're gonna be making some cool comments
which I mean I'm not gonna be making
them exactly like this cuz I did some
stuff we don't really know how to do yet
but we're going to be learning at new
properties so in the last video we had a
color setting we had like boarded color
and then we defined each one like red
blue green yellow and oh yeah forgot
color sorry okay and then we over rid it
with this see if I put it at the bottom
and if i refresh my comments are gonna
go away it's gonna back to being ugly
you can see it's pretty ugly now so
whichever one comes latest last is the
one that gets the the one that the
website takes so obviously I'm going to
delete the first one since it's useless
and we're going to learn a new a sorry
we're going to learn a new property with
appropriate values so the property is
order radius so we can make a radius and
let's try to order and then we can
choose a corner of one of our comments
there the options are top left top right
bottom left and bottom right set the top
left radius so that's what it looks like
we're two top radius and we have border
bottom radius
bottom yeah which it doesn't show the
color yet because I have I stopped to
finish the first one top left bottom
left top right and bottom right awesome
so those are our four things that we
need to fill out I keep forgetting the
words that properties I don't know why
it's like the easiest word and then as
soon as I say it it comes back to me so
we just give a value and pixels to be so
I can get pixel twenty pixels and what
this is going to do it's going to curve
the corner of our comments so if you
look closely here now the top-left
corner has this cool curve and it
doesn't really look super great but
that's how you can get nice curved boxes
for comments or whatever you want add it
by adding a radius so I can do that for
the rest of them and now we have oops I
screwed one of the order bought button
bottom all right so now that's sort of
what it looks like and we can offset
these so we can make the bottom left and
the top right be a little bit more and
we get like a more of a odd shape and
you can pretty much do a lot of
different stuff with this and just like
the other properties we've learned we
can combine these all in a border radius
setting and to define this we can define
one so two pixels which will give them
to assign them all to two pixels or
eighty pixels where we can go like
extreme go like two
forty pixels which obviously that didn't
you don't think that worked so yeah
that's that's about as curved as it's
gonna get
just circle oh that's not a circle yeah
it's pretty awesome alright so that is
the border radius setting and that's
pretty much all that to say about the
border radius and in the next video we
will be talking about something new so
what are we I think we're something to
do as a border I'm not sure yet we'll
figure it out so I shall see you then
