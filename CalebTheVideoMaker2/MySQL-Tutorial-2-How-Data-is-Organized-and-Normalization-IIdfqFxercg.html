you made it this far you're almost done
nice kick we got a lot to go but you'll
be learning so much so I I hope you stay
with me and I hope you comment subscribe
leave me some feedback and let me know
what you think because I really
appreciate it so in this video I'll be
going over Norma organization how a
database works and what they call
normalization alright so as I said in
the last video data is stored in tables
and basically when you're drawing or
designing with a pencil or piece of
chalk or programs such as MySQL
workbench that's generated this allow
you to design databases on your computer
so here's a table and its name info and
you have a website or any kind of
application for such a videogame you
make that's access to the it through the
internet and where you can store store
information about specific users such as
their user name their password email
login which I guess would be username
any kind of security questions you know
store in their information
these would each be stored in their own
column which are typically like this so
these would be named what this what they
are so like we have an ID for each user
and then we'd have the name and I can't
write that small and then phone number
username password and you just basically
go on and keep adding more and more that
unique and then each individual entry
such as let's say I sign up for this app
or game and I build an account or sign
up my entry would come across this way
so ID of one Caleb that's my name phone
number you wish numbs kick but probably
do um so this this is all good except
what if you need to store something not
so related such as let's say a person on
this guy this application let's say
you can write comments to each other
sort of like Facebook or any other
social networking website and then you
need to store these comments in your
database should your storm down here
well you actually shouldn't because
that's not really related to the
information of the person this is where
we get the term normalization which
maybe that's not where we get it but um
normalization is reducing redundant
information by creating more tables so
rather than storing user comments with
all the student not students sorry with
all the users information you're gonna
have two tables so this would be a foe
and this will be comments just like that
so now you can have this crap separated
to make things more organized now when
you're normalizing a database there's
three forms to follow first normal form
second normal form and third normal form
there's technically is three more but
we're not going over those because
they're not really needed alright so
first thing make sure everything is a
tonic and if you don't know what that
means it's basically it can be split up
any farther so let's say address now
this can consist of a street address
city state country planet instead of
doing that what you can do is break the
address up into city and state and put
these into a table split them up and
have separate entries this makes things
easier and it's more organized and
another thing with being atomic is you
can't have something that will store
more than one thing such as favorite
animals instead of fav animals
they ratings and you put dog cat Leo
bird on this is also violation because
you're storing three things in one spot
that's not atomic so what you need to do
is create new tables and that's what
gets us to the second normal form which
is basically creating the new tables for
all this information all right so let's
go to the same example favorite animals
you can have a table for the information
about the person and then you can have a
table for their favorite animals alright
so then it will list the person here and
one of their favorite animals here then
it lists the person and one of their
favorite animals and then this is
actually tied to this which with what
they call a primary key which we'll get
into in one of the upcoming videos so
that's basically what you need to do
don't store it all in one slot spread it
out into a new table and we'll be
getting into this with our examples that
we'll be going over and you'll be
following me in MySQL or PHP my admin
and you'll learn what's going on if you
don't understand anything
all right the next thing you need to do
is look at how things rely on each other
now that doesn't really make any sense
so I'll just give you an example info I
know I've used that example a lot that's
because it's really good all right so if
you have a name city phone number and
then you have the city's governor
you see this is a violation because yes
technically if you change if you change
the person their city will change which
will then change the city governor
unless they live in the same city as
somebody else but you see this is
actually reliant on the city because if
you change the city then the city
governor would also change so that's the
next thing you do and then uh after that
just overview it make sure nothing is
wrong and then you can look at relations
and that's what I'll be showing you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
