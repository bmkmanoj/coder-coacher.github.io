video maker to this video I swear my dog
dehydrates himself all day just to drink
water when I'm recording videos I swear
he does it this video is going to be
covering end charm now this data type
works very similar to the char data type
so make sure you refresh on that data
type there are some key differences
though this data type is also known as
the national character set data type
whenever you see a data type with
something like national in it this is
referring to Unicode it is highly
recommended you go review the videos I
created / character sets and utf-8 and
utf-16 just a few videos ago that's
because they are foundational to
understanding the benefit of this column
additionally in order to understand why
we would benefit from a data type like
this you need to understand how
character sets are applied to an Oracle
database so let's say this is an Oracle
database and we have available to us
multiple character sets the thing with
Oracle is that these character sets are
applied at the database level that means
the entire database gets this character
set this is in contrast to other
database management systems where you
can often create a character set at the
database level at an individual table
level so if we have an individual table
we could say this is of a certain
character set and even column levels so
we could take this individual column and
say this is of a certain character set
Oracle doesn't work the same way
Oracle only has character sets available
at the database level now there is
something available to us that's similar
to having a character set at the column
level but slightly different and that is
where the end data types come in the end
data types allow us to store a Unicode
in a column even if the database
character set is not Unicode so let's
say this is not Unicode we are allowed
to have a table within our non Unicode
database that stores Unicode inside of a
column but it's slightly different than
actually defining a character set for
this column because we're limited to
just Unicode
in what situation would something like
this be practical well let's say we are
working with a database that we know is
going to work with applications that use
ASCII ask you as a character set I uses
one byte per character it might be
easier for us if everything uses ascii
including the database so we might set
the database character set to ascii but
what happens if it comes up where we
actually want to store unicode in our
database if we don't have this datatype
available to us we're not able to do
that in Oracle without changing the
database character set to something like
Unicode Unicode has many more characters
available to us and allows for different
languages
whereas ASCII limits us to just English
so if 99% of our database is ASCII we
might have 1% that we want to be unicode
so in order to get this 1% we can label
the column as in charge now let's talk
about the practicality of this data type
is this a data type you should be using
that's a different subject my goal is to
introduce you to the different data
types that doesn't necessarily mean
they're always useful now I'm not saying
you should never use n char there might
be a good time to use that but in
general it's almost always recommended
to have a Unicode database and in this
situation the N char data type becomes a
lot less useful especially since in
Unicode one character can also take up
one byte that's because as we mentioned
before unicode is a superset of ascii so
this here is unicode ASCII is right here
that means if we use ASCII characters
inside of a unicode character set they
are only going to take up one byte so
there is not an obvious benefit of
making your character set ascii because
of that we are not going to get into the
specifics of ascii character sets that's
because they're not very important to us
the unicode character sets are important
to us so because of that in the next
video i'm going to be talking about some
specific unicode character sets that you
need to know about it's not simply
called Unicode or ASCII they have fancy
names that you need to know of course
nothing can be simple right in addition
to the end part of this not being super
useful because of our database character
set being unit
a lot of people wonder whether you
should use char datatypes at all yeah
you probably wish you knew that before I
taught you all about them but there is
some controversy whether you should ever
use char datatypes and that's something
we will talk about in an upcoming video
but essentially there is not really a
huge benefit in using char datatypes in
Oracle that's all I got for this video
guys thank you for watching if you've
enjoyed it please click like and
subscribe to Caleb the video make it two
and that will really help me out thanks
guys and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
