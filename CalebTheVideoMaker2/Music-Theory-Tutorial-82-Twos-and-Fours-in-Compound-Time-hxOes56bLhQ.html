video I talked about a compound time so
if you remember and when we were in
four-four time or common time we had
tablets now we can still have tup let's
in nike free game was called compound
time so how does it work exactly
considering the triplet is the most
common feeling way to play incumbent on
so we don't have to signify a triplet
for example if we have three notes we
don't have to put a little three above
it because that's the norm so what kind
of tablets do we have well we can
actually have a two we have a four and
so on so why well for example if we see
three notes its guests to play the tough
for the next beat so makes sense but we
can still have a thoughts played
normally so if instead we had two notes
with a 2 and B so that isn't exact what
does that always happen ah so we can
still have top 'let's it's just opposite
instead we'll have twos and fours so if
we were to play and make up a little
song oh hey this week it's so annoying
how do you fix it
here's our song right now we have a
tablet right here so it's done just step
to touch done we're now subdividing the
be in two instead of three the original
is three one two three hopefully that
makes sense now if we had four it's just
like sixteenth notes actually let's keep
that there this one's a little more
awkward triple it's kind of awkward
isn't it triple and trick bullet Ellen
and running and I would ripple the
triple live one and money and a warning
and one so for account with the beat go
beats one two three and four it would be
starting in one triplet two triplet 3
and 4 and a 1 triplet 2 triplet 3 and 4
into 1 triplet 2 triplet 3 and 4 and a 1
triplet 2 triplet 3 and 4 E and O one
makes sense hopefully so that's example
of couplets and compound time so if you
can get you should practice swapping
from feel to feel as you can tell I'm
not very good at it working on it I mean
I'm alright with a little bit of
practice but just pull and beat out of
knowing it's pretty difficult so you
should be able to try to get to the
point where you can just sight read all
these rhythms let's make up a little
more of a complex one we have a 4 here
for a triplet or the normal and
in to the quarter note so this is pretty
complex basically this is going I can
show you where the downbeats will be
I'll circle them down beats are one two
three and four here all underline them
basically the start of each one get the
edited it 12 trick ball into digital one
too thick for trip ball with that I
should find an easier way account this
guy than did it a good today that's
really awkward what I ended to Mina so
that's an example of a really pretty
cool um time signature beat I mean a
compound time signature beat which that
was in while considering I didn't have
any measures in that there would be that
would have been one measure which would
have made that 24 8 time I think I have
no clue but anyways that's compound time
so in the next video I'll be showing you
some other cool sweet stuff I'd ever
tell you what I'm gonna do do I haha I
said doodoo oh okay well anyways I'll
see you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
