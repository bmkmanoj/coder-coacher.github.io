database tutorial I don't know how to
start this video hey guys welcome to
your database tutorial and in this video
I'll actually be speaking of encryption
so I'm going to switch up cuz I'm tired
of talking about stupid functions well
they're not stupid but you know they
they're kind of annoying but I'll try
and pull it in my hate for functions
until later when we're learning them
it's more so encryption this is really
cool I actually really like encryption
it's it's cool stuff so basically it's a
way to transmit a message or anything
secretively so to prevent somebody from
capturing it and decoding it or anything
and figuring out what it is and using it
for themselves for example passwords
will be encrypted so all social security
numbers maybe credit card numbers
definitely will be encrypted so yeah
basically it's like writing a secret
code so I'm gonna just kind of have some
fun here because I've never really had
anybody could write secret codes to cuz
I didn't have friends alright let's go
so if we we have like a we can have like
sort of like a key to figure it out so
this key is going to be numbers that
represent letters so here's letter ABCD
ABCD F G H I J
o p q r s t u v w that's close enough
then we can represent these by numbers 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so now we can say a
secret message I could send you a secret
message saying one sec let me find a
good one what duv s T V W X Y Z so 13 14
15
bubble bubble Bob's 5 6 so I could say 8
5 26 and then you know the secret code
so all you do is have to convert it back
into words 8 its
H 5 is e 20 25 sorry hey see now when
we're talking smack about people and
someone finds our secret message they're
not gonna know what we're talking about
this can also be used for sending when
we have a top-secret plan to like I
don't know steal some kids lunch money
we can pass these notes back and forth
in school nobody's gonna know we're like
what do you mean you're going to one
seven three eight 12 right into is 6 3
12 9 you see what I'm saying it's gonna
be pretty cool so I could be like 4
15700 15 16 17 18 19 19 and then
something like he likes 415 719 but
you're gonna know that says I like dogs
because dogs are pretty cool so yeah
that's sort of what encryption is
basically just a way so you can
communicate without other people
figuring it out
that was weird I was like distracted and
then the phone rang did you guys see I
was like it was like ring Wireless
collar but anyways there's two types of
encryption we have one-way encryption
and then we have two-way encryption so
one way we have a secret formula box and
we put a message so here's the message
yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna represent the
message by a thought all right so here's
somebody's thought that's but here's a
guy and this is his thought I know that
doesn't really whatever so this is this
guy's thought right and he converts this
thought through this converter box and
then it's bundled off message right now
somebody else comes along he's like I
wonder if I thought the same thing so
they put their thought which looks like
this
through this conversion box and it comes
out like this these don't match you see
but if someone comes along with the
exact same shape almost close enough
pretend these are the same same thought
and he puts it to his box it's going to
get the same look which I don't know if
I can do this
close enough
so now this is one way conversion 1 both
way well you can actually kind of figure
it out so we can take this these four
this these are lost forever you won't be
able to figure them out but if we take
in to a conversion we can actually put
this back through the converter and see
the original thought that's the
difference between one-way conversion
and two-way conversion for one-way
encryption in two-way encryption so if
you need something you can see again in
the future you must use two-way
conversion / incursion whatever so yeah
that's that's my introduction to
encryption I know it's kind of waste the
time but it was kind of fun so yeah
Thanks for writing secret messages with
me see you later
subscribe click like thanks I almost
have 300 I'm so close</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
