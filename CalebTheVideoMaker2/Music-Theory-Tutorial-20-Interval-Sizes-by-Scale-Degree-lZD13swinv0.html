I am going to be talking about something
called interval size when I write this
out for you guys or girls you don't
really know what this is yet but
interval size is extremely important and
interval size is the measurement between
two notes you have a staff 5 line thing
we have a note here and note here the
space in between these it's called the
interval size okay
now this will help us create scales
chords all kinds of cool stuff so we are
going to be using the scale of degrees
that we learned in the last video to
figure out interval sizes and then we
will also be doing the same thing with
sheet music you know and sheet music is
just like staff so I'll be explaining
that in upcoming videos for those of you
who are interested in that so now let's
say I have I want to figure out the
interval between C and G sharp so we
have C and I want to know what the
interval size is between these and
remember it's important to know this
because it allows us to figure out how
different pitches pitches interact with
each other
so the size is very important now let's
figure this out we have remember how I
said we just ignore the sharps and flats
and put them in their natural state so
we can just get rid of this for now for
now anyways and we can create the scales
C may be c d e f and g now even if this
had a sharp on it I said we can take it
down to the natural state to figure out
the scale degree this one was the first
or the not the first when uh Oh get in
that in a second
second two three four and five so since
we're starting on C that's considered
the first or unison I'll go just give me
a minute an up to G would be C so this
is the first second third fourth fifth
so the size between these is called a
fifth because we're starting at 1 and
going up to the fifth because we started
at D and went to GE it'd be a fourth
because this would become 1 this will
become 2 this will become 3 this would
become 4 so I hope that makes sense
basically we're taking the scale degree
so we're basically just taking whatever
note we'd you start along just give me a
random letter give me a letter shot it
up Oh F sharp you say sure let's use F
sharp F sharp and we're going to end on
mm flat right let's create let's create
an imaginary scale of all the natural
notes F what's after F we're going into
sending word which is up F G a B C D
remember we're going to ignore these
signor on for now trap so let's count 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 so the distance between an F
and an E is called 1/7 because we're
covering 7 of the scale degrees so this
is 1/7 1 2 3 4 5
6:7 always remembered we start we count
we count the first one that's something
many people forget we have it's not f2g
okay it's not like this 1 2 3 it's not
like that
wrong it's 1 2 3 4 all right let's try
something a little more difficult I'm
going to pick let's go with Yi sharp and
we're going to go all the way up to a
double flat now I'm going to do this
wrong and then you are gonna shout out
what I need to fix and I'll hear you and
I'll fix it you know like old cartoons
and stuff so I'm gonna do it wrong so
don't follow this this is wrong I'm just
in case you hear me it's wrong here's E
G sharp is F because there's no black
key and we're going to a double short
double flat remember a flat double flap
so from F to G one two so we just
covered a second from F because remember
we ignore these which makes this an F
and we ignore these which makes this a G
right right right so we covered a second
I'm so smart wrong you first how much
each edges properly you sharp all the
way up to a double flat well first thing
you do is ignore the accidentals cross
this out cross this out just get rid of
them pretend they're not even there to
find the interval sighs now II up to a
well we have e f g this is the first
second third fourth we cover a
in green 1/4 not a second not not did
you hear me I said not ignore these
you're gonna screw yourself up if you
don't pay attention you ignore the
accidentals and look at the natural
notes we're going from E to a that means
e f g a for when we have an interval we
go from one note to the nether but to
another so let's say ETA as an interval
this is specifically 1/4 and if we're
going from E to so let's say efore which
would be right here
efore up 2 all the way up until efore
that's the same note it's actually
called a unison that's another term you
need to learn unison it's not at first a
lot of people will call it a first it's
not called a first I don't care if you
call it first I don't care if I call it
at first but many people out there will
call it a first but it's action I mean
it's supposed to be a unison so if we're
going from one note to the same note
it's a unison interval size I remember
interval size is how many scale degrees
we can cover sweet so what if we go from
e 4 all the way up to e 5
well let's take a look with e f g a b c
d e that's 8 so would we call an eighth
diane on e offended e e f g a b c d e
yes that's it many people call that an
eighth that's wrong
don't call an eight because it's
actually called
am Optive can't see that these markers
are horrible and octave personally I
don't really care if you call an eighth
if you want to call an eighth go for it
I'm just saying the rules octave and
using so basically if we have um from
the same note to the same note unison if
we have one note to the same note an
octave higher which is just like a four
a five it's called an octave not Nathe
it's simple so that's all we have for
interval size right now the next video I
will be still talking about interval
size although it will be much more
common way of doing it and it'll
probably make more sense so I'll see you
