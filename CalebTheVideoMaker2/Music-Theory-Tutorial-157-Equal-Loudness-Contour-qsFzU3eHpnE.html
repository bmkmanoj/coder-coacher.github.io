to talk about interpreting sounds by
their sound pressure level or how loud
they are now when we have a sound let's
say we're recording it and from all of
the frequencies from twenty to twenty
thousand we could say they're equally
loud
well that is said to be flat just ignore
this picture for a minute yeah not flat
like this this is a different kind of
flat this is saying every single
frequency is equally loud so let's say
this is twenty Hertz and this is twenty
thousand Hertz
there's no spikes and loudness this is
volume so that is said to be flat but
when we hear sound it's not necessarily
flat there's a little bit of differences
especially for one our ears the way
they're shaped changes things from
person to person and for everybody in
general but louder pitch sounds I mean
higher pitch sounds higher pitch sounds
and lower pitch sounds tend to be a
little quieter so when we're listening
to songs you may want to boost up the
treble and the bass to make it equally
flat so that's something you may want to
know treble is the higher portion higher
pitched or tweeter you may have heard of
that and then bass is the lower pitched
which comes from a subwoofer so yeah
that's what I was gonna say now in order
to make it flat to our ears to where all
pitches are the same volume to us now
they're actually the bass and treble is
a little bit louder but we interpret
them quieter so I know that's kind of
weird but that's how it is we interpret
the treble and the bass a little quieter
so a long time ago these two guys name
last name Fletcher and the other guy
Munson I believe is their names did a
test to figure out how loud you would
have to make
in order for them to all sound flat or
the same volume throughout the frequency
spectrum from twenty to twenty thousand
and we got these curves here which are
called the Fletcher and Munson curves
and I will explain them in just a second
first I want to show you I'm really
stupid so when I first did it I got this
blurry picture so here are the curves
you see basically it's saying fun right
here all these here's the lowest
frequency twenty fifty Hertz hundred
Hertz 200 Hertz 500 Hertz a thousand
Hertz mm Hertz
fifty thousand five thousand Hertz ten
thousand Hertz and twenty thousand Hertz
this is the frequency range of what we
can hear this is volume anything past
120 is entering the threshold of pain so
if you can't read this on the side it
says sound pressure level decibels then
a bunch of other crap you don't really
need to know about and down here this is
frequency in Hertz so in order for the
lower pitched sounds like 2250 to sound
flat we have to boost them this amount
alright let's follow a line here here we
have a sound at 10 decibels now and at
right here we can add a thousand Hertz
it is about 10 decibels which is what it
says which is cool now if we wanted to
make the lower pitch sounds at 10
decibels we would have to crank them up
all the way up to 70 decibels so that's
if we wanted them to be equally as loud
so this right here and this right here
are the same volume
this one's higher pitched this one's
lower pitched hopefully that makes sense
so if we are at 90 you see as the higher
we go we don't have to increase quite as
much if we're at a hundred decibels we
are at a thousand it's about about 90
decibels but for the bass if we wanted
to crank the bass out to be 90 decibels
it'd be out like 110 or
one-twenty same for the other treble
side which is a little more funky and
see we got these spikes here if we
wanted it to be equally as loud over
here we would have to crank it up to
about 110 I think I can't really see but
yeah that's the basis of these curves
and what I wanted to show you earlier
it's not first printed it off it looked
like that and I was gonna use it to
that's how stupid but yeah those are the
currents these are called The Fletcher
Munson curves and they were invented
around 1937 and it looks like this now
in 1956 they did another test on this
and they said oh this one's not quite as
accurate as everybody thinks it is so
they came up with a new one this is the
same concept as you can see we need to
crank up the base in order for to be
equally as loud trouble not so much but
we still a little bit we are looking at
the blue lines right now and all
explained what the red lines are in a
second so yeah that's what we would do
in order for everything to be equally as
loud but sometimes we don't want
everything be equally as loud because
then the bass or treble may sound a
little too high so I mean this is to say
if you want them equally as loud just
said so this thing the blue lines are
said to be ISO 226 that's what they're
called that stands for International
Organization of standardized date for
standardization sweet right I know so
they redid this again in 2003 so you get
ISO 226 : 2003 and that's the red lines
so as we go on in time it's getting a
little bit more accurate to say well we
don't actually have to boost it this
much we have to boost this much which is
our really similar so yeah that's all
about that so you may hear these curves
even these ones dang with them curves oh
yeah you may hear these curves referred
to as the Fletcher
and curves even though this is ISO mm I
mean 226 2003 version so it's more
appropriately cold
what's a cold equal loudness contour I
believe so this may play a part when
you're designing a certain song or
studio or anything like that so that's
all I have to say in this video
oh by the way check this out I tried
printing this one out and this is what I
got beautiful I know so I'm kind of
stupid but I figure it out after second
and I cancel it
