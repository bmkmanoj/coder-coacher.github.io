literally the first time I've ever
started a video on this side but I don't
really know why I'm telling you that
anywho this video is going to be over
domain integrity so the very first thing
we need to discuss is what is this fancy
domain word you know like is that like a
web address or what is that well
essentially domain is the rules for data
what is allowed and what's not allowed
so there are numerous ways we can
enforce what data is allowed in a
specific column some of these are very
general ways that are allowed in most
database systems for example data types
are a very great way to have domain
integrity so let me take a step back if
we have domain integrity what we are
saying is that our data is within the
allowed values if we do not have domain
integrity then we cannot trust our data
to be in a set of different values or
within a certain range of values so the
data types these are a very general way
to restrict data so for example you can
have a numeric data type and that's
going to reject string data you can have
a date data type and that's going to
force every single value to be of a date
format you can get very specific on what
kind of data you're looking for by using
the appropriate data type so as you get
into some more database design and some
more advanced database concepts make
sure you understand the data types by
having the correct data types you can
make sure your data has integrity the
other way are some general rules you
could use not null this is an example of
a constraint that would basically force
every single road to have a value for
that column you could use unique that's
going to force every single value for
that column to be unique meaning once a
value is used another row cannot use
that value now additionally you can use
what's known as a check constraint so
check constraints are pretty awesome and
they're not available in all database
systems so I'm pretty psyched that db2
has them but check constraints allow us
to be extremely extremely specific on
what data is allowed inside of our
column so if you want to be specific on
we can only use values in this range or
only these specific options well then
you might want to look into a check
constraint now if you are not using
check constraints there is kind of like
an old-fashioned way of doing something
similar to a check constraint and that's
generally called a lookup table also
known as a validation a classic example
of this is having these states in a
table and then referencing them so if
over here you have a state tables and
then in this table every single row is a
state that someone could live in well
then you could only allow those values
using a foreign key so this is kind of
goes back to the one-to-many
relationships if you decide to set it up
this way you can force a column to have
a value in that state table so over here
you can have a state column and you
could say this references the state
table and then the state ID column and
now every single value in this column is
going to have to be a row in this state
table so that's an example of a
validation table nothing too crazy in
this video I know is really super short
but those are your general guidelines on
how you get domain integrity I didn't go
into a ton of detail on how to do all of
it but the point is here is to teach you
the basics so then you know where to
look if you are trying to do something
specific if you want something more to
research definitely highly recommend the
check constraints because that's going
to allow you to be very picky with what
kind of data gets in your database so
thank you guys for watching please be
sure to subscribe check the description
for some links I'll give you a link from
my website and also to download DB to be
sure to subscribe for upcoming content
like this video and I'll see you in the
next one and yeah guys that's all we got
for database design at least for now
it's been a journey but we made it we
made it together we made it so thank you
and I'll see you in the next video which
actually I lied the next video is going
to be applying some stuff we've been
talking about in the last previous
videos so after that we're good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
