errand I don't ever know
hello everybody welcome back to your
fourth oracle SQL tutorial right this
video and the next videos I like to call
the five video database design primer
right so I'm going to take basically my
50 part database design series get rid
of all the useless junk in it and then
I'm going to condense it down into like
a 5 video power database design series
within this series so this video in the
next four videos are all going to be
database design relating to Oracle
database so get your pull ups because
you guys are big kids now we're gonna
get started right now this video is
going to be vocabulary so we're going to
start off with SQL structured query
language this is the language that we
use to communicate with the Oracle
database right so to illustrate this we
have us these stupid little people here
that don't know anything about how
computers work well at least I'd know
and then we have the database over here
right and we communicate with this
database using SQL that SQL is able to
be understood by humans it's it makes
sense and the computer or the database
can take that SQL and then convert it
into machine code by machine code it's
just lower level code that actually
tells the computer to do things like
retrieve files we don't have to do any
of this because SQL is able to do that
for us because the database understands
SQL and we understand this you oh so we
talk and SQL to talk to the database to
talk machine code to do the complicated
stuff
another thing about SQL is it's actually
a standard language so if you go from
Oracle database over to MySQL you
probably noticed that this also
has SQL that's because SQL is used for
every single kind of relational database
management system you're probably
wondering what's a relational database
management system I'm going to tell you
so a relational database management
system is basically a really fancy word
to mean the database we talk
specifically using SQL to the relational
database management system so Oracle
Oracle database is an example of a
relational database management system if
you're thinking what I'm thinking you're
probably wondering what in the world
relational means right and if you've
ever done research on this you'll get a
lot of answers that say it's because
relational database management systems
have relationships well I'm gonna tell
you that's a load of garbage that's not
why it's called relation the real reason
is because it has what's known as
relations relations is this fancy
mathematical term that they use to
basically describe tables
all right so tables you know we talked
about tables they have a table name
columns and rows well you gotta know is
relations equals tables all right now if
you're anything like me you're probably
wondering what happens when you have a
table and someone doesn't put
information in it I know that's what
you're thinking well if that's the case
you get what's something that's called
you get something that's called a null
all right
no I don't care how you pronounce it I
know is basically the absence of a value
so if you have a table and you have a
column name and this person goes in your
database thing and tries to put
information in and they forget to put
their name in and submit it well for
that row for that person there's not
going to be a value there so to
represent the lack of a value the
database uses the term
oh that means it's missing a value
you'll often hear the term null value
but that really doesn't make sense
because null by definition means the
absence of value so it have a null value
is contradictory it's like an invisible
seeing now you're probably wondering how
in the world can I prevent null values
from entering my database well there's
tons of different ways for one they're
not always a bad thing but we'll talk
about that later but a really good way
it's their database design database
design is a process we do before we
create the database and also while we
have the database to improve it if
necessary its purpose is to protect the
integrity of our database and what
exactly do I mean by that well let me
give you a really good example if we
have two tables here let's say this is a
user table or users whether you use
plural or singular we'll talk about that
later but let's say we have a user's
table and then we have a over here we
have a orders table if we have an order
from users there's some kind of
connection here because the user places
an order and the order is placed by a
user
so there's what's known as a
relationship so this is a relationship
the integrity the integrity right here
is having this connection we need to
protect that if we get rid of this for
example we have this guy over here and
he buys a hammer hey I don't know what
that is
but if he buys a hammer and then this
user gets deleted and then it says this
hammer was bought by this user and he
doesn't exist that's a problem that's a
fault
and though the integrity of the database
so we got to prevent that so we design
our database in a way that protects the
integrity and we'll get more into that
as we go on so we already talked about
relationship this is a connection
between two tables now there's something
else that is important to know about
tables you're probably wondering well
how do you keep every single row in a
table unique well that's something known
as a primary key you think about it we
have a table we have all kinds of
different entities in here let's say
there are trees we're keeping a
documentation of all the trees that grow
in our national park or something stupid
I don't know and we have just multiple
trees well how do we keep them unique
because we could have an oak tree okay I
have another oak tree this one could be
six-foot and this one could be six-foot
so now it looks like we have we have a
problem here is this tree six foot and
this tree six foot or is this a mistake
in her database and we actually have
duplicate data one tree in there twice
that's an error that's not good so we
need something known as a primary key to
protect us from that and generally it's
just a random database generated number
so we'll have something such as a tree
ID and that's this going to be like 1 2
3 7 12 48 and basically every tree is
going to have their own ID so that
prevents duplicate data continuing on
that example we could have that tree
right and let's say we're running a tree
store and we're selling these trees
right so we also have a table for sales
and we sell that tree to somebody that
means we have a customer the customer
initiates the sale to buy the tree well
these are all connected and the way
they're connected is by the primary key
being referenced in the other table so
these are all going to be tables this
will be a tree table a sales table and a
customer table and they're all going to
be connected with relationships how the
well we're going to have a tree ID we
have a customer ID and we have a sales
ID to issue the sale we're basically
going to say this sale with the sale ID
also has a customer ID because deseo had
to be ordered by someone
now also the sale is going to have a
tree ID because the sale has to sell a
tree so basically this tree ID and this
customer ID is going to be replicated
and the sales val in the sales table and
this is known as a foreign key just to
kind of illustrate that a little more we
can give a specific example of a sale we
could say the sale ID is 7 the customer
ID is 743 the tree ID is 12 now we can
basically take this and we can build the
entire sale from this information we're
saying that the customer that has the ID
of 743 let's say refers to this guy is
buying a tree with the ID of 12 so that
whisper refers to this specific willow
tree or whatever with the ID of 12 so
that connects to that the sale is
talking about the sale itself so this
whole thing is labeled sale ID number 7
so we're going to have three tables in
this situation gonna have the trees so
we're gonna have the trees those
customers and the sales
this is going to have a primary key this
is going to have a primary key and this
is going to have a primary key that's
because they all have primary keys every
single table needs a primary key the
sales is going to have two foreign keys
it's going to a foreign key to the trees
we're referring to their primary key I'm
just gonna have a foreign key to the
customers primary key so now we have
foreign key on the list now if you've
made it this far through all of this
information I congratulate you because
it's a lot really quickly so don't get
overwhelmed if you are falling behind I
have a 50 part video series if you want
to go check that out over all this
information but much slower but if
you're anything like me you're probably
wondering when you have these primary
foreign key relationships how do you
protect them from being broken well I'm
going to teach you that that's known as
a constraint so in the tree example a
constraint would be the sale can't have
a tree that doesn't exist another really
good example of a constraint would be
preventing somebody from deleting a tree
or a customer if it's being referenced
by a sale so you have a sale and it says
oh this tree was bought by this customer
well if someone goes in and deletes that
customer well then we have an issue
because it's saying that this tree was
bought by a customer who doesn't exist
in the database right that is an issue
with database integrity which is part of
database design so when we design a
database we get constraints to protect
the primary and foreign key
relationships that's getting pretty
intense now if you're wondering how in
the world does the database keep up with
all this information and processes so
quickly
when you get all these sales of trees
and stuff well I can answer that
question you're wondering about indexes
indexes are basically when you take
take a certain column in a database the
column would be a single attribute of
multiple entities so like the name you
can take everybody's name and you can
make an index port what that index does
is allows the database to find that
information faster we can talk more
specifics of indexes in the future but
for now that's all you really need to
know except that primary Keys are going
to get indexed automatically so I'm just
guessing that you're probably wondering
how in the world does a database keep
all of the different types of data
organized such as well we have phone
numbers over here we have names over
here how does it know what type of data
it is well that my friend is known as a
data type a data type is basically the
kind of data you are assigning for a
column I have this table and we have a
column named name well you should expect
that every single value within this
column for every single person is
letters so we can assign a data type to
this name of string for example that's
that's just a kind of data type that
covers all of the basic vocabulary that
I covered over the course of like a
billion videos in my other courses so if
you need slower version check those out
otherwise write all these down get the
definitions figured out study them a
little bit and then move on to the next
video
