you like this video be sure subscribe
this video we'll be talking about SQL so
SQL all right so what is SQL SQL is a
programming language used to communicate
to a database basically uh we speak
English databases do not so SQL is kind
of like the mediator between computer
database and human English think of it
like that
it's almost English it's very simple and
in this series we're not actually going
to be programming any databases although
we will be talking about general SQL
concepts so it's important that you know
about SQL so SQL is not like a specific
relational database management system
programming language it is a general
language use for every single relational
database management system from vendor
to vendor such as MySQL to SQL Server or
something else it might vary a little
bit but the general concepts of SQL stay
the same so this is this is going to be
a general concept that you should know
about so SQL first is used to define the
database structure and then it
manipulates the data within so basically
we can kind of think of SQL as two
categories here one it defines the
structure and then two it manipulates by
that it means we insert data and then we
can search it or delete it or update it
these are the two sub categories of SQL
we actually for some reason name these
their own languages so this is data
definition language or DDL
and this is data manipulation language
or
mmm some people may say there's more
categories but I mean this is pretty
much the debate - so think of it like
this what's gonna erase is here now that
we have this we have GDL DML we have
like a table for example I'm just going
to write this down here and we have the
columns so we have like ID username
password
well that's data definition language
data manipulation language is what we
would use to insert a new value such as
the ID of 72 of the username of Caleb
curry password of Pi 1 2 3 that's data
manipulation language so when you think
of a table and if obviously if you have
a big database you have multiple tables
well all of this structure and the
connection between tables
that's all data definition language so
it gets all of the main structure of the
database and then the the data within
the database is data manipulation
language so those are the two main
categories um just I just want to talk
about some of the features of both of
these languages so basically when we
define tables we have a create statement
so basically on all SQL I write in all
capital letters that's just a pad i
pattern that I've chosen so create is an
example of an SQL command used to create
tables and we can create a database this
way that is data definition language
because we're defining the structure of
our database a commands such as updating
or yeah I guess if update if we're
updating the actual values within
columns well this is manipulation
language because we're not changing the
structure the column stays the same just
a specific attribute of an entity
changes we're updating
Curry's username - Caleb curry one two
three well that's a data manipulation
language
another thing that SQL can do is what's
known as a join and joins are very
important very important with a
relational database management system
because with the relational database
management system we break things up
into separate tables for simplicity sake
for one sorry was I haven't seen there I
think I was in whatever rather than
having a spreadsheet with like tons of
information we break it off by entity so
here's a table about the user here's the
table about the orders here's a table
about the customers then we can join
those values to get a new larger table a
new view that looks like a huge
unorganized table
I mean basically it looks up it doesn't
look like we broke it up into multiple
tables so if we have a table here and
then we have a table here and let's just
say we have this is a sale table and
this is a user table within the sale
table we have a sale ID we have a user
ID the person who bought this stuff and
then we have the objects that they
bought and I mean this is just a silly
example just for you to understand the
concept of a joint then within the users
table we have the the name the user ID
and so forth we can do a join here we
could take the objects that they bought
the person the objects that the person
bought as well as the name of the person
who bought it connected by the user ID
which we'll we'll talk about this more
then we can get a new view which has the
name and the items that that name but
and it's all talking about the same
entity this user so that's just some of
the basics of SQL in the next video I
will be either talking about like
I think we'll talk about naming
conventions yeah I think that's what
we'll do
all right so thank you for watching if

awesome all right thank you guys and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
