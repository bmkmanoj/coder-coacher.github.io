will be just some more vocabulary
hopefully it's not 12 minutes long like
the last one but we'll do our best
alright so these ones are there's not as
many we're broken up into two categories
this one first one is SQL so first we
learned about SQL which obviously is
program language used to cause by the
way I never you mentioned this on
horrible structured query language is
what SQL means well that's what it
stands for it's used to connect to your
database hi sorry I just got distracted
I was waving this paper and like my lens
is like flashing for some reason anyways
uh the next part was data definition
language which is used to define it's
part of SQL so SQL has data definition
language and DML data manipulation
language DDL is used to define the
structure of our database data
manipulation language is used to insert
values in our database as well as update
them delete values and search values and
so forth well the other thing was I'd
ever really mentioned this but I do want
to mention it here SQL keywords so
anytime we have the word keywords in a
programming language it's talking about
something that is reserved that you're
not supposed to use for your
user-defined data so for example select
an SQL this is a word that your database
is going to recognize as okay we want
you to do something we don't need to
select data it's a keyword because it's
already defined so I wouldn't I don't
want to name my tables or my columns any
keywords because it can cause errors or
confusion or just make things
complicated
I always put a SKU out key words in
capital letters alright so that's pretty
much all for the SQL
Comerica and every other country
all right presentation so the very first
thing is we have the front end of an
application
the front end is what the user sees on
the back end is what's going on behind
the scene when we have a website we
don't just have what the website looks
like we have code that gives us that
look when we put in data to forms we
have languages that communicate with
databases to create a follow non
confusing front-end but the back end is
complicated as heck so that's the
difference between front-end and
back-end front-end is what the any user
at a particular time will see the
backend is what's going on behind the
scenes so often when we were working
with databases we will program a
front-end because we don't want everyone
accessing our server
it's insecure and it's just not a good
idea so we often create a front-end
application to access our database most
commonly a website although there's
other forms but whatever so if here is
our database rather than people signing
into the server and using SQL code to
get information we often program front
ends for people to access this data in a
different way so each one of these front
ends would be like a website page for
example so here would be a registration
page here would be your users page here
would be your profile of your home page
here would be if you like you can even
have different tier systems so this
could be a page where the website
administrator can add or delete users
they have that extra privilege this is
also the view system which we will talk
about in a second well the front-end
doesn't allow us to directly type in our
own SQL it only allows us to use what
the the front-end gives us what
is then communicated to the database so
that's what a front end end is the back
end would be the server-side code used
to communicate with the database so when
we when we're talking about clients and
servers we have those two terms we have
client and then we have server so very
first thing is client client is think of
it if we have this wall here over here
we have a computer and then over here we
have the database this is the client
side because we're accessing the
database over here is the server side so
clump a client side and then server side
I don't really have room to write that
but the server serves instances of this
database to the client where they can
access the data in some way depends on
how we the the privileges we give them
so when we talking about different
privileges for different people
we use what's known as a view so
personally finish this client side and
server side and we communicate from the
client side to the server side by
server-side scripting or programming
language yeah Paulo teach oh I'm a hands
tired we can give custom views so a few
is just taking the data from the
database and illustrating it in a
different way than how it's actually
stored for example a user on a website
can visit let's say we're on like a
social network and I visit my friends
page it'll tell me their their name
possibly their user name if that's a
to use their data registration their
phone number if that's public for
example anything like that their
relationships that is although
information that is private may only be
accessible to the user who owns it for
example their password or their email or
their friends lists that might be a
different view depending on what page
you are on what page you're on and the
user that you are so I maybe it will
access my own password and email but
that might be private to other people
that's the view views often use joins
which basically connect data from
multiple tables to create a new table we
have two tables here users table
comments table can you see that can you
see it you better be able to see it well
a comment is always given by a user and
we connect it using the ID it's called a
foreign key connection
well this ID let's say it's the ID of 25
right well instead of having okay this
column it was by the person with the
name with the user with the user ID of
25 we want to say
Caleb curry so we haven't joined taking
the name from the user table and apply
and connecting it with the comment of
the comments table to get this new to
generated table this is just a view it's
not actually stored in the database like
this we're just creating a new
illustration of how the data really is
stored and then we can have the name of
the person followed by the comment or
comments of that person you may be
asking why don't you just use the name
as a reference
well that's because many multiple people
can have the same name for example so we
always need something that's you
unique for this connection whether if
you don't want to use an ID you could
use something like a natural key use
your name for example but I often use
IDs and we'll be talking about that more
in upcoming videos so yeah that is all
of the vocabulary that we have gone over
so far pretty much if you have any
questions about any of those just leave
a comment I recommend that you write all
those down I should told you that at the
beginning but anyways I recommend you
write those down as well as the
definitions study those learn them and
especially study from the previous video
study all the different terms that mean
the same thing because um after a while
you get kind of used to those terms but
if you're just learning and you don't
know that these are talking about the
same things well then you can get
confused very easily so I recommend you
study alright a row is also called
topple and is also called it whatever
bla bla bla that will help you that way
when I say whatever word it is you know
what I'm talking about and you don't
have to like check your charts or
whatever or go watch other videos so
that's something I definitely recommend
that you memorize as well for the SQL
stuff it's not as important like the DML
DDL but I do recommend that you memorize
all of these terms as well so thank you
for watching if you enjoyed that please
be sure to click Subscribe and I will
see you guys in the next video where
were your starting something new so yeah
I'm excited hopefully you are too bye
yeah yeah yeah Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
