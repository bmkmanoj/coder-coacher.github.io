to talk about the whole step and half
step patterns of all of these I want you
to keep these in your brain because I'm
going to erase them and we need more
space where I would keep them up so I
need a bigger whiteboard hopefully i'll
get one someday but anyways first one we
had was Ionian and this step pattern for
that was the same as the major scale
whole whole half whole whole half C to D
D D to e e to F F to G g2a a to b b to c
make sense now the next one Dorian is
basically taking this w and moving it to
the end so what we get is well I
probably shouldn't read that right day
is what we get is a whole half whole
whole whole half full so we just kind of
scooted everything over one see now the
half's here we took this extra w and
scoot it to the end then places Phrygian
would be half whole whole whole half
whole uh Lydian which is whole whole
whole half gross half F mixolydian is
whole whole falling along hopefully half
whole whole half and then mixolydian
since after that eolian is whole half
whole half whole whole then X Lydian
what's after mixolydian Oh Maggie Lin
what's after yewland Walker Ian so we
finally we have half
whole whole half whole whole whole so
here just for I'm just gonna write the
first letter of each of them so we get I
olean Ionian sorry Dorian Phrygian
Lydian mixolydian that's an M sorry
mixolydian Aeolian and walk Korean so
that is the whole step half step
patterns of all these I'm going to try
and clean up a little bit so what what
do we notice about this what we can see
that the half step and the whole steps
are all just scoop and down one each
time so we get this cool little shows in
different colors so you can really see
it we get this cool little diagonal line
of the half steps same thing with the
half steps up here and the app steps
down here so basically everything's just
scooting over each time that's why when
we are in each key such as the key of C
each one is like a different scale
degree because we're just scooping over
1 so rather this one B and C this 1d
because we just scoot it up on e f g a b
back to see so that's how that will work
see once we at once we go up again we
screw this h to the n we get whole whole
half whole whole whole half which brings
us back to the Ionian so this one which
is the seventh scale degree if we're in
the key of C it would be B if we go up
one more time it brings us back to see
so that's how all the modes work that's
why it's appropriate to work on a
different scale degree because we're
just screwing everything over and it
allows the intervals to stay this
name sorry it allows the intervals to
scoot over 1 which pushes us up one
scale degree within the scale but the
modes we learned once again we're Ionian
i'm just going represented with an i um
Dorian Phrygian Lydian mixolydian
Aeolian and walk cream now which scale
degree do these each apply to this one
applies to the tonic this one applies to
the second or it's like that so this one
applies to the third this one applies to
this one applies to this second scale
degree this one applies to the third
this one to the fourth this one to the
oopsies this one to the fifth mix
leading to the fifth yoli into the sixth
luck loughran to the seventh so that is
the process of modes and that is all I
have say for this right now and I'll see
you in the next video where we will be
analyzing this a bit further</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
