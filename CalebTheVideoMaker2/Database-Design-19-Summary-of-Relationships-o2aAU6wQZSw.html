will be a summary of all the
relationship garbage that we learned and
basically this videos is going to be
like all of it in one and it's going to
be awesome and it's going to make a
whole lot more sense after this so the
very first thing that you need to
realize when it comes to relationships
is that there's not always a defined
relationship for every circumstance and
it's sometimes you have it's something
that you have to decide on your own so
in my old database design series which
if you want to check it out just go to
my youtube channel a lot of people were
confused about ok is a student to class
is that a one-to-one or one-to-many or a
many-to-many relationship well that's
something that you're actually going to
have to decide on your own sometimes so
you have to think logically about the
application of the relationship so let's
think of the example of a class and a
professor what kind of relationship is
that I don't know let's try to find out
so we have the class then we have the
professor people would ask me like okay
what kind of relationship is this well
it depends on the application if it's me
it can literally be all three it just
depends on what you need for your
application if it's a one-to-one
relationship that means a class can be
taught by one professor and a professor
can teach one class if it's a
one-to-many relationship that means
either a class can be taught by one
professor and a professor can teach many
classes or the opposite a class can be
taught by many professors but a
professor can teach only one class or
can be a many-to-many relationship a
professor can teach multiple classes
that can be taught by multiple
professors so it depends on the college
because some colleges are going to allow
a class to be taught by multiple
professors other colleges are not going
to allow that so that depends
on the application of the database if
I'm building a database for a college
that does allow multiple professors for
a class that means it's a many-to-many
relationship because many professors
teach many classes many classes are
taught by many professors right so when
it comes to designing one-to-one
one-to-many and many-to-many I'll show
you how to do all three of those for a
class to professor all right so if we
have one-to-one we could have for
example we could have the professor
right we can have a professor table only
know how to spell which book pro as I
don't know if there's two FS I love who
cares professor table right if it's a
one-to-one relationship we can have the
professor ID the name of the professor
and then we could have a class that's
the class that they teach and it's the
only class that they teach that class is
only taught by the hi professor that was
and that's how you store one-to-one
relationship and typically you're not
going to do that with another entity
when it's when it comes to like a name
you typically will do that because the
name is just assigned to that person a
class can generally I mean typically
professors can teach multiple classes
unless you're some kind of adjunct
teacher but class in this case is a
one-to-one relationship if we wanted to
make it a one-to-many relationship well
then we would break off class here get a
new table class we have a class ID and
here we can put more information about
the class we'd have the class name this
is the most common way of storing
information on two tables you very very
rarely store a one-to-one relationship
over multiple tables but it is possible
we talked about that earlier we have
class name and then we could have more
information about the class and then we
have a foreign key class
I D that would make this the parent
because class ID
points to class ID if you wanted this to
be the parent well then we would switch
that we would make professor ID which
would probably the most logical way to
do that but you have to keep that in
mind because it can be a one-to-many
direction a one-to-many this direction
or it can be a one-to-many this
direction and obviously typically the
class is going to be the many side
because a class can be taught by
multiple I mean a professor teach
multiple classes that means the
professor is on the one side that many
is the class which means we need to give
the professor ID on this side so the
proof ID is a foreign key referencing
the proof ID in the professor's table
that is how you draw a one-to-many
relationship this direction one-to-many
parent-child now if we wanted to make
that in many to many relationship we
actually have to break this off even
farther into three tables so now we have
the professor's table and then we have
the class table and then we have the
probably class professors table which is
the in terment intermediary table so we
have this table here the stable here
this table here this these all this will
have an ID
professor ID and this will have an ID
class I then you reference this in this
intermediary table where we have
professor ID of like 6 with the class of
7
professor ID of 6 with the class of 8
which is basically saying this professor
with the idea of 6 is teaching two
classes now when it comes to IDs for
this table this whole thing can be an ID
in itself or if you want you can give it
a new ID to say class professor ID and
that's kind of one related so that's
pretty much we'll get into that later
but that is pretty much the sum of
designing relationships one-to-one is
typically in one table one-to-many is
two tables with the child having a
foreign key pointing to the parent and
then a many-to-many has to two parents
with the intermediary being the child
pointing back to both of the parents
hopefully that is all crystal clear and
awesome because now you literally know
how to design every binary relationship
in database design in by binary I mean a
relationship between two tables so you
can have a binary relationship which we
talked about there's one to one over two
tables there's one of many over two
tables and there's many to many over two
tables logically but then we have to
break those up into the best way to to
store those to store those in a database
well this is basically binary because
we're talking about two entities class
and a professor a student and a class
you can have relationships between
multiple tables but that is something
I'm sorry multiple entities but that is
something we will have to address in a
future video so yeah glad you got to
understand all that so thank you for
watching and I will see you in the next
video where we will be diving into I
believe keys so yeah that's going to be
sweet so I will see you then
