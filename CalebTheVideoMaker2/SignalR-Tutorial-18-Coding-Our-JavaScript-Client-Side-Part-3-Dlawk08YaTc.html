are going to be invoking that
server-side method from the client so if
you take a look at our hub here we have
this announced method we want to invoke
that from the client side so where do we
even begin well let's go back to our
JavaScript and the way we need to do
this is if we need to tell it what hub
we want to talk to because up here we
made a connection but we never specified
hey let's talk to my hub that's
important because you're not limited to
just one hub you can have multiple hubs
so you need to be very specific on which
one you're talking to so we're going to
have it so that when the connection is
established we invoke that server-side
method so within this done here we are
going to put that call to that method so
let's just kind of clean up the syntax
here a little bit so when we get the
connection and it works log it and then
we'll invoke a server-side method so
what we're going to do is dollar sign
dot connection dot and then what you
need to do is put the name of the hub
but the capitalization is very important
we're going to use camel casing that's
where the first word is lowercase and
the next word is uppercase my hub dot
server dot and then we're going to save
the method that we want to call which is
announced all right let's give it a try
save it and go back to our web browser
give it a refresh object doesn't support
property or method an Alex okay
I forgot then there we go save it now go
back to our browser refresh it it worked
okay so why is it not doing anything
well let's let's go do a little quick
review so when we look at our
server-side code the announced method is
making a call to the announce function
on all of the clients so you should
expect in our client-side code to have
an announced
function that's why it's not doing
anything because there's no function to
be called here so let's create this
function what we need to do is we need
to put a dollar sign dot get the
connection dot save the hub name my hub
and then we need to say client because
now we're making a client-side function
dot announce and we're going to set that
equal to a function so what's what's
going on here
well the server-side code is looking for
this announced and we're going to assign
this announce to this function so when
the server calls it it gets fed this
function here so within here all we're
going to do is make an alert all right
let's give it a try and see if it works
let's open our browser give it a refresh
and nothing happened huh
so why isn't it working well let's look
back at our server-side code real quick
you can see we're calling the announce
function and we're passing in a message
if you go back to our client-side code
we're not accepting any data here so it
doesn't see it as the correct function
so what we need to do is we need to
accept that message right here and then
what we can do is alert that message one
more thing though go back to the
server-side code that announced method
that's server-side expects a message so
we need to give it that message to be
reinstall our client-side code and we
call the server method we also need to
pass in some data so let's pass in a
string that says connected and also we
don't need to make this a string because
that would just make it say message save
that now let's give it another try
hopefully it works
connected ha so we have effectively
created our hub we've created
client-side code to connect to
and we made that message be announced
one more cool thing I want to show you
though guys let's open this edge browser
and let's open another one
let's go to localhost copy it and we're
gonna make two two windows essentially
we're going to go to it on here and look
at that it says connected on both of
them so that's the magic we just made
our first real-time application
hopefully you guys see the power in it
that is incredible alright one more
thing that I want to do and I will do
that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
