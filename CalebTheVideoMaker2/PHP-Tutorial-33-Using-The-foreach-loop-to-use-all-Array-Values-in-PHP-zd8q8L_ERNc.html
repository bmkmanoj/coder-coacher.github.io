33rd PHP tutorial this video I wanted to
talk about using the for each loop to go
through every single value within an
array alright so we talked about the for
each loop and video 30 I believe so if
you do not know about that you can go
look at it there and in this video I'm
just going to be reviewing it this will
be pretty quick just so you can see it
done
on-screen all right so the first thing
you must do to use the for each on an
array is you must have an array so to
create an array we can go epic
that's our reigning yeah I know so
creative and then we can use the array
function within here we can create three
string values and I'm just going to put
some names in here alright so now we
have three values alright so this one
has the key 0 this one has the key 1
this one has the key to there's a total
of three values alright so now we can
call before each loop and with any
control structure I always set it up
like this before I type anything just so
I don't end up forgetting one of these
then I go back and add what I wish so
within the parentheses the first thing
we do is we tell it what array we are
going to be using we're going to be
using the epoch array then I put the
word as and then we can use any variable
we want I'm going to use value none down
here we can do something with that value
so like look this boom here we have
Aaron ty josh value okay let me explain
for each will automatically no matter
how you set it up take the value and
assign it to your second variable within
these parentheses the well in this case
it could be third so as is going to tell
it to do that alright so now that means
this variable does not matter what it's
called we can name it pi and then we can
echo out pi if you don't understand
what's going on
go check out my video over for each
loops okay so now what this is going to
do is it is going to use take the right
epoch and then it's going to use the D
holder to take each value so this is the
value the first time it's going to be
Erin and it's going to echo out n and
then it's going to go through the loop
and go to the next value tie then it's
going to echo out ty and it's going to
the next value josh echo out Josh so we
can pretty much name this whatever we
want I'm going to name it be for a value
okay another thing we can do is we can
add a line break oopsies there we go all
snap all right so now it's nice and easy
to read what if we want to know the key
of this well all we have to do is create
a new variable it doesn't matter what it
is and have it point to the value sort
of like when we're defining an array we
could be like like this well it also
works when we're using the for each
we're just saying all right these are
replacement variables for the setup used
to create
so when we create an array we had this
look at this right here
well instead of one we're just going to
use this temporary variable to say it
could be any key it doesn't have to be
one and we're using this temporary value
to mean it can be any value it doesn't
have to be n so that means it can be to
tie or three and Josh or we could set
this to twenty now it can be twenty and
Aaron 21 and Ty 22 and Josh so let's try
that okay right now we're not doing
anything that's because we are not using
this key within the code block so let's
try adding something the key points to
whoops whoa
didn't we do that now if i refresh it we
got an error so let's take a look oh
okay I forgot to close my quotes I am a
noob all right so the key 20 points to
Aaron the key 21 points to tie the key
22 points to Josh so that is how the for
each loop works and we can do pretty
much anything we want so let's try
something new let's say these are
numbers one two and nine thousand one
the key zero points the one the key one
points to two key two points to nine
thousand one okay so if this is what we
have for example we can take the
variable V and add one thousand to it
we're going to do is we're going to
assign this new value to
added value okay so now rather than
echoing B we're going to want to echo
added value so let's try this and I'm
going to add a line break in there
awesome so that added 1,000 to each of
the original variables and I don't know
why that's there but it's kind of cool
because it makes money so yeah that is
using the for each loop in PHP thank you
