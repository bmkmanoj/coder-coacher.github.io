Python tutorial series by the way if in
the middle of this video you hear a
little beep that's because I am
currently editing a video and it might
be done publishing and then it decides
to you know make a bunch of noise and
interrupt my recording what not anyways
in this video we're going to be talking
a little bit more about the for loop so
the for loop IT rates through a list or
a range so let's try this 4x in range
let's let's create a few here not loot
that Bing yeah let's let's first before
we do anything let's create a list
alright let's make it friends and we're
going to make this c-dawg
so that's my friend sea dog and I guess
we'll just we'll add some people to that
friends append gym it and now let's put
some let's print and friends just to
check it all to check to make sure
everything went well so now I have two
people in this friends list now and we
if we create a for loop we could say for
X and friends and then what we do is we
start the for loop so in order to do
this we say : and then we go tell it
what we want it to do with each value
and we could have a nested loot love
loop here so we could say for I we have
to use a different variable for I in
range 0 to 10
print print
I wear just print we'll just print the
variable I so now what it should do if I
did this right it should say c-dawg and
then it should make a list zero to ten
and then for Jimmy it'll print zero to
ten again or up to nine anyways because
it doesn't actually go up to ten it
prints zero all the way up to nine all
right let's see if it worked okay yes it
did so the only problem is I never
printed out the friend's name so let's
try this again in order to do that we
would have to say print let's print
let's just print X yep let's make a
simple now let's try it and it says see
doll and then it says Jimmy and then it
goes on into the nested four so it does
this one one time and then for every I T
eration it does this a second it does
this one so if we had like ten friends
and friends it's going to go through
this ten times once for each different
person so that's kind of how a nested
for loop looks once again just be
careful with the indentation know that
this right here is part of the
indentation for this four and this right
here is for the indentation of this four
so yeah that's all I really need to say
in this video I know it's kind of simple
and to the point but nothing too much
about it so in the next video hopefully
we will be starting something new and be
sure to subscribe and I'll see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
