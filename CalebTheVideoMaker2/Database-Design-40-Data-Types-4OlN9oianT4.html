will be discussing datatypes almost
forgot there anyways what a data type is
is when you create a column every single
value in that column has to be of a
certain data type so you need to tell
that column when you create the database
what data type it is to be also when
you're designing you usually put the
data types there as well so that way you
have an idea of how your database is
going to work so there's three main
categories of data types and the naming
conventions or the names of these data
types from one database management
system to another database management
system might vary a little bit but in
general they're organized into three
main kinds
that's date numeric and string so
basically we're going to be going over
these and a little bit of depth we're
not going to go super in-depth because
right now you just need to understand
what these are and just understand that
your database application might be
slightly different from others let's
start from the bottom up just to make
things fun string string is any
characters or like letters so basically
you put these within quotes so hey this
is an example of a string even a number
within quotes can be used as a string in
this case this will be used as a string
basically the other three doesn't have
any mathematical value unless it's
converted to numeric within string
you'll often have some subcategories you
will have something that's either char
or varchar which does this mean
character or variable character what
that means is it's just like a list of
characters the character or chart
usually is stuff that's set in length so
like a phone number or a zip code
something that doesn't change size-wise
so basically with a char you'll see you
have it something
like char 8 and every single value
within that char column is going to be
stored as a individual characters now
even if you don't put eight characters
let's say you put six then there's going
to be two blank characters in there so
they're all sort of eight varchar' on
the other hand is variable basically
meaning that the size can change you can
have anywhere from 0 up to 8
there's also often the subcategory or
sub data type of text which is often
used for larger things such as comments
messages and so forth that's basic
summary of the string data types as for
numeric data types these are numbers
that's different than this this is a
string that has a number in it that's
used differently than the numeric data
type the numeric data type doesn't have
quotes it's just the numbers that you're
using just like string there's often
some subcategories of decimal and then
floating-point or double decimal works
in base 10 now I know we haven't really
gotten much into faces and I'm just
gonna put date back up here some never
got big it but I think it's really
important to know and in fact I've made
a lot of videos over binary hexadecimal
and stuff basically different numbering
systems that use different bases well
decimal uses base-10 it's the number
system we're used to counting in you
know 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and then goes
back to 10 11 12 13 14 it's base 10
that's what decid means and decimal
well there's also binary so we have
decimal and then we have a binary
decimals base 10 binaries in base 2 so
binary we only have the options of 0 &amp;amp; 1
now you don't really need to understand
how to like calculate in binary
if you want to know that I do have
videos for that but just know when we're
working with decimal it is working with
a base 10 system when we're working with
floating points we're working with
binary which is stored differently it's
stored in binary and then you can have
it presented as decimal for math or
whatever so what's really the difference
do you use decimal or do you use
floating points it just kind of really
depends decimal generally is more
accurate on mathematics to a plane there
are problems that can come up with
decimal but you'll just have to research
those but basically this one has some
errors binary it has problems with
certain mathematical equations or
numbers for example when we want to
store one-fourth it's stored like this
we have zero point zero one and the way
this kind of works is we have anything
after the point that divides the number
basically in half so we would have half
but we don't have half so we have 1/2 of
1/2 1/4 kind of makes sense
so the place values would be this one
right here would be of we'd have 1/2
this place value would be 1/4 and then
anything after that would be 1/8 and
anything after that would be 1/16 so
right now when we have it we would take
1/2 multiplied by zero to get zero
because we don't have anything there we
take 1/4 multiply it by 1 since we have
it there we get 1/4 0 0 we add those up
we get 1/4 basic adding and multiplying
to understand how it works but when we
have a number such as 0.1 and decimal
that is basically impossible to store in
binary simply because we're
working in a base-2 system and we can't
get to point one very easily because one
eight that doesn't quite cut it you have
to basically have a combination of a
bunch of different fractions to get as
close as possible to point one but you
can never really get there perfectly so
that's problem with the floating points
so if you needed ass or something like
that you would if it needs to have that
accuracy you would have to have it
stored as a decimal which stores it
differently oh I was a lot sorry if I
completely overwhelm do with that number
stuff and if I did don't even worry
about it that was a little too fast you
need it slower please check out my
introduction to binary video it's a
super long video where I basically
explain it step by step so you
understand and then I have a couple
other videos adding and subtracting and
also fractions in binary you will also
have an integer type which will only
store numbers that don't have any
decimals after them so only whole
numbers like 5 1228 negative 52 so forth
with numbers we also have to worry about
whether they are unsigned or signed if
they are unsigned numbers that means
that they can't be negative if they are
signed that means they can be positive
or negative
you're probably wondering why would you
ever do that well if you're working with
something that doesn't go negative well
then you wouldn't need to have that
negative when you have a signed number
and it can be positive or negative the
range of potential values stays the same
but since you include negatives the
maximum value is different it's not as
high think about if you have a range
from zero to a thousand but then you
include negatives now you have from
negative five hundred to five hundred
that is going to be told with the
datatype so you might say something like
double unsigned that would work as a
number that's enough for numbers I don't
want to talk about this anymore
let's talk about dates dates well
there's a couple different things you
need to know about dates there's eight
then there's time there
is date time and then there's timestamp
so let's talk about date time first
because it makes sense the best it
basically just stores a date such as you
know Oh two for February then you might
have a colon you might have twenty two
for the date twenty second and then
colon maybe on 1998 for 1998 and the
year then you have the time which could
be whatever I could be twelve thirty 22
which would be the seconds and you might
even be able have some milliseconds or
microseconds that's how you would store
a date time the way it actually looks
might vary from database management
system to database management system
some might have colons between the
numbers some some might have hyphens or
commas or whatever it doesn't really
matter I don't mean to think about that
right now I just want you to think about
the date being a date and the time being
a time date time being the combination
of a date and a time that's pretty much
that for dates the only other thing is
the timestamp the timestamp is an exact
moment in time that's recorded to
establish when something was created or
done it can be in milliseconds or it can
be in the month the day and then the
second set hour and then the seconds and
then the milliseconds or it can just be
a number of seconds so forth it varies
but anyways that's going to give you a
number when something was done it's
usually for something like when an
account was created or when a
transaction was done or when something
happened when you update a column that
timestamp will often update and that's
going to keep it to like when that row
was entered into the database so if you
enter your new row and one of the
columns is a timestamp it's going to
give you a value as soon as you submit
that and it's put into the database the
timestamps created and it says okay this
row was entered at this time that's the
main thing with timestamps so basically
you got three types of data types we got
string um numeric and then
eight all of those classifications have
different data types for each one but in
general as long as you know like the
gist of what is what you'll be fine you
don't have to worry too much because
when you get actually programming a
database you will have more specifics on
what data types to use so you guys thank
you for watching so I for rambling in
this video is a long one who piece out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
