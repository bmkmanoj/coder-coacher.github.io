gonna be talking about foreign keys so
this is a big subject and there's a lot
of important things so I'm going to be
separating a lot of these concepts up in
two separate videos so the next two or
three videos this video and two others I
think will be over foreign keys and a
lot of things that have to do with
foreign keys I'm sorry
anyways this video we'll be talking
about introduction to foreign keys and
exactly it what exactly they do alright
so a foreign key is a reference and what
does it reference it references a
primary key so that's bit that's the
most basic definition of a foreign key
now this can be a primary key in the
same table or a primary key and a
separate table so let's kind of see how
this would play out if we do do some
drawing right let's let's think of a
class for a college database so this
database has caught up has all the
information for a specific College or
multiple colleges and one table is for
classes we also have a table for
instructors and for users and anything
else that's a obvious that's an obvious
entity so let's let's look at the class
table so I have a class table with this
draw it out here within here we could
have a class ID which like I said we're
just going to be using surrogate keys
for most of this you can't do the same
thing with natural Peas and if you have
no idea what I'm talking about just
don't just pretend I never said anything
so yeah we have a class ID that's an
example of a surrogate primary key we
can also have an instructor
you see so we can have an instructor ID
right and we could have let's say a room
number because we could have we can have
a table for every single room which
talks about more information about the
room or I don't know if that's a really
good example or we could say we have a
bigger building or a bigger college and
we have a table for each building so
that's probably that's probably a better
example so we can say a building ID to
say which which building it is in
alright so here here are 3 ID so you can
assume that they're all keys because
almost all IDs are going to be keys of
some sort which one is the primary key
well this one right here the class ID
this is the primary key because it's the
class table every single row within this
table is going to have a class ID
whether it be 1 2 3 4 7 12 843 64
whatever it is it's going to have a
class ID every single row so every
single class is going to have its own ID
we also have an instructor ID we also
have a building ID well since these are
kind of unrelated to the class you can
assume that there are foreign keys in
this example because we're not going to
have an instructor ID for a class
necessarily by itself this is going to
be an instructor ID for an instructor so
that means we have another table for
instructor so this is our instructor
stable I think I'm spelling instructor
right and we have an instructor in here
instructor ID well this you can tell
that these are a reference here we can
also have a building ID so this
reference is another table and that
would be the building and then we have a
building ID
sorry I'm taking forever to write in a
Cayman right nice that says building ID
right there and this reference is that
there so you can see there's a
connection between these tables now
we'll get more into drawing
relationships better like rather than
just using lines we'll talk about more
of that in future but as from now we can
see that these reference these columns
so the columns point to each other and
also each individual rows going to point
to each other so let me explain that a
little bit more when we have a row with
in our class table let's draw this table
a little bit better so you kind of see
how it would work so let's say this is
an actual example of the values within
this table we have a class ID and
instructor I'm just going to put on and
the building ID just for simplicity okay
because I don't feel like writing all
that out so we got a class ID and just
just to make things more just to be more
accurate to what a normal database would
be we could say like the name the name
of the class like by all dude so we can
have a class ID we could have seven for
a value we could have the instructor ID
could be 63 we could have the building
ID of 16 and then the name could be
biology well every single column is
going to have column rules or
requirements for example these two
columns here individually this one is
going to have a rule that says every
single value within this column so as we
go to the next row at the next value
every single one is going to have to
reference something from the instructor
table because it's an instructor ID so
that's one of the column rules now same
for the building ID we could say that
every single row has to reference a
value within the building
all right so that means do you row right
here let's say this row individually
this one right here the class ID with
seven biology references the instructor
with the ID of 63 and the building with
the ID of 16 so you can see that the
column has rules set to say that every
single value within this column every
single row is going to have to reference
an instructor and a building now each
individual row we could say all the
specific row references the building and
16 in the instructor 63 you see so
that's kind of how foreign keys work let
me uh put this out I've got a drawn out
of different way
let's take a look at the the building
table okay so let's just draw little
squares to represent it and let's say
within this table we're not going to
structure the columns or anything we're
just going to say we have the building
seven 16 and 14 so these are three
separate buildings and we could have
names for the buildings and all kinds of
other things now we have within the
class let's say this is the class table
right and we have the class ID so the
class ID would be like 64 38 123 it
doesn't really matter what number they
are and eight right and now we're going
to have a reference to the building ID
so let's say we have seven seven seven
14 right so here's this an example so
over here we got the class ID we got the
building ID and then we got the building
ID and then we have more information
about the building here if we wanted
well you can see that there's a
connection between every single value
every single row within this class table
has a connection with a building ID so
the entire column building ID has the
rules that every single value within
that column has to point to a value
within the building ID of the building
table now each individual row has a
value that points to a specific row
within the building ID as you can see
these are all individual rows so I see a
little crowded here we can see that
three of these classes in this class
table reference one building and that's
the building with the ID seven and that
could be the room of legit building
seven
for or whatever you want to call your
building it doesn't really matter so
that's that's an example of a
relationship using foreign keys foreign
keys or what keep things connected so
let's say the name of building 7 was
legit because I really don't know what
else to name it well now I have the
value of legit as its name and we
connect with the ID so rather than
putting legit legit legit and having
repeating data that could be easily
messed up for example with legit was
changed to legit with two T's or changes
change the name completely well now is
this a foreign key it's connected so it
updates automatically uh so yeah that's
kind of how foreign keys work just keep
in mind that every table has one primary
key
now that primary can primary key can be
a combination of multiple columns if you
want but it only is defined as one
primary key for example we can have the
combination of first name plus last
names this group could be the primary
key but we're not going to have the
first name primary key and we're not
going to have also the last name primary
key because that's too much two primary
keys and we can't do that we can have
the combination of the two but with
foreign keys you can have multiple
columns having foreign key relations to
different tables but keep in mind each
column can only have one reference so in
the class example we had a teacher ID
well that teacher ID here's the class
table and let's say the teacher ID is 7
6 &amp;amp; 5 well this can be any reference and
we can also have another foreign key we
could have the building ID which could
be 6 12 and 8 so although we only let
have one primary key in a table we can
have multiple foreign keys referencing
different tables if we wanted it to be
we're the inch the the instructor I
think it's supposed to be a tie so the
instructor to wear the class have
multiple instructors well that's a
many-to-many relationship when we're
going to have to redesign our tables
with an intermediary table so hopefully
that's kind of making sense I just want
you to realize that primary keys or what
sort each individual tables the foreign
keys are what connect tables and that
you protect that integrity with forward
key constraints which we'll be talking
about in the upcoming next few videos so
that's all I really got to say about
foreign keys in this video if you're new
to this it might be a lot of complex
thought but don't let it ball don't let
it ever want me to just take it easy and
if you ever need check out my I have
another database design series which
kind of takes things a little easier so
if that would be beneficial for you
check that out if you have any questions
leave me a comment and I'll be sure to
get to them thank you and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
