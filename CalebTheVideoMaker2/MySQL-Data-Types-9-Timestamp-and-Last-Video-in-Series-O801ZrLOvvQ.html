and this is basically an amount of
seconds since what they call the UNIX
epoch which was in nineteen seventy so
the number is pretty big now but
basically when when I do a timestamp
it'll take the time from your server or
your computer and uh it'll convert it to
UTC UTC stands for coordinated Universal
Time why it's like that I don't even
know so it's coordinated Universal Time
pretty sure you can read that but oh
well UTC can be reached from any time
zone so if you ever see like you TC plus
or minus like three hours it basically
converts all the time zones to a
straight time specific time zone and
then uh this allows it to universal and
then um the time stamp will update any
time there is an insert into your
database or an update alright guys
that's all um I hope you learned a lot
from this gum miniature course I guess
you could call it it was kind of short
but um I covered everything and if you
can't tell my throat's about you explode
because I don't think I took a single
break and I've drinking like a ton
alright guys thanks for watching be sure
to subscribe please I mean I'm not
begging you but um yeah and be sure to
like this video and catch you next time
more videos are coming soon peace out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
