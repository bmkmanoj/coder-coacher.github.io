and this is basically an amount of
seconds since what they call the UNIX
epoch which was in 1970 so the number is
pretty big now but basically when when I
do a timestamp
it'll take the time from your server or
your computer and uh it'll convert it to
UTC UTC stands for coordinated Universal
Time why it's like that I don't even
know
so it's coordinated Universal Time
pretty sure you can't even read that but
oh well UTC can be reached from any time
zone so if you ever see like UTC plus or
minus like three hours it basically
converts all the time zones to a
straight time specific time zone and
then uh this allows it to Universal and
then the time stamp will update any time
there is an insert into your database or
an update alright guys that's all um I
hope you learned a lot from this
miniature course I guess you could call
it it was kind of short but um I covered
everything and if you can't tell my
threads about ready to explode because I
don't think I took a single break and
I'm drinking like I'm telling now all
right guys well thanks for watching be
sure to subscribe please I mean I'm not
begging you but um yeah and be sure to
like this video and uh catch you next
time
more videos are coming soon peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
