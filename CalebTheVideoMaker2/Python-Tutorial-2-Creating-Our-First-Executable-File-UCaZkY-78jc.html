video we're going to be talking about
creating our very first launch herbal
Python file and I'll explain what that
means in just a second but first for
simplicity I pin this to my Start menu
and I'd recommend that you do that so to
do that you can click on the file right
click and click pin to task
I'm sorry pin just Start menu or you can
pin it to the taskbar which might be
useful for you too but either way I did
that now let me just get that out of the
way for us we don't need that anymore
alright so here is our Idol our
graphical user interface we can put our
code in here and then we press ENTER to
execute that write in write that moment
and we can do things like create hello
worlds and we can make if statements and
so forth when you make an if sorry I'm
kind of battle typing and then we can
press ENTER to go to the next line and
press ENTER again to execute it well
that's something we can do with this and
that's really cool but what if we want
to actually make a complete program and
not have to worry about pressing enter
and then it launching and doing what we
want it to do oh that's something we can
do with Python as well
so in order to do that we click file new
file alright so this is our new file you
can see we don't have any of this extra
text at the top so we can start typing
and then we can say of just for an
example let's create a print that says
hello world let me just uh correct that
there and then we can put a semicolon to
end our line and I'll explain all this
all this later but I'm just showing you
how the program works for now so when we
press ENTER you can see oh nothing
happens is it broken no it's actually
supposed to do that that's a good thing
what we can do is then click file save
and we can either save it to this folder
or we can save it to our desktop for
example and we can just name it whatever
you want we can say hello click Save so
now we have a file named hello dot py
and now to run it we click a run and
then we click run module and it's going
to run over here where it's on our
graphical user interface and it's going
to run that file so now since we're
going to be using both of these let me
just open both of these side-by-side
there you go so now we can see both of
them very clearly so you can see over
here when we run this it goes over and
runs it within our graphical user
interface so we can see what this
program does so let's try something else
we can basically just turn this into an
if statement indent that and then come
up here
if v is greater than four colon and then
we can save it by pressing file save or
just clicking ctrl S which is what you
will want to get used to that's what
I'll be doing throughout these videos so
I don't have to click keep clicking that
although make sure you save it now
that's really important and then what we
do is options or run sorry run module or
just press f5 and we can keep pressing
f5 and it's going to run that module now
let's try changing this if 3 is greater
than 4 and see if you launch it without
saving it it has it says it has to be
saved so click OK to save it and then it
runs and you can see nothing happened
that's because 3 is not greater to 4 so
when we keep trying to run this oops
sorry I'm going too fast oh my goodness
alright so make sure you don't click it
click things a little too fast for it it
might freak out on you like that what we
can do is click file open and then we
can click on our file to bring it back
up which is probably good thing that
that happened so I can just illustrate
how to get things back up and running
then you just click f5 and it will run
it at 5 and and run it nothing happens
but you can see now we can make complex
scripts all in one file and then run the
entire script at one time now you may be
wondering what is this file how can I
open it well let's let's try that out
right now what we're going to do is
we're going to open the file location of
our Python
oops sorry home of our Python folder so
python 34 and then we have tests sorry
hello py
I created that one earlier when I was
messing around when we double-click it
we have this little black box pop up and
then it disappears and you're probably
wondering like oh what's the purpose of
that well you can see it's not very
useful right now that's because we
haven't figured out how to keep that
system open so where it doesn't
disappear but if you look at this really
quick if you were like if your eyes or
so fast you could like freeze time well
that's going to run our script here I'll
make it more easy to see so if I make it
seven greater than four and just so we
can see what's going on here put like 50
lines of that save it and then we run
this file you can see a a flash of what
our program does you might not be able
to see it too well on YouTube but I can
see it clearly so that that's a problem
we're going to have to learn how to fix
in upcoming videos but as for now all of
our scripts can be ran within our
graphical user interface or idle so that
will work out perfectly fine so we don't
have to worry about running the actual
programs from the file alright so that
is the end of this video thank you for
watching hopefully that was helpful and
in the next video we'll really start
getting into beginner programming
techniques and concepts so be sure to
subscribe and I will see you in the next
video well technically I won't see you
but you know what I mean all right peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
