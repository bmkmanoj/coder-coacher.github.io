wanted to go over the absolute
measurements of all of the Triads that
we have learned learned so we had the
major triad the minor tried diminish try
that and the Augmented triad now if we
take a look at just the first to the
major in the minor we can see they both
have a perfect fifth the only difference
is this first note right here so this is
to say that the third and the in the
Triad is an important note because it
distinguishes whether it is minor or
major and we'll get into that in another
upcoming video but that's what you can
think so if you want it to sound minor
you just lower the middle note now if we
have diminished augmented diminished has
a minor third and a diminished fifth
augmented has a major third and an
Augmented fifth I guess I'll circle
those ones too so it fits in I don't
want to feel left out so anyways here
are the absolute measurements for the
Triads cool it yeah I know so efron see
your C and make a keyboard here I don't
know I just think it my keyboard output
i'll also be funner because i don't get
it wrong keyboards very often so we have
c b+ wrong I shouldn't be there
and G pretty awesome so here is our
keyboard we can basically recreate the
sea triad by taking the three notes the
first third and the fifth and altering
them appropriately to match the proper
triad side trip light there so here is
conveniently enough a major sequel I
raised a c-major chord and this is
because a minor a major third and a
perfect fifth are diatonic they are
within the major scale of C says C major
conveniently enough a major chord comes
from the C major scale so what is the C
major scale we have c d e f g a b c
there's no sharps or flats in the c
major scale sharps or flats so that's a
that's makes sense the c major chord is
diatonic to the c major scale so you get
the c major chord from the c major scale
so minor chord we take this note and
place it here instead so that makes it
minor if we want to diminished we place
it here because this interval right here
is a minor third one two three four now
this interval is a diminished fifth
that's because I has six half steps one
two three four five six so this becomes
a diminished fifth here it's pretty
sweet uno so the absolute measurements
for an Augmented chord would be C E and
G sharp so here is the absolute
intervals we got a major third and then
we got a Augmented fifth now an
Augmented fifth as ate half steps
because you take a perfect fifth
seven half steps and increase it one
half step to make it augmented or raise
it a half step so it was originally here
and we scoot it up to here that creates
an Augmented triad so basically that is
the absolute measurements for the Triads
that we have learnt itted so in the next
video we're going to go over the seventh
chords so I'll see you then thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
