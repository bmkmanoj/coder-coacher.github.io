from Caleb the video maker - this is
your second video and your C programming
tutorial series now at the end of the
last video I said we were going to start
programming in this video I may have
lied just a little bit that's because I
forgot we had to set up our environment
so the environment is the computer we're
working on that has all of the tools we
are going to need installed and ready to
go so the first thing we're going to
need is an operating system now if you
don't know what an operating system is
it's just the software that runs on
every computer you either have you know
a Windows operating systems such as
Windows 10 or Windows 7 or if you're
fortunate enough Windows 8 or you might
have Mac and in general you can classify
operating systems into two groups the
first one is Windows based operating
systems and the second group is UNIX and
Linux operating systems now Mac would be
part of that second group it's a UNIX
based operating system and I know you're
probably wondering like why am I getting
into all this stuff right now well the
reason is because Windows is a little
bit different and I would highly
recommend to have a UNIX or Linux
operating system you can try to do all
windows it might work just fine but you
might have to look up a couple things
and do things a little bit differently
so to make things easier for you
I think we should all be on Linux or
UNIX operating systems so what are some
good examples of that well if you have
an apple computer you're set you have
what you need if you have a Windows
computer don't give up hope
don't go buy a Mac right now I don't
want you to be in debt for the rest of
your life there is a tool called
VirtualBox which will allow you to
install operating systems inside of
other operating systems then you can
install Ubuntu which is completely free
and that will allow you to follow
everything in this video basically
exactly the same as for how to do all
that I recommend is looking up a
tutorial there's probably like a
thousand on the Internet
once you got all that done we're going
to need to open a terminal so on Mac go
up here and type in
terminal oh it's great it's pretty once
you're on the terminal you can change a
couple things first you can zoom in by
holding command or if you're on Linux
you can hold ctrl and pressing the plus
button you can also click terminal and
go to preferences and you can change all
kinds of goodies and all that stuff I
think the classic neon green is perfect
for me so to begin we are going to need
a compiler now remember from the
previous video the compiler takes our C
code and turns it into something the
computer can use so the compiler we are
going to use is called GCC GCC is very
common and it's probably installed on
most if not all UNIX operating systems
and it's very easy to install on Mac all
you got to do is tie GCC and press Enter
now I already have installed so it
didn't do anything fancy but if you
don't have it installed it's probably
going to ask you if you want to install
some kind of developer tools and infect
your computer with a bunch of viruses
just be sure to click yes I'm kidding no
viruses be sure to click install and
once that's done you will get to this
point and when you type in GCC it will
complain because you're not telling it
what file you want to compile in
addition to GCC we are also going to
need a text editor now the text editor
is where we type in our C code and just
like how I said GCC is common on a ton
of computers there is a text editor that
is very common on a lot of computers
that text editor is called vim now 50%
of you are probably gonna be like them
25% are probably back yeah and then the
other 25 are going to be like I have no
idea what then it takes a while to get
used to them so a lot of people dislike
it but once you figure it out it's very
useful because it's available on so many
different computers so no matter what
you can use this text editor to edit
files even if you're connecting to a
computer remotely through the console or
the shell or whatever the heck you want
to call this thing the terminal but I'm
getting off-topic it doesn't really
matter if you want to use them or not
because I'm going to use them and if you
want to use something else that's
totally cool with me
okay so let's type them and then put a
space and then what comes after that is
the name of the file you want to create
so we will just say hello dot C and
press Enter
now M is open anywhere there is a tilde
it means there's no line there this
first line is where we're typing and
down at the bottom you can see the name
of the file and you can also see that
it's a new file now like I said vim
frustrates a lot of people and part of
the reason is how in the world are you
supposed to get out of this program well
I'm going to teach you the trick on how
to escape one of the most useful pieces
of information to know in life the trick
is to put : Q and then press Enter now
we're back to the terminal
that is a pretty good introduction we
got our environment ready to go and
we're ready to start coding so in the
next video we're going to write and
execute our very first program so be
sure to subscribe if you like these
videos and I will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
