teaching you how to control somebody's
computer remotely you can also just view
their computer if they have some
questions or something you want to go to
a website it's called join dot me that's
Jo I in period dot and period Emme all
right so this is what it look like and
under share you want click the basic and
then you want click this little arrow it
should start a download and save file
look just like that
okay you want to clip that and run
simples that should pop up here so this
code right here you can copy this or
send it to somebody an email but
basically all they have to do is go into
their web browser and they can paste it
up here in their address bar and press
GO and they'll be able to view your
screen now it's gonna look a little
funky because I'm viewing me viewing me
who's viewing me so it'll probably be a
bit slow Paul I can't see anything but
try it on another computer I promise
it'll work
and now what you can do is this little
mouse you can share the control with the
viewer so now the person on that window
can control my screen so alright guys
it's a little bit tricky on one computer
but try don't know there it'll work out
and you'll be able to control your
computer all you got to do is if you
want to cancel them I'm controlling it
just click right here and stop it
that's all you have to do there's also
meant some other options on here which
whatever you can score with this and
that's about all thanks for watching
catch you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
