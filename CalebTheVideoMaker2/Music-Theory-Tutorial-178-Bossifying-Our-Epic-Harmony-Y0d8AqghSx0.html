music theory tutorial series and in this
video we're going to be talking about
altering the chord structure to create a
better harmony now specifically we're
talking about three voice harmony that
means three different people or three
different voices parts whatever you want
to think of it our seeing this or
playing this part so we have this one
somebody playing that those notes and we
have somebody playing these nets now I
have somebody playing these notes so as
you can look at it I mean as you can see
they're all kind of going the same
direction this little check mark thing
and let's go parallel movement and
typically it's boring and kind of
frowned upon so we can do is alter this
harmony to make it even better so for
example I can take this G and scoot it
up here well with this G I can take this
F let's get up here and actually i'll
take the a to put it right here I'm take
this G and move it up here again so
let's get rid of this these lines down
here
so this is our new part of making reduce
air is too because we're going to read
we're going to change things up a bit
and let me just try to restructure some
of these lines right so now we have a
new part here and it doesn't jump around
as much so you can have a part here that
one's kind of jumpy hmm we could move
that yeah we for example we can move the
F back down here no that's that's even a
bigger job yeah let's leave it there and
we could have uh very good so now the
jumps aren't nearly as big that one's
pretty big but not not an achievable
it's only a third so now the jumps
aren't as big and it will sound cooler
because it's not all parallel movement
you make things fun ER and it'll be more
interesting so that is an example of
changing the chord structure to better
to make the Harmony even better so
parallel ism which I said these are
moved in parallel originally that's the
idea of parallelism which is when two
nuts let's say these to move the same
interval they're the same interval part
of their third and then they both go
down a second for example that as you
can see these two lines here if you
extend them they're parallel as in if
they went on forever they'd never touch
that's the idea of parallel if you have
parallel lines think of train tracks
they can curve and stuff but they're
always together but not touching that's
the idea of parallel ism in harmony
parallelism is usually to be avoided
because it's boring mainly and it's lame
and it's boring so that is the idea that
although so there is some parallel ism
there are some guidelines to make the
best parallel ism so parallelism
parallel ism parallel cords are not
always bad but specifically the bad ones
are
perfect fifths apart from each other and
just perfect notes in general and
octaves there they're not good so if we
have a perfect fifth here let's say this
is a perfect fit between each other and
these notes are moving together that
that's a parallel movement because
they're the same distance apart from
each other a perfect fifth and perfect
fifth perfect fit perfect fifth that's
to be avoided because the relation
between these notes and now we're kind
of getting into multi voice melody which
will be getting to that in an upcoming
video which it's very important to be
able to distinguish between melody lines
you don't want it to sound like a
harmony but if we're playing these
perfect fifths together which by the way
sound very nicely together it's going to
sound like one sound to us for example C
and G those are very close to each other
and sound and they sound almost as one
piece so for if we're in four-part
melody wright and then one of two of the
melodies get in this perfect fifth
pattern and they're going together it's
going to sound like one melody and it's
going to sound like a three-part melody
with everybody else which completely
defeats the purpose of having a
four-part melody when it only sounds
like three it makes things more
difficult and then it doesn't make all
of the melody parts equally important
that's the idea of counterpoint which is
to say all of the multiple melodies are
equally as important which will be
getting that into the net will be
getting into that in the next video so i
will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
