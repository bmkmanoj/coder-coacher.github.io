welcome my name is Caleb from Caleb the
video maker to this video we are going
to be discussing second normal form
second normal form so right where was I
okay second normal form it's the second
in the normalization process as you
probably would have guessed
now the prerequisites of second normal
form is that you've already completed
first normal form so make sure you watch
the previous video that's going to tell
you how to get to this point now second
normal form deals with something known
as partial dependencies now we've talked
about when you have a value for a column
it depends on that entity partial
dependencies come in when you have two
or more columns for the primary key so
this always deals with compound or
composite keys when you have multiple
columns that are part of the primary key
that primary key is known as a composite
primary key so let's say we have one key
over here and one key over here now this
is where the partial dependency comes in
when you have a column it depends on
that primary key so that means if we
have a column down here it's going to
need to depend on the primary key but
when we have composite keys it has to
depend on both of them but if we have a
partial dependency it depends on less
than all of them so for example if we
have 3 columns that consists of the
primary key it has to depend on all of
them if it only depends on two we have
what's known as a partial dependency so
in the situation of only having two if
it depends on only one we have a partial
dependency now I know this is all
conceptual but give me a couple minutes
I'll give you some examples but for now
just know that partial dependencies are
bad the entire goal a second normal form
is to get rid of partial dependencies
and what that means is if you don't have
a composite key you don't even have to
worry about second normal form that
being said some of the principles inside
of second normal form can still be
applied and can help improve your
database the reason that is is you
actually never have to use a composite
you can force yourself to always use a
single column for a key for example if
this is named column one a really
awesome name and this one's column two
instead of having a composite key in
theory you could just have column 1
column 2 ID and then just give it a
number and then this would not be a
composite key because it's just one
column that being said the data in this
table should still depend on both of
these because that's how the table is
set up you're just gaming the system by
adding a new column it doesn't improve
your database any it just makes it worse
so only how to column if you already
know how to design the database and
don't just add a column to avoid a
second normal form because that's going
to defeat the whole purpose second
normal form is a good thing not a bad
thing so if you see yourself trying to
kind of squeak through the cracks and
avoid having to do the rules of the
normal forms then the chances are you're
adding a layer of complexity and that
complexity is layered on top of a bad
designed database so don't be obnoxious
don't try to game the system follow the
normal forms and everything will work
out just great now that we talked about
the concepts let's go over some real
examples really practical examples back
to our animal dating site I have that
cookie you know my but first I wanted to
explain one more thing second normal
form comes up more often when you have
natural keys the reason that is is
because when you have natural keys you
often have to think of more columns in
order to force things to be unique not
always but in general you can just add
an ID to whatever table you have and
you're good to go which is kind of funny
because I was kind of just yelling at
you guys not to do that just a minute
ago but essentially that's what
surrogate Keys do such a hypocrite
essentially if you're using single
column surrogate key columns that's good
but there are circumstances when you're
going to have multiple
school ID columns inside of a primary
key for example when we designed a
many-to-many relationship in databases
we break that up into two one-to-many
relationships so to do that we need
what's known as an intermediary table or
a junction table and when you do that
you're going to have two columns in
there at least it depends on how many
tables you're joining and the group is
going to have to be unique not just one
column in that situation you have two
IDs and you're still using surrogate
Keys the primary key is the combination
of the two columns in that situation you
are required to understand second normal
form what I am advising against is
adding a third column to say the
combination of both of those IDs so I
guess there's a fine line between making
it easier on yourself by using IDs and
making it harder on yourself by adding
too many IDs and that's a fine line that
you're going to have to find because
it's a little bit subjective depending
on you the database management system
and also the project you're working on
and the team you're working on some
people like to have that third column
just so you can reference an entire row
by one ID rather than a group but some
people prefer not to just so you don't
have that extra column for no reason if
they don't need it now moving on to
super practical examples we are starting
an animal dating site and we need a way
to express relationships between one
animal and another animal I personally
think one of the easiest way to design
databases is to start with the wrong way
to store data and then start picking
away all of the obvious things that are
wrong and you end up with something a
little bit prettier that's kind of how
the normal forms work so we'll start
with a bad design database go through
the normalization process up to second
normal form and then we'll be good in
that situation we still might need some
improvement but that's what third normal
form is about which we will discuss in
the next video but for now let's start
with
the animal stable now I'm not going to
spend a whole bunch of time writing out
all of the columns that's because
there's only one column I'm really
interested in and that is the column of
who the animal is in a relationship with
whether it be dating or marriage or
betrothal or whatever so there might be
a column in here such as relationship
with so we'll have an animal ID because
we always need some kind of primary key
and then we'll have relationship and
let's put some data in here let's say
there's one animal with the ID of three
and an animal with the idea of four five
six and seven so these are all different
animals and now this is actually a
foreign key but how does this work it's
actually a foreign key that references
the same table it just references a
different column so this relationship
with column references the animal ID
column I don't know where I was going
with that so we could say the animal was
the ID of three is in a relationship
with the ID for what that means that the
animal is the ID he also has to be in a
relationship with the animal of three
because you have to update two rows
every single time you want to store one
relationship this isn't the best way to
design it this can introduce anomalies
for example three could be in a
relationship with four and four in a
relationship with five and now it's this
chain and that's not the way I
envisioned this dating website to work
so because there's an association here
you can see three is associated with
four and four should also be associated
with three this would be a good example
of when we should use an association
table or a table inside of a
many-to-many relationship and
intermediary table the odd part of this
though is that there's only going to be
a total of two tables rather than three
so imagine it like this we have a table
for animals and then we have the
intermediary table
we have a third table which is also
animals now obviously these are the same
exact table so we don't need to draw it
twice but that's essentially what we're
going to do when we're thinking about
this but when we actually design it will
only use two so we can say we have an
animal over here with the idea let's go
a three and the animal lady over here
with four and we combine them of three
for inside of our team listens we're
only using one table and this references
the same table we only need two so let's
draw a table and this will be named
relationships we actually haven't really
talked about second normal form in this
example yet this is kind of just to
prepare us for a situation where we
might run into second normal form so
inside of this relationships table we
can make an association between two
animals so we would have animal 1 ID
animal to light key and now we only have
to put in one row for every relationship
so we could say the animal with the ID
of 3 is in a relationship with the ID of
for the animal with the idea for and now
we don't have to go and put for three
that's because that Association is
already made so that means we have to
assume that this is a back and forth
relationship so 3 is in a relationship
with 4 and 4 is in a relationship with 3
if you wanted to make it to where 3
could be in relationship with 4 before
doesn't have to be in a relationship
with 3 if you wanted to do that for some
reason then you would need to think of
actually adding rows for each direction
so we could say 4 is in relationship
with 5 but as I said that's stupid I
don't want to do that so we're not doing
that because we have this association
now we're not going to need this call
and now this table would just have data
on the animal so we'd still have the
animal ID the animal name the animal
species all of that stuff this table is
devoted to just the relationship if we
wanted to add a different relationship
we'd have to use different data that's
because this dating website is not going
to allow one animal to be in a
relationship with multiple
because that's just messed up I'm gonna
teach these animals purity okay so that
means five could be in relationship with
seven but we can't use three again in
this column what that means is that this
column can be unique and this column can
be unique you could also make the group
as a whole unique that way we don't have
any repeating data now something I don't
know is how to enforce uniqueness this
way so that way if we had four three it
would be a violation so if you guys know
how to do that please leave a comment
let me know how to do that but for now
we'll just leave it at this so that way
we can have three four but we couldn't
have three five you sick animals and
you're probably wondering where in the
world the second normal form come in
with all this crap well it comes in with
this that's because we have a
combination of ID's as the primary key
and when we have that we have a
composite where compound key and there's
a potential for partial dependencies so
where does a partial dependency come in
a partial dependency in this situation
would be any data describing the animal
for example if we had a column here
running out of room so it's gonna be a
really small column and if there were
any attributes describing one of the
animals so let's say we had animal one
species that's really good information
to have in the database the only thing
is it doesn't belong in this table
that's because the a one species is
dependent only on animal one that's
because it's only describing one half of
this table the first animal so if we had
a normal mini to many relationship let's
say it looks something like this
beautiful I know and inside of this
table we had information related to this
entity that would be a no-no the only
information to go inside of this table
has to be relevant to both of the
primary keys the way you can tell if it
depends on both keys is if you change
one of them is the data able to change
for example in this situation we have a
one species if we change
- let's just say we change this to an
eight right well this data is always
going to be the same that's because
there's no connection to animal - at all
so if you have another many-to-many
relationship just ask yourself if we
change this half of the table is this
attribute going to change whatever
attribute it is if there is a column in
that table and you change one of the
primary keys is it able to change in
this situation if we change this column
this column is unable to change
therefore we have a partial dependency
that's because it only depends on part
of the primary key now you might be
asking yourself if we can't store this
here what kind of information could we
store in a table with a composite
primary key any kind of data that
describes the connection of the two
entities so let's say we have these two
rabbits and they are in a relationship
right well any data that describes this
relationship could be stored in that
intermediary table for example we could
have a column establishment data that
would be the time or date of when this
relationship started we could also say
type of relationship for example we can
have you know dating married engaged
complicated and so forth this data all
describes the relationship so this would
not be in violation of second normal
form
hopefully that describes second normal
form pretty well just be careful of
those intermediary tables because that's
where it'll sneak in on you
thanks guys hopefully it was helpful if
you liked this video click like and as
always click subscribe on my channel
because that really helps me out and
encourages me to make more videos so
thanks guys in the next video we will be
talking about third normal form thank
you I know I've said that like four
times but I'm really thankful do you
guys like my drawing it's it's better
than usual so I thought I'd ask</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
