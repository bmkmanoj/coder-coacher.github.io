talked over a term known as tessitura
now this is a range or a normal fitting
range of notes for a specific type of
instrument or group or pitch or staff
now the ones we learn we learn treble
clef well I just I guess we should say
we learned it we learned trouble bass
alto and tenor trouble use the G clef
base used the F clef now the other tube
which were alto and tenor used the sea
cliff well behind me I have a bunch of
other test Turris which you will
typically only see four of these Claire
won't leave me alone I'm not that
interested anyways before that you'll
typically see is bass treble alto and
tenor but here are the rest of them so
we have French violin trouble soprano
Metsu soprano alto tenor baritone base
and sub base so what's the difference
between all these typically you will see
these two whoops with this the G clef
these four up down to tenor you will see
with the sea cliff
and these and then also the tenor one
you'll see with both so I'm overlapping
that there you'll see with the base
cliff so how does this all work we have
so many of these to put each pitch on a
different line on the staff we could
have more but after some point will be
repeating ourselves for example we can
move this thing up or down so much that
it's the basically the same thing as a
sea clef rather than a G clef so when
we're done we have one two three four
five six seven eight nine unique tessa
taurus so let's begin now treble the one
we already know assigns g right here
where is middle C it's actually down
here one well this is the second highest
pitch tessitura it has a very high range
won't even higher though is French
violin which actually scoots everything
up and assigns g2 right here now we're
scooting all the notes down which allows
for a higher pitch up here we're
scooting each line or space up a third
so this is g g a b so now this is g this
is a this is B so hopefully that makes
sense now I'm going to go through these
and basically show the difference is
Phyllis line back in French violin where
does it sign a sign middle C well
actually two ledger lines down i forgot
the word for a minute whereas trouble
assign it it assigns it one ledger line
down where it is soprano sign it and the
reason I'm using middle C is so we're
all we just pick one note for the mall
rather than going ok this assigns G this
side seat I'm just using middle C for
all of them the soprano assigns it here
what about Mets a soprano well actually
here what about alto
hmm remember I'll choke left put the sea
in the middle we remember that from our
previous videos right right that's what
I thought tenor moves it up even more
baritone one more markers getting really
black really quickly Baird oh shoot I
lost track tenor baritone base is one
above and remember that's where we
interact that's where we cross lines
with the treble clef so treble clef goes
down one tenor clef got bass clef goes
up one ledger line so now what about sub
bass well that's actually two ledger
lines above I'm actually running out of
space here so there is space there is
sub base so that are those are all of
the tessitura so we have french violin
trouble sort pronto mezzo soprano alto
tenor baritone base and sub base now
which ones do we use typically we use my
cursor you can ck these to the Swan and
this one typically we won't see these
ones you may see him but that because
these are the ones you really ever see
and plus now that you know how this all
works you will understand when you see a
different one for example if you see a
treble clef all the way down here rather
than normal we know that this assigns G
hear what the tessitura is called it
doesn't really matter even though we
know it's French violin that is the
tessitura of this right here we're using
the g clef which assigns g to this a b c
d e f g remember the bass clef well it
actually assigned f to that so are these
are these in harmonic huh well they're
actually not because this is actually
higher because remember this is going to
assign middle C down here whereas
cliff assigns it above the staff one
ledger line so those are not in harmonic
they're actually octaves so yeah awesome
that is all I have to say about
tutorials and trust traffic lip cleft
signs it's all I have to say about clear
signs for now until the next video so
see you then subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
