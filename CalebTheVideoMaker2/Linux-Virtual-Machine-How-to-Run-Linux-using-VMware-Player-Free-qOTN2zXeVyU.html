video maker in this video I'll be
teaching you how to install linux as a
virtual machine alright so you see I
have sent to sent OS up but you don't
have to use just send to us you can use
Ubuntu or any other Linux based system
so basically a virtual machine is where
you can run it within your operating
system so you don't have to partition
your hard or hard drive or a reinstall
your operating system or anything like
that it will save our data every single
time we use it and we don't have to
worry about losing our data it stores it
on a hard drive in a virtual machine so
if you want more detailed instructions I
do have a blog over this I created
Caleb curry comm forward slash
installing - Linux - as blah blah blah
yeah you get it so just check out my
blogs in there but for now we will want
to download VMware so you want to go to
this link right here and if you aren't
already be sure to watch this in
full-screen max resolution so you can
see everything clearly we are at wwvv
a.m. we're calm forward slash products
forward slash player now when you get to
the page it'll look something like this
it changes occasionally but you just
scroll down and look for free for
personal use and you click download I
don't bring you to this page right so
the one that you want
you will want it for the operating
system that you are running currently so
I'm running Windows you don't want you
don't want it for the operating system
you're going to install or anything like
that so yeah windows 32-bit and 64-bit
and just click download and that will
start downloading the other thing you
need is what's known as an ISO which is
used to write on to optical disks so
it's how you create DVDs and so forth
but we can use this ISO to create a
virtual machine I cancelled that because
I already have it downloaded so we'll
just use sent OS so sent OS org forward
slash download click download now and
I'll bring to a bunch of mirrors you can
just click on whatever really works and
then that will start downloading as well
it's a pretty big file so give us
time so once those are finished
downloading you will want to open them
and run them I created a shortcut on the
desktop just for simplicity sake but if
you need to find the file check your
downloads folder or wherever it
downloaded to and then just open it we
will install VMware Player first and
window will pop up user account control
just click yes all right so you just go
through the process pretty easy yeah be
sure to read all this good stuff
especially the ending all right the
location of installation yours almost
likely be C colon forward slash possibly
I don't know but I am on a second
partition so it's labeled G next I'm not
going to check for product updates extra
work I'm not going to help improve
anything and then I'm not gonna make any
of this stuff either so you can if you
want but that's up to you continue and
just let that install oh done and then
you just click finish once it's finished
installing we can find the file location
of VMware Player which should be in
Program Files x86 VMware VMware Player
and then you will want to look for VM
Player exe this window will come up from
here you want to click create a new
virtual machine and we're not installing
from a disk
we're actually installing from a file
that we downloaded the image file so you
will want to find the CentOS or Sint OS
ISO so here it is and then you open it
and you click Next and then you can just
make a full name if you want and then
once you have all that you click Next
and ok I already have one so obviously
mess around with this earlier so I'll
just click Next
so umm yeah you can name your sent to us
but I mean like I said I already
installed this once so I'm just going to
name sent to us too and then we can give
it some file size for like how many how
much size this virtual machine has and
I'm not really going to use it for much
so I'll just give it like
for but I'm sure you and I'll go it like
seven I'm sure you might need more than
that
so yes I'm just going to keep it like
how it is and then finish and here's all
of our removable devices we can just X
out of that alright now this will come
up do you want to install VMware tools
easy install I'm sorry this is this is a
good you want to click download install
because we want to use the easy install
otherwise it will not complete I just
click download and install which will
take a couple years and a user account
control just click yes alright so I'm
just going to pause it while all of this
does its work alright once that gets all
done like loading and junk it'll keep
going through a bunch of these processes
and it takes a while but I do want to
mention something while we're waiting
when you click on this your mouse kind
of goes away and you can get out of that
by pressing ctrl + Alt at the same time
so now I'm controlling my desktop when I
click on it I'm controlling the virtual
machine desktop virtual machine desktop
virtual machine desktop ok you get the
point
all right as you can see things just
finished installing so you can just
click your username there and put your
password in log in give it a couple
hours again as usual this does take a
while so you do have to be patient
alright so this is now your official
virtual machine of sent OS so we can
move this around and we can record
obviously on a Windows computer
so just like a normal computer we can
access all the stuff we can do things on
this and when we put stuff on here if
for example if I went to the Internet
and downloaded a photo well when we X
out of this everything is going to stay
the same so that is how you install an
operating system as a virtual machine so
what we can do from here there's some
other options for example oh we can exit
obviously and suspending sort of like
sleeping or whatever powering off
turning it off so I'm just going to turn
it off it takes a while when we launched
the actual program again VM player dot
exe we now have sent us over here and it
has information about that we can also
install a new virtual machine such as
Ubuntu or whatever you have really we
can open a virtual machine that is
already created from like either if you
have this on another computer you can
put it on a hard drive bring it to this
computer and so forth you can do a lot
of things but once you just need to
reopen it you just double click it and
it will start right where you left off
in the last time it'll boot up like a
normal computer and everything will be
saved to your hard drive but through
this virtual machine it seems like
another computer so hopefully that all
makes sense and once again if you have
any questions just leave me a comment so
yeah that that all that information is
also available on my blog on the website
oh that's trippy check that out alright
well thanks for watching guys and I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
