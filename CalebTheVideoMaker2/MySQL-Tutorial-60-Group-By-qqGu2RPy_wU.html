know what number this is well I kind of
got distracted in the last few videos
and I never got to say Happy
Thanksgiving
I'm not sure if I'll play this on
Thanksgiving considering that's today
but if you're watching this like three
weeks from then or two years in the
future or in the past than Happy
Thanksgiving or Happy Christmas or Merry
Christmas or Happy Hanukkah or whatever
whenever you're watching this find the
closest holiday and put happy before it
and then that's what I'm telling you
today I will be talking about grouping
these aggregate functions now I'm going
to be using the same example if we have
a store and you can rate not a store
sorry a restaurant and you can rate this
restaurant up to three times and you can
use this for a lot of examples but I
like this example because I made it up
and it's really clever so yeah so
basically one person can rate the
restaurant three times let's draw this
out we got James right here he's kind of
short
then we got Caleb over here nothing
super buff right
sexy hair you know it's six-pack that's
that's Caleb I got this this lady over
here so we have three people this kind
of looks like really creepy
this guy was names James I think this
was Caleb and let's name her Delilah
hey there so here is what we read in the
store
this guy rated it a six and then it came
back and rated it a five i rated it a 10
a 10 and a 10 this person
Delilah only came here twice alright
that's enough
darn it James rated at 10 and 10 and 10
i rated a 6 &amp;amp; a 5 this is not a division
sign this is just different different
columns or rows sorry so now this
Delilah rated it a three and that's all
Sherita cuz you only went there once
right so this is he rated it three times
i rated it twice she rated it once now
if we were to find the max of these the
answer would be 10 you see because we
used the max function and then we use
the column so here's a column one of the
columns stores us or our name or our ID
something to refer to us one of the
other columns stores our ratings but if
we have more than one rating it goes
into a new row you've learned that from
your normalization we can't just have
multiple things within a single entry so
this is basically a new row for each one
of these see like this oops yeah this
would come out as one two three four
five six rows one three of them would
refer to me the sorry James two of them
referred to me if we gave least function
and put in the ratings the result would
be three you see but now if we were to
group these so we can actually at the
end
we could say group buy so we would say
let me just right now select then we're
going to select our ID select ID comma
and then max then within parenthesis we
would have select the max rating from
where are we getting it from we are
getting it from the ratings table from
ratings group by and then we would say
group by our ID so right now what this
will do is it will actually separate
this into three sections that's why I
drew like this with the end result we
would get an imaginary new part of the
table that would give the max for each
person so the max here would be 10 the
max here would be 6 and the max here of
the 3 that's how a group by works it
doesn't worry about everything together
it worries about everything related to
another column for example in this case
group buying the I'm grouping by the ID
you see what this means is it's going to
take all the duplicate IDs and crunch
them into a new entry and then find the
grit max or least or the average for all
of those specific IDs okay so my camera
batteries just died and like out of the
blue it didn't even give me a warning
usually it'll say like battery low which
gives me like an hour but no this is
like dead so hopefully I didn't miss
anything
but basically what I wanted to say it's
in order to find how many times a person
voted you can use the count function
with a group body because counting will
count the columns and the group by will
tell you how to group them so we use
count
and in parentheses you can say the
ratings because that's what we're
wanting to count how many times this
restaurant has been rated so in here we
put the ratings these are the ratings
here are the IDs and then we can say
from what table and then we can say
group by by and then how are we going to
group them ID so we want them hunched
down into the IDs so group by by what
are they called customers yes cust over
hi so we're counting the ratings and
we're grouping them by the customer IDs
what this will do is it will take this
one two three it counts them counted
them so what will what will end up
looking like is this the idea of one one
has braided three times
i D of two has raided twice and the ID
of three has rated one time that is how
a group I will work
so James of rated three times I wrote
rated twice and delilah rated once so
that is how to use a group by with an
aggregate function and in the next video
I will be speaking of something awesome
so I will see you then and please I
don't know why I do that I'm like
I'm sorry distracted
but anyways see me the next video please
click like and subscribe and I'll see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
