ahead of time if the lighting has been
getting worse and worse i io 'the to
finish at least the first 30 videos
recording them tonight so it's getting a
little dark by that I mean it's
pitch-black out but that's ok we're
moving on to a topic and this is really
cool because this is like not only
useful in machine learning but in so
many areas of computer science and that
is the data structure trees so trees are
a type of data structure and a data
structure is just a way to store data a
tree is pretty interesting and it is
basically a very foundational piece of
machine learning and decision-making so
to make a tree we start with these crazy
shapes in computer science we call them
circles and you have these lines between
the circles ok so the actual technical
name for these circles are notes so you
can have what we call the root node
which is the one at the very top and we
call these you know child nodes but it's
all relative so a child node can also be
a parent node and what that means is it
also has children like so and you can
have as many nodes as you like there are
specific types of trees specifically
binary trees where you can't have three
nodes you can only have 0 1 or 2 but
we're just talking about general trees
here so it's okay to have multiple nodes
I'm not gonna go into all the rules for
trees and the different types but there
is a lot of information out there on
trees so if you want to know tons of
detail I'm sure it's out there probably
the most important nodes in this tree
are what are known as leaf nodes so the
leaf nodes are the nodes at the very end
in this case these are the leaf nodes so
the leaf nodes are the end of the tree
and usually contain the information we
are looking for so when we get into
making these trees the information
inside of this node for example is going
to be very important whereas these nodes
are going to contain
information on how to get to this node
this is like the end result and this is
kind of like the path to get there and
that is the way we're going to represent
it in this specific situation but in
other uses of trees they might use the
nodes for different things like for
example these might not be a
representation of the path to get to the
leaf nodes they might be data themselves
so yeah guys that is a brief
introduction to trees no is very brief
but the most important part is that you
understand just the basics in the next
video we're going to be talking about a
very specific type of tree called a
decision tree and that is what we're
going to be using in machine learning
please be sure to check that out and
please be sure to subscribe thank you
and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
