video we're going to be talking about
big concepts of partials and overtones
as well as fundamental frequencies so
this words may be foreign to you and if
so that's okay because I'm going to be
breaking these down so basically to draw
it out when we have a sound let's just
represent it with a sine wave here it's
not just one frequency so let's say this
is 440 Hertz we may be having sounds of
let's say 880 Hertz or to 20 Hertz or
anything really close to that
this gives makes a sound very complex
which allows us to distinguish between
different instruments that's why a piano
doesn't sound like a guitar and a guitar
doesn't sound like a piccolo which
doesn't sound like a cello which doesn't
sound like a violin which doesn't sound
like a trumpet which doesn't sound like
a clarinet which doesn't sound like a
what thankfully it doesn't sound like
clarinet no escape man clarinet players
you cool too doesn't sound like a drum
doesn't sound like a I can't think of
any other instruments so yeah things get
very complex they're not just one
frequency you have multiple frequencies
that have something in common that allow
us to hear it as one sound this goes
back to the idea of frequency masking
it's hard for our brain to distinguish
two sounds that are very similar so
let's say this is twice as fast as this
one this is 440 and this is 880 well
that means this vibrates twice for every
time this vibrates once that that's an
octave and octaves sound very similar
and consonants so yeah that's India
frequency masking we can't distinguish
the difference between different
frequencies that are have a lot in
common so that's the idea of frequency
medicine now what's a fundamental
frequency this is the frequency that we
name it it's the main frequency so just
like we said 440 Hertz this is the
fundamental frequency it may also have
an 80 Hertz or to 20 Hertz
typically this is the loudest one and it
is the one we hear these ones are going
to be much more quiet and we're not
going to be able to distinguish now
thanks to frequency masking so that is
the fundamental frequency now we have
these two terms here which we are going
to define okay so we're gonna do
partials and red overtones and blue
let's define these well we oftentimes
have multiples or very close multiples
of the fundamental frequency so let's
say the fundamental frequency is 10 just
to make things very simple then over a
partial is any thing having to do with
the sound any extra frequency so as I
said oftentimes we have multiple
frequencies to create the sound a
partial is any any frequency that is
used to make the entire sound so let's
say we may have a twenty we may have a
forty you may have an eighty we may even
have like a 65
let's go 85 this is a I just said I was
gonna do partials in red and I'm writing
them in blue how steep for me so
Parcells we may have 10 I may have them
in 20 we're gonna have them 40 80 or
even 85 maybe rice these blue ones here
an overtone is any above the fundamental
frequency but does not include the
fundamental frequency so partial is any
frequency creating the maiden sound an
overtone is any frequency except the
fundamental frequency so most often
these will be multiples of the
fundamental frequency so let's say the
fundamental frequency is 10 that means
this is the first overtone 2048 e these
are overtones
these are partials we're here and often
times we have names from first partial
second partial third partial fourth
partial and so forth
so let me make a little graph here we
could have four partials so we can have
the fundamental frequency ten this is
the first partial all right now we have
a multiple of that 20 this is the second
partial this is also the first overtone
forty this is the third partial 2nd
overtone 80 would be the fourth partial
third over ten 165th for partial fourth
overtone so as you can see there's this
pattern where this one is always one
lower than this one so that is a very
confusing thing many beginner musicians
do not comprehend and then they get
confused partials include the
fundamental frequency overtones do not
so you have to remember that distinction
so if you're saying fourth overtone
that's the fifth partial so that's
really all I have to say about partials
and overtones and next video I'm going
to be taking this concept adding a
little bit more and then completing the
whole thought process everything makes
sense and if you want to support me be
