will be talking about the proper way to
draw musical notes so we have a staff
which has five lines now when we write
music we will often see notes with a
line above them this is called the stem
but when I'm representing pitches I
often just leave it as a circle well
that's not a hundred percent proper but
to represent pitches it works fun now we
need to have a proper way to draw the
circle of a note it's actually slighted
a tiny bit like that and then this
sometimes will be filled in sometimes
will be Hollow and then we have the stem
which goes up or down depending on where
you're at on the staff typically
anything on the second space or lower
the stem will go up so if we have a note
here instead we'll go up but that is not
a set rule and you can change that for
example I'm a percussionist and almost
all of our notes go straight up because
if they're not it's weird but I don't
know maybe they are maybe some people do
that I'm anyways so anything down here
is good typically going to go up
anything on the lawn this line or up
here is going to go down and notice how
the stem is on the opposite side so from
the middle line the stem actually goes
down not up that's weird but that's just
how I do it so you often see the notes
flippin sides and doing all kinds of 360
tricks and stuff but don't worry about
too much now you know how it works
there's another thing sometimes I have
no clue why I just drew that I meant to
draw a line and then draw us
stick a droid okay here's a note on a
line sometimes you will see something
like this that right there is called a
flag I believe so you can have multiple
flags or you can have them connected to
other notes for example like this here
is the flag even though it's not really
a flag anymore this is sort of like a
flag I guess I don't even know why it's
called flag I guess it looks like a flag
who knows and then sometimes we have
notes that look like this not really
more like this I'll get into that later
try to draw an eighth note which a
horrible life but yeah now that you know
the proper area for the stem to point
either up or down and also which side it
goes on if it's going up it's on the
right if it's going down it's on the
left and there's also the term the stem
which I mean the flag which is that
little thing that goes over it so I'll
see you in the next video which will be
really fun so you better be there thank
you goodbye right
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
