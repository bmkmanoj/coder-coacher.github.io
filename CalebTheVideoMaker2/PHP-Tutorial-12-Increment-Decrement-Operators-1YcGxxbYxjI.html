video about incrementing and
decrementing I believe it's pronounced
so in programming you will often see
plus signs which is the addition
operator but then you often you will see
two in a row
which is the increment operator and I
will be teaching you what this means you
may also see two minus signs in a row
what this will do is increase or
decrease a value by one so let's go
through an example alright we have a
variable money alright and just to
represent my bank account this is going
to be equal to zero
so money has a value of zero now what we
can do is we can use the increment so
let's say I get paid for a month's worth
of work I can say money plus plus well
now the value of money is going to be
one make sense or I could have said - -
which then it would be negative one all
right so so far we know is if we put
either two minus signs or two plus signs
after the word the variable name it's
going to increment or decrement it I saw
you pronounce that d Kerman I don't know
anyways well this is very common so you
should understand this there is another
thing you will need to know though and
that's if you put the plus or minus
signs before it so what if I say money
with two plus signs before it versus two
plus signs after it well the main
difference is that this one is let's say
we're echoing this phrase out so echo is
just a way to present it to the browser
echo money plus plus well what this is
going to do is it's going to echo money
so money is going to be echoed right
then so what does money equal it equals
zero so it's going to say zero and then
it's going to increment it but if
instead instead of doing this one we do
this one so you say echo plus plus money
well now it's going to increment it and
then it's going to echo it does that
make sense
so this one is going to echo it first
and then increment it this one's going
to increment it and then echo it so what
will the results of this be well at the
start of our program the variable money
has the value 0 we echo out money so
we're going to get a zero and then it
increments money to one so money is
equal to one now now we're going to echo
increment money so now money is equal to
two and then we're going to echo money
so now we're going to get o2 the reason
we have both of those is because we're
echoing here and then we're echoing here
so let's say just to try things out I
take away this increment so all we have
right now is this echo money just like
that what's going to be sent to the
browser is a zero that's pretty simple
to understand because that's the value
money was assigned well if we say
money plus a plus well now what's going
to be sent to the browser still zero
that's because we're echoing money and
then right after we echo it we're
incrementing it so the echoing comes
first so zero goes to the browser but
down here the value of money is 1 so the
value of not something over the value of
money is 1 but what gets sent to the
computer or what gets sent to the
browser is 0
just to explain this one more time why
it's like this it's because of money the
original value of money so this points
back to this and says oh okay the value
is zero we're going to echo that back to
the browser so this down here is the
browser and the person sees zero and
then after we just finish that so that's
done we stopped increment it so this is
going to go back to the original value
and create it to be one because we're
adding 1 to it so now money has the
value of 1 so let's try this again
money we assign it 12 and then we say
let go
plus plus money just like this what is
going to be sent to the screen what do
you think that's what I thought too
indeed it will be 13 that's because
we're echoing but before we get to the
actual variable we have to increment at
first because the increment comes first
so this goes back changes 12 to 13 well
it doesn't go actually change our code
but in the system's memory it will be
replaced with 13 rather than 12 so now
money has the value 13 well then once we
retrieve this variable oh it's not 12
any longer now it's 13 so that gets sent
as 13 so one more example here I'm just
gonna erase everything so it's clear
money is equal to 12
okay we're going to
I go money man we're going to echo money
plus plus and then finally we're going
to echo money again so how is this going
to work well the first ones are pretty
easy it's going to retrieve the value of
money points back
oh it's 12 so a 12 is going to be sent
to the browser okay well now we're going
to echo money again echo money so
another 12 is being sent to the browser
so this is done and this is done now we
have to increment it so money now has
the value 13 rather than 12
once we echo money again we get 13
so hopefully that clearly demonstrates
incrementing and obviously decrementing
is pretty much the same way except it
goes down and spit it up so if this is
money - - it would be 12 12 11 pretty
simple so those are two very important
things you will need to know about in
PHP and another way to think about it is
if it's confusing you still just think
of it like this money equals 12
now we're reassigning money to the value
of money plus one so how is this going
to work
well money plus one that's going to be
13 and then it the money the original
variable the value it's assigned it
points to the new one of 13 so money
equals money plus one it's pretty much
the same thing
money plus plus so that's the basics of
incrementing and decrementing pretty
much it's not even really the basics
that's like everything you need to know
about it this will often be used for
loops and I know we haven't learned
about that much but it can be used a
certain amount of times so let's say oh
you want to stop a loop in a program
once it's been done 70 times well each
time it's been done we can we can have a
encounter and every single time it goes
through the program we can increment
counter up one until it reaches 70 which
then the program will stop and we'll be
getting into that shortly so basically
we're just learning the very basics of
programming concepts so that way once we
get into more advanced PHP programming
everything seems to make sense so I know
this is a long video to explain a very
simple topic but thank you for sticking
for for it sticking through it and I'll
see you in the next video please please
