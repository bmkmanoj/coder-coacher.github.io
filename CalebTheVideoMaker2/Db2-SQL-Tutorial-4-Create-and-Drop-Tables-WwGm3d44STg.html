video maker - this video is going to be
a pretty simple video on how to create
tables and drop tables so when we're
talking about deleting tables we use the
keyword drop not delete so they are both
keywords in SQL so you got to make sure
you understand the difference drop is
part of the structure so if you drop a
table you are getting rid of it from the
structure delete on the other hand is
used for data and that's to delete data
from a table just a little tip there so
you understand the difference so we are
going to start with creating a table now
because we're just starting and we don't
have a lot of SQL skills under our belt
I am going to paste a little script in
here and then just explain it rather
than type everything from scratch so
here's an example of how you create a
table we are creating a table called
users and this syntax is very simple you
just say create table and then the name
of the table and then inside of
parentheses is all of the columns that
you're going to put in the table then
you end the statement with a semicolon
this allows you to go put more
statements after this statement each one
of these here is a column and the syntax
is the name of the column followed by
the data type which is just what kind of
data we want to store in that column
overall the statement is pretty simple
so if you're having any issues I think
over time you'll just kind of get used
to the way we write SQL once you have
the statement finished you can hold
control and press s even on a Mac and
okay we have an issue let's figure out
what it is I bet you it's because I
already created this table at one point
so I will give you a sneak peak and show
you how to drop tables just like that
alright I ran that and you could see it
worked now let's go back and create this
table and you can see that worked if you
ever do have an error you can click this
little arrow and let me just expand this
a bit so you can see you can click this
little log button and that's going to
give you some more information where you
can learn about this error and that will
open a web browser when it loads it's
going to open the IBM db2 Doc's
specifically for Linux UNIX and windows
you got to be careful when you open any
document pages on the Internet to make
sure you're on the right version of db2
so let's go back and let's just learn a
little bit more the first thing is that
SQL is not space sensitive the more
technical term is it's not whitespace
sensitive so white spaces include tabs
spaces and enters so you can structure
this however you like and it's going to
work just the same so just to show you
this I'll drop the table then I'll rerun
this create table statement with all the
extra whitespace and you can see it
still runs now there's obviously some
rules to this you can't split key words
like this and anytime you're dealing
with something like a string any extra
spaces in here are going to be part of
that string so it doesn't always work
that way it just depends on the context
if you are writing SQL and you're not
dealing with splitting words or strings
then everything should be fine and you
can structure it however you like so if
you prefer everything to be on one line
go right ahead as a sneak-peek towards
the future when we start talking about
primary keys you're often going to have
one column designated as the primary key
and that is a special column that is
always going to be unique and determines
how the table is stored so if you make
this ID column the primary key when you
go and get the data from the table it's
going to be sorted by the ID so to make
something the primary key it's really
super easy you just add in here primary
key now there is one other thing you
need to do and that is label it as not
null so that means you're not allowed to
have nulls nulls are the absence of
values so when we say not in all we're
literally just saying every single row
has to have a value so let me drop this
table and recreate it with the primary
key there we go so now if we go to
administer and then tables we should be
able to find our user table there you go
and you can see it's part of the db2
instance schema so I didn't specify a
schema so it just defaulted to db2
instance if I wanted to specify a schema
I would just preface my table with a
name of a schema so let's go to the
users and then we can go to columns we
can see all of the columns and their
data types we can also look at the data
and you can see that there's nothing in
here so yeah guys that is your
introduction on
creating and dropping tables hopefully
that was helpful and in the next video
we'll be doing something else that will
also be extremely exciting so be sure to
check that out and thank you for
