it very well so that's the ideas you can
cover up these quiet sounds with these
loud sounds that's the idea of temporal
masking our brain is not good by hearing
a loud sound boom and then right after
that is hearing a very but if you space
them far enough to where the boom quiet
down quiets down then you can hear the
quiet sound this is a big important
factor in data what's it called
just like mp3 what's called encoding so
yeah we can actually lower the file
sizes of certain songs and sounds and
such because if we have a really loud
noise and then a really quiet one and we
can't hear that quiet one we can
actually delete it and lower the file
size so that is how we can get different
encoding s-- mp3 shoot i'm really
pathetic at this TI FF the windows media
WMA yeah so that is the idea of temporal
masking another big concept is frequency
masking which is to say when to some
vibrations are going at one time it's
hard to hear them both at the same time
it sounds like one sound to us that
sound can be good or it can be bad if
they're very different we can usually
single one out and listen to it but if
they're very similar it's almost
impossible for example if I'm playing
440 Hertz and eight acres at the same
time all we really hear is a giant a you
may hear a little bit of loudness and a
little bit of Highness but they both
sound it just sounds like one egg we
don't hear okay that's an a that's an a
this concept also comes in handy when
forming ports so if we have C E and G
well the relation between these
vibrations are similar to where we only
hear one sound
and that's AC major chord we don't hear
it okay see eg I can tell they're trying
to do something with these three sounds
no they kind of go together but we still
can kind of hear a difference if you
listen very closely you may be able to
hear the individual pitches so when we
have something such as c plus a c-sharp
well these calls extreme amounts of
dissonance because they're so close and
they just sound bad so this we can
actually kind of tell that there's a
pitch here and a pitch here and it
doesn't come together as one sound
that's the idea of distance it doesn't
work together to create one sound
it goes against each other to create
this argument or something to be
resolved by pushing it back together
into one sound so that's the idea when
we're moving forward in a song we don't
want it to be like oh this sounds nice
it's the same thing over and over again
we may get some some other frequencies
going these are frequencies by the way
and they're all like whoa so they're
both going and then oh no it sounds
sounds almost bad but it still sounds
good it's just it's unpleased like I
wouldn't want the song to end right now
but then boom boom they have a little
battle and bam they become one sound and
we end on the tonic so that was really
weird of example but that's basically
like going from C to g7 that g7 is sort
of like the extra extra vibration that
confuses listeners and makes something
wanting to be resolved and then once we
go from the g7 back to the C it's like a
whole new level of clearness in our
brain to where it sounds very pleasant
so we can make songs sound good by
adding a little bit of this not pleasant
sounding notes together hopefully that
makes sense but that's the idea of
frequency masking it's basically just
the idea that it's hard to hear multiple
frequencies at once last one I have one
here is localizing this is a good one
I'm actually going to draw for this
because
I think it'd be fun so localizing what
is local is not localizing it's the idea
that we are able to figure out where a
sound is coming from so there's two ways
we can do this it has to do with time
and loudness and this is very useful
because we have two ears which really
helps us to figure out where sounds are
coming from for example let me just let
me just show you here here's my head
right sorry for the funky shadows trying
out this new lighting system not because
I need better little not because I don't
know why I'm doing just so you can see
better because I feel it's a little too
dark although it's adding these really
funky shadows and I don't like them so I
don't know what to do plus it's like 600
degrees and I have lights over there
there there there there there's it's
really not even helping so I don't know
what to do anyways okay um I'm ADHD you
know up right now focus here's my head
let's say I have a drum over here and
someone hits it the sound is traveling
this direction hits my ear and then it
takes longer for the sound to travel
over here and hit this ear because
obviously this ears closer also it's not
quite as loud because my big fat head
blocks most of the sound sounds can
bounce off walls and stuff and reach my
head in multiple different ways my ear
over here but it's not as loud because
the direct sound boom hits my ear kind
of like fades out and then hits my other
ear and it's not quite as loud you can
barely even tell the difference but our
brain is able to focus in on these
little differences of volume and time to
allow us to figure out where sound is so
you hear sound and our brain tells us
okay it hit this year first it's louder
in this ear first not first well it's
louder in this year so it's this
direction or it's that direction or it's
not over there so let me draw us out of
it alright let's have this guy here his
name is Jim Jim Jim Jackson I just I
I couldn't think of anything I'm not
some dumb name well unless you're named
Jim Jackson it's a cool name I'm just I
just couldn't I don't know so here we
have this guy and here's this big head
he's super angry I guess let's make him
angry all right yeah let's say he he
forgot to clean his room he's just a
little boy he's he's a little boy he is
11 years old
right and his mom is over here rah rah
rah rah rah rah screaming Adam and stuff
clean your room
actually let's make his dad it looks
more like a man clean your room and
these vibrations go everywhere and
here's his ear big-eared as you can tell
it's bigger so I'm gonna show the right
ear with red these vibrations can come
over here a bounce off the wall here and
hit his ear still although it's slower
so it takes more time barely any time at
all because this feet remember sound
travels 100 1000 130 feet per second
that's like that's really fast I mean
not like light speed fast but that's
fast so yeah we can actually interpret
that also it's not going to be as loud
because all these main waves are here
blew out again always main waves right
here they're getting blocked by his head
and then all these other waves are
reaching his ear so the loudness over
here may be up here but the loudness
over here may only be up to here so it
can use that Intel master our brain
recognition of where sounds are coming
from so that is pretty much the entire
idea of this concept and all those other
concepts so this is a bit more of a
different video than all the other ones
and I'm going to be getting into a
little bit more with this kind of stuff
because I think it's cool and it'll help
when your understanding with music and
sound combining those together because
it's not all about live sound you may
have some with recording may also need
to understand how we hear sound exactly
to get the best
sounding music so that's all I have to
say in this video
it was 17 minutes and 10 seconds so I
might cut it into two videos I don't
know yet so I'm just gonna stop talking
now if you want to support me be sure to
subscribe check out my social networks
and all my other cool links and stuff
down here in the description yeah so
yeah if you need help with anything
check out my Facebook page send me a
message I'll do my best to help so I'll
leave a comment telling me any
suggestions like this video and share
the series with a friend because that's
really what I would like you to do in
