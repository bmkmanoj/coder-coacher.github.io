wanted to talk a little bit more about
borders we're almost done now so and i
are probably sick and tired of borders
but i'm going to we showed i've showed
you a lot of border properties border
style width color radius shadow so forth
i'm going to showing you the actual
order property it's just border so what
does the border do well it combines some
of these into one property declaration
and it makes things a lot easier so if
you look here we have the border width
10 pixels for example and we also have
the style double and the color red well
blue i'm sorry i was looking at this
border so i'm going to show you how to
combine these into one thing so first we
can say how thick do we want the border
well we say five pixels and then what
kind of border let's go double again i
like it and then what color let's go
cyan and then we can save that and
refresh alright so it kind of got rid of
some of our other settings by overriding
them that's okay so this is pretty much
just like english if you look at it and
you read it order we want a five pixel
double cyan border so that is how you
can read that and remember it so I could
say border on a 20 pixel black Wow guys
completely fail solid black border and
this is what we get so that's how you
can declare border properties so just
like all the other border properties we
can do like border left for example
which will just affect the left border
so we can make some pretty cool shapes
and stuff and whatnot
but I'm just going through some examples
here dash I don't know if that's daunted
pretty sure that's one yeah there we go
and that looks kind of cool so cool wait
yep we could also go order top 10 pixels
solid red border little right 0 pixels
the reason I have to put solid red or
anything is because if there's zero
pixels well it's not going to have a
style or color in fact I don't even need
the PX so i can say zero and then border
bottom say 40 dash here for the bottom
40 pixels double RGB all right I screwed
something up here help if I spell double
wrong I mean right double there we go
that is super cool so as you can see we
can still see the end of this almost
like there is a border even though we
decided to say there was no border well
this is because we have a shadow
property so when we have a shadow it
contrasts with the white of the comment
which makes it look like there is a
border so you can actually do that if
you don't want a border so zero just
like this all right so can get rid of
all of these alright so now we don't
really have a border and we can see at
the top
it looks like when I'm on the border but
as we go closer this way it looks like
we do have a border so you can actually
use a box shadow as I get fake Border
let's see 00 so this is going to put it
in the middle and then we could have the
fade pretty much do whatever we want
with it and now now we got some cool
comments with this cool shadow effect
but no border so if you think that looks
really cool then you might want to do
that or just offset it a little bit to
get like of order but not quite so now
you can see we have these comments that
look like they have a border but they
don't and actually I think that looks
pretty cool so I might keep it that way
I'm not too sure so yeah that's all I
really have to say about borders for now
and in the next video we are going to be
going over something new so hopefully
you're excited cuz I sure AM so I will
see you then thank you for watching
