already did this video a long time ago
you know I kind of stopped making videos
for a bit so wait Scott's been editing I
recorded the huge chunk videos and I've
been editing him over time and I was
editing this one I was like whoa this I
could teach it better so that's what I'm
going to try and do this is about time
signatures and specifically ones we
haven't seen yet so if you don't know
what a time signature is that's okay and
as you can tell i did get a new marker
this is one of my weaker ones i have a
whole bunch more so in the future videos
yeah if you think about it you're kind
of watching me in the future again
that's weird so in the next video it'll
be back into the past so yeah I am
getting new markers soon just so you
know and yeah so anyways we've seen what
what you may know as of 44 time also
known as common time and I am getting a
new marker there we go so 44 is common
time we have been measuring our measures
with this and I never really explained
what it was well this is known as a time
signature this tells us how many beats
are in a measure specifically this is
the type of beat this is how many so for
represents a quarter note so it's saying
whether we have four quarter notes and
we can change these numbers to give us
new types of measures
what if we were writing out our time
signature and we made a mistake we
accidentally put 3 / 4 well this would
actually change things and give us three
quarter notes per measure or bar
whatever you want to call it if you
don't remember what that is it's
basically just breaks up pieces of music
so it just makes it easier to read and
play and so forth so it'll look like
this and before we could have a eighth
notes in a measure well now we're only
going to be able to have six
one two three one two three one and two
and three and one if we had another
quarter note over here dudududu so that
is how this concept works that's what
the top number does so if we wanted we
could make this a six and now we could
have six quarter notes per measure so
this would only be one measure in its
entire self and you basically put any
number you want on the top the bottom is
a little more little more limited though
another option you may see on the bottom
is a to this tells us that the note we
are using is a half note just as in a
fourth or a quarter note we can use a
half or a two so now what if we have 2
over 2 well two half notes that's what
this is telling us to half two half
notes per measure that's the same thing
as 4 over 4 18 when it comes to how much
we can fit in one measure because two
half notes guess what that's the
equivalent of four quarter notes so
these are very similar this is almost
like this the only difference is is on
the how many beats are in a measure so
444444 that's hard to say that's like
four that's like three fours too bad we
have one more and then we'd have four
fours but anyways for over four that has
four beats it's this top number 2 over 2
has two beats because the top number but
we can both fit the same amount they
both fit the same amount of notes in one
measure so what's the difference well
this is known as common time this is
known as cut time because basically at
half as many beats so let's
day to the concept of conducting if
someone's conducting a marching band I'm
going skits back a little more yeah I
don't you see my house that's weird I
here we are so pretend I'm a conductor
I'm not really I'm pretty bad at it
actually they'd go one two three four
those are the people like a wave their
hands in the front of the band or
whatever one two three four now for a
cup time we're only going to use two one
two three four 1234 1234 or 1313 so that
is the difference less beats same amount
of counts so we have two terms beats
counts these are not the same thing
counts are something we use to keep the
beat the beat is the consistent clicking
or tapping or whatever you want whatever
is consistent so counts commute is
usually bigger than the amount of beats
we have for example if we are counting
quarter notes and then we go into eighth
notes
what's the beat the beat are the
coordinates the counts are the eighth
notes because if you go back if you
remember the topic of subdivision if you
don't remember what that is go back a
couple of videos the proper way to count
this to allow us to play this the best
would be one and two and three and four
and one and two and we're counting the
quarter notes as eighth notes we're only
playing the beats on the beats one two
three four the counts are eighth notes
one and two and make sense maybe not
maybe I don't know but when we get into
the concept of time signatures all you
gots to know is that for four as for
beats 22 as two beats four fours beats
are coordinates to tues beats are half
notes or comment I'm cut so they're
pretty much the same thing now another
thing is when we're talking about beats
per minute you'll often see this little
quarter note equals 60 for example this
is saying there are 60 beats per minute
and a half time the equivalent would be
30 because half notes take up twice the
amount of time so we'd have 30 in a
minute rather than 60 in a minute that's
if you want them to stay the same whoops
or is it 2 3 4 3 13 I don't actually
know if that's 60 but that's just what
I'm trying to explain so yep
pull stuffing out that's the difference
between cuttin comment and just in case
you don't understand still let's let's
do a little overview just real quick
when we are designing time signatures I
have a bottom number this is what gets
the beat this up here is how many so
let's try something new let's put a one
down here now a whole note gets to beat
how many do we want let's go on now we
have a 10 note per beat her now we have
one whole note per measure and the whole
note gets the beat so it be one two
three two two three four how you count
that that's up to you you can go one two
orion go one two three four two two
three four three two three four four two
three four basically each whole note is
a measure and we give each one of these
four quarter note counts in this case
for one beat that means we're deciding
to count in quarter notes one two three
four two two three four three so forth
well we don't have to count them in
coordinates we can count of nathan's we
can go one and two and three and four
and two and two three and four and three
and two and three and four and four and
two and three and four and one that is
the counts so that's completely
different than up here this doesn't tell
us how to count it counting is in our
brain that's something we do
I don't think that explained anything
any better than what I tried the first
time but worth my effort saw shall see
you in the next video goodbye
