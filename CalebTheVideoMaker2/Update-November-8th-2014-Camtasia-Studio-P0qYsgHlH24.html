I have some really awesome news to share
with you guys all right so i just bought
camtasia studio your Brides probably
like oh ok well that's awesome because i
bought it fully by donations received
from other youtubers who have supported
me and that is so so awesome because i
honestly would not have been able to get
that program without all of your help
it's awesome so thank you guys and gals
who have donated and also to everyone
who has supported me here on YouTube
it's awesome to see that kind of stuff
happening and it's also awesome and I'm
way using the word awesome too much but
anyways it's awesome because I no longer
have to live off of free trials and
generic programs not that the programs
i've been using aren't working but I
decided I wasn't going to mess around
with free trials or anything anymore so
I've been using camstudio and windows
movie maker which is just like asking
for trouble because they always seem to
mess up you can't do anything fancy and
just it's limiting me to what I want to
do so now that i have a new program i'm
going to be making a couple more new
videos giving an introduction to that
program for other people who want to
know a bit about it so for those of you
who don't know camtasia is a program
that you can use to record your screen
as well as audio and webcam which works
sometimes and you can use it also as a
video editor because as a built-in video
editing software so i'll be able to take
videos that are your cord on the screen
edit those and also they would put these
videos and use that as my primary editor
rather than Windows Movie Maker so
that's going to cut my editing time in
half at least and it's going to improve
the quality of my videos so guys that
means a lot to me it's truly a blessing
because I would not have been able to
get that without you which just makes it
makes me want to smile well I am smiling
but anyways I'm excited to release
better content new content guys if you
have any suggestions let me know and
thank you all too
I've donated to have doing it thank you
all to who dang thank you to all of you
who have donated into all of those who
watch my videos I appreciate all of the
support i'm not sure if you guys want me
to give you shout shout shout outs or
not so i'm not going to say anybody's
name or business or whatever but i would
not be i would be willing to do that so
thank you again and I will go I'll see
you guys in the next video thanks for
everything guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
