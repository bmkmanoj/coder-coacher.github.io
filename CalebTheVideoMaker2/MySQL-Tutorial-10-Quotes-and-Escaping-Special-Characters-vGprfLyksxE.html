in this story I'll be talking about
strings and quotes bunch of other cool
stuff so let's get started
basically when you have a string which
is just a bunch of characters which if
you don't remember characters just like
a letter so B that's a character same
with two and the a sign which sounds
horrible question mark those are all
characters when you quote these it
becomes a string so okay this is a
quoted string and these are all
characters ca leb now you insert
whatever the string is within double
quotes and if you don't I mean there are
single quotes which look like that which
on the keyboard little feet straight up
so we have double quotes and in single
quotes so I can put Caleb up here dragon
put Caleb down here the same thing um
but what happens if let's say you have
single quotes here and you have they are
cool which is a contraction a
combination of they are which they're
cool this is a problem here because my
school will look through this and go oh
we can see this especially quilt in
America we're starting a string so we
have a quotation mark first character
second character third character fourth
character and then another quotation
mark so this is the string day that's
not what we wanted we wanted their cool
so a way around this is to use double
quotes and put there and the reason
behind this is MySQL look Oh double
quote we're starting a a string so look
through all these characters and then
I'll get to this single quote and you
can't close a double quote oh man I'm
cutting it off you can't close a double
quote with another single quote you have
to close it with a double quote so we'll
actually include it and keep going up
until it gets to double quote and then
it will close the string so that's
pretty cool so but what happens if you
need to use single quotes and double
quotes within a quote it's a little
confusing
let's say we have their cool comma a
said double quotes hey period and then a
single quote so let's look at this MySQL
see this and it'll go all and I'll close
right there so let's change this to a
double quote and then close it with a
double quote it'll go all the way up
here and stop right here because it
encounters the first double quote so
what you need to do is call it escaping
it what you just put a backward slash
and then the double quote so from here
if you need to put double quotes within
a double quote it looked like this
now the reason with for this is it will
encounter this it'll keep going and I'll
see this and it will oh that's an escape
character and it will it'll ignore this
but it will keep it in a string so the
output will say they said double quote
hey
another escaping string with a double
quote it'll ignore that one and then
I'll go up to this quote so includes all
of this and the final output is with the
quotes hey you can't see that hey not
same concept with single quotes you need
to escape a single quote you just put a
backslash and then a single quote simple
as that there's a lot there's a bunch of
these escaping strings that you can do
and another one is what if you need a
backslash so you want to say I either
got $2 or 3 two-thirds in I got 2/3 2/3
of a PI just okay just 2/3 right quilt
that so then it'll go and I'll say oh
it's an escaping character and it will
escape three which doesn't even do
anything so what this will do it'll come
out as two three double quoted just like
that which you don't want that so you
need to insert this backslash by
doubling back slashes so in the end
we'll have an old quote - backslash
backslash three so this will go through
here
MySQL Oh a - let's keep that Oh an
escape string or escape character and
then it will look at the next character
and it will escape it which means it
just makes a normal character so that
that's so far we'd have two forward
slash and then the next character three
with the final result
two-thirds I'm gonna keep cutting us off
two-thirds there we go
and the reason I tell of this camera is
because the light over there kept me
and these blue bars across my video is
making me mad and I don't know how to
fix it so but I want that light on
because it makes it bright in here so
yeah that's just escaping strings and
there's some other ones including this
one backslash n which gives you a new
line so if you want to say hey by Caleb
well the first thing you'd see is this
as this is a single quote so it'd be
easier to make double quotes up here ah
then put a then the new line this is a
escaping the end which makes this is
this this right here makes a new line
hey and then you put I'm new line and
then Caleb just like that so then the
end result is hey I'm Caleb because if
you insert this right here into the
string it T it takes it as a new line so
when you see when you write that it
doesn't come out and the string is that
it comes out as a new line so this
translates into MySQL has a new line I
said like 400 times but I hope that
makes sense so far we have a backward
slash double quote backward slash
forward quote I mean single quote
backward slash backward slash backward
slash backward slash then we had
backward slash n so this will escape
that to put it in the string this will
escape that and put it in the string
this will put this in the string and
this together will make a new line
another one is backslash T and this will
actually put a tab and if you don't know
what that is it's basically a big space
so you would tab um you'd tab it's like
right up right below the little squiggly
thing on your keyboard on top left but
that's the matter of you hit tab and
it's sort of like an indent so you're
writing a paragraph and B like this
you'd put a tab right here right there
there's also one such as backward slash
underscore and backward slash % which
are used for comparisons but you don't
need to know that right now because I
haven't taught you that so that is this
Adamic that was what I need to show you
in this video in the next video I'll be
explaining everything about MySQL and
I'll put it in plain English so you know
exactly how it works then after that
we're going to be installing xampp or
exam whatever example whatever you want
to call it uh and we'll start
programming with MySQL so I hope to see
you there because it's gonna be awesome
and I hope you're excited I am see ya I
need a drink of water so I'll see you
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
