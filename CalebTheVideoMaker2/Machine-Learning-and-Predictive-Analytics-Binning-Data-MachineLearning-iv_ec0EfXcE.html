are going to be talking about binning
this is a process where we take
continuous data and convert it to
categorical so we start with the
continuous features such as age and we
convert that into a categorical feature
such as age range so essentially you can
think of having multiple bins and you
can label bins by some grouping okay so
the grouping is totally up to you but
let's say we group these in tens we
might have a 30s 40s 50s 60s and 70s all
we have right now is 50 30 and 70 so I'm
only putting these up here but you would
been for every single group of tens then
you can just visualize taking these
values and putting them in these bins
and then what your new data is is what
bin each one of these goes into and this
is very interesting it's a very
important process in machine learning
but I find it interesting because
generally people in computer science
don't like to lose data ever well once
you lose data or change something it's
very hard to go back to what you had so
this is actually a destructive process
unless you keep this data separate and
just copy over the values otherwise you
are going to actually destroy these
values and lower the usefulness of the
individual data so you got to be very
careful here so to illustrate this we
are going to write the new values you
can see there's actually a loss of
information by going from continuous to
categorical we now no longer have the
ones position for these values which it
seems like why would that help us at all
we actually lost information but the
information becomes much more useful so
why is this more useful than this what
we actually do binning
all of the time even in our head we just
might not think about it it I'll give
you an example let's say we have this
guy here whoa
movin up I'm up two 2d drawings now I
guess I've always been on 2d drawings
but no longer stick figures okay and I
tell you this guy is 56 does that tell
you anything and by the way let's think
of the context of predicting whether
he's likely to have diabetes or not okay
well it doesn't really tell us a whole
lot but in your head you might go
through some processing and say huh this
guy you know this guy is greater than 50
and according to our data people over 50
are more likely to have diabetes for
example that might vary depending on
your data in this example though 50 and
older are much more likely to have
diabetes sorry guys if you're over 50
okay now this makes sense we're starting
to get information by losing information
we Bend this guy in our head into a
category once we have categories we can
predict what's going to happen for
individuals see that that's starting to
make sense so if you can take your data
group it and then see the end result for
those groups that's going to be more
effective to drag this home one more
time if we just left it at 56 well then
the only thing that we could really do
is look at 56 year-olds what is what is
their chance of having diabetes that is
much harder to do and not nearly as
effective we do this in programming all
the time for example if you did
something like this here is an example
of Benning where you take an if
statement and you have two conditionals
if age is greater than 50 and age is
less than 60 that's saying age is
between 50 and 60 later on we're going
to learn a data structure called a
decision tree and this is going to show
how important categorical data really is
because this is going to branch a bunch
and the higher the cardinality the more
complex this decision tree is going to
get so
the less cardinality the more simple
things are going to be for machine
learning so hopefully that makes bending
nice crystal clear and that's all I got
for this video so please be sure to
subscribe to my channel and I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
