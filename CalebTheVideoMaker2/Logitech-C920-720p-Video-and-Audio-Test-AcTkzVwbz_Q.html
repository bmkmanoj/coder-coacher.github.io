the video maker and this is the Logitech
c920 Pro HD webcam that's quite the name
well I just want to do a little video
test for you to see this is the quality
I am recording with the camera this is
the audio from the camera so I'm not
recording this with anything else so if
you think it's good then the chances are
the camera quality is good and if you
think it's bad
chances are it's bad I wanted to do a
little test on focusing so the first
thing I did was write some wrote some
words just to see how quickly it can
focus and overall it focuses pretty
quickly and as I adjust it will refocus
and I can get pretty darn close so yeah
that's pretty much it that's touching
and that's pretty much as far as I can
go and you can still read it so the
focus is pretty good it does have an
option to turn auto focus off and you
can manually adjust it but for my
situation I don't think that's the best
option cuz I don't have time to do that
all day
here's another test just with a quarter
see if it'll focus on this and you can
see it does focus it's not quite as good
as the paper but you can see the United
States of America and god we trust' and
then quarter dollar almost so yeah
that's pretty good at focusing and it
does it pretty quickly as you can see
it's already focused back on me I'm you
do have some options with the logitech
webcam software to zoom in and readjust
the the location of the recorder
although I do not recommend this because
this is purely digital zooming in what
this means is it actually lowers the
quality of the video so let's just say
for an image you have a thousand pixels
total total and then you zoom in very
closely will all those other pictures
pixels around disappear so you you have
a less quality video
so what this means is if you really need
to zoom in with your video either take
the camera and move it closer or if
that's not going to work because it's
already recorded I would do it all after
you record it in a video editing
software this is because once you record
it zoomed in once you record it zoomed
in you cannot go back and change it and
zoom out it's permanently like that but
if you do it after the math you can undo
that zooming in and go back to the
original big view and not have to worry
about being too zoomed in too far for
that clip so you can also change the
resolution the max is 1080 I am
recording on 720 right now I guess I
didn't you realize I should have done
1080 but this is fine for this video
because I usually record in 720 anyways
you can go to advanced settings where
you can change the exposure gain
brightness contrast color intensity
white balance and you can adjust most of
these some of them have the option to do
auto such as white balance which that's
what it's on you have some anti flicker
content image orientation and some image
quality and some other stuff so then you
can save it and that pretty much sums up
everything you can do with this logitech
webcam software if you get a different
software you may be able to do different
things and obviously if you use a weaker
software you may not be able to get some
of the features with the Logitech
software for example you may just use a
system just to record your video and you
may not have all of the specific options
to zoom in and all that stuff so yeah
that's just an example of here's this is
a test video hopefully this is helpful
and I guess I can do some content in
1080p too so thank you for watching and
I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
