about it limit that's going to show 10
members now why did you choose those 10
members
that's not sure you know I don't even
know why you would choose just random 10
members so you needed something to make
this more useful and that would be you
would basically have it so it orders it
by a specific information so your last
name um if you want to order it by the
last name so you just put order by last
name Kayla would be at the top and um
like Bob of the up here John would be
down here and so on oops John that's
going to organize it and then you can
make it ascending or descending
so that'll flip which way it goes so
then Kayla will be down here and so
forth but all you really need to know is
you select the information use a where
clause to a describe up what is being
selected so we're the memberships that
is gold it's only the gold members and
then you can order it by the sign-up
date and then you can limit it to ten so
if I signed up in June somebody sign up
in August I'll be signed up first and
I'll be in the close I'll be closer to
the first members and the first ten
members get a prize for being such
dedicated members for so long so that's
just a great that's just a small example
the Select query and you'll see a lot
more of this and the next thing I'm
going to explain is a joint a joint is
pretty simple basically what a joint is
is taking results from one table and
results from another table and combining
them together and they usually usually
have like something related so for this
Jim let's say each member can post a
review about this Jim on their board or
on their website or something and only
one person only a person can only write
one review so each one will have like a
separate ID it'll only be assigned to
one
person so basically this would be set up
all right here's a good example here is
a my information to this gym my ID seven
my name is Caleb I don't have an add an
address written down and I don't have a
phone number my membership status is
bronze and my workout program is legs
I left a review by on their website that
says good gym on April 2nd now this this
will have a a comment ID so let's say
review ID 6 or 63 alright the 63rd
review says good gym on April 2nd and
it's by a member with the ID and 7 now
basically with a join I can take these
IDs and make a another table and from a
query which will have like Caleb so this
is who the message is by and then uh
then over here I will have the message
so as you can see I combined the name
over here and brought it down here and
that took the message from up here and
put it over here
and then you could also have this for
other people so John wrote a message of
cool gym and so forth all the water out
of this and the sky was this that's an
example of a joint by combining two
things from two different tables because
as you can see there's no message over
here it's over here on a different table
with a members ID a comment ID message
and the date so by simply taking this
putting it over here and this over here
you that's basically a joint alright
that's all for this tutorial and in the
next video guess what all being an
installing zamp and uh we will be
actually programming a database after
that so I hope you're ready because I am
so I might come back to the board and
write some other stuff if I need to I'm
not sure yet
so let me know what you prefer on the
computer or on the chalkboard I know the
sound quality sounds better with my
camera by far and I can actually like
point with things like my chalk I'm
hoping in the future to get a better
microphone and maybe like a tablet or
something I can write on that'll come up
on the screen that you can see now I can
like illustrate things out I actually
happen to use my camera all the time
alright so subscribe and I'll see you
later thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
