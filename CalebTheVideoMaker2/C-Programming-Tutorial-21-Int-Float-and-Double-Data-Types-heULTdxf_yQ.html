make it to this video we are going to be
talking about numeric data types now I
know we've talked about numeric data
types a little bit in fact I know I've
already taught you about int and also
double the other one that I wanted to
talk about is float if you haven't heard
of float it's very similar to double
with just a little bit of a difference
there are some other numeric data types
but they're basically just variations on
these three data types so it's very
important you get these three down and
then you can kind of just modify them a
little bit to figure out all the other
data types the very first one int it
stands for
integer and an integer is a whole number
so for example seven up seven six seven
eight nine ten those are all whole
numbers even like negative numbers
negative four negative three zero all of
those now the next to these you could
classify as floating-point numbers it
seems kind of odd because you see it has
this word float in it and it makes you
think it only applies to the float
datatype but actually both the double
and the float data types are considered
floating-point essentially what a
floating-point number is is anything
with a fractional part so for example
five point four six point eight three
point zero so this video is going to try
to familiarize you with all three of
these and also talk about some tricks
and tips and all that good stuff so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to open a
file we'll just create a new one we'll
name it
numeric data types dot C so we're in our
file and the three data types again just
so you have them here for reference are
int double and float so let's say you
wanted to store in a variable the number
of dogs you own which data type are you
going to want to use well you're
probably going to want to use int that's
because I highly doubt you have a
fractional part of a dog as a pet if so
that's that's is messed up so you could
do something like this int dogs
equals six so that one's pretty easy
when I
you want to have whole numbers or things
that can't be divided you will want to
use an int but when do you use double or
float they're pretty similar so it's
kind of hard to tell the difference well
if you're not sure err on the side of
using double double is considered the
more standard more accepted better
datatype of the two now there are
certain situations when to use float I
think it would be more clear if I
actually explained the difference let's
make a section for a floating point the
difference has to do with precision
think of precision is how much data the
thing can hold so if you have a value
nine nine nine nine nine point nine nine
nine nine nine nine nine this thing is
super precise then again if you have a
value like four I mean that's that's not
precise at all is this is four so the
difference between the two is that
double has double the precision that
means if you need to store a lot of
information you're probably going to
want to use the double data type let's
clear this junk out and then I will go
through an example showing you the
difference very clearly let's say we
want to print some values we need to
know the conversion characters for all
of these data types well the first is
percent I for an integer and we want
these in a string and then the second is
a percent F for floating point values
there's a little tip here I'm going to
talk about this more later but if you
pass in a float to this it becomes
double the function will actually
convert the float value to a double that
is another example of why we want to use
doubles more often is because they are
more standard there is a time when you
would want to use a float though and
that is if you're very very very low on
memory
that's because doubles take up twice as
much space so if you're on a very very
small device with very limited memory
you might want to use floats but for
basically every other computer
application you're going to want to use
doubles the fact that this becomes a
double also shows us why there's only
one conversion character no matter
whether we pass in a float or double
it's going to be outputted exactly
the same so we only need % F we don't
need % F for doubles and then % F for
floats it's the same so let's get rid of
some of these comments and now I'm going
to show you where floating point values
have their weaknesses so let's put a
comma here and let's pass in some values
I'm actually going to pass in a flow and
a double so let's add another % F and a
new line will pass in 1 1 point 1 1 1 1
and then we'll pass in 1 point 1 1 1 1
with a capital F which is to say hey
this is specifically a float let's save
this and run it and see the output
alright you can see that the output for
the integer is what we expected 1 and
the flow and the double output exactly
the same in this situation whether you
use float or double doesn't really
matter the output is exactly the same
but there are times when there are
differences for example let's go back
into our code and let's change the
numbers we're printing out let's change
this to a thousand one hundred and
eleven point one one one one oh now you
see some differences here the integers
just like we expected the double is what
we wanted but the flow is not what we
wanted this problem has to do with how
numbers are stored on computers they are
stored in base 2 essentially they are
stored in binary and in binary certain
numbers cannot be represented exactly
this problem of being in base 2 with the
combination of using a float variable
gives us a number that is not exactly
what we are hoping for if we kept adding
data to our numbers eventually the
double variable is going to mess up too
so the moral of the story is that you
can't trust floating-point numbers for
everything integers are a little bit
more trustworthy if you put in 1 you
should expect one to come out that's all
I got to say in this video guys and as
always my last minute words on whether
to use float or double is if you're
unsure prepare for trouble
make it double and that's all I got for
you guys see you in the next video
