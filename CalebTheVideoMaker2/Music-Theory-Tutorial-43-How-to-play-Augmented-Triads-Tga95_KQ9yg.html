fourth and final type of triad for right
now that is an Augmented triad so
remember the Augmented interval just
raised everything so we can take a major
which has a major third and a minor
third and raise that minor third to a
major third to get two major thirds that
will create an Augmented chord so let me
write this all by itself so it's more
clear gotta get everything augmented
chords consists of a major well the root
which is where you start a major third
four half steps and then a major third
with four half steps let me show you an
Augmented chord here here's the first
root note so we call it a c-major or C
augmented chord sorry travel up four
half steps one two three four sorry I
screwed that up one two three four then
we travel up for more one two three four
so now this is the formation of our
augmented chord very simple all we have
to do is find a major chord and increase
that last no one half step so here's a d
major chord I want to make it augmented
boom augmented boom major augmented
major augment major augmented major
minor major minor major minor diminished
minor diminished minor diminished minor
major augmented see the correlation
there so it's all connected you don't
have to move your hands all crazy or
you're playing guitar it's probably a
little bit different because it's hard
to shrink sizes of frets and stuff such
as a dma d minor chord I'll show you
what I mean
most people play it like this but for a
d minor we take the third which is this
one right here and shrink it a half step
down here which makes it hard to play
you can't play it so we do is we swap
the fingering d minor chord vs. and all
we're really doing is just taking this
note right here moving it down here so
yes this stuff does apply to other
instruments it's not just piano crap not
crap but you know so be sure to learn it
