this video we are going to be talking
about one-to-many relationships this
video and a lot of the upcoming videos
are general database design concepts and
just database concepts in general not
necessarily relating to design and all
of these things are important when
you're working with the database system
fortunately this information is very
universal so once you learn it with a
db2 database you can apply it to any
other database system out there that is
relational that being said I am trying
to teach these concepts in the context
of a db2 database so some of the
specific details might vary a little bit
from database to database the overall
concepts are very universal so as we go
through these videos even though we
might not be talking specifically how to
do something in db2 all of this is
extremely foundational for successfully
working with a db2 database so let's get
started with one-to-many relationships
as a review from the previous video a
one-to-one relationship is a
relationship between an entity and an
attribute well now in a one-to-many
relationship we're having relationships
between multiple entities generally this
is going to be structured in a way that
there is a parent in this situation we
have a parent entity that's going to be
referenced by multiple child entities
this is the structure of a one-to-many
relationship and the reason it's
one-to-many is because there is one
entity appear and potentially many
entities down here there are some
restrictions when it comes to
one-to-many relationships so this entity
could not reference another parent this
would be illegal and just can't happen
so that'll make a little bit more sense
once we go into a little bit more detail
but just for now know that a one-to-many
relationship is many entities
referencing one entity so let's say we
have a premium website where you can buy
these memberships and generally when you
go to a membership website they're going
to have three tiers you know one that's
really super cheap but has like no
features one in the middle where you get
a little bit of everything and that's
usually the most popular and then you
got like the premium one that cost a
whole lot well let's kind of mimic that
and see how we would design
as a one-to-many relationship you see
there are three different options when
it comes to the membership and this user
gets to choose one so let's say he picks
bronze well it's other user she might
pick gold the important thing to realize
though is that one user can't pick
multiple membership levels and two
different users could if they wanted
reference the same membership level so
in this situation we have a one-to-many
relationship that's because we have one
entity over here which will be the
parent and then two children entities
that are going to reference that parent
how do we actually structure this in a
database well this is where primary and
foreign keys come in the parent is going
to have a primary key and let's just say
that value is one well each one of these
children are going to reference that
primary key using a foreign key so the
value of that foreign key is going to be
one and that makes that association
between this one and this one over here
and that's how you kind of connect
things if we wanted to structure this in
tables it would look something like this
every single table has a primary key
which forces every single row to be
unique so these are the columns so if
you were to actually look at data it
would be structured like this where the
columns are here but for simplicity we
kind of design it where the columns are
one after the other and this is
generally known as an entity
relationship diagram and it just allows
us to structure the columns of our
tables so the user table is gonna have a
primary key and the membership table is
gonna have a primary key this here is a
foreign key that references this primary
key and essentially what that means is
every single value for this membership
ID column has to be a value from this
column over here the membership rows
would look something like this where we
have the ID and we have the value of
whatever that idea is then over here you
would have one user with a membership ID
so the user with the idea of one
references the bronze or you could have
a user with the ID of two reference
and it's impossible to put something
like a fort because you see this value
here has nowhere to reference so that
would not be allowed to be put into the
database and that's the benefit of
having foreign keys is that they add
those restrictions that's all I got for
you for one-to-many relationships in the
next video we are going to be talking
about many to many relationships and
that's actually a problem in databases
because it's not very easy to design a
many-to-many relationship but I'm going
to be teaching you the trick so that way
you know what to do so thanks for
