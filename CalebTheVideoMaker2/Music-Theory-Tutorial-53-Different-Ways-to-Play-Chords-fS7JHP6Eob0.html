it still relates to chords it's how you
play them when you're accompanying a
group or anything like that look now
this would be for say playing the basic
chords whenever the chance come so i'll
show you an example just basic on the
first beat no fancy rhythms concept
shush so this is a block rhythms we can
also play it in a rhythm which i still
can't spell that word for some reason i
don't know but anyways that would be
something more fancy like that's a
rhythm out of the chords that is not
block chords that is two types then
there's also things called arpeggios i
believe it's pronounced probably not
because i pronounce everything wrong but
that is breaking up a chord implying
each note separately so i can have a
c-major chord or triad whatever you want
to call it on see like this and i could
play it that would be blocked formation
or I can break it up so this note
follows this note follows this snow and
it sound like this and just press an
octave see and it sounds fine or I can
put the cord and the base and then each
of the broken up versions in the treble
or the higher end of it so
that is arpeggio she's basically a
broken up court very common alright
sweet so that's all I'm gonna talk about
in this video it's kind of short one but
not not too fancy all you need to know
is that there's different ways to play
chords I can play fancy rhythms or I can
break them up one note at a time or i
can plan block which is just basic
nothing fancy just just to place the
background that is two things you should
know oh yeah that's about all so i'll
see you in the next video and some be
awesome so subscribe
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
