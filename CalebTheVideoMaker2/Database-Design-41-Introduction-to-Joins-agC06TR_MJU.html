you need someone help you through the
join process and you're all confused
well luckily for you I'm here to help
you so this video we'll be talking about
joins and in fact the next whole group
of videos will be about joins so it's
going to be a lot now joins are a
complex subject there they can be
confusing and tricky and up very
syntactical I don't know if that's a
word but basically the syntax from
relational database management to
another relational database management
system can be confusing and complex but
rather than diving in just learning all
that stuff we're going to be talking
about the concepts of what the types of
joins are and I know you might not even
know to join is yet so you're probably
thinking I don't know what you're
talking about
well that's what we're talking about
today so thank you for joining me let's
begin so a join is when you take
something that's structured in a
database in a confusing non
user-friendly way and you're presenting
it in a user-friendly way now this is
done so that way we can store our data
in the database in a way that's the best
structured to where we protect our data
integrity and it's normalized and
separated across tables with the proper
relationships and data types and keys
and indexes and everything but when we
actually want to present that data for
example on a web page or in a program or
to the analyzer person who goes in
analyzes and does calculations on our
data or just views those calculations
after the database does all the work
with the analyzation well that end
result is often in a way it looks in a
way that i's organized and structured it
makes sense to us that's the purpose of
a join so it takes a mess and puts it
out in a way that looks beautiful and
this can be done over multiple tables
so for example
we're gonna have a table here a table
here and a table here and these could
all be three different tables with
relationships between the tables we
don't get any specifics of what kind of
tables but basically a joint is going to
take all of this and it's going to
present us with a generated table that
is more pretty it's more beautiful and
more structured and it makes more sense
now the way this is done is using
foreign key primary key connections so
when we have these relationships between
these tables where I drew these arrows
here that represents a foreign key
connection that references a primary key
so one of these tables is the parent one
of them is the child and we want the end
result to combine them together into one
now when you do this these columns that
are connected are going to be indexed to
make it much faster now when you join
tables often you replace names of things
with more user friendly names so for
example we could have you know let's say
we had a comment on a website and it
says wow thing and then this is posted
by Caleb
well you can see that if you have that
username here it might actually be a
user ID in a comment table so for
example we can say this up here is the
comment table this is a user table and
there's a foreign key from the user ID
referencing the user ID in the user
table well we when we present that data
on a database we will want to replace
that user ID with the actual user name
so rather than having you know we could
have it to where it's like user ID of
four thousand five hundred eighty-two
and then you're like oh
I know what that means well since this
is all within the comments table now
we're going to take information from a
user table and put that user name
instead of the user ID that is how a
joint works conceptually that's another
important thing all this think of it
conceptually these videos are going to
be hoping you understand the concepts of
the different kinds of joins and
throughout it I'll be giving you some
examples of how you would type that in
SQL maybe but I'm not going to be
getting into the specifics
that's because joints are done
differently from database management
system to database management system so
what you just need to know is how the
joins work and the expected results and
then when you start working with MySQL
or SQL server or Oracle database or
whatever else then you can just figure
out how to do their joins you will
already know what the results are going
to be because you understand the joins
and you just type it out boom you got to
join there now this is one other thing
to know that's important is all of this
is data manipulation most of what we've
been talking about before is data
definition so that was in a basically
DDL but now we're going on to DML so DDL
data definition language and data
manipulation language these are two
parts of SQL we all we all talked about
this and on the older videos but we're
on like way farther now so you guys
might have forgot this but this is
important to know because now we already
have the definition the structure of the
database the database might are to be
completely designed and structured with
the columns and the rows but now we're
manipulating that data to look a certain
way so by doing joins you're not
actually changing the structure of the
database your change
the presentation of that database that
is extremely important to know now you
may be wondering why exactly do I need
to know this because if I'm database
designer or whatever really all I need
to do is design the structure of the
database and then the database
administrator or the software engineer
person or whoever can go in there and
use my database that I designed and
created and they can do all the data
manipulation stuff to fit their
application right well maybe but not
likely that's because the joins are also
very important to understand because
when you design your database you need
to think of it in a user-friendly way
and then normalize it make it confusing
and then present it in a user-friendly
way it's kind of confusing because you
start with let's say you are really bad
at database design and you're
structuring a table and you have it to
where it's like comments comment table
and within this you have a user name and
then you have the the comment and then
maybe the blog post or video whatever it
doesn't really matter you can have some
IDs in there basically you don't know
what you're doing and you put the user
name will just go Caleb see comment lane
there got another one from Caleb see
cool I can't see awesome when you look
at this and you show it to your grandma
she understands it he's like okay she
might not understand it but she gets if
you explained it she might
Caleb see posted the comment lane Caleb
she also posted the comment cool Caleb
also posted the comment of scalzi all
supposed to become awesome but this
isn't the best way to do this because we
learned about data integrity and also
repeating data because now I have this
you're three times so instead we use a
user ID we get rid of Caleb C and we get
rid of the username we have a user ID
and then here we have the user ID six
now I use that number seven seven seven
and then over here we have a user table
with the user ID column which has all of
our user IDs for each individual person
so we started off with this friendly
design but in reality it doesn't work
because it's not normalized there's
repeating data but it looks pretty once
we have that then we can break it up and
normalize it so that way we have
multiple tables so we have this table
and then we have this table over here
but that's not the only thing we do the
next thing we have to do is you have to
take up those pieces of the puzzle and
put them back together in a join to get
the final result
so we basically want to replicate the
original table we had here by using a
join of our normalized database and
recreating it so we're going to do is
we're going to take the user ID call and
we're going to take the user ID you guys
see that all good is everything this
this will likely also have a username
column so I kind of ran out of room here
but user name and that user net user ID
at seven will be connected to Caleb C
using a joint we are going to connect
these two tables by basically using this
foreign key which points to seven and
finding the Associated username with
that user ID and our drawing will look
like this username comment
and the name of the table can be I mean
whatever you want it can be generated
table or it doesn't even need a name if
you're just putting it on a website or
something and then under the username
column it'll be a Caleb C and then Caleb
C and then Caleb C and then under the
comment you're going to happen lame and
cool and awesome but this doesn't just
like this to begin with
we got the username from this table and
we got the comment from this table so
not only do you have to design the
structure of the database but you have
to structure the joins to basically put
our database back into simple language
or Grandma readable tables okay that
that's basically what we want to do so
let's say you get a job or you're
working for a developer or something and
they say okay on my website I want a
table on this users page where I can
sign in with my username password and I
can see their username their password
their email their date they signed up
and everything like that and if I want I
can go in there and edit it that way
they don't have to go in and type SQL
you're you're going to have that
programmed in the in the actual
application to send that SQL but we need
to structure the tables we need to make
a join that's going to be able to
combine those all to one pretty table
which that's the job of the database
designer likely I mean if the
applications or the database is huge you
might have someone who does the the
designing and then someone who does the
implementation and then someone who does
the joins and then someone who does this
other junk but I mean if you're just
working on your own and you guys do
everything you're also gonna have to
design the joints and I highly highly
write highly recommend you do that
before you go and program
in your application and then you're like
oh crap I don't know how to do this or
all my database is structured wrong I'm
going to do this all beforehand don't
rush into things because then you're
going to be like dude Dawg my
application ain't working right and the
reason is because you didn't take the
time to structure your database the
right way and develop your joins yeah
okay once you got that you're good to go
and yeah so there are a couple different
kinds of joins there's inner joins outer
joins cross joins unions there's all
kinds of different things that we're
going to be talking about and we're just
going to be scratching the surface of
each and every one so after these our
next group of videos you will be
sufficient and joins you can be like
joining good so yeah catch in the next
video and stay in school or watch my
videos one of the two hi pizza</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
