trial it's kind of confusing as a yours
or mine anyways this video we're going
to be talking about the text data type
the text data type has actually not been
discussed yet in this series so
something new well now the text data
type is a little bit different than the
varchar' data type because the varchar'
data type you can fit all possible range
of values using one data type but with
text it's actually split into four
different data types depending on the
size that you want so we have text and
then we have tiny text so that'd be
smaller than text but I'll just put it
here since this is kind of like the what
what they all have in common
now the next size for these is 255 65535
this one's about 16 million and about 4
billion so as you can tell these things
can store a ton of data now this is
measured in bytes now working with a
text data type works exactly the same
way as working with a varchar' data type
the easiest way to explain text data
types is to compare it with a varchar'
data type to see the primary differences
so that is what I'm going to get into
now the very first difference is that
the text data types are not limited by
the maximum row size in MySQL so in the
previous video we said that the max row
limit was 65535 bytes
well you saw that some of the text data
types a lot for much more than that so
how is that well with the text of data
types the data is actually stored
elsewhere so let's say this is our table
we will store our data over here and
then reference that data over here
that's all behind the scenes to us
though it doesn't look any different
it's not used any different this is all
just the magic behind it and what that
means is that over here there's only a
maximum of 12 bytes used so if you
continually find yourself hitting this a
limit it might be useful if you
implement a text data type so that way
our data can be elsewhere and we saved
some space that being said there's also
text data
types that are larger than the maximum
of varchar' so if for any reason
varchar' does not give you enough space
to store the string you want to store in
it you can use a text data type and
store way more unless the a text column
does not allow for a default other than
null so the only option for the default
for a text column is not but for bar
chart we can do anything we want so in
summary if you need more data in your
rows you can use text to separate it or
if you need more data than the maximum
varchar' you can use text and finally
you can set a default and varchar'
that's not null but you can't do that in
text so if any of those situations fit
what you need then you would know that
you need to switch over to text or to
varchar' in general if you're not overly
convinced you need to switch to text
then bar chart will probably do just
fine another thing I wanted to mention
to you is that these text data types are
sometimes called clubs as stupid as that
sounds
so a club stands for character large
object there's other types of large
objects which we may discuss in the
upcoming videos but this is one so if
someone's talking about clubs now you're
not gonna sound like an idiot at least
you'll know what they're talking about
so thanks guys hopefully this video is
helpful if you liked it be sure to click
