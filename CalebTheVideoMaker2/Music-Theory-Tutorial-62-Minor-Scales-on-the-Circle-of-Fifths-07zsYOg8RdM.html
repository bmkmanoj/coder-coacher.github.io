into something oh by the way welcome
back to your music theory series I
almost always say MySQL because i made
like 100 mysql tutorials and now i'm
stuck saying it but anyways welcome back
to your music theory series in this
video I'll be talking about relative
minor keys so it's called mine what does
this mean well even though minor sounds
different it still can use the same keys
as a major scale for example if you
remember C major is on all the white
keys and so is a minor I can actually
show that to you it's it really dark in
here is it just the way I've seen this I
think it's just make the way I'm seeing
this who knows alright so start one of
these on see we start on C here we get a
C major scale
start on a here we get the a minor scale
these are said to be the a is said to be
a relative minor scale man Imran holy
cow it always does that when I so a is
said to be a relative minor compared to
see it's the relative minor scale of C
it's because they use the same notes now
when we're looking at the circle of
fifths it also has relative minor scales
on because some scales I can't think of
any other examples except a minor but
some scales use well actually I know
what it goes there's a F has a relative
minor scale of d I think maybe I'm not
too sure so d minor uses the same keys
as f major all off to see if that's all
right in a minute we'll see if I'm right
we'll see it right on this bow home I
was right all right so here here's the
circle of fifths see we have a relative
minor oh shoot we have a relative minor
of a that means they use the same keys
now if we are going this way they are
still an ascending fifths hey one two
three four five six seven so so they're
going in fifths in this direction 77
half step 7 half steps seven half steps
seven half steps be e a D which spells
bead G C F which is conveniently the
same pattern b EA D G and the same
pattern for the the key signatures here
for example be EAD GCF see what I'm
saying</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
