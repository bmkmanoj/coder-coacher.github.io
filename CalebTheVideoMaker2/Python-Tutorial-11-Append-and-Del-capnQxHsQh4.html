this video we're going to be talking
about adding and removing stuff from a
list so it's going to be super legit and
awesome so be sure to watch the whole
thing and click like and subscribe
alright so we're down here on our Python
shell we just shrink it up here so you
can see a bit all right there we go
alright so first let's create a list so
we can just make lists and it's keywords
so let's go awesome and then we're going
to put everything that's awesome in here
alright and if you if you already have
like a set number of options you can put
those out first and then you can fill in
the blanks so awesome well obviously we
know that water is awesome we also know
that h2o is awesome and we also know
that a hydration is awesome so we press
ENTER and we have this new list awesome
if you want to see the contents you can
put print and then within here you can
put awesome with no quotes and it tells
us all the parts of the list now in
order to remove something we use the
keyword del or delete short for delete
obviously and then what we do is we just
give the index number of the item we
want to delete so we'll talk a little
bit more about that but I'll show you
right now delete or del awesome and then
within these little brackets you put the
index number so index number is the
order of the items in the list it starts
at 0 0 1 2 so if we wanted to delete h2o
we would put del awesome and then we put
a 1 because it starts at 0 so 0 1 and
then I can press ENTER and now when we
print awesome it has removed h2o so we
only have two things within our list but
that's not the only thing we can also
use a function to add things into our
list so this a function is append and
I'll be showing you how to use this the
first thing that we do is we write the
name of our list so our list name is
awesome
do whatever you want and then you put a
period and then you put the word append
so this right here is known as object
dot notation I believe or just dot
notation and basically it says that we
want to run this function on this list
so after the dot whatever we put here is
a function a function is something that
does something with our data this over
here this is a little bit different than
a function this is a command and why
it's like that who knows but basically
we want to use the function append and
then within a function just like print
printing is a function we put open quote
or open parentheses and then closing
parentheses and then whatever we want
within them so we do the same thing for
the append function we open and close
our parentheses and then within here we
add something to our list so let's put
some h2o yo and we want to put those in
quotes so let's try like this
enter now when we print the list and
then enter it you can see that h2o yo
was added to the end so that is how you
add and delete things from lists so yeah
thank you for watching and I will see
you in the next video peace and
