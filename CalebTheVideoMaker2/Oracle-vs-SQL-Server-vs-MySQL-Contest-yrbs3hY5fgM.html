face the camera face I need you for a
video onyx face the camp basically hey
everyone its Caleb from Caleb the video
maker - and as you can tell I'm getting
prepared for Christmas my red and green
pillows you can see there's my
heavily-used workout machine over there
anyways the point of this video is I
wanted to talk about a couple different
relational database management systems
so you know guys I've made videos over
MySQL I've started videos over Oracle
and there's another popular one known as
sequel server but which one is best they
are really strong competitors and of
course they have their differences
certain ones are better for certain
different things but the core of them
all is the same they're all based off of
a standard known as SQL structured query
language and as you guys know I am
trying to run a YouTube channel that
focuses heavily on database management
systems and database design so how could
I not cover all three database systems
so I wanted to announce that I'm going
to be making videos over MySQL again but
this time is going to be more in depth
and just awesomer and I'm going to be
covering videos over sequel server and
oracle but I thought I'd make it a
little bit more fun than that I'm going
to be uploading them at the same time
I'm going to turn into a little
competition to see which one you guys
like the most now don't be confused
because I've already started my Oracle
series but that was before I thought of
this fabulous idea so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to hold off on the
oracle videos just for a bit I'm up to
video number 22 then I'm going to start
my MySQL and sequel server videos get
those caught up to video number 22 so
that way all three series are on video
number 22 and starting at the beginning
of the next year 2017 I'm going to start
uploading videos for all three of them
at the same time so what you guys can do
is you can watch the series that you
want click like on them and share them
with all your friends and I'm
gonna build this awesome point system
and at the end we're gonna see which one
wins and that series is going to get a
bonus 50 videos so obviously I don't
know everything about all of these
relational database management systems
I'm still learning that's part of the
goal I want to be familiar with all of
these and be efficient at building
databases and all the three most popular
database management systems and they are
the most popular you can look up world's
most popular database systems and there
are standardized comparisons and MySQL
sequel server and oracle blow away all
the other ones by a longshot
that's why I thought it'd be a great
idea just to cover all of the main ones
that you guys are going to run into in
your database careers so the competition
starts January 1st and the competition
will end at video number 150 yeah so
I'll be making 150 videos for each of
the relational database management
systems and then the winner is going to
get a total of 200 so if there's a
database you prefer you're going to want
to make sure you watch all those click
like and make sure that that series ends
up as the winner now how does the
scoring system work well I decided each
view is going to be worth one point and
each like is going to be worth 10 points
periodically I will release an update
just kind of announce which ones are
winning and as for actual measurements
the measurements are based off of video
number 23
up until video number 150 I know it's
kind of confusing but that's just how
it's going to go so from January 1st
up until however long it takes me to
make 150 videos that is when the
challenge is in session and then at the
end I'm just going to figure out how
many views all those videos for each
series and how many likes for each
series in which everyone got the most is
going to get the prize so yeah guys
that's my new year's resolution I don't
know what else to say that's all guys
and just as a conclusion December will
be MySQL and sequel server and starting
the new year I'll be making all three
together hopefully the videos are
helpful be sure to click like on this
video and subscribe and just for fun
let's all post our New Year's
resolutions as a comment to this video
thanks and I will see you in the next
one yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
