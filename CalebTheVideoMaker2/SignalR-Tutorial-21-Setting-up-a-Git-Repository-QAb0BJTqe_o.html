video is to help you guys get everything
we got so far into a git repository so
you're probably thinking what the heck
is good
well many of you probably already know
this but git is a source control manager
or there's a couple different names for
them but essentially it's a repository
for you to store your code in and it's
super super helpful to keep organized on
projects so as this gets more complex I
just want to make sure that everything
we need is organized and structured so
what we're gonna do is go to get - SCM
comm download the latest version I'm
gonna use the version I already got but
almost everything is gonna be identical
so it should be fine and then what you
need to do is you need to open a folder
and find the project that you're working
on so the location of my solution is in
Documents Visual Studio 15 projects et
vm2 the next thing you're going to want
to do is open up git so from your Start
menu you can just put get open up git
bash and just travel to this location
this you want to get the directory on
here the same as the folder so you can
use the CD command change directory and
I just like to do it one step at a time
so first I always go CD tilde which gets
me in my home directory which obviously
where I started but just in case you
guys need to be on the same page as me
documents CD and then quote this one
because there's a lot of spaces perfect
so we are in the directory and then what
you can do is type git status and you
can see it's not a git repository or any
of the parent directories so there's
nothing get here so what we need to do
is type git init which is which is the
command to initialize a repository
initializing empty git repository in
that folder so now if you guys have it
to where you can see hidden files you
will see a dot git inside of the folder
so if you're wondering how to view
hidden files up in your file explorer
click view and then check hidden files
and I should
the next thing you need to do is get a
get ignore file so get ignore file
essentially tells get what files you do
not want to put into the repository
because certain files you don't need to
put in there so the easiest way to do
that is go to web browser and just
search get ignore for visual studio the
first one should be perfect what you're
gonna want to do is just copy this
entire file and then go back to your
folders right click and create a new
text document and you just name it
get ignore keep it as text that's fine
open it up paste it and save it you can
go file save or ctrl s whatever and then
once it's already done you can go over
here delete the ending and put a dot at
the beginning oh okay
so I guess that's not gonna work so the
other way you can do it is type MV and
then put the name of the file get ignore
dot text and we're gonna rename that to
dot git ignore perfect so hopefully you
guys got all that and you should be up
to speed now what you can go back into
this and say get status that's going to
list every single thing in here if you
want a good tool like a graphical user
interface tool to look at all this I
would suggest SourceTree so when you
download an open-source tree it's gonna
look something like this probably with
more stuff on it but then you click
clone slash new add a working copy
because we already have to get
repository we don't need to clone one
from somewhere else next thing I want to
do is select the folder you could just
copy the address from here paste that
here will get you to it click select
folder this is a git repository make
sure it says that click Add
then I open it up and it's a lot easier
just to kind of see all the files that
are going to be put into the repository
once you got all that done hopefully you
didn't make any mistakes all you got to
do is say a commit message so initial
commit and then just kind of give a
description of what you got perfect so
why can't I click commit well with git
you have something known as a staging
area it's the files you want to put into
the repository so these files are all
unstaged meaning we're saying hey even
though the git ignore says these files
are ok we still don't want them in there
that's not what we want though so what
we need to do is we need to put them all
under the staging area now you can see
it's labeled as we added all these
different files that's exactly what we
want now the commit button is ready to
be pressed and I'm gonna press it sweet
so now if we go back to our bash and by
the way an easy way to open this is just
click this terminal button right here
you can say git status and nothing to
commit working directory clean if you
want to see the history of your commits
you can say git log yes that's our
initial commitment perfect you can also
see it on sourcetree using this log
slash history button you can see all
your commits right here and the files
that were added into them so I know that
was a lot of content and it was kind of
unrelated but this is something that's
very super practical I would highly
highly highly recommend that you guys do
this and get all of your code into some
kind of source control management system
git is the one I use it's the one I like
so that's what I'll be using for this
and as we make some crazy changes I'll
just make a quick git commit that way if
I screw everything up I can just revert
back in time and have everything back to
how it was so hopefully that's helpful
guys I will see you guys in the next
video thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
