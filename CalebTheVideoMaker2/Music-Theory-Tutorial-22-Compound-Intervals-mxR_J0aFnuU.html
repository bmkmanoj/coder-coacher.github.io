over something called compound interval
size let's get caught in here compound
shish interval size can you read that
can you read that can you read that
I hope so cuz I've been using this
little board this entire time
well anyways compound interval size is
anything above an octave so basically
double octave was the size of eight so
from c4 to c5 was an octave now what if
we go from c4 to d5 that's actually one
extra well then assign eight it's a
like yes good guess so that is an
example of a compound interval size so I
can think of it as discounting from the
bottom one up to the larger one so we
could have okay let's say C 4 to be 5 so
we have c 4 c d e f g a b c so that's
let's see that's B 4 B 4 seed haha get
it cuz it's like before it oh man oh so
this is C 5 d e f G a B that's a lot so
here is B 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
13 14 14
so that is 14th you have to think C 2 C
is 8 now if we go from C to B that is 7
we have the same C here twice so we
actually have to subtract 1 so that's
why compound interval sizes are weird so
let me just show you on a keyboard it's
probably easier 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
12 13 14 15 say we're going from D to 4d
for two so basically it's whatever the
interval is for the first one for the
first octave so let's say we're going
from D to 4d for to f5 okay let's figure
this out d 4 d 4 D 5
d4 to d5 we already know that's an
octave which is eight because we figured
out one letter to the next is an octave
now from d5 to f5 is a second D F D D to
F is a second so we have an octave if
plus a second you would think Oh 8 + 2
10 well it's actually not because you
can see repeating the D twice which
means you can't count the same note
twice so this is actually a 9th an
easier way to think of this is alright
we're going from D to an F an octave
above it so that means we have an octave
8 plus 1 more 9th rather than recounting
the D that's an easier way to think of
it when you have smaller intervals for
example if we have C C to D we know it's
a 9th C - okay c4 to d5 we know this is
a 9th because c4 to c5 is an octave plus
a D would make it a 9th one extra step
so that's all about interval sizes in
the next video I'll be talking about
adding intervals and that'll make a
little bit that'll help me clear things
up and help you clear things up which
would be good so I'll see you then thank
you
