welcome to Caleb video makeup - it is me
Caleb from Caleb's video maker - so
thank you for joining this livestream I
have some exciting news to share with
you this is my third livestream in a row
I'm still using my potato cam HD with my
potato microphone but that's okay okay
we'll get somewhere someday the topic
for today is going to be software
testing and I must say up front I am NOT
a software tester I mean well I do test
software but I'm not a like testing
engineer or anything like that I'm just
some noob on the youtubes so take all my
advice as just the basics right but
before we get started I have some cool
news and I wanted to give a special
thanks to my sponsor which IBM and
specifically the product I am thinking
that you guys are interested in is db2
which is their database so I am going to
paste a link for you guys in the
comments where you guys can go check
that out
and give that a try and the reason I'm
promoting this so much right now in
these live streams is because I'm
actually going to be coming out with a
series over db2 so the sooner you get
started with it the sooner that series
is going to be of help I mean the series
is going to come out the same time
either way but you can already be
started you can already get get your
feet wet a little bit oh I always forget
to change the title names for these
things okay what do we want to call it
today let's go with software testing
okay I should probably fix that before I
start live streaming so we are up to
seven viewers which is pretty sweet
I decided every time I reach a new high
score on total viewers I am going to
shout for joy so so far my max is 16
so the goal for today is to get 17 can
we get 17 if we get 17 it's gonna be
quite exciting for me all right so I
saved the info I don't know if that's
gonna update now or if that will save
when it's done I don't know so I'm
getting a little bit more into
live-streaming I think the results of
the previous two have been tremendous as
a lot of fun like like I did it for two
hours yesterday and I found it hard to
stop doing it and it was like midnight
almost so that is pretty pretty pretty
awesome but I am using a software to do
this live streaming and I found out some
cool tricks right so in the previous
videos I wanted to show you guys some
stuff on the screen and I couldn't
figure it out because you know I'm just
a silly guy he doesn't know how to do
anything but I figured it out found a
tutorial okay check this out check it
out already
Oh black box no black box black box this
may or may not have anything to do with
black box tech black blood black box
testing which we will be talking about
in this video and it actually has
nothing to do with that it's actually
just a background where I am going to be
putting important information like so so
you can see here I am sharing our
sponsor and I'm putting the link there
so you guys can go get that they are the
ones who are making this content
possible so make sure you thank them
give their software a try it's great
because it is available for free as a
developer and you can do so many
different things with it so that is why
I am very very very excited to be
sponsored by them I mean of all sponsors
this is really great so be sure to check
that out and there's one other thing
check this out
you ready for this are you ready boom
huh sharing your screen ha you see that
so now I can do on-screen tutorials
which is pretty awesome now I'm pretty
sure with the compression on here it's
going to look pretty horrible
until we you know set up a real studio
but until then I think this will do so
I'm going to go over a few things I
wanted to share with you I see these
live streams as a way that I can update
you guys with new things that are
happening so to begin let me show my
screen first off this is our sponsor IBM
db2 and you know this is great because
they're sharing my video so by sharing
their stuff I am in the end sharing my
own stuff but the cool part is is that
they have decided to invest money into
the community they could have just as
easily spent that money on Google
Adsense or something but instead they
decided to help a little noob like me
making some silly tutorials and as a
result they're saying hey we appreciate
you we appreciate your audience we
appreciate our customer base they care
about the person not just the numbers so
that's why I'm appreciative so I'm gonna
have to practice a bit switching back
between the face and the screen but
eventually I will get it but as I was
saying I really appreciate that because
this is a lot different than just
putting an ad on the Internet
this is reaching out to the development
community showing a product that is of
extreme use of it's a good product so
that is why I am totally for sponsorship
whether your opinion on sponsorship is
oh that's silly you're trying to make
money you shouldn't try to make money
that's evil or if it's like oh you
should do ton the sponsors if you're
anywhere in-between
you should really listen to what I have
to say here because sponsorship is
actually a way to help creators and help
companies get their name out if iBM has
a good product they can use people like
me as a as a means to share that product
with the world so I am obviously by no
means against sponsorship and in fact I
put my sponsorship up kind of like a
page on my website saying what I
look for in a potential sponsor and it
took about six months or so to get like
a real sponsor so I've been trying to do
this for a while and I finally got one
so that is why I'm really excited um I
have had some other sponsored work which
I'll be sharing with with you in just a
minute so let's switch over to the
screen oh okay so this is db2 developer
edition this is the one that you can use
for free and it's full-featured and you
can see it supports you know JSON XML
and all that good stuff so there's also
some other cool stuff you can read in
here and you can program to it with a
bunch of different languages and yada
yada yada I'm not gonna bore you with
all the details if you're interested go
check that out but now I want to give
you an update on what's going on with my
channel and by the way if you click the
link that is being displayed or in the
live chat it'll take you to this page so
it'll be an easy way for you to find it
so this is my channel here so I'm up to
40 almost 41 thousand subscribers which
is incredible
just in the last few days I just wanted
to share some of the content that I've
been sharing on here
I'll go to my videos oh okay there we go
so what I've been doing is okay that's
kind of weird it's like three behind but
whatever that's the one we're on hey
it's my self so I've been doing these
database clustering videos on a regular
basis and these videos response were
sponsored by several nights which they
are also a great company who went out of
their way to make sure that I knew what
I was doing for this series in that I
knew that they were there to answer
questions and that their software was
mainly designed to help developers and
DBAs and all of that good stuff
so I am also a huge supporter of them
and I can actually paste a link to them
if you guys are interested but
essentially what they are is they are a
database management system the main tool
they sell is called a cluster
control and I think there's I think you
can you can get started with free so you
can get started with it for free so I'll
give you a chance to try it out and I am
actually going over how to use that
stuff in this series so I just pasted
the link in the live chat so you guys
can go check that out but this series is
really really good if you are completely
new to database clustering as I was
Believe It or Not most of my tutorials
are you know basic sequel SQL database
design but database clustering was a
little bit of a step up so not only that
was this a great learning experience for
me I I am able to share that learning
experience with you guys and illustrate
that in a simple enough way that you
guys can understand what I'm talking
about
so if you look though at these views you
can see that the old shoot I didn't mean
to do that you can see that the views
here on the live streams are very very
good I'm honestly surprised so you can
see 220 view 222 on the database
clustering number two and 466 on
database clustering 1 which those are
very good views but just my live stream
that I did 20 hours ago is already up to
300 views which is incredible yeah so
the last thing I wanted to say is that
you can also find some blogs on my
website with some sexy pictures here
that show illustrations and I will be
updating the blogs database clustering
where you can find all that good stuff
but these still need pictures as you can
see picture is coming soon okay so
that's enough wasting your time with
channel updates I think in the future
I'll probably try to move those later on
after I talk about the stuff I wanted to
talk about for the day okay some guy
said my beard is looking cool well thank
you okay
let's get on to software testing I've
got a lot a lot of information for you
guys so I'm excited to share we talked a
little bit about software testing
yesterday
because the topic for yesterday was
computer science and a huge piece of
computer science is software testing
obviously because as a computer
scientist you got to make sure you are
creating bug-free or as poss as close to
bug free software as possible yeah so
I'm gonna be talking about that it's
kind of hard for me to switch back
between my notes and the live dashboard
so I might not see you guys comments til
the end where I'll be answering some
questions and I'm not sure if I'll be
able to notice if we do reach 17 viewers
by chance we did reach 14 but now we're
down to five so I must be slacking okay
so let's talk about what is testing
software testing is the process of
making software not have bugs making
sure that it does what it's supposed to
do and also looking for bugs that we can
fix so a bug is just when something
doesn't work the way it should work so
you type something in and it says error
sequel connection problem bla bla bla
which by the way you should never see
errors that talk about the database
there should be very general like there
was the problem try again later but you
know you always see those errors where
it just spits out all of the information
on a public website that's really bad so
there's really two types of software
testing that I'm going to be talking
about manual testing and automated
testing so as a computer science program
dude programming dude I am obviously
interested in automating testing
automated testing anything that we can
automate as a programmer we need to
automate it we should even be automating
our automation and then automating that
process as well that's because Adam
ation saves time it allows us to do our
job of programming rather than software
testing in in a sense we can program the
tests but we don't have to sit there
click a thousand buttons make sure
everything is working we can spend more
time actually coding our software rather
than going through and clicking buddies
so there is ups and downs of automated
verse manual testing but ultimately it
probably bat be best to have a balance
of both of them both automated testing
and manual testing but probably more
automated testing than manual testing so
as I talk to you guys about in the last
livestream if you guys saw here's a
little illustration I had it's really
stupid but consider this a program and
you're going this way and you hit an if
statement one way goes one way and one
way goes the other way and the program
continues to branch so when you're when
you're software a branch is a bunch you
have a bunch of different points that
you have to test essentially every
single end point needs testing so on
here there's three end points 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 so
that would take three tests at least and
sometimes different branches can require
more or less work so it can get pretty
complex because if you think of a
complex software system the ends of your
software meaning the grant the ends of
the branches all the possible options of
input and output it can basically become
an impossible task so we have to limit
ourselves a little bit sometimes because
we have to make sure that we can test
everything as good as possible I'm not
sure the live stream seems to be loading
I don't know if it's a if it's
disconnected okay let's try to reconnect
this thing
okay I don't know if the internet just
crashed I think it's up again so I
apologize with that not sure what I was
saying but essentially the bigger your
program
exponentially more things you have to
test so to make it easier on us we need
to try to approach testing in a way
that's going to prevent us from trying
every single possibility of input it's
just not plausible so one thing that a
lot of people do is test the edge cases
and the edge cases are the inputs that
are right before the limit and a little
bit after the limit to make sure the
proper response is given so for example
if a method or function takes a positive
number like inserting money into your
bank account well you should probably
test what happens if you insert a dollar
what happens if you insert $0 and what
happens if you insert negative $1.00
those are the edge cases and also what
happens if you test the maximum number
and the number right after that all of
those possibilities should respond in a
good way so if you put in something
invalid so the software should say
something like hey that is an invalid
input please try again so you're going
to have to do data validation for each
one of those edge cases so you can base
your tests that you write in software
off of these edge cases and it'll give
you a pretty good idea that your
software is working correctly obviously
I can't do it perfect because of the
complexity of the whole system but there
is some ways to get essentially bug free
software which I'm going to be talking
about later in this in this podcast or
livestream or whatever you want to call
it and that's actually really really
really cool I've actually never done
what I'm going to talk about but I've
learned a little bit about it and I just
want to throw that in there at the end
of this so if you were looking for a way
to make bug free software stay tuned
because I'm going to be talking about
that
okay so what is next the two types of
tests well there's unit tests and
integration tests so in a unit test is
designed to test a small unit so this
would be like one unit would be testing
that inserting money into your bank
account function and basically mocking
or faking the bank and all you got to do
is write a unit test for all of the
different edge cases so you would have a
unit test for zero negative one one max
number and the number after the max
number and the reason the tests do you
have so many little small tests is
because if you think of the name it's a
unit we are trying to test individual
units of our software so that way when
we change things we can basically just
run this huge number of tests and verify
that the software is working the way
it's supposed to be working so that is
why the unit tests are very small
because we want to be able to easily
test one small piece of functionality
and if a test breaks the smaller the
unit the easier it is to figure out
what's wrong for example if you tested
every single thing and decide a one dry
unit test and then it failed well now
you're gonna have to debug this test and
figure out what's going on and it could
be anywhere inside that unit test so if
you make your unit test smaller they're
easier to fix they're easier to follow
and they test a more specific
functionality yeah yeah hopefully that
makes sense to you guys the other thing
was integration test now an integration
test these are the things the people who
pay money actually care about
we as software developers we do unit
tests but should we do unit tests as
much as we do integration test I don't
know software developers will probably
say heck yeah you should do more unit
testing you should do integration test
and then you know the people paying the
actual money would say integration tests
are more important and essentially what
integration test is it tests your entire
system so rather than faking that bank
it would actually test putting money
into
bank verifying that the bank took the
money and that you can access the new
amount of money that is what an
integration test is it tests the bigger
functionality of your app so that means
they're more complex but they show what
the application is supposed to do from a
zoomed out perspective the unit test is
like zooming in into the cellular
details of your test whereas the the
integration test is like oh does my arm
work no it doesn't okay that means
something's broken so you can see the
difference their unit test very small
integration tests can be a little bit
bigger but you still want to try to keep
them small but they should test the
functionality of something you know if
you program pretend an arm as a program
I know it's such a dumb illustration but
if you're programming all these units
and everything's working but can you use
all of that as a whole to pick up some
water twist off the cap and take a drink
yeah i was really just thirsty i needed
an excuse to get some water next thing i
wanted to talk about is black box and
white box testing you know so all about
that black box there right so what in
the world is a black box and white box
testing these okay these are kind of
dumb okay I shouldn't say that because
they're pretty important I guess but
essentially these are test cases that
are often written in English to show hey
is your program working and the way
companies do these varies but I had to
do it at one company that I was working
for and essentially you had to write up
a word document showing that your
software does everything that it's
supposed to do and that included
pictures and inputs and outputs and then
you know making sure showing a picture
that all the unit tests and integration
tests passed and it was you know it's
good except it took like forever
and you know if you write good enough
unit tests and integration test you
really shouldn't have to spend a whole
lot of time turning that into a document
it's kind of just I don't know I kind of
feel like some people just try to overdo
it sometimes which we should try not to
do so what is the difference between
white box and black box testing
well white box exposes the inside of
your application so these are the tests
usually the developers are going to be
doing so these are making sure hey this
function does what it's supposed to do
hey this does what it's supposed to do
the black box is a little bit more not
see-through so as an example those are
the kinds of tests once you put the
application onto a either a testing
environment or a customer's a fake
customers computer then you run these
tests and make sure it works and these
are often you know these are gonna the
things gonna be ran by the testing
engineers or the testing people because
they don't necessarily know what your
code is doing all they really care about
is is this software doing what it's
supposed to be doing so that's black box
tech back box testing okay then there's
some more categories of testing so
limitation testing this is you know
pushing the limits of your software does
your software work when you're working
with tons of data you know gigabytes of
data terabytes of data more than that
does it work if you have a slower
computer does it work if the internet
slow does it work with more people so if
you have an app that's being used by
multiple people well that goes into
concurrency with concurrency meaning the
term multiple users of this application
there's also concurrency when it comes
to asynchronous II which we'll talk
about a minute but concurrency meaning
multiple people using your software at
the same time if you have a thousand
users does this start to slow down does
it
if you have a million users if you have
10 million whatever your limits whatever
you think the appropriate limit is you
need to test that so that way you know
that your software works in a production
environment that might actually reach
that point
so that's limitation testing and along
with that is performance testing
performance testing is basically saying
is this fast yeah this is fast okay it
passes but there's more to it than that
obviously you can get software packages
that can optimize the speed of your
program all that good stuff but
essentially what that is is hey does
this program work without consuming all
of the memory and just making the
computer super slow is this a good
performing program and then on top of
that is scalability is this something
that we could easily grow out to more
customers without causing problems
that's really important because you know
think of like Pokemon go right they had
this big issue because they were not
prepared for the mass number of people
that were going to be using their
software and when the app launched 50
percent of the time it would just shut
down or wouldn't work because the
scalability was underestimated so now
let's talk about concurrency in code so
that's different than I'm taught when
we're talking about users so concurrency
and code is is dealing with parallel
computing or parallel processes
multi-threading asynchronous code all of
that kind of good stuff so if you don't
know what any of that is that's okay but
essentially it's another layer of
complexity to our software so let's
let's talk about some of the different
things that that is okay so it's magic I
know that much I don't really understand
all of it but essentially you can
execute multiple things at the same time
using parallel processing so rather than
processing something waiting for it to
finish and then processing something
else waiting for it to finish why not
just process
both at the same time and I saw this
illustration of this like kind of like
doing laundry and it was like four steps
you know you have to throw the clothes
in the washer you have to Co the clothes
clothes in the dryer you have to dry
your clothes no take the clothes out and
then you have to fold the clothes or
something like that and if you just did
that once well you'd have to wait for
the whole thing
to take take the time that it does to
get through to the end but you know if Y
you put something in a dryer you throw
something in the washer well you can
kind of do two things at once layered on
top of each other so you can speed up
the process of your computer your your
processing of your code and how that
works I have no idea I sort of had a
class on it and it was completely over
my head so it's about all I know but I
do know it can cause some problems some
serious problems with code so if you
have concurrency like that like parallel
processing or multi-threading which is
essentially the same thing so parallel
processing with multi-threading or if
you're dealing with asynchronous code
which is stuff that happens in the
background you are highly likely to have
bugs in your software so one of the very
common bugs that you get when you do
this kind of stuff is deadlock and it's
a pretty horrible so what is deadlock
essentially deadlock is when one piece
of your software is waiting on another
piece to do something and that piece is
waiting on the other piece to do
something so your your software just
locks and doesn't go anywhere it doesn't
do anything it just sits there and why
is that why is that a big problem well
besides the fact that your stuffs broken
and all your customers are gonna be
super upset it doesn't happen all of the
time so it's an unpredictable problem
meaning if you find this bug and then
you teach someone how to reproduce it
there's a high probability it's not
going to happen because it's based on
time
so deadlock only happens if two things
happen in parallel and they're not lined
up just right so for example let's say
you have to lock two resources and you
have to essentially two processes and
each process needs to lock both of the
resources
well there's resource a and resource B
what's day number one
grabs a and then number two grabs B but
they both still need the other one so
they just wait for the other one to
release it and now you got this problem
because they're both holding one and
they're both wastes waiting on each
other to release it that's kind of a
dumb example but stuff similar to that
you can prevent that but it has to do
with locking and unlocking so that is a
huge thing in code and you know you
could make a whole series on that so I'm
not going to do that right now maybe
later but if you're doing that kind of
stuff in your code you need to be very
very careful that you are locking and
unlocking at the appropriate times
because if you're locking section is too
short and essentially locking is saying
hey I'm going to grab both of these you
can't touch it back off son that kind of
stuff so when you when you lock you
don't risk that problem but if you're
locking section is too big you sacrifice
the benefit of processing things in
parallel because then the other one has
to wait for everything to finish and you
defeat the whole purpose that makes any
sense
so deadlock big problem big big thing
that's hard to test and that's just
that's something to deal with if you
have it if you have experienced it then
you need to go back and you need to go
back and make sure that you're locking
everything appropriately so we're up to
thirty minutes and I'm going through
this pretty quickly uh
try not to ramble too much
the next thing I wanted to talk about is
reducing the need for testing in other
words write better software how do we
write better software so we don't need
to test it so much we should still test
it because obviously the software needs
to do what it's supposed to do but we
don't want you to have more testers than
we have programmers because come on the
thing is writing software is extremely
hard and I'm not just saying that
because I'm awful at it I'm saying that
because it is and I'm bad at it but
besides that it's an extremely complex
process that can be very difficult to
get right
there's even books written on that so I
think there's one like dreaming and code
or something and that talks about all
that
so with this live streaming software
there's this little box at the bottom it
changes colors and it goes from I green
to red so I apologize if if this is a
little choppy I'm not going to be able
to tell right now but I'll have to go
through and you know this if this
Internet's not gonna work I'm gonna have
to find somewhere else to do this
because it's too much fun to quit too
much fun ain't quitting this may be not
skinny okay so how do we reduce bugs how
do we make a better software well let's
write a book about it because there's a
thousand things we can do to make
testing easier and to make software
better one of the very first things I
would recommend is test-driven
development and that is where you write
and think about your tests before you
write the code once your tests are there
you can run them and since you haven't
programmed anything you know it's gonna
fail it's not gonna work and you're
gonna get probably like a red circle or
a failed sign and then what you do is
you go implement the code needed to make
that test pass and no more and then you
write another test and you just keep
repeating that process and why would you
want to do this well the reason is
because if you write the test first it
require it forces you to think
about what your software is really
supposed to be doing because like I
mentioned in the last livestream
oftentimes we think we're supposed to be
doing something we programmed something
than we're then we're thinking and the
thing that the person actually wants is
completely different and the way they
explain what they want is completely
completely different so actually getting
the right product is very challenging so
doing the test first you can actually
run that by your the boss or whoever and
say hey is this this stuff look right
and if they have any idea about -
software testing they can look through
it and say yeah this this looks good and
then you can code it and then you're on
you're both on the same page so that's
pretty cool so test-driven development
obviously it doesn't work okay so with
with that the reality is you're probably
going to maybe I shouldn't say this I
don't know you're probably gonna be
doing a little bit of both at the same
time because sometimes writing an entire
test or a test suite for example without
coding anything is challenging because
you're not really sure what to test for
what what the code is gonna look like
but you know 75 to 100 percent of your
efforts should be writing the tests in
the twenty five percent should be
thinking about you know pseudocode hey
what what is our structure going to look
like and kind of build those out
together yeah so when you when you write
code you need to write good code and one
of the ways that I think you write good
code is by following conventions so a
convention is just an agreed-upon way of
doing something and there are tons of
conventions in code and software suites
and all that good stuff but one of them
that I am very very particular about is
naming conventions and capitalization
conventions because if you get thrown in
software that has a certain convention
but someone's not following it it's
nearly impossible to follow what's going
on because you look at something and you
say oh it's a property but really it's a
field and that's that's annoying so
let's talk about some
the conventions that I think are
important so what is Pascal casing and
camel casing these are two
capitalization standards Pascal casing
is where if you have multiple words like
I can't think of anything but each first
letter is capitalized so that is
different than the other option which is
camel casing where all of the letters of
the first all of the first letters of
the words are capitalized except the
first word is lowercase and just that
convention alone can tell you what the
variable is so I'm talking specifically
programming I'm not talking sequel or
database programming the naming
conventions for a sequel database is
something else so let's talk about
programming for example in c-sharp a
property it's just like a property on an
object it is always capital a field
which is just a variable essentially is
always camelcase
and if you made it Pascal casing your
first thought is oh this is a property
but it's really not so figure out what
your capitalization standards are for
whatever software you're writing or
whatever programming language you're
using and you need to follow them
religiously as annoying as it might be
and sometimes it can get confusing when
it comes to abbreviations so like if you
have like MVC in your code for example
do you capitalize all of the letters
what if you are in in camel casing do
you do you lowercase the first M and
then upper case the V and the see all
that's kind of confusing and usually the
programming language will have some kind
of documentation on what is recommended
well generally you don't you if you have
two letters they'll both be capitalized
if you have three letters they will the
first one or all three of them either
the first one will be capital and then
the rest lowercase or all three of them
will be lowercase depending on if it's a
camel case or Pascal casing
so that's kind of confusing to explain
without a an illustration but if your
your acronym is three letters you should
be thinking lowercase generally that's
gonna vary but uppercase multiple
characters in a row uppercase is
generally frowned upon unless it's
something small like two characters okay
who that's some man I never thought like
he is so detailed on writing variable
names but on the topic of abbreviations
you should just try to avoid them if you
can if you can't for some reason over
just makes sense like if you're gonna
write ID I mean that's way better than
identification number or identity
identification so obviously sometimes
they're reasonable but sometimes you'll
read code and every single variable is
just an abbreviation or some random
letter so it's like P LJ P parentheses a
comma J and then it's like oh I'm
supposed to be able to read that somehow
yeah that's not happening
so even if it takes up more room spell
out your stinking variable names because
no one knows what you're talking about
in in a year you're not gonna know what
you're talking about either so I am
generally very against abbreviations
because they're stupid and there's way
too many of them if you look up any
abbreviation on the internet there's 40
potential possibilities so if someone
doesn't know what your abbreviation
means it's confusing
simple as that ah so if you're on a
software team you need to get some
serious rules you know rules annoying
things get in people's code and say bro
why don't have a light bulb it's got
some really great ideas today you need
to get in people's code and be like bro
there should be lowercase this should be
uppercase what the heck is ljp mean
spell it out I don't care if your
variable names get longer
it's worth it because then you can read
your code as if it's English and that
makes it easier for us all uh yeah so
that's that's that you need to have some
generalized company standards on how you
write your code that way you know all of
your code is not only readable by one
specific person other people in your in
your industry and in your business and
company they can read it as well so some
software is out there that can actually
force certain conventions so like I
can't really think of any good ones but
there's something with Visual Studio
like FX something essentially it'll
it'll scan your code and be like bro
you're breaking the rules you're gonna
get fired your boss is gonna kill you
and that that'll help you keep your team
all on the same page so look into stuff
like that if you really want to be picky
but generally just tell everyone the
rules and tell them to follow them
yep so one convention I have is like if
I'm using a an acronym and I have to use
that acronym but I'm using it in a
variable that's camel case I will
lowercase the first letter even though
it looks weird because that way I know
this is a variable local variable or
field or whatever I'm working with the
last thing that I have weight just
kidding I got a ton more is code reviews
so a code review is once you commit
stuff or once you have your code ready
you can commit it to a branch or just
have it on your laptop but usually you
should commit it to some kind of
repository have some boss dude or some
other software engineer look at your
code slap you in the face be like noob
you don't know what you're doing then
they whip out their DDS plus plus on
runescape and take you to the wildy and
phone you and send you to Lumbee yeah
yeah that's what that's a good thing
okay that's one of the perks of working
in a team environment is people sharpen
you by uh cutting cutting you and
causing painful
painful things to go through your body
verbally though I'm not not physically I
mean if people are literally cutting you
you need to get out of that job okay
when people say hey use cutting-edge
software that is not what they mean at
all okay moving on
sorry I'm one of those guys who will be
in in like a class or whatever and I'll
say a joke and everyone is like and I'm
just the only one laughing at my own
joke
so yeah dude get some close reviews
there's software out there that can help
you with that so you can type your code
reviews but sometimes people overdo with
all the software's sometimes it's nice
just to get in a room with a bunch of
people who are super mean and they say
hey your code sucks you shouldn't work
here and you need a demotion but if you
can fix this a might work you know that
that happens sometimes but if you are in
that position you should really try to
encourage people not bring them down
okay the next biggest thing is automated
testing obviously we talked about that a
little bit but I think going into
automated testing is super important
because the things weak the more things
we can automate the less things we have
to do by hand so even if you have a
thousand or a couple thousand or tens of
thousands of little unit tests if it
saves you from hiring an entire team of
testing engineers it's worth it it
really is and you can usually find
software developers or software
engineers that have a little bit more
skill set and are able to do the testing
rather than hiring a designated test
writer and you might have to pay them a
little bit more but imagine paying a
software engineer an extra ten thousand
a year and saving yourself 6070 thousand
or whatever by not hiring a testing
engineer if you hired higher skilled
developers then you might actually save
yourself some money by not needing as
much staff and yeah there's always the
argument like oh well if you test it
takes away your time
you can't code as much but the reality
is is your test should be highly
coherent with your code so who is more
suitable to write your tests than the
actual person who wrote the code it
might take a little bit more time but
when you go back and work on that code
again you're going to understand at a
much deeper level because you wrote that
wrote all these tests verifying that the
software is doing what it's supposed to
be doing so you become intimately
involved with that codebase and it
becomes your baby as weird as that is I
have experienced that I wrote some
software and then I built a website and
they changed it and it was like right in
the heart you you took my baby so if you
haven't experienced that then you're
probably not as intimately involved with
the code as you should be and I ain't
saying no weird intimacy man just I'm
just saying get really familiar with the
code know it inside and out don't just
get it working and then move on know why
it works so that way you can fix
problems that come up so the next thing
this is a whole section so honestly I'm
contemplating breaking this off into its
own little livestream thingamajiggy but
AI what the heck I only got to get up in
like 6:00 in the morning so we got time
so continuous integration this is pretty
popular and it's pretty a big deal so
you need to learn about it so there's
three kind of steps and I'm not really
going to go into all the details of all
of them but there's continuous
integration continuous delivery
continuous deployment and they all are
kind of you know the same thing if you
think about it they're continuous
something if I can generalize a little
bit too much and essentially what this
stuff is designed to do is to make the
delivery of your software much smoother
much faster much bug free because the
problem that people are coming up with
is that you know the software needs
change so fast and they change a ton of
stuff on their local
they write this super-awesome software
on their laptop they commit it to the
repository
you know they commit 472 files with 200
terabytes of lines and then everyone
else tries their software and it doesn't
work and you get the the standard oh it
works on my machine syndrome and the
problem with that is is that people are
not committing their code regularly
enough probably because they're using
some crappy conversion
source control system like subversion or
Team Foundation server apologies if you
work for both either of those companies
but I'm a huge fan of the distributed
content management the distributed
source control management like git so
get some git get in your life and then
you will make your life better
so with that you can basically set up
some rules you can make some either
PowerShell scripts or some kind of
scripts with some kind of fancy language
and essentially when you make a commit
to your repository it's automatically
going to deliver those changes to a
testing environment or even to the
customers computer which is pretty cool
but that's dangerous because then anyone
could just commit whatever they wanted
and you know there's gonna be new
software out there that does
who-knows-what so there's rules with it
you can add specifically you can tie
these this build process of getting your
software out you can tie it to tests so
you can backup your your in to your
continuous delivery with tests now what
that means is let's say you have a
hundred unit test for your software and
you commit your changes to the
repository without running your tests
because you know we always forget to do
that kind of stuff and then the the
process of this continuous delivery is
going to pick up on that and say hey bro
your uh your uh test failed and it's
gonna stop there it's not going
to do anything with your code and you're
just gonna have to make the changes
until it works let's say your tests pass
well then it's going to move that over
into probably a testing environment
where you can you can then do some more
tests like blackbox testing for example
and then once that's approved you can
commit it even to the customers machine
which seems kind of crazy but it is a
possibility for example there's software
out there like octopus deploy which is
an example of this you can basically put
this little agent on all of anybody's
machines that you want this software to
go to and you can push the updates
automatically like that this is often
used for like internal stuff if you want
to update some software on everyone's
machines well you can set you can put
this little piece of software on all the
machines and send software out to all of
those machines so there's different ways
of doing that in different views is that
something you should even do or is that
just a really bad idea or is it an
awesome idea that's all probably the
opinion so feel free to have your own
and look it up and if you think it's
cool give it a try if you don't think
it's cool then you know unsubscribe and
never come to my channel ever again
because you know some people are
sensitive and that's what they like to
do not that I'm thinking of any people
or anything but that happens regularly
which is okay whatever if you don't like
my content that's okay I'm not gonna be
horribly offended just partially like
I'm so the other thing I want to mention
is the software verification and this is
something that is really super cool this
is what I mentioned at the beginning of
when it comes to craning bug free
software this is kind of like magic I
don't know a thing about it but I know
it exists so do you want to know more
about it
look up this thing coq10 it spelling but
whatever look that up it is it is a
you're looking up right now I'll tell
you what it is because I don't know what
this it's basically a way to write these
proofs to prove your software does what
it's supposed to do so the the
proof assistant and that is basically a
mathematical way to prove that your
software does exactly what it's supposed
to do so with this there are proven
compilers for example that don't have
any books
unlike some compilers which can have
bugs actually so this is really cool but
this is something that might be
interesting if you are looking for some
like serious top-of-the-line software
with no bugs you might want to look into
something like this it is a process it's
very let's just say I went to a little
session on it and it was like up here in
the knowledge and I was like down here
like bro I'm just trying to be an HTML
engineer I have no idea what you're
talking about but there was pizza so it
was very motivating so that's something
you might want to look into and that
could be really super cool because if in
theory you could replace the unit
testing with this proof testing well
then you could have less bugs and you
wouldn't have to have as many testing
engineers so that's kind of sweet that's
all I really got on software testing so
at this point I am going to start
looking at some questions but once again
I just wanted to interrupt with this
interruption sponsored by db2 this
database there will be videos coming out
soon so if you just jumped in the stream
half way through and you missed the
beginning what I told you is that I am
going to be producing a db2 series
that's going to be a great start for
those of you who don't have any database
experience or who are looking for a
database that can be used for multiple
different things because this database
starts at you know a free version and
can scale up to like super ginormous
enterprise fortune 100
any kind of stuff so crazy-cool database
with all kinds of cool features that
hopefully i will get to discuss in great
detail in addition to that I'm hoping to
have some blogs on it too so there will
be extra information this is a series
I'm going to put a lot of effort into
because iBM is going out of their way to
support my content so that is why I'm
going out of my way to make sure you
guys know that they are there supporting
my content and not only that but I
actually really like their database you
know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna sponsor
someone whose product is really lame
that'd be lame ok so question and answer
oh let's go to that live dashboard see
what we got
hey Caleb hey Scott what's up hi dude
back at you man Wow your bids about our
DB stuff was dope awesome man ok there's
literally no questions come on guys
what am I here for if I'm not here to
answer any questions there's gonna blab
her to a camera all day
you should really invest in a new mic
Caleb the one you are using currently is
clipping occasionally and is very
jarring when it happens yes yes I agree
this this stream is turd ok so yes my
microphone is pretty crappy my internet
is pretty crappy that is on the to-do
list I am going to work on that but it
is a process because it takes a lot of
time to figure all that stuff out and
figuring out a place where I can
actually do some streams rather in this
rather than in this bar
hey this is great you should do more of
this you bet you can I still watch the
podcast later yes these are
automatically published to my youtubes
so all the peeps from the inner tubes
you can check out this stuff later if
you have to work or if you have a life
or if you just don't feel like watching
me blabber right now that's fine I would
encourage you just play it in the
background listen to it and yeah great
stuff hopefully hopefully you can learn
I'm trying to make it very
conversational that's why I'm not gonna
give it a bunch of pictures and
confusing charts and stuff because
essentially I want this to be something
where you can listen to it learn some
stuff and apply it I'm not I'm not
teaching you how to configure a database
engine right now that's not the goal of
this this stream okay so literally I got
like no questions except the one about
watching this stream which isn't really
that helpful so I have some questions
that people asked previously that I
haven't really gotten to so I'm going to
continually try to find new questions
that people have asked that I've
basically ignored because I have
hundreds of them so the first one and
I'm generalizing the what they say but
hey Caleb questions currently in college
doing a project involving asking
questions of what it's like to be in a
computer programming community well if
you want to know what it's like to be in
a computer programming community I
suggest you check out like a meetups
calm or Meetup calm or whatever it is
and look for meetups in your local area
because you can actually find
communities on all kinds of different
stuff and that could be a really good
way for you to actually experience that
or if that is not reasonable if you
don't live around communities you can
join live streams like this or find some
kind of community online where you can
communicate with others so hopefully
that helps helps you figure that out
you have to ask questions what it's like
to be in a computer programming
community it's kind of confusing because
I feel like a teacher would actually
encourage you to find a computer
programming community and become a part
of it well maybe I'm not understanding
the question right and you're actually
asking something like what what it means
to be in computer programming and if
that is what you're asking I recommend
you watch yesterday's livestream which
was about computer science sorry my nose
is itching and I'm all like blip picking
my nose but I will try to refrain myself
Happy New Year I'll buy that last
question I was from Steven the next one
is Sayuri watched your video on YouTube
Oracle sequel my school my sequel MySQL
learn some database design wanted to
review it more in depth which database
do you think will benefit me most thank
you in advance to your new fan Sayuri
okay so the reality is is that all
relational databases are built off of a
standard SQL structured query language
it's a standard which means if you learn
one you can transfer a lot of that
information to another one so which one
will benefit you most I don't know if
there if there is a an exact answer it
really depends on what you're trying to
do what kind of job you're trying to get
what kind of staff you're working in so
if you're working in like the Microsoft
stack a lot of those kinds of jobs are
going to expect sequel server but if
you're working in a Java stack you might
expect MySQL Oracle or whatever if
you're going in an enterprise
programming so you might then be dealing
with Oracle or db2 with this new db2
series I'll be producing I would highly
recommend looking into that that link
here down on the screen is actually
where you can go to learn more about
that and give it a download for free so
that would be great to get started to
prepare for this series that will be
coming
in the next few weeks so that would be a
good start because I'm going to go on a
lot of depth on what a database is what
it means for to be a relational database
versus a non structured or an
unstructured database or actually db2
sports both so I'll be talking about
that my blogs so it's gonna be a little
bit more a little bit more tasty than my
other series that I've done where I just
kind of scratch the bare minimum this
one is going to scratch that minimum but
also scratch a little deeper and really
teach you some of the structural
importances of designing a database and
also how to apply that to a db2 database
which is phenomenal so hopefully that
answers your question if you are
completely new I would recommend finding
a free database so db2 works great but
there's all kinds of free ones out there
if if you think a different one would
suit your needs a little better okay
name Angie
hi help me with my SQL stored procedures
I have no idea how to do that well
fortunately for you I have a series on
that so let's try to show you how to
find it okay gonna switch to my fancy
screen give me just a sec okay I'm gonna
go to my youtube channel there it is
would you look at that okay if you go on
here go to the videos techno playlist
tab you can find all my tasty playlist
PHP and DreamHost we'll talk about that
in a little bit
what dream host is db2 database
clustering well you go in here and click
view 18 more find all kinds of cool
stuff on here so the one you were
looking for was MySQL stored procedures
so boom right there you go you got 10
videos on MySQL stored procedures
hopefully that's just what you're
looking for it kind of scratches the
surface surface on some of the syntax
and the things you're going to need to
know all right so that's that for that
question okay the next question hi I
just have one question if I finish my
web design using front-page
how can I publish or upload it as really
website as a real website please I need
an answer
thank you Mary the person's name was
Mary they weren't thanking Mary because
my name is not Mary so how do you
actually make your website a website
well honestly I don't know what front
page is but if if it's any more
complicated than what I'm going to
explain then you should probably use
something else to make your website if
you have HTML CSS that is what you need
for a website front-end
and that needs to be hosted or you can
self host it but I highly highly highly
highly advise against it for security
issues but you need to host that
somewhere that is able to deliver those
websites so the hosting provider that I
suggest is dreamhost
so let me share that link with you guys
I will paste that in the live stream it
is uh so you guys can hear me say it
they find it to kunis ctv m2 a bit dot
ly slash ctv em to dream host I will
paste that in the comments right here
and I will even up show you a little bit
what what dream host looks like so
you're not completely unfamiliar let me
just I'll load it up for you guys
I'll show you a couple cool things that
you'll need to know if you're going to
upload a website okay let me switch over
my screen here okay there we go so the
very first thing is ignore that for a
second let's focus on this dream post so
this is the dream host dashboard and you
can go in here and see all your domains
and a domain will be actually associated
with your files so you're going to need
to store your files in a folder by that
domain and then when you just go to that
domain it'll it'll show you the files so
if you go to Caleb curry com well this
is actually processing basically index
dot PHP but if you're using HTML it'll
work just the same way so you might have
something like slash index dot HTML for
example yeah so dreamhost is really good
because they offer you support and they
have really super good hosting for
example if you're doing something with
WordPress dream press is like your
heaven essentially for web hosting so
dream host is what I highly recommend
for if you're trying to set up a simple
website but there is also some other
content management systems the 1-click
installs over here and in here you can
actually basically install all of these
things super super easy so for example I
came in here I published a Joomla
website it was done simple as that
once you have your domain you can you
can buy a domain from dream host or if
you own it somewhere else such as
GoDaddy you can transfer it or change
the pointings of your website so it can
still work on GoDaddy once you got that
you're going to get a file transfer
protocol program such as FileZilla and
this will allow you to connect to
essentially this computer whatever is
hosting your website so whatever
computer is hosting this website I can
connect to that
and change my files around so once you
have your files on your computer your
HTML and your CSS you're going to go in
here with your host that's going to be
your website name you're going to pass
in your username and password for your
FTP user and then you're going to
connect once you're connected you can
literally just drag your files over to
your server and then refresh the page
hopefully it gets it hopefully it works
you will want to make sure that you know
you have an index dot PHP index dot HTML
home HTML something like that because
that is the one that's going to be
automatically rendered when you go to
your web address like this if you do
something like home like cool homepage
or something you're actually going to
have to type that in like this which is
not what you want for your home page
because it's it's more complex so you
don't want to do that
so yeah that's File Transfer Protocol
that's like the bare minimum basics but
if you do sign up with DreamHost there
is a referral link that I have that I
posted in the chat and you signup you
actually get some benefits if you sign
people up so I'm not just suggesting
dreamhost to make money I'm suggesting
it because this is what I've been using
for the last forever and they have been
one of the best web hosting experiences
that I've ever used I did try a
different web host I've used GoDaddy I I
didn't use go to that GoDaddy for web
hosting but I used it to buy a domain
and I hated it I actually transferred my
ownership of my domain to DreamHost
and that just makes it all a lot easier
but the cool thing is you can actually
go over here and down here and support
you can find all kinds of support stuff
obviously seeing contact support and go
in here hopefully it doesn't spill out
any important information but um on here
you can you can ask questions and you
can even so like let's say hey I'm
having a problem with my website well
you can chat with an agent live if it's
urgent or you can submit a ticket and
they have like a 24 hour response
they go over above and beyond what what
I would expect for support so if you're
having a problem setting up a website
they'll literally help guide you through
it so that's pretty awesome it kind of
kind of brings you into the more
advanced the more advanced web
development kind of stuff but you don't
necessarily have to be an expert because
you have a support team right there
waiting to help you
so hopefully that kind of gives you a
rundown yeah so that is what I would
recommend the most important thing is to
get your HTML and CSS files onto your
shared hosting or dedicated hosting
provider so three most offers both
there's a difference between shared
hosting is where you know multiple web
sites is ran from the same server or you
can buy a dedicated server if you're
getting like tons of views if you do go
for the the if you do go for something
with DreamHost I highly recommend just
starting with shared hosting unless you
know your website's gonna do really well
so shared hosting I do recommend getting
it for a year because one I think it's
cheaper on Dream
I think it's cheaper for you to sign up
for a year and you don't have to worry
about renewing it every month and the
bonus that is I receive is much higher
if you sign up for a year in fact I
almost get everything you pay for the
first year of hosting so it's you can
almost think of it as a way to support
this content is by signing up for a year
you have the website for a year and I
even have over on my channel you go to
my channel go to my playlist well that's
what I was talking about earlier I have
a series on here somewhere PHP MySQL in
dream host so if that's something you
want to set up a simple website with PHP
it's really super easy to do I talked
about grabbing data from a database and
displaying it in a web page
hosted with dream most so that'll kind
of give you your overall guide on how to
do everything it get started that'll
cover FTP all that good stuff
okay so that's all I got for the
questions right now I'll look at the
stream and see if you guys got anything
else let me go back to me see if you
guys got any questions it doesn't look
like you guys got any questions so I
think I'm gonna end it there before I go
I did just want to talk about a little
bit about what's coming up expect the
database clustering videos to be coming
out really Swift very quick because I'm
going to crank those out of the way and
that way you guys got the full series
available to you that'll get you started
with database clustering there are some
things that I've wanted to share with
you some videos that are out there that
that I'm featured in so I am going to
probably start sharing those with you
guys either next a lot probably in the
next live stream or in an upcoming one
so I'm going to try to use this as a as
a medium for for me just to keep you
guys updated on what's going on I'm
trying to run a more open business here
so what I mean by that is I'm going to
talk talk to you guys about the
processes I'm going through the
challenges of the making the videos and
the kind of content I get it
get produced so if you are interested in
more of that kind of stuff please leave
a comment on this stream ok some guy
actually asked someone asked a question
Sebastian which software do you use for
testing code well this is usually
software the software you use is usually
programming language dependent so the
testing software you use for c-sharp
might be different than the testing
software use for Java there is probably
some Universal testing software out
there but if we're talking like c-sharp
there's testing frameworks such as n
unit X unit and stuff like that so
there's all kinds of different options
and I don't have a recommended hey this
is the software suite you need to get so
hopefully that answers your question
and yeah guys I am really really excited
yeah so one of the people commented
about my horrible microphone I
understand that it's not the best and I
think even today some of the stream
kicked out which is a problem so if you
guys like this content I am going to be
thinking of ways to improve that
hopefully by you know by the end of the
year we can have some really sweet live
streams with a co-hosts or special
guests and even some stuff that I'm
really really excited about that I've
been thinking about for a while so one
of the things with running a tutorial
channel is you know this stuff is so
it's it's pieced to where it's a
tutorial but it doesn't necessarily
teach you all of the stuff so I want to
do something where I I'm kind of doing
tutorials still but at a more production
level so what I mean by that is it
almost like we're pair programming but
there's multiple of you guys and you
guys are just watching the program I
guess but rather than you know me
planning hey this is exactly what I want
to do in this video I'm just going to
come up with some software that I want
to build and we are going to build that
together from start to end and it just
sounds so awesome because I have some
sweet apps that I want to build for this
channel for my business so why not make
an open-source project that I can have
you guys the community contribute to and
we can actually go through all of the
processes of programming and application
a good application with you know all
that testing stuff I'm talking about
unit tests continuous integration with
build servers all of that so you can get
the start to end experience of building
that application and what you can do is
you can you can even you could even do
the same kind of thing with an app for
yourself and use that as a resume piece
you can use that to build your resume
because you can say hey I have this
application that I built and this this
uses you know this uses a db2 database
and it's hosted in the cloud I here's
how I configured the connection to the
database here's how I use source control
so show like hey we're using a git
source control and we're using
continuous integrations so if I make
this change on on this branch and then
refresh the website or whatever whatever
we're working on you can see those
changes immediately and you can tie
those tests to that to see if your
software is working the way it's
supposed to work it's really nice to you
know make tutorials and all those little
pieces like oh how to setup continuous
integration but it doesn't really give
the full picture and it doesn't
necessarily mean you know how to program
or what or anything like that so with
that there's going to be some challenges
because I need to figure out how in the
world do I make good open-source
software and show the whole process when
I'm using stuff that is not supposed to
be shared for example if I'm using an
API key that's something you generally
don't just hand out to the entire world
because then people can do stuff with
your account blah blah blah blah you
don't want to do that so I'm thinking of
how in the world am I going to do this
and there's also going to be some some
level of openness with this because I'm
going to come up with issues no not
intentionally but you know I'm gonna do
bug tracking and I'm gonna find bugs
because every software is gonna have
bugs and then I'm going to try to debug
them and you're gonna see the whole
process but the challenge for me is you
know this is new to me as well like I've
done some of this stuff and I'm sure
some of you guys have worked with some
of the stuff I'm mentioning but building
you know an entire platform from
beginning to end all open-source with
community contributions bug free using
testing continuous integration hosting
in in the cloud or whatever we're
hosting it on all of that for a really
big good software application is
actually a very challenging task so I'm
trying to figure out ways that I can do
that without you know spending a three
four-hour session debugging something
you know what I'm saying
I'm trying to I'm trying to figure out
the balance okay how much of this do I
want to record and how much of this am I
just going to show I'm leaning towards
more by show I just mean like oh here I
fixed this bug here's how I did it I'm
leaning more towards showing you the
whole process like hey let's fix this
bug together leave some comments if you
guys have any suggestions what the
challenge of that is I may or may not be
able to fix the bug and I will probably
make myself look like a total idiot in
front of hundreds of people over the
course of the videos lifespan which I'm
totally cool with I make myself look
like an idiot all the day long I'm
actually really good at it yeah
something I said in just last night's
stream someone was like brah
dude you that doesn't even make sense
cuz someone asked me like oh what's my
favorite pastimes right and you know
being analytical and super intelligent
like I am I was like pastimes okay so
these are the things that you've spent
your time on in the past right so times
of the past but no English doesn't work
that way pastimes are your hobbies
how how have I not known that I've lived
twenty thousand months no way no how
long about twenty thousand I don't know
why I picked twenty thousand basically
I've lived a long time and I didn't know
that say that's proof and I'm just
showing you that I'm totally cool with
looking like an idiot
because you're all probably thinking
while this guy's an idiot so yeah I'm
blabbering now but that's kind of fun
because uh
this is fun I'm enjoying it but in the
next six months hopefully we can upgrade
the potato potato mic in the potato can
set up a studio get some sweet HD cams
and show the whole process beginning
from beginning to end of developing an
application that's what I want to do I
am thinking of there's others some some
other stuff that I'd like to share with
you guys before I go let's talk about oh
I've got to stop itching my nose okay
let's talk about analytics and some
website stuff so I've been working on my
website some and getting some more blogs
up there because I'm trying to grow that
platform YouTube is a platform but my
website is my own platform so it's kind
of a higher value in a sense and can be
monetized in more creative ways so that
is why I'm really pushing the website
development it's a it's a new way for me
to reach an audience and it's not in
contrast to my YouTube channel it's uh
it's actually a supplement to my youtube
channel so by building my website I'm
not I'm not taking away from my YouTube
channel I'm actually helping my youtube
channel and my YouTube channel helps my
website I'm already creating all this
content on YouTube I might as well take
a couple extra minutes put it on my
website to grow that as well oh I do
want to talk about monetization with
websites and how to do that because
that's something I'm learning as well
because I've really really neglected the
website over these years just because I
like making videos and I don't really
like writing blogs that much but I can
deal with it but one of the most
important things is page views and also
unique visitors how many pages does a
unique visitor view
and those are the kind of numbers that
you can calculate to decide when you can
start really monetizing on a website
more than enough research shows that if
you are reaching 100,000 page views per
month you should be able to make a
full-time income off of your website
well I'm almost there I am about 2,000
page views a month so I just got a
couple thousand more to go
and I will be integrating new content
and new ways of sharing cool stuff with
you guys specifically software systems
that are out there for people would it
sponsor me so for example not only will
I have these live streams in these
videos as a sponsorship medium but I
will be able to share that stuff on my
website to thousands of people so
obviously that's something I'm
interested in and I think most of you
guys should be interested in that kind
of stuff too because it's not all about
it's not all about programming it's
about how do I make a living doing
something I love well I love doing this
YouTube stuff I love doing the content
creation
I love making myself look like a total
idiot in front of hundreds of thousands
of people and something is thrilling
about it you know I can go I can go find
a programming job and I enjoy it but
this is what I really really enjoy doing
so with it when it comes to web content
we are going to be talking about why you
should write a blog why you should
figure out ways to monetize that blog
and how to monetize and also just how to
get new traffic how to build your resume
blogs are a huge resume bonus kind of
thing so yeah that's what I got for the
upcoming streams and that is all I got
for you guys today so enjoy your night
and hopefully we'll be doing this
tomorrow or really soon so thanks guys
and peace out and I got to stop this
stream
