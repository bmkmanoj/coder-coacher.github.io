microphones both of the blue brand so we
have the blue Yeti and the blue snowball
and I'm just going to do a quick
comparison these I'm not going to get
too in-depth and I'm just going to do
basically commentary just to see what
they sound a couple things you should
note this is on a shock mount what a
shock mount does is it absorbs a
transition of sound through a metal
basically these are Springs here so it
doesn't affect the audio as much now
there's a couple other things on the
back we have the gain settings and the
pattern settings so gain is basically
how impactful the audio will be once
it's recorded so if I crank this up it's
going to be louder I crank this down
it's going to be quieter pattern that is
the direction of sound you want to
record so we have bi-directional and so
forth so I'm going to use the third one
for this which is cardioid which
basically just if you're just talking in
front of it the blue snowball has some
similar settings a little different
though we have numbers here one two and
three one is for single user voice or
instrument two is for things that are
louder and might cause you know
distortion three is four groups of
voices or instruments and I do not have
a shock mount for this but it's not
going to have a big drastic effect on
the actual sound and it's on the normal
stand that came with it I believe yep
now that audio that you just heard was
recorded with the blue Yeti and I'm
going to just test that out a little bit
more so I'm going to pick it up and I
don't think it'll affect this sound too
much holding it especially with the
shock mount am i affected slightly but
this is the best way so I'm not like
down here like trying to talk to it so
this is on medium gain it's on the end
so you're supposed to talk directly into
it not like this or like this although
if it's slightly tilted it's not going
to have a drastic effect on the quality
of the sound and if you want it to be
louder you can either talk closer to the
microphone or you can increase the gain
so now it's louder I don't
cause it to distort the so I'm talking
quieter not being said with you being
this close it can cause some problem so
I recommend a pop stopper or a pop
filter or a popper stop or whatever you
want to call it this will basically
reduce the impact the force of your air
so it's going to stop P's B's other
letters that are Papa Pollock where you
blow a bunch of air out and that's going
to improve the quality of your sound but
this is not really required if you're
not going to need it but if you're going
to be like let's say turning the game
down really low and talking like right
here to get that deep sound basically
the closer you are to the microphone the
deeper it's going to sound and basically
if you're going to do this you
definitely need a pop filter because
otherwise it's going to sound like this
which just doesn't sound good so this
here is the blue snowball
now hopefully I'm at the right space
from it I'm not distorting anything this
is on number one setting on the back
which is for single user voice or
instrument recordings so basically it's
like the standard now if you're going to
be really close to the microphone you
might want to move it to position two
which is going to lower the basically
the gain there's no gain knob on this
microphone like there is for the blue
Yeti although there is that setting to
decrease the gain I believe by 10
decibels so let's just hear that so this
is where it's going to decrease the gain
but that allows you to speak closer once
again with a microphone like this you
might want a pop filter so let me
illustrate that this is with a pop
filter now from what I've noticed the
blue Yeti sounds a little louder
compared to this one but you can put it
back to the standard settings which is
going to make that louder and then
finally we have the third setting which
is going to be like for a full room for
example that's going to sound the worst
if you're doing a commentary but if
that's what you like go for I mean
there's no real limitation right now
overall both of the microphones sound
really great if you're limited on money
you can go for there
but if you're looking for long run I
recommend this because I think this is
more dynamic on what it can do
especially with the custom gain settings
another feature of the blue Yeti is that
has a mute button so basically if you
want to at any time change your audio or
basically mute what's going in you press
the mute button there's also a headphone
jack which works as its own driver so
you can record on this if I put these
headphones on with the blue Yeti I can
get them off here that's going to allow
me to hear what's going on on my
computer and what's going on in real
life because the audio hits the
microphone comes in through my
headphones so it's good for recording so
I can hear what's going on and it's good
because I can hear what's going on in my
computer the blue snowball does not have
a feature like that although it is still
still pretty awesome
Oh
you
so yeah dudes I know I'm not the best
guitar player ever but you can get like
the kind of the idea overall I think the
Yeti you kind of pones
the blue snowball no offence snowball
you're good but you're not loud enough
you're so quiet
I can't hear anything see you guys let
me know what you think you like it like
if you disagree just leave comment let
me know which what you're thinking yeah
they're both good though I like them
both thank you and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
