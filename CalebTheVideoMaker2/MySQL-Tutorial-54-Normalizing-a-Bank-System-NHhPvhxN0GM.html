I don't know a number it is I'm sorry I
would keep track but it's just so
difficult but anyway some this video
will be covering the star of a banking
system now first thing you want to do
when you're building a database is to
find what your goal for the database is
to be right so gold that's what I'm
going to write down cool now it's a
banking system and you're going to be
able to do transaction so transferring
money from one account to another and
that's basically all it's gonna do it's
gonna be very simple maybe some interest
concepts and savings accounts I'm not
too sure yet
but it's gonna be sweet whatever it is
it's gonna be awesome so the goal is
money transactions it's not always a bad
idea to write down notes I do it
sometimes so yeah that's our goal money
transactions transactions so yeah umm
then you want to define what you want to
store within your database don't worry
about tables yet just to figure out
everything you want to store and I
actually wrote a list of these and I'm
gonna write them up here here's
everything I want to store I want to
store the person's name where they live
their phone number their email their
password for like online banking montt
how much money they have or don't have
and an access code what an access code
almost like a banking pin to allow
access to the banking features so you
can sign in to your account but to do
certain things you may need an access
code I know that's kind of confusing but
the access code is used for extra
security and to record
how encryption works right so this is
everything I want to store and the next
thing you do is follow the normalization
process or figure out what kind of data
types there yeah figure out what kind of
data types they are and in more
specifics but I'm going to go in the
normalization process first because it's
really simple and also I need the proper
columns
in order to define what datatypes they
will be for example address I'm going to
break that up into country state city
and then address for like the specific
road address and then um area code so
that'll be five columns for the address
then the names gonna be first name last
name money this this is going to go into
a new table because money isn't really
related to the person may be thinking
some about the access code and password
they're not really related to the person
but you're kind of right but then again
this is just for a banking system so the
information for the person doesn't have
to be specific you don't have to say
person's information and then the
person's banking information because
that well that table would only really
store the password for their bank
account so I'm just gonna include that
with the person's information that's an
example of where normalization is you
can choose what to do because I don't
really think that's going to help out
having another table for that the access
code will be for each account not each
person so what this means the access
code where it's my big piece of chalk
the access code is going to go with the
account so we have a count over here the
money's gonna go with the account the
access codes gonna go with account but
the password is gonna go with the person
so this is how it's gonna be broken up
you see none I kind of just just that's
why get a chalkboard draw your ideas or
a piece of paper draw what your ideas
helps to clear things up in your brain
sometimes you're not really sure what to
do and just have to try things too so
you also want to try it on the computer
sometimes see how things work out
in the next video I will be talking
about specific data types for each one
of these columns and why we chose those
data types this will be a great review
from the beginning of this series
because that was like forever ago so
we're going to go for some data types
also things we need to know about
encryption for data types and then also
how long how big the data type should be
such as like varchar' 20 you'll
understand so catch you there and
subscribe like my video think you can
