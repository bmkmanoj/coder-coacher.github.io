curry and this is our MySQL tutorial
like 100 probably something I don't know
so I just wanted to review what I taught
you in the last session per video or
lesson or whatever you want to call it
about court family so we have the tonic
which has the first third and sixth and
the reason for this is we have seen E
which fit nicely with the third chord
sorry uh we have E and G which fit
nicely with the third chord then we have
C and E which fit nicely with the sixth
chord makes sense so then for the
sub-dominant we have Fna which fit
nicely with the F and a of the D major
chord now for a dominant we have B D F
for the seventh and then G B D for the
fifth so the overlapping notes are B and
D so here are said to be our chord
family so these fit with these those fit
with those in this fit with these so now
when we're creating music sometimes we
don't want simple okay we're gonna go to
the fifth and then the fourth back to
the fifth and then back to the tonic and
okay we're done sometimes that's not
good enough
and you want to switch things up to give
a new emotional effect or just to add
some more whatever that is to your music
so you may want to switch chords or what
we call chord substitution so you may
hear this escort substitution
no space or you may hear it as
reharmonization reharmonization
basically sometimes when you don't
necessarily want to resolve it on the
tonic you can resolve it on one of these
other notes and it will sound fitting
enough to fit the music this goes hand
in hand with chord inversions we have
the first inversion and the second
inversion so this is basically just flip
the notes around to create new music
it's all the same chord and the same
feeling but it doesn't sound quite the
same and I can show you that on this
little keyboard here C major chord C
major chord wait no sorry think C major
chord dang this is so C major chord
c-major quote so close C major chord C
major chord okay I'm gonna get it right
this time
C major chord C major chord they sound
different but there's still the same
chord so when when we're working with
this what we can do is instead of having
the because typically the fifth right
here points back to the tonic the fourth
here points either to the fifth or back
to the tonic these are too tight what I
said earlier a cadence pulls us back to
the tonic we go from the fifth this is a
big mess I know but it's okay when we go
from the fifth to the tonic that is a
cadence known as an authentic cadence so
five to one is an authentic when we go
from the four to one it's a play goal
cadence I'll write those out when we get
some space so rather than going back to
the tonic we can try going back to the
third in the scale and create some new
music and it won't
it sounds fitting because of the shared
notes but it doesn't give the same feel
for example
that sounds different than it's broken
alright that sounds different than a
minor because one's minor ones major for
one plus the tonic is what's resolving
the entire piece of music or an entire
section of music or starting an entire
piece of music so sometimes I don't want
that we can try swapping it for one of
these chords same thing for the dominant
we go to the seventh which creates a lot
of unsettling sounds it's called
dissonance which we'll get in that later
it doesn't sound quite right it wants to
pull us back up to the tonic same thing
with the G or in this case the G the
fifth always wants to pull back to the
tonic so does this it wants to pull back
to the tonic so let me clear this up a
bit what we have learned today today is
Cadence's we had authentic and play goal
I think that's a precedent authentic
cadence is a resolution from the fifth
back to the tonic then we have play gold
which is a fourth back to the tonic and
just like how we have the fifth I'm
sorry the fifth wanting to pull back to
the tonic so does the seventh because
it's what is because this is the leading
tone which pulls us back to the tonic so
that's an example of chord substitution
rather than going to the fifth we can
try going to the seventh diminished
chord which will add more color
or flavor to your music rather than
going out of the scale or having crazy
chords for example we can have a crazy
inverted C major with a with a sharp v
and add 13 blah blah blah but and
sometimes it's just too much and we just
want to simplify things so what we can
do is just try chord inversions and
using chords within these three chord
families rather than the tonic the
fourth and the fifth all of the time so
that's all I have to say for this video
and the next video I'll be going over
something of course so yeah see you then
yeah bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
