over column features now oh man
you may not know what that means and
that's okay
but we've actually went over one of
these already if you remember from our
previous videos we went over something
that will assign or unsigned so what
this means is a signed value will allow
negative x' and an unsigned value will
not so if you just put a column into a
database if you don't say anything it'll
become it'll be a signed value but if
you want it to not allow negatives you
tell it to be an unsigned value this is
a column feature and there is actually
some more of them that I'll be going
over right so the next one I'll be going
over is null which is spelled and ull
and this should actually be capitalized
but I'm not going to go fix it it takes
too much time um basically null is it
requires an entry so basically we try
I'm trying to think how to explain this
and easy if something is null it does
not have a value it is nothing so let's
say it asks for a number and you put 0
this is not null even though it's 0 it
just sort of like nothing it's still an
entry no is nothing so if you want to
prevent people from putting in nothing
you claim it to be not know which is
another column feature so if it's an
unsigned not null that means it has to
have a value that is positive the third
one I'll be going over is auto increment
so for this I'll be giving you an
example let's say you have a website and
you post a blog on there and you can
allow people to add comments down at the
bottom now for each comment you would
want each one to be assigned a primary
key to keep it unique this means comment
with the ID of
third would be insert comment here but
um what you want you want that to be
Auto incremented so basically when
somebody goes to the forum to submit a
comment it'll say the message and submit
there's not a little box asking for
column ID that's ridiculous
so what will happen if this person
submits a comment and it's ID number 400
the next one will automatically be 401
that's auto incrementing and that is a
column feature so let's go over this we
have a number that is unsigned and
unsigned means there's no negatives it
also is not null so we have unsigned not
null
this means it has to have a positive
value it has a value that's positive
which means you can't not have a value
it has to have a value and it's also
auto increment which means when you
submit auto increment as a column
feature it will go up by one each time
so the next column feature I'll be going
over is default now we have Auto
increment here and we have to fall here
they're kind of similar but they're
different Auto increment will go to one
up each time whereas default if nothing
is entered into a not null then it'll
give it something so let me explain this
a little bit more we're not going to use
a column with Auto increment because you
don't need a default it does it itself
the default for an auto increment is one
more so we have an entry and asks for
your state where you with
if you do not click anything let's say
there's 450 options and you don't click
anything then the default will be
California that that's an example of a
default it's a horrible example but it's
an example so basically if you have it
for okay you have an unsigned what you
do not need for this case because it's a
state you can't have a negative state so
this is not a good call and feature it's
unnecessary and it's not going to work
out right we have it not null which
means you can't leave it blank and if
you do leave it blank it'll
automatically assign it as California if
this was not not null then that you
can't do this it'd just be entered
Clinic which would be no not a empty
string the last column feature I want to
go over is zero fill that's spelling
this zero fill another thing with zero
fill is has to do with zeros at the
beginning so let's say you have a value
Oh
16 and when you store that in the
database it's going to get rid of this
unless you have zero fill turned on if
you do not have zero fill let's cover
this up then you'll get stored 16 which
isn't horrible because 0 0 16 and 16 are
the same number and it technically but
um let's say zip codes sometimes they
may start with 0 so like 0 1 4 3 is 5
like this and you store it in a non 0
filled column it will store as 1 4 3 5
and that'll get some confusion and maybe
some errors if you're doing something
crazy so interview here are all the
column features we went over unsigned
does not allow negative values so 0 to
255 rather than negative 128 to 127 not
null requires you to enter something so
if it asks you for your phone number you
have to put in your phone number and if
you don't
go to a default value if you if you
don't have a default value it'll give
you an error if you do have a default
value it will give you the default value
of zero zero zero blah blah blah and the
reason for this is because it can
actually improve them and improve
performance using normal columns so
that's what default is it's a default
value if nothing is entered into a
nominal value Auto increment that will
actually count for you sub one each
entry used usually used for IDs because
you want them all to be different and
you don't have to manually type one two
three four all the way up to like six
bit chilly and however many you have has
way too much effort and we don't like
putting effort into things right no I
was kidding so uh that's what Auto
increment will do it'll count for you
zero fill pads things to the left with
zeros like this this would be a four
digit padded v zero fill number and also
it'll retain zeros if it's entered if
this is entered originally it would turn
it to fifteen but if you have zero fill
on it'll keep it with the zero so it'll
be entered as this and retrieved at this
so that's all the colon features will be
going over and you better see me in the
next video because it's only going to
get all summer so yeah subscribe and
I'll see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
