video I will be talking about the case
operator it's very similar to the if
function but it's tad different so let
me explain it starts with this we're
going to select something like always
always select and we're going to select
the name and any other column that we
may one such as the ID or anything like
that in order to do this we say case and
then we say a column to test and I'm
going to test the name called just like
the if statement last time tested the
name to see if it was Caleb curry or not
so case name and then we say when and
then when it is something do something
so when it when is Caleb curry what we
do is say then then we display awesome
that says awesome by the way and then
what we do is create what is called an
else statement else even more awesome so
let me show you how this works this will
test this column name and when it's
Caleb curry then we're going to display
awesome otherwise or else is as it is
written even just display even more
awesome a very first thing is we say
what call in the test when it is
something then something else something
else very similar to the if because if
you remember the if function it was test
something if it is then do this if it's
not do this so if we were to like submit
this for the if statement it would be
the case name this is what we're testing
we're testing the name when it's equal
to Caleb curry so one name is equal to
Caleb curry
then do something say awesome and when
it's not say even awesomer yes you get
the point that's how that works
basically we're just spreading it out to
take up more space which you're probably
like why do we want to do that well for
one it may be easier to read for some
people because all we're doing is
testing a column and when it's something
then do something else do something else
now some of you may realize that this is
very similar to the if function so why
would we even use this well the reason
is we can actually test it against
multiple things this else statement can
actually be removed if if necessary for
example if you don't want an else you
need to say if the name's Caleb curry
then awesome otherwise don't don't worry
about it
but we can actually say another one when
it when a name because we're still
testing the name cool so now if your
name is John it's cool you're cool and
then you can say when TS is our initials
by the way wanna buy a keyboard it's an
inside joke sorry
so now we have three wins wins for a
year right here right here so we're
testing the name when the name is Caleb
curry then awesome
when name is John then cool when name is
TS then wanna buy a keyboard that is how
a basic case operator works so thank you
for watching my name is Caleb and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
