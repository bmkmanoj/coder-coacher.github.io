finally going to be talking about cord
Cadence's I've mentioned these a lot and
I'm finally to the point where I'm going
to be able to describe each one
individually and what the use for each
one is like I mean I don't really know
the use for all of them but I can tell
you the effectiveness for each one to
reach for resolution that is so the
first thing we have is a perfect cadence
that is anything from V to I so the v to
the tonic or v7 either one this is a
perfect authentic cadence is what it's
called it's the most effective form of
resolution and then the next one is
imperfect cadence which is anything like
v to the loo tonic but a little
alteration such as a chord inversion of
the v or replacing the v
with a diminished a third above it such
as instead of a G we could use a B
diminished because it B diminished can
replace the G that's an imperfect
authentic cadence because it's like this
one but it's not this it's not an actual
perfect authenticates so next one is
playable that is from the fourth chord
to the tonic so rather than going G to C
we'd go F to see now I have these two
other ones we haven't heard of yet half
and interrupted half is where we stand
what is it where we end on G so yeah
this is where we would ant not G this is
where we would end on v instead of the
tonic and the key of C it would be
ending on G sorry I'm trying to give you
examples but it's not always anything on
G so for in the key of G and B G a B C D
be ending on D instead of G so that's
where you end on the G and the last one
we have is interrupted that is where we
go from v to anything but the tonic so
not the tonic and if you don't know what
the little exclamation mark means before
the I go check out my MySQL tutorial
series and you'll learn lots about that
and lots of other cool things so yeah
that's what the interrupted cadence is
so we have the perfect and imperfect the
play --gel and then the half and
interrupt it so sort of like three
groups I guess they're not really
official groups just a quick review
perfect often indicates v to tonic and
perfect something like v to the tonic
play go forth to the tonic half is
ending on v and interrupted its from v
to anything but the tonic these are said
to be weak Cadence's in my last video I
call it play GLE a weak cadence but it's
not technically weekend's I was
preferring weak as in it's not as
effective as the perfect authenticators
so this one is the most effective the
imperfect is probably the second most
effective it may be the play it kind of
just depends on what you're replacing v
with then I would say be half and then
the interrupted it just kind of depends
so it all depends on what chords you had
known obviously oh my gosh what if
you're going from V to V five to five
then it's an interrupted half cadence
it's like two Cadence's in one oh my
gosh alright so yeah that's pretty much
all I have to say about the chord Kansa
this is a pretty short video but I'm not
gonna waste your time so see you in the
next video if you would like to support
me please subscribe or I'll give you a
checklist subscribe very first thing
subscribe but don't mm-hmm oh yeah just
subscribe subscribe subscribe like like
this video and all the other videos in
this series if you wish if you need
technical support or you want business
topics or anything cool like that go
check out my Facebook page you want to
follow me personally follow my Twitter
but don't put don't post questions like
program how do I make a major chord on
there that's where you can go to my
Facebook account and send me a message
unless it's like something really simple
in short so that's all I have to say I
thought I'd just waste some time
advertising since a short video but I
will see you in the next video thank you
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
