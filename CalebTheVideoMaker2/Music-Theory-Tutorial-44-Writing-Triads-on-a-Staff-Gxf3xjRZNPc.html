triads out on paper it takes a little
bit more work or I should say on a staff
because it's not always on paper but
it's really not that much work so we
make the five lines
I hope you can see this good and clear
pick clef where we used trouble class
for now cuz I like treble clef cuz it's
awesome
but for those bass bassist out there
it's basic school too
now off to make it a triad right on the
one for some reason I forgot the word we
pick let's say we're going to make a G
major triad G major triad start on G
cool hey and then we create the three
notes you remember we always space them
so if they're on the lines are all three
of the lines then we make sure the the
interval sizes are correct and that most
people with all right there's two way to
do this I could create the first note
it's probably the better way to do it
here and then from G I travel up four
one two three four okay I have a B and
then a B travel up three one two three
create a D or what you can do is create
all three and then see if they're right
so do I need to add any sharps or flats
basically what you figured out now let's
try a different one that's actually has
some sharps and flats in it let's go for
a D sharp major scale no I don't know
why I keep saying scale major triad
so here's D down here which means all
three notes are going to be in this
space you see me here so you can see and
my battery's low it's gonna die
alright so D sharp major triad we sharp
this note and then we find D here's D
travel up D sharp now I travel up for to
make a major third one two three four D
G alright that seems alright so we just
draw a DS sharp then we draw G Oh
there's a space there what's that mean
that means either we did something wrong
or we threw in something right so here's
d-sharp one two three four this is
actually an F double sharp the reason
for this is because we have to keep it
on the F remember the first rule no
one's gonna know what this is but if
it's like this with a double sharp it
will make sense because that's telling
the person to play a G even though it's
written as an F hopefully that's all
good help you hopefully that makes sense
there in harmonic member that word so
even though it's played like this it's
written as an F because if it wasn't
we'd have this gap here and it would
confuse people as they wouldn't
automatically know it's a triad because
most triads are written like this unless
they're in an inversion which we'll get
into that later so we de chartres
two three four one two three so is this
a sharp or B flat well we know it's not
flat because we can't mix sharps and
flats remember so it must be a sharp and
that is our good example I was actually
I just picked a random one those pretty
good so that is how to create edgy sharp
major try it let's try a different one
we'll use black this time get tired of
green oh just look what just happened
you see that you see it it's gone
generic guess I'm gonna thread yeah
that's good that's good that's good now
let's create mmm-hmm F sharp major scale
so here's an F not scale try it gosh
dang it so that means we're going to
fill in these spots but let's try it the
other way we're going to fill them as we
go we're going to create F sharp major
triad not scale
here's F F sharp so go for up from here
one two three four so that'd be a sharp
or B flat one of the two well we know it
can't be B flat because then we'd have
to put it here there'd be a space so it
has to be a sharp and then from a sharp
we travel three one two three C sharp
that sounds good to me
cool yeah it is pretty sweet so let's
try let's try making an a minor chord
well if you remember all we have to do
is flatten the middle note so take this
sharp away boom we got a minor let's try
making a diminished one boom a sharp
diminished let's try making an Augmented
one well we actually had both these back
create this double sharp because the
major that's and to create a major into
Augmented we raise the top note a half
step to create a sharp Augmented chord
so that's the basis of figuring writing
out chords on the sheet music this is
pretty important thing to know how to do
so make sure you don't be make sure
you're very careful between the inner
harmonics like be sharp and see see make
sure you know where to write it on the
line you have to be sure to cover the
proper scale degrees such as the score
this one's broken if we're in the if
we're an a chord the notes we need to
use are the root the third and the fifth
so a b c d e so we need AC ace so if if
we even have to use like e double sharp
and c double sharp for some crazy chord
well then that's that's the way it has
to be unless you want to create a
different chord that sounds the same
what you can do that so thank you for
watching and I keep cutting my head off
but that's okay so see you soon and
subscribe thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
