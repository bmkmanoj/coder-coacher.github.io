be taking a quick break from joins that
we've been discussing for the last eight
or so videos and we will be discussing
something that's a little unrelated but
kind of related does that make sense but
anyways we will be discussing aliases so
an alias is when you rename something
and you gave it kind of like a nickname
or more of a user friendly name or a
name that you are more used to seeing
and you can do this when you're writing
select statements and SQL and you can do
that to either make it easier to write
or easier to read so when you want to
give a table an alias you will use the a
S or as keyword and that's going to say
anything that follows as we will is what
we want to call the table so let's say
we had that user table and instead of
using user you wanted to say a customer
well then when you use the table and the
rest of the query and you use your
joints rather than using user you can
use customer and often you won't take a
short name and make it into something
longer you will do something like
replace user with a u and then instead
of you doing user dot user ID you would
be you die user ID that's an example of
an alias when you do it on tables it's
often to make the select statement
easier but you can also do it for
columns now when you do it on a column
it's going to work a little differently
so on a select statement you put all
your columns at the top so here's just
an example of what you might say to a
database you're going to select the
email first name and last name when you
use an alias with columns not only do
you change what the column is column but
it's going to change what it's presented
as so when you get that new structured
view that generated table and it looks
something like this rather than saying
email first name or last name you can
make it say email FN oops
FN ln4 first name last name or you can
take out that
underscore and you can replace it with
you know first space name this works
similar in the way that the other alias
works for the tables except you put it
right after the column so you could say
select email as contact comma first name
as and then you put in quotes got a
quoted that's because you're telling it
this is what you want it to be you want
to put it in quotes so that way it's
understood to be a string you can see
here I put that space there and it's not
the quotes that can just cause a problem
okay see all that that's basically how
an alias works you can take the alias to
make things easier to write easier to
present and also it can change the way
the view looks so it looks more pretty
right in the next video we're going to
be talking about joints that you
reference the same table or a self join
and basically you're going to take the
table you have and basically tell ask yo
you want to make a copy of it
essentially and join these two tables
which are the same and the only way
that's going to work is if you give it
an alias so this table will be called t1
and this would be T 2 for example so
that's an example of one you would use
an alias
other than renaming your columns or your
tables so thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
