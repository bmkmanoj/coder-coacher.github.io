It doesn't work. As you can see mine does work.
but you may get something such as busy. And this is often 
a problem with the ports. So if you don't know much about ports that's ok but basically
we communicate through port 80. If it's not working that means something else is using port 80
So what this means is that we need to change what port we're using
So what we can do is click config right here and click the top one Apache
and in parenthesis httpd.conf
click that and this is what comes up scroll down some
Look for listen 80
change that to something else such as 82
and then file
save and then you can exit out of it.
Now restart you're system here
and hopefully it turns green and everything works and as you can see it's now on port 82
if still something doesn't work that means a different problem
is the cause of why it's not working. So if we refresh this page you can see
it still doesn't work. Well now we have to access
our website by putting a colon 82. and now it brings us to our website
So that's how to quickly change you're ports in Xampp
and that's all I have to say.
