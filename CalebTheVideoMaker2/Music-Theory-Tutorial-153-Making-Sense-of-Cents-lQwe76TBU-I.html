talked about equal temperament and we
did that funky math equation well I have
good news for you and bad news for you
which one you want first can't hear you
I wanted that one too all right I'll
stop being like little kid shows all
right
we're going to still have a math
equation in this one but it's very
simple compared to that last one so I
promise I'm not gonna be doing math for
the rest of this series there's really
not that much math involved in music
theory besides like fractions and powers
of the 18th squared root of 63
occasionally but nothing too difficult
so let's go we're going to be talking
about what's known as cents s e and s so
not like money if you're from America
not cents as in money we're talking
since as in frequency this is a term
used for frequencies so we already know
the terms half-step whole-step semitone
tone die tone tritone well since our
sorta like those intervals
I mean steps although they're smaller so
now we take one half-step and we assign
this to 100 since it's practically a
dollar I get it
cents because I made that money thing
earlier than 100 cents so now we can
basically go more accurate in the
specifics in frequency so this is
specifically used often times for
different tuning systems that alter
pitches by just a couple of cents rather
than a whole half step so let's say if
it's if it's not a but it's not an
a-sharp it's somewhere in between we
could say it's an egg plus 30 cents or
specific amount of cents or so forth so
that is what this is used for right so
yeah one half step is assigned 100 cents
so how many half steps are in an octave
if you don't know this by now it's 12
and I guess I could go through that see
C sharp D d sharp e F f-sharp G g-sharp
a a sharp B 2 C that is back to C that's
12 half steps and if one half step is
100 C that means an octave is equal to
21
I mean 1200 see this 100 times twelve is
twelve hundred or a thousand two hundred
you need to figure out how to increase a
certain pitch a certain amount and PIN
sense rather than intervals like half
steps full steps there's a little
formula we have the original so let's
say we're at 440 Hertz and we want to
increase this let's say 10 cents well we
would actually multiply it by 2 and then
in powers we have 10 divided by 1200
because we're using an octave that's why
I explained that there's 1200 cents in
an octave so this number right here is
how many cents we want to increase the
spot and we chose 10 so this formula
right here is going to give you the new
frequency of 10 cents higher than 440 it
may be 448 I really have no idea but
that is the formula to figure out new
frequencies using cents</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
