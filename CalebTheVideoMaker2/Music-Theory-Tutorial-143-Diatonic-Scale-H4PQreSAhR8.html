wanted to talk about the diatonic scale
and no this isn't a diatonic scale it's
only two notes this is something
completely different this is a scale
consisting of whole steps and half steps
for example whole whole half so the
arrangement will always have three I
mean five whole steps and two half steps
that qualifies this as a diatonic scale
we will always have it in the pattern of
two whole steps three whole steps and we
we talked about this let's go back
summer MySpace
we talked about this some and when we
talked about modes these are all
examples of diatonic scales because we
have oh-oh-oh-oh
but then it goes back to two holes so
these all qualify as a diatonic scale I
just wanted to teach you because you
will probably come across this term
diatonic scale and I wanted to clarify
what exactly a diatonic scale is it's a
scale consisting of five whole steps and
two half steps
hey it's Claire that qualifies this as a
diatonic hepta tonic scale so what does
this mean diatonic has five whole steps
two half steps
hepta tonic has seven notes within the
scale one two three four five six and
then the seventh one brings us back to
the root because these are steps so we
start on a root go whole step from that
so that be like you get the point
basically we don't count the root in the
octave so if we're going C to C you only
count C once which is why it's seven
notes rather than eight even though we
cover eighth notes
so that's kind of odd but anyways
diatonic scale five whole steps two half
steps tonic scale has seven notes within
scale that's all I have to say for this
video and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
