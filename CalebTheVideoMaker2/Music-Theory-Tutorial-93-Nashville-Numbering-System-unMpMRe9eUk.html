be one of my shortest and easiest videos
in this entire series it's about the
Nashville numberings number system
number system you may come across this
in your adventure sub music but it's
really nothing to get scared of her it's
pretty simple remember how in my last
video if you watched it I labeled the
chords by Roman numerals I use capital I
a lowercase eyes and then three and
lowercase eyes and then uppercase IV V
and then lower case V I and then VII
diminished little Celsius their degree
side where it well now ah this is an
even simpler way of doing that rather
than giving Roman numerals we just give
them letters numbers I sorry sorry i
don't know i get this too confusing look
great so the tonic the first note in a
scale for when we're creating courts
will name that chord with a one so we
draw this out yo we have a scale making
chords so we're on the e Oh this'll is
megha see cuz I don't know any major
scale so I'll see all right so anyways
forget whatever we have the scale c d e
f g a b c we would say the C chord is
the one chord the D chord is the two
chord the e chord is the three chord we
completely ignore the fact whether
they're whether they are minor or major
we just give give them numbers so that
is the Nashville numbering system this
would be seven this would be seven this
will be a tour one because it's a tonic
so yeah that is the Asheville number
so see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
