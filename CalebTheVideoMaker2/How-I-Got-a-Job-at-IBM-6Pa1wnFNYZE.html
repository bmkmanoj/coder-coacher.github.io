some really exciting news that I want to
share with you guys and also explain how
I got there so recently I landed a job
with IBM now iBM is a well-established
company with over a hundred years in its
lifespan I mean that's crazy I mean to
me that's like forever
so this video I'm going to dedicate to
talking about what's happening in my
life how this job is going to affect me
and how I managed to get this job and
I'm hoping those of you who are looking
for jobs that this video can be of
inspiration to you so you know what to
look for what what to strive for when
you are trying to get a job and the way
you got this job is probably abnormal to
most I mean it was to me I was not
expecting this so it's really cool how
it played out and I think it'll be an
inspiration so I'll start at the
beginning first off for those of you
don't know me I have a developer
background but I'm still fairly young so
I don't have a lot of experience under
my belt I am attending school for
computer science I am in my last year
for bachelors finally man my mom's gonna
be so proud and I am actually still in
school while working this job which is
abnormal
most people they get out of school and
then they start looking for a job and
the way I approach things is a little
bit different and in fact I've actually
had development jobs even though I've
been in school so I worked as a devil I
worked as a developer for a year and a
half for a company sometimes part-time
sometimes full times as I had time to
give but usually probably average 30
hours a week so I had a pretty involved
development job and that's why I really
established you know I'm interested in
the tech field and I love programming
this is this is what I want to do and at
that point I was interested in going
back to school because I I dropped out
and long story wolf but that's like I'm
gonna go back into computer science get
a bachelor's and
throughout that experience I've always
been documenting what I've been learning
on my YouTube videos so I I do trainings
a tutorial basically everything I know
which people see my videos I'm like wow
you know all this stuff
well they don't realize aside from my
YouTube videos I don't know anything
like literally here's how I think about
it if I if I learned something and I
don't get to make a video about it it's
like wasted effort which is really
really sad approach but I'm getting off
topic the point is I have continually
documented my knowledge base here on
YouTube check here on my youtube channel
not just to help me learn that's one key
thing was to help me learn but also to
try to build an income and establish my
influence and my business here on the
internet and you guys who have been
following me forever know that I have I
have gone through lots of changes with
the way I do videos the stuff I'm
covering and I've been establishing
myself slowly in figuring out who I
really am and what my career is going to
be and it's been a really good adventure
and somewhere along the lines I I wanted
to kind of step it up a notch and I
started releasing more content and being
more restrictive on the kind of content
I was creating so that was not very long
ago like within a year and at that point
not everything I learned was getting put
on YouTube so I would question myself
hey does this content really does this
really address my audience does this
does this add value to what what I have
on my channel and if the answer was no I
would try not to make videos over it and
usually that ended up with me not
learning the material anyways so I still
have been kind of trying to always make
videos about what I'm learning so my
learning has changed to better better
address this developer data driven need
in the industry and as I was making more
and more videos on that I opened a
sponsorship page on my website which
gave some stats and everything about
what a sponsor would get if they were to
sponsor some videos and I worked with a
couple different brands I worked at
several nines I worked with IBM and
actually yeah only two and I've been
reached out to a couple others but
nothing has I haven't followed through
with any of those yet so IBM was the
second one but they weren't really
reaching out for a sponsorship they
invited me to a conference to speak and
you guys may remember me posting a video
about it how I was going to Germany to
speak about their database and more
generally just unstructured data and how
that works inside of a relational
database and that was kind of that was
kind of the relationship start with me
and IBM and I guess I didn't do terrible
because they still wanted to work with
me after so that's exciting
the next step was there they wanted some
videos made that would help developers
get started with their database so their
database is db2 as you guys have
probably known from my videos and I made
18 or so videos and during that
timeframe I had a deadline I was like I
have to get these 18 videos doing before
this date and before that date is when I
got offered a position at IBM and it was
it was crazy
everything was orchestrated so well when
I actually got offered the position I
had a lot of mixed feelings I ended up
saying yes obviously because I making
this video on how I got a job at IBM but
there's a lot of mixed feelings mainly
because the the job itself was a little
bit off what I was experienced in and I
can explain that in a bit
and also they were asking for a
relocation and those are two really
challenging things to deal with so it's
been very challenging but I've been with
the company for months or so now and I'm
still surviving
so it's crazy because I'm still in
school and I was reached out so when I
got hired it was kind of like an
exception
like hey we like people to be done with
school unless you're an intern but what
will make an exception and I'm not
trying to say that because like oh I'm
so awesome or whatever what I'm trying
to get the point across is that there
are steps you can take to make yourself
distinguished in the market place of job
searching and those are the kinds of
things I want to talk to you about in
this video specifically I had that
record on my youtube channel of hey here
are the things that I study here's the
way I present information and although
up here I'm probably lower than most
software engineers out there I I went
the extra step to present what I did
know and organize and structure my
skills in in essentially a resume so
people come to my youtube channel they
know what I do and that offered that
offered extreme value to me because it
was basically a living resume because
you know I'm getting 200,000 views a
month and I don't have to do anything
for that so of 200,000 views some of
those are potential employers and of
those potential employers of those
potential employers some percentage of
them are going to reach out to me offer
me a position and YouTube was my means
of making a resume and it's still going
to be there's other ways to do that
though if you guys are trying to figure
out how do I get a job where do I work
what do I do figure out what you enjoy
and start proving yourself in that area
even if it's even if it's one small
thing start there you know if you just
want if you just want to do like just
databases like that's what I started
with or just database design or just one
particular piece of a programming
language you can do that it doesn't have
to be on YouTube either you can use
github or bitbucket or some repository
system anything to showcase what you've
done because honestly
wise knowledge wise I would say there
are better people for the position there
are there's so many people out there
with so many skills who strive and work
so hard to reach one of these positions
but I was I was selected because I had
that proof behind me so they looked at
me and they said oh this guy's not just
all words he's actions we can see this
from his YouTube channel and when I
spoke in Germany that was affirmation so
I don't really I don't really want to
ramble but basically what I'm trying to
get across is that by building a resume
some sort of active resume you can set
yourself apart from the competition
because you have all these things under
your name even if there's small
achievements they'll start to add up you
know now I'm to the point where on
YouTube I've hit 50,000 subscribers on
you to me I have over a hundred thousand
students and then all my other social
networks I have you know a couple
thousand you know with Facebook and
Twitter and my my email and that all
adds up I'm starting to build an
influence and it's pretty crazy so the
videos that I'm going to be producing
now I'm still gonna do tutorials in fact
I got it I got a board right there boom
but I want to talk more real world so I
did some live streams back a while ago
and I liked those they were fun the
problem with those is they were really
long and only had small sections of
really good content what I want to do is
I want to get rid of all that extra
stuff and just give you guys good
content on a regular basis
showing you hey here's what's going on
in my life hey here's something I'm
learning about here's something new and
that is going to allow you guys to come
to this channel and see see what's going
on in the industry from a real world
perspective so I'm gonna try and get as
real as possible with career career tips
what's going on in the industry what you
need to know
about and I'm gonna be genuine about it
so with the tutorials I go up there and
I'm like oh blah blah blah blah blah
here's some things I know yeah yeah I'm
smart whatever but the thing is I have
to prepare for forever to get all that
information organized and I still want
to do that because it mentally is it's
exercising my brain and it's helping me
learn material but the problem with that
is that if there's something small I
want to talk about such as Raspberry Pi
or IOT or quantum computing or machine
learning or actually I've just did some
videos on that but something where I'm
not an expert at I don't feel like I
have to go study for hours to even make
a video what I want to do so on Oh whip
out a camera talk to you guys and say
hey here's what I know here's what you
should know here's what's happened in
the industry here's what is happening in
the industry and that's it and the stuff
that I don't know don't even have to
worry about that so for example I want
to talk some about quantum computing
because I think it is a stinkin ly
awesome it's thinking awesome and I want
to talk about why it is with my tutorial
so you're not really gonna get that you
guys probably didn't even know I was
interested in that because I wasn't
really able to talk about that but now
my idea is when I'm driving to work whip
out a camera talk about some topic for
the day give some advice to people
answer questions be connected with my
audience so what I want you guys to take
away from this is that throughout this
upcoming project I'm not going to be
hiding away from what's going on in real
life and just teach the same old stuff
what I want to do is I want to allow you
guys to peek in to what the real world
and the industry is like through events
through cool topics I'm learning about
like brand new technology all of those
things I want to give you guys as early
as possible access to that kind of
information and I want you to be able to
come back here on a regular basis and
know that I'm gonna be producing good
content giving
what's what's real and what's new that
way you can leave you can leave this
channel and have some something to show
for it up here you know but it's gonna
be very conversational right like this
I'm just literally just talking on the
camera
nothing special makes it easier on me it
makes it more real it makes it authentic
and what I don't want you guys to think
is oh now I got this job and it's you
know big deal it's time to slow down on
my YouTube or whatever in fact is doing
the exact opposite because now every
single day I go into work unexposed new
technology I'm exposed to new ideas and
I come home more motivated than ever to
share those things with you guys and to
make those those YouTube videos and
build my influence so it's not like one
or the other in fact I think these are
gonna work really well in supplementing
one another augmenting one another
because you know I'm gonna be attending
some events here and I'd like to show
you guys what's going on like what's
going on in the real world if you're not
able to get out there you're not able to
to get a job you're not able to attend
these crazy events and see what's new in
the technology field I want to deliver
that information to you free of charge
here on YouTube see ya guys that's all I
got for this one
so to summarize the the biggest thing is
to build a living resume and we'll get
into some more business tips and resume
tips because I've actually been kind of
collecting them over the years since
I've since I've had numerous tech jobs
and I'm still fairly young and I have
experience here on YouTube I think I
could give you guys some valid advice
and help you guys get employment and I
see that every day we have not every day
but very often people send me messages
hey man you you helped me ace my
interview at Facebook now I got a
software job at Facebook hey man I just
finished my master's degree all the time
so I get to influence people I get to
help people and that makes me happy and
fulfilled so hopefully you guys are
excited let me know what you guys want
to see
for tutorials let me know what you guys
want to see for these chats and yeah
let's move on let's let's take over the
internet yeah please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
