am the owner of this channel Caleb the
video maker - I'm also the owner of my
website
Caleb currycomb and my other channel
Caleb the video maker without the two
and what I do is I offer educational
videos to anybody who has an internet
connection now someday I may have had
some downloads to where you can use for
offline viewing but for now this is what
I offer and what I want to do is I want
to explain a bit what I have done and
what I plan on doing with this channel
in the future basically in this video I
will be comparing and contrasting two
terms training and education what I have
the most of on this channel is education
and you may be thinking education
training sounds like the same thing well
I think there's a little bit of a
difference when I think of Education I
think of the fundamentals and the main
concepts you need to understand in order
to understand how things work or why
things work the way they do for whatever
you're studying now training is learning
how to use certain tools or functions or
whatever you're using to get a final
product
now as for training you may not know
exactly what's going on or why things
work the way they do you just know
that's what you get so to help clear up
the difference between training and
education I have an example let's say
you're working with some video and
you're using a program such as Adobe
Premiere Pro now if you don't understa
that's okay but let's say you have some
footage and it's interlaced and you have
no clue what that means all you know is
that the person who wants your video
wants it to be progressive not
interlaced you may not have a clue what
that means but you may understand how to
get it from progress I mean from
interlaced to progressive you can get
this by training yourself in Adobe
Premiere now once you're trained there
you may be able to do the same thing in
Final Cut Pro or some other video
editing program with education you
be educated in a way that lets you
understand that interlaced means every
other bar and then goes back and does
every other bar again to create a frame
if that don't does that don't worry if
that doesn't make me sense but now that
you understand how that works you can
find a program or a technique to switch
from interlaced to progressive now you
may not understand quickly how you can
get to progressive and it may take you
some more time my dogs are always
barking now with training you may know
quickly how to do that but you may not
understand fully what's going on there's
good sides and bad sides to both of
these for example it may take you a
longer time with education to figure out
how to get the final product with
training you may not get the best
results because you're not exactly sure
what's going on but that's it's the lane
example and what I want to do is I want
to start offering more training classes
right now on mostly offer educational
classes and with training also I want to
provide education with in so you
understand what you're doing with this
training basically I want you to get the
best of both worlds to where you're
getting trained and educated by the way
if you want to learn more about training
and education you can check out this
video if there's an annotation there
where you need to check the link in the
description which will take you to a lie
the computer guys video who talks a
little bit about that for IT
professionals and I like him because now
I know I'm not the only one you couldn't
think of a creative named Eli the
computer guy Caleb's video maker we're
probably like oh yeah that's a good idea
most boring name ever but I like my name
so I like his name too to create these
training videos it requires more
preparation on my part and also a better
understanding of how to use certain
programs and so forth and if you don't
know this already I am more of an
education kind of guy
I'm book smart but sometimes actually
doing things I'm kind of useless
makes any sense so what I want to do is
I want to better prepare myself for the
future to be able to create awesome
stuff with whatever it is I'm working
with by being fully educated and fully
trained in the areas I need trained this
will help me to get the best results the
quickest and by quickest
I'm not saying rushed and crappy I'm
saying cutting out wasted time by
knowing what I'm doing and this I want
to share with you guys so we can all
progress and help make us better and
everything training videos are
oftentimes more boring and not as
entertaining which are the same thing
because you have to go through a bunch
of these small little steps oh this
button does this Oh there's 600 options
we're gonna go learn them all oh this
button does this with seven thousand
three hundred forty two options you know
what I'm saying if you don't know what
I'm talking about just open any Adobe
program or a Autodesk program and click
options and just like boom but yeah
that's what I want to get with to where
we understand what more programs do and
so forth as many of you may already know
I have a variety of videos but not a ton
because I'm kind of just starting out I
have a lot of our databases and I have a
lot / music theory and nowhere in
between but these are educational videos
because I can teach you about music
theory now for training I may teach you
about finale which helps us create music
and to produce professional quality
stuff just having that education of
music theory is not going to get you
anywhere that's why I think a balance
between education and training get the
best stuff ever now for MySQL you can
use this education to be a database
manager or anything else like that
that's the the training side whereas the
MySQL is the education side also on the
education side you can have computer
science which allows you to understand
what MySQL is doing exactly so if you
want to further your education with
database thing I would suggest learn
programming languages and computer
science then train yourself to produce
awesome programs or databases that meet
people's needs sorry I'm keep waving my
hands around uselessly drop my clipboard
anyways although I don't know the exact
direction I'm taking this project I want
to offer material that has rare quality
information that helps you edit yourself
and train yourself to work in the real
world so please leave me a comment
telling me what you've liked what you
would like to see and also what style
you like to learn in cuz right now
mainly I use a whiteboard or a
chalkboard and I know that's boring for
some people so I want to be able to help
the most people will also be helping
individual groups that like certain
things I'd like to thank you all for the
support you have given me because now
I've nearly reached 1000 subscribers oh
yeah high-five I hope to continue to
make these little update videos here and
then to tell you where I'm going with
this project channel whatever you want
to call it and that's all I really have
to say for now a few other things real
quick you can number one check out my
new website Caleb curry com to follow me
