PHP tutorial this video I want to talk
about functions so if you liked it
please be sure to subscribe and if you
don't like it please be sure to click
like alright thank you
let's begin alright so what is a
function you have you may have heard of
even the term function or well a method
is the same pretty much the same thing
as a function but in object-oriented
programming such as JavaScript or Java
so PHP is a procedural programming
language so it's not object-oriented
programming language so we don't have
methods or well okay technically you can
use PHP either as a procedural language
or an object-oriented programming
language but right now we're using it as
a procedural language and if you really
don't know what that means don't either
worry about it just follow them so if
you just just think method function
alright so if you never heard of a
method don't worry about that's just for
you other people who may have heard
about it alright so what does a function
do well a function takes some given
value and does something with it
okay so I like to think of it like this
this is a function alright I like to
think of it as a tunnel alright so we
give it a value or values it does
something with those values
and then we get back a new value that is
the basics of how a function works we
have used some functions already I can't
think of ones we've used but I know we
have because I was like I know we
haven't talked about functions yet and
now we're finally talking about
functions but oh yeah I don't want the
array function so let's do an example of
the array function
these are parentheses when we put these
at forward like this we're calling the
function that means it's going to do its
thing so here's the array tunnel and
then we put a value in it and it gives
us a value back so what we put in here
is a list of values separated by commas
so we could have yo and so I can't think
of any whoa piece of chalk was like
slight like rolling down the anyways now
it's going to give us back an array
where each one of these values has an
index and is a key a key value pair
within an array and whenever we can name
it by assigning it to a variable so pi
is equal to the return value of array so
that means this value that comes out is
assigned to the variable pi that is a
function we have used there is a
multitude of other functions you will
use like seriously there's a ton so a
lot of these are going to be reference
rather than memorization because all of
them are used
little bit differently and it's kind of
hard to memorize them all so if you
can't memorize them all that's okay it
doesn't mean you're a noob because then
I'd be like a major noob because I know
like barely any in fact I don't even
know one that one that's not even real I
just made it up
I'm kidding very awesome though oh my
gosh what if I just made up this whole
series and like none of this was even
true
let be hilarious alright anyways
oftentimes okay sometimes when we call a
function so let's just say function X
let's just say that's a function we call
it by putting the parentheses and then
we put it for an a semicolon this is
going to do the junk within the function
it does not always require something
within the parentheses when it does we
have specific terms for what those are
alright so we would put in what's known
as an argument and you may also hear the
term parameter and for the longest time
I did not know the difference between
these two terms but as we go in this
video and in the next video we will be
under we will understand the difference
between these two terms perfectly but
that's for now that doesn't really
matter all you need to know is sometimes
oh I don't have it'll take in
information other times it will not okay
the cool thing about functions is we can
have what's known as a user-defined
function so just like with arrays we
could create our own race but we can
also create our own functions so for
example the function array was not user
defined it was predefined because we did
not create it all we did was call it so
when you see this right here this is no
as calling the function that means it's
going to do the code that the function
is programmed to do all right so now
let's talk about creating functions well
the first thing is obviously it's going
to need a name so the name consists well
it can have all right I don't know but
you can have letters underscores and
numbers the only other rule is well
there's a couple other rules but you
cannot start with the number you can
only use a number after you started with
a letter for example L or an underscore
so those are one rule one that's those
are the vegetables another thing is you
cannot use a predefined term in PHP so
you couldn't name your function and go
because echo is already used within PHP
it's a word
reserved word Wow literally as soon as I
stop the camera I remember I think
that's sword anyways those are the basic
naming rules now what would we use a
function for or why would we create a
function well the very first reason I
mean these aren't like exact I mean you
can use it for whatever you want but
most commonly the very first reason is
for repeating code I love this new chalk
I feel like it could write so much
better and also I don't know how to
spell this just bear with me
separating you that are separate I think
that's right
separating complex code so set repeating
code if you just create the function
once so let's say the function itself is
50 lines then when you call it you only
have to use one line so if you use the
same code ten times rather than having
500 lines you could have 50 then call it
60 to um 10 times to get 60 lines
hopefully that makes sense basically um
it's less code reuse you can create the
function and then use it multiple
different times so let's say you have a
value you put it through a function and
then you get a new value like this well
you could do that with multiple values
throughout the program rather than this
if you didn't use functions you would
have to program itself and then what you
get is the same thing repeat it on here
twice and that is a waste of space and
extra lines so often times it's used for
repeating code another thing is for
separating complex code so rather than
always typing a complex system right
then and there you can make a complex
system over here so this is a complex
crazy program and then all you have to
do is reference it very simple and you
can reference it multiple different
times and as you can see all these
little boxes are very simple very simple
this I don't really want to work with
that 50 times so if it's super complex I
might just put it in its own function
and then use that function as the
program goes on right so that is all I
have to say in this video in the next
video I'm actually going to be teaching
you how to create functions and be going
over the two terms
argument and parameter and probably some
other junk so please be sure to
subscribe and I will see you in the next
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
