video maker - this video is going to be
a little bit special because we are
actually going to be creating our very
own complement machine this video is
dedicated to those looking for love well
don't worry about other people's you
know computers are way more predictable
and you can tell them to say whatever
they want forget all those jerky guys
and them Mean Girls just this is getting
weird okay let's just visit get started
so we are going to create a new
application and we are going to make
kind of like a modified hello world that
tells us our name and gives us a
compliment so let's save then and we'll
call this compliment machine you can
capitalize it however you want
totally up to you just know that Linux
is case sensitive so this and this with
a lowercase e are completely different
so let's go in here and go into insert
mode using I and say include standard
IOH it means return 0 perfect now I
guess we'll just start with a normal
hello world right that would be a good
place to start hello world and instead
of world we could actually put our name
in here and we'll break down to the new
line after that now let's compile and
let's run it you can see that it works
it even says our name also personal but
it's not good enough
so let's improve it I'm going to talk
about how to put strings inside of these
quotes without directly typing them
because we want to start separating
what's in our code and what should be
imputed in our code or inputted or
insert it however you want to think
about it so sort of how when we started
with numbers we would get numbers from
the user and then output them to the
screen well we want to do the same thing
here so to start I want to teach you a
new format or conversion character and
that conversion character is actually
percent s and that is for string so what
is a string a string is a sequence of
characters where a character is just
anything you can type on the keyboard or
like a new line tab and all that good
stuff so each one of these is a
character the space is a character a
period is character a string is when you
put all of those in a sequence using
quotes like this hello you can see here
we're actually passing in a string to
the printf function and that is called
our format string well what I want to
actually do is pass in another string
into this string into the % s location
so we need to pass in another argument
so let me get rid of this junk you will
go in here add a comma and now we need
to add something into this function so
what do we want to add well let's just
make it work just like it was by passing
in our name and also we will put the
exclamation mark right here so take a
good look at that make sure you
understand it see how it works and then
we will run it and make sure it works
just like we were hoping you can see
that it works exactly the same and make
sure you recompile it so we're actually
getting new results this app is pretty
cool so far but I want to take it a step
farther and actually ask the user for
their name and then output it so let's
go back into our code and now this might
be new to you but just look at the
syntax and familiarize yourself with it
and it'll start to make some sense we
need to create something called an array
and we will discuss arrays in a lot of
detail in the future but essentially
since the string is just a sequence of
characters you can see here just each
one of these as a character we could put
each one of these in what's known as a
character array so to do that lets go
into main go to a new line and we are
going to say char name which is the
variable name you can name it whatever
you want you can name it taco bell you
can name it McDonald's you can name it
spaghetti name it corduroy pillows which
by the way there's a new one out and
it's making headlines basically you can
make it whatever you want
we're going to go with name because
that's what it's going to store the next
thing you do is put square brackets
inside of the square brackets we are
going to say how many characters are
allowed so my name is Caleb it takes up
five characters
so what is like the longest name you can
think of that is what you're going to
want to consider so I think 30 would
probably be a good number of characters
but there's a little trick here you have
to have one more extra than the total
you want to allow so if I want your name
to be up to 30 characters I'm going to
put a 31 and the reason that is is
because strings need a character at the
end to say the string is over and that
is called the null terminator and it
looks like a backslash and a zero all
right let's get rid of this comment and
start working some more on our code oh
now for the fun part how do we get this
value from the user well as always we
are going to use scanf and inside a
scanf you are going to use percent s and
as always need to put those in double
quotes that is our conversion character
that we are going to use which makes
sense because we're expecting a string
the next thing is we're going to use the
variable name and this is where things
get kind of confusing you're actually
not going to use the address of operator
so you just put the variable name as is
if you had an integer variable like int
X for example when you wanted to pass
that into scanf to get a value for it
you always have to do the ampersand and
then the variable but when we're talking
about arrays you don't do that and all
of that will make a lot of sense when we
start talking about arrays in the future
but for now this is the exception to the
rule make sure you don't put the address
of operator now inside of the printf we
can just use that variable instead of
Caleb here we can pass in variable here
let's get rid of this and we will put
name let's run it and give it a try
okay so it's asking us for a name but we
forgot to put a prompt so we'll want to
do that but let's put Caleb and you can
see it's working which is kind of cool
go back in our code and improve it let's
first give a prompt so up here maybe
right here we could say you know we
might as well make our complement
Machine a big jerk like every other guy
in the world
all right now let's run it yo girl until
named and there's something weird here
you actually can't use spaces so if you
wanted to do that you would want to take
first name last name separately so if
you did like Sally Bob it's only going
to say hello Sally and last thing is
don't forget we have to put a compliment
in here there we go I think our app is
complete
no girl until your name Sally Bob hello
Sally Bob you look very nice today so
yeah guys this is how you make a
compliment machine in C programming
hopefully that's helpful for all your
lack of relationship I don't know if
you've enjoyed this video please click
like and in the next video we are going
to be talking about using functions in C
and that is so huge so make sure you
check that out guys peace and I'll see
yous it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
