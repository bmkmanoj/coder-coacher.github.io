Python tutorial series in this video I
want to talk about embedding values in a
string or the values of variables so for
example I want to teach you how to put a
value of a variable in a string
dynamically so let's just say for
example we have this string and this
string says hey my name is and within
these these spaces we wanted to change
depending upon the value we give it well
we can actually do this so when when we
print it like this it just just gives us
blank lines and we don't really want
that so what we need to do is it's kind
of funky but just try it out what we're
going to do is first we're going to put
a percent sign and then we are going to
put an S and what that basically means
is that it's waiting on a string to be
given to give to put that value in there
so if we if we submit it like this
nothing really happens if we try it with
single quotes and then enter you see the
same thing happens so what is the
solution well the solution is we have to
tell it what string we want to be put in
place of that % % and s so to do that
after our quotes we put a % and then we
tell it what we want to place in place
of that % s just like that and then we
can press ENTER and you can see hey my
name is Caleb so this this % s is
basically saying I'm waiting for a value
to be given to me then we give this %
which tells python that all right the
next value is going to be the value that
we want to place in that % s so I know
that's a little complex but don't don't
don't make it too confusing
whoops I didn't mean to do that
let's try something else we could
actually make it variable so we can make
it name we can assign this variable
caleb curry hopefully got oh if it bugs
you that I use my name for like every
example just just let me know guys like
III doesn't really matter to me I just
don't know what else to use so we could
make that example we just assigned the
value caleb curry to the variable with
the name name convenient right now we
can try that previous example so let me
just bring that up so this is what we
had before now instead of using this
string here we can just put the variable
name and then we can submit that and we
can see that it takes the value given to
the variable name so this points back to
this which points back to the value
Caleb curry and then this value is
submitted in place of the percent s we
can then do it again let's let's just
try something new
we okay let's first let's change the
value of name we could say really now
when we go back to this and submit it it
changes the name do you guys see what
I'm saying
this is just a dynamic reference to a
variable which is defined here and then
here we redefined it as filly we could
also do this with multiple variables so
if we had last name we assign that Bob
and by the way just you don't really
need to use these if you're only
submitting one line so I know I need to
either decide if I'm gonna use them or
not but don't worry hot you can use them
if you want but now when we go back to
this and we put a different variable
last name it changes the final value
another thing we can do is rather than
having this
string here we can also assign that to a
variable so let's skip a couple lines
just to kind of clear things out we're
going to make a message we're going to
give it the value hey my name is and
then we are going to give it percent s
and then a space so that way there's a
space here and then we are going to keep
it like that
so now H has the value hey my name is
and then blank now we can create the
other name so name equals Helen Keller I
don't think that's all right who cares
all right so now name has the value
Helen Keller and then we can kind of
print both of these at the same time we
can say message then we could say a %
which is basically saying this is what
we want to replace the percent in this
message with so this is telling Python
that whatever comes next is what we want
to use to replace that and then we use
name a name has the value Helen Keller
so then we can submit that hey my name
is Helen Keller
hopefully that's starting to make sense
on how that works we can take this even
a step farther and we can use multiple
replacements within a message so for
example we can add a another one in here
oops I guess I should probably obviously
retype that I can't just go back and
decide it so we can put another one in
here and we'll put two so now we are
expecting to replace two parts of this
string so now message has this value and
then we can create two new variables
name let's go first
name Helen last name
hello now what we can do is we can do
the same concept print I'm just gonna
close it right now just to make it
easier we can say a message then put the
parenthesis I'm inside the % and then
for clarity sake we've made quotes and
then we go first name last name so here
is what's going to happen message is
given right here hey my name is blank
blank and then we're going to insert the
values first name last name so this one
goes first this one goes second and then
we submit that hello my name is Helen
Keller and just so you know what happens
when we don't use these parenthesis I'm
gonna submit it oh we get an error so
just know that when we want to do that
we will put the values we want to
replace in those things parenthesis
sorry man it's so late all right well
that is all I have to say in this video
sorry that I keep always forgetting
words like parentheses and like the most
easy words like I can explain a huge
concept and forget the word like print
or something stupid but anyways thank
you for watching in the next video we
will be talking about some more awesome
stuff so be sure to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
