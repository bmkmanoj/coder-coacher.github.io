gonna be downloading sequel server so
now I'm just gonna search it because you
know URLs change all of the time we're
gonna be using sequel server 2016 but
we're gonna be looking for the Microsoft
com website and then here's the URL as
of now and then we go to downloads now
here we are shown different versions of
sequel server and the one we're going to
be looking for is developer edition and
what this is is a fully featured free
edition so that means we can do
everything now if you want to actually
do this in production you might want to
consider the Express Edition and that
one is a basically a slimmed down
version but the benefit of that is that
it's free for production so obviously
we're just learning so I'm gonna go with
the developer edition now that's going
to ask you to sign into your Microsoft
account if you don't have one it's
really easy to make one so I'm not gonna
go through that whole process alright so
we're here now when it's your first time
opening this app you'll have to agree to
kind of like a License Agreement or
whatever in order to join Visual Studio
dev essentials now I already did that
so it's not showing that for me
essentially that's going to give you
access to all of these panels here but
the one we are most interested in is
Microsoft sequel server so we're gonna
click download on that that's gonna
start the download alright let's open
that yes now of course you're gonna be
presented with even more options we'll
go with basic just because you know
that's the easiest one but if you want
you can customize things yeah yeah yeah
whatever
I totally read that yep and there we go
now that's gonna start downloading a
bunch of junk just let it do its thing
and come back in a little bit
alright so it's done now they're
actually working on a release of sequel
server that works on Linux and Mac OS so
if you guys want to give that a try I
would encourage you to do that and let
me know how it goes and all of this
stuff that popped up is pretty important
so I'm gonna actually copy all of that
and I'll just use a tool known as the
snipping tool
should blame and then you can just save
that it says a restart is required but
basically everything is installed down
here says install SMS and that's what
we're going to be talking about in the
next video but for now let's click this
Connect Now button and you can see here
we are now connected to our database so
I think we can do stuff like select five
plus five for example and then type in
go there we go but I don't really like
working with the database in this
command prompt kind of thing so I'm
going to be installing a visual tool now
we're still going to be learning SQL I'm
just going to be typing the SQL inside
of this visual tool so I'm not teaching
you guys the the cheating method doing
everything visually we're going to learn
SQL in this series we're just going to
be typing in to a different tool known
as SMS or sequel server management
studio so that's what we're gonna be
talking about in the next video be sure
to check that out guys if you like the
series so far please be sure to click
like subscribe and you know share it
with all your friends and everything
like that thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
