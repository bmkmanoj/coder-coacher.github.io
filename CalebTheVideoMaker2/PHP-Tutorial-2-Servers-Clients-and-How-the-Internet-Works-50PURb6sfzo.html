tutorial and in this video I want to
talk a little bit more about how
websites work so we can start
programming in PHP alright so first PHP
PHP used to stand for personal home page
but as it adapted they change that it is
now PHP hypertext processor just so you
know
so the first P actually stands for PHP
which is kind of weird oh yeah
PHP hypertext processor if you don't
even know what that means don't even
worry about it we'll be getting into it
so PHP is what is known as a server-side
scripting language or server-side
programming language or just server-side
so there's two options we have
server-side and then we have Y side all
right so what does this mean well we
have to define what's a server and what
is a client a client is a person who
accesses let's say a website a server is
what stores that website so basically it
can be a computer or just a a tower with
hard drives and so forth but basically a
person who's on a computer so this is a
computer right here we have this guy
who's accessing it he wants to visit
Caleb currycomb for example he types it
in at the top and then it goes to the
server that has Caleb curry coms content
on it and everybody requests that
information and it gets sent back to the
computer so now his computer is
accessing Caleb curry com
I mean I'm simplifying it but pretty
much is how it works right so the
content that is sent to him is
client-side content the stuff that stays
on the server is the server-side content
for example the database which may just
be tables with columns and rows I mean
visually that is going to stay on the
server and it's not going to cross this
line this is because that's a really
crappy lines like anyways we don't want
the client to be able to access the
database if he could cross over that
line well then he could change all this
content and screw up the website on the
server which is going to send improper
content to the clients that you're
trying to either provide stuff for them
or get some money from them or whatever
your website is for it's going to mess
it up so we don't want him to allow we
don't want to allow him to get access to
the server to the database within the
server so all this is stored within the
server and we don't want people to
access server content usually sometimes
that may be appropriate for example if
you have a user registration on your
website and somebody wants to change
their password
well that password which you can
represent with those little astrick
things let's say is passwords four
characters long and he doesn't think
that's long enough well you may want to
take this replace it with something else
and put that in the database so next
time he tries to login it will look for
the new password rather than the old
password well that is something you can
do but you're going to need a
server-side programming language such as
PHP so we can use this tunnel
and PHP can allow him to change that
content within the database and then it
can send it back if needed to the client
so this PHP acts like a tunnel between
the stuff on the server and the stuff on
the clients side so the website HTML and
the forms and stuff that's all over here
but the database content that's over
here this acts as a tunnel to where they
can change things but PHP is going to
check oh are they changing what they
really are trying to change or are they
trying to trick this website and hack it
or update content that they're not
supposed to update or what exactly are
they trying to do by writing this this
stuff and asking PHP to change something
on the server that that's dangerous
so we need a a guardian to protect our
server because if we just let anybody go
onto the server well that's not going to
be so good so all this stuff is kept on
the server basically the place that
keeps all your website content in your
databases and then we're going to use
PHP which is to start and just look like
a mess to communicate between the two so
that's pretty awesome what how exactly
does that work well PHP code is also
stored on the server so we can have PHP
code let's say this is a program right
here and it's a PHP program
right and that right there is how to
open PHP we'll get into that later
so this PHP program is on the server and
what PHP can do is it can take content
within the PHP code just specific pieces
and it can send it over to the client
side just what you want so all the rest
of the PHP code is kept within the PHP
script on the server so as I'm saying
some of its on the server and some of it
is sent to the client a way we can do
that is by saying like print hello
this right here hello is going to be
sent into the HTML source code the
content they get with a long within the
website that they're looking at I'm
sorry but the rest of the code they're
not going to get the print this stays
within the PHP code and is permanently
on the server this wall this is not
going to become this is not going to be
over here so some of the PHP code can
send content to the client and some of
it can be on the server so PHP code is
said to be a server-side scripting
language or a server-side language
doesn't really matter so that is pretty
much how PHP works to contact a server
it allows specific pieces to be sent to
the client or so or stuff sent from the
client can be used through a PHP script
to communicate with the databases or
other content within the server so
that's all I have to say in this video
hopefully I covered it all and I'll see
you in the next one so thank you for
watching be sure to subscribe thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
