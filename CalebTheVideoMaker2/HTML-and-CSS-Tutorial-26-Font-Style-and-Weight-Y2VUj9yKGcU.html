video I talked about modifying the font
size so I you I went something like this
font size and I put something like 20
pixels which affected the paragraphs
fawn well I'm going to be going into
more about affecting fonts but I'm not
going to be talking about size we're
going to be talking about weight and
probably no idea what I'm talking about
that is why I am going to tell you so so
far we know font size we also know color
and we know background color I think so
these are just some of the things you
can use to modify your page all right so
let's change a little bit about our page
because I think it's kind of dumb it's
getting an old I need to change it up so
I'm just going to get rid of this div
completely and the shopping list I don't
really want a shopping list so now I
just have a paragraph and I'm gonna get
rid of these lines too
and these tips so just Jim just struck
him out with a paragraph all I really
have is paragraph all right so I could
take the font size crank that up to 40
pixels if I wish so desire that's what's
awesome i web develop meter in control
do whatever you want unless you're
getting paid by somebody else you need
something then you have to do whatever
they so you can't really do what you
want alright so we can do font and then
we go to style so I'm going to be
talking about font styles well you may
not just want normal boring text you may
want italic text
this will italicize your text or uh
sorry sweater problem and boom now you
have italics which is really cool so
that's one thing you can do with font
style
another thing is oblique which just
tilts everything yes compare between you
know
bleak and italic I don't see a
difference italic yep it looks exactly
the same see I don't really know about
that but it doesn't really matter
another thing we can do is we go for
weight so this is how we can hold things
we can say boom so I'm just going
through the basic functions of a word
processor oftentimes you will want to
change the size of the text the the font
which we'll be getting into that soon
and you will also want to italicize it
and you will want to hold it
occasionally
so to italicize it you do it
font-style:italic to make it bold
font-weight:bold font size you can
change the size of it so those are just
some more all right so we could make a
little outline here if you wish we could
have an h1 look at it on the h1 and then
we can have a title in here so we've got
a really cool title but right now it
doesn't look much like a title so we can
do is we can alter obviously the
paragraphs like way too big so we'll
make that 16 pixels that's a lot better
and font weight we don't need the whole
thing to be bold so if we just delete it
it'll go back to normal that's good
let's crank it up to 22 pixels I think
that'll be a little bit more fitting
awesome now we can also create a h1 tag
here so what this will do is it'll
change the h1 headings that are in the
website so we can do the same stuff that
we did for paragraph up here font size
well we can make it 42 pixels
and I'm not a huge fan of the boldness
so we can actually use text I mean a
font late to change this back to normal
rather than bold so that's the normal
that's that's bold or what it was before
and I'm going to keep it at normal and I
also think it'd be cool if we had like a
cool underline here that separated the
text from the title so it could I have
text declaration which we haven't really
talked about texts
yeah we've really been talking about
font but if you want to modify text you
can use text decoration but that's
really out of the scope of this video so
that's all I have to say for this video
and in the next video we'll be talking
about some more stuff so I shall see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
