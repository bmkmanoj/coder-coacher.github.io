talking some more about this garbage but
first don't want to say looking all that
crap like when I was done with that last
video I just stepped back and was like
not nice like that just looking at that
just writing that makes me feel smart so
yeah I'm totally gonna like take a
picture of it and post it online or
something see how me erase all this
stuff alright now that I forgot what I
wrote let's talk about indexes so the
very first thing is a there's a primary
key indexes and then there's a foreign
key indexes and also foreign key
constraints if you remember that
basically we need to make it so we
optimize it for a banking system which
this involves proper foreign key
relations and good choices in primary
Keys which if you have been following
along with me since I started this you
should know how to tell if a primary key
is good it keeps everything unique it
doesn't change and it's a number
preferably the primary key for the first
table was just the member ID the member
of the bank so that member ID account
and then finally we had a count owner's
ID so a quarter sorry account just like
this so if you look at this this will be
a primary key primary key primary key
and in front foreign key the reason this
is a foreign key is because it
references to a table and it it
references to a key in a different table
or a foreign table that helps you
remember it so points up to here so now
when we define our indexes we can define
stuff in my packages
we can define the primary keys and
foreign keys was also although with all
the with also the constraints so
basically we need to define the primary
keys when creating our table but to do
we say Anacapa like this we don't we
don't put we put a space here but we do
not put an underscore so a primary key
is it in parentheses you put member ID
and then on the other table when we're
creating that we do the same thing
primary key account ID then when we go
to the four key well it's a foreign key
account holder ID in here references
member ID so it's a references and then
we have point up to this one so that's
how everything is connected now for the
storage engine we want to use in ODB so
if you remember there was two I taught
you my I Sam and in ODB let me write
this out for you to remind you my
here are the two options we are using
this one because it allows for foreign
key constraints which just keeps your
database connected with foreign keys so
if you delete something it'll also
delete the foreign key or give you a
warning of some sort and also allows for
transactions which you want for a bank
account for example what if you transfer
five hundred dollars your computer
system crashes and you don't know if it
got completed or you don't know if you
still owe that guy five hundred dollars
now someone's calling oh I'm missing
five hundred dollars I think I'm gonna
sue well nothing none of that would have
happened if you used a proper storage
engine so we're going with you know nodb
because it allows for foreign key
constraints and it allows for
transactions we do not need to worry
about any other foreign key constraints
because there's only one foreign key
which points to the main table if we had
multiple tables for some reason if it
was a big system we'd have some more
than just one but we don't so don't have
to worry about that also for indexes we
can also use them to search quicker for
example it's like a book I take book I'm
going if own learning about Windows XP I
could go back to the back and look up
Windows XP in the index and find it
quicker basically that is how an index
works within a database so what this
means is if you want to search by like
names faster or anything else faster you
will want to apply as an index I'm
probably not going to but I might who
knows so all the only indexes I need are
the primary key in the foreign key so
that means we're pretty much done with
designing our database all we really
have to do is program it and put a bunch
of crap in it now as far as character
sets it's not a whole big deal for this
application because we're not we're not
using it for PHP or anything we're just
using for our database and the default
will work fine for what I'm going to do
you may want to change it you can look
look up which one's best for what
you can decide but I'm going to use the
default which is Latin Latin something
my current default is Latin Swedish
case-insensitive
so I'm like end up using like utf-8 or
something but this probably worked so
yeah we'll see about that in the next
video so yeah see you in the next video
where I will actually be programming
this and explaining some new things so
catch you there thanks and subscribe
subscribe now here I'm going to kill you
on a video game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
