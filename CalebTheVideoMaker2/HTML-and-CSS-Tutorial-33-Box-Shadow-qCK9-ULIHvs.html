going to be telling you how to make
these awesome shadows here and you can
put this on pretty much anything see
even the submit button has a sweet
shadow which meant you may not want to
do that but I thought it was pretty
awesome so yeah let's figure how to do
that I'm just gonna start from scratch
here by the way what I just deleted here
this is called a ID which will be
learning about that in a future video it
references this specific input type with
the ID submit which I mean I kinda just
threw it in there to show an example so
yeah let's learn so I'm gonna refresh
this is what it looks like now and this
is the property that we want is known as
board bombing box-shadow so we can set a
whole bunch of values in here the very
first one we can set is how far to
offset the shadow so I can say 10 pixels
and then I can set a color all right
okay so I need to set one more you have
to set the first value is the height or
horizontal offset and then the next one
is the vertical offset so 10 pixels 10
pixels so this is what it looks like now
we can change these so I can say 5 and
you can see it's scooted over to the
left because this is the first the first
value is the horizontal offset
then the vertical which is up and down
then we can set a color so I'm gonna
change this to a hexadecimal color let's
go 87 87 87 alright yeah there's a gray
there alright then the third one is
optional so this is the pretty much all
you have to have so I could make a
boarder with this I mean a box shadow
and it looked like like that but I don't
really think it looks good so I'm going
to add what's called a blur so that's
just just add another number at night
and that's going to blur it and it also
includes the blur spread so if I make
this make it 10 pixels it's going to
blur out farther I'm going to increase
these some so we can see it better so
I'm offsetting it more so now we are
starting to get a good-looking shadow
you see there's another setting we can
add in here which is the spread which is
sort of just like how big it goes
science 810 pixels and you can see that
looks pretty ridiculous so you can
either just not even put it in there at
all or you can find a value that looks
nice but whatever you want as you can
see we actually have a shadow on top of
it too this can this can be from the the
the blur and also if I crank this up to
like 60 you can see it goes a little bit
too far on all sides so the cut the
spread can make it look bad if you don't
if you don't use it right because you
might not want a shadow on all four
sides so hopefully that makes sense so
here are the values we put the first one
is how far to offset it this direction
the next one is how far did to put it
down next one is the blur
how much blur you want it so if I take
that number out put it zero pixels it's
going to be solid and you can see the
curved lines but I don't think that
looks good so I'm going to add some blur
all right there we go and it's still a
little too much I'm gonna put that down
too and I'm gonna make this seven so
there we go I think that's a good blur
and then the final one is the spread
which we just talked about that and then
finally we have the color so this can be
an RGB value I don't like one two five
one four two one five and just just for
a side note to help you guys when you
all the numbers are the same
it's a form of either white or black so
the closer the number is to 255
the lighter than color the lower it is
to zero the darker black is zero that
means one fifty-five is somewhere
between light gray and light gray so 255
is white we could divide that in half
and get like 126 or yes some 120 7.5 but
that's as far as I can go so yeah that's
something you can do you can also change
the color so it doesn't have to be black
or gray typically shadows are but it
doesn't really matter because I think
that looks pretty awesome if you asked
me so you can also have what's called an
inset so that puts the shadow on the
inside rather than on the outside so
I'll show you what that looks like so
that's what it can look like on the
inside all right you may be wondering
how can you move this on the other side
of the comments instead of having it
down in this corner we might want to up
in this corner well to do that we can
put a negative number for the box shadow
so now it's going to move to the left 5
pixels and up 5 pixels and I'm going to
take off the inset so now up 5 pixels
left 5 pixels or you can just have one
negative so now it's going to go down to
the left and so forth so you can mess
with that get some cool shadows and
share with me your results or whatever
it doesn't really matter but yeah that's
all I have to say about the Box shadow
and we will be talking about something
new in the next video so I will see you
then thank you and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
