I want to talk about look-up tables we
write that out for you soon see it
look-up tables so what is a lookup table
well I mean I have to kind of explain
something else first before we're gonna
get into this so just kind of relax and
take a take a good look I'm going to
raise this so I can have some room so
let's say we have a membership table or
membership database and we have a user
table or members table and within that
we have like a membership status okay
and let's say there's like 10 options I
guess so you could have like bronze
silver gold platinum titanium and then
like not a member or like trial member
or partner or special member or member
above all members I don't know I'm just
kind of making stuff up anyways
some people will create what's known as
a lookup table so they'll have a table
over here with every single option for
the membership so we could have the
memberships and then within here we
would have each individual row is one of
the membership statuses right so we have
like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
I'm just going to go with 9 this can't
fit anymore 9 individual rows and then
we so that's one column the ID for
example which I mean we could use a
different key if we needed but for this
we'll just use an ID and then we have a
column to say what do membership status
it so we could have like gold silver
bronze platinum and so forth now we can
have a members table and then a column
within this member table can reference
the key of the membership so remember
like one or two videos ago I talked
about how keys make connections between
tables well this is how that's done
here's an example of a connection using
a key what we would do is we would have
like the member the members user member
name or their ID for example and then we
have their first name last name address
phone number billing type whatever it is
and then we would have a column
membership you see and within here let's
just say for example we didn't have this
table this is gone we just had this
member table well when we have six
thousand rows within here the membership
type would get repeated lots and lots of
times we would have like gold gold gold
gold bronze platinum platinum platinum
bronze gold platinum bronze and go on go
on for all of the rows and that would
work that's that that is a possibility
for your database I'm not saying it's
going to cause your database to explode
or you'll get fired or anything well
unless you're told not to do that you
might get fired that's a possibility for
the database design now let's think what
kind of relationship is this one member
can have one membership and a membership
can have multiple people having a
membership so it's a one-to-many
relationship may one side is the
the membership you have one of these and
then you would have many people using
that so that means if we look if you
remember from the relationships we need
to take the key from this one and put it
over into this table and now if we add
this new relationship in we don't have
all of that repeating data because all
we do is reference one individual row
and there's some other benefits to that
which I'll explain in a second so now we
could be like rather than gold gold gold
silver bronze platinum we have 1 1 1 2 2
3 4 for all of our rows and we'd still
have individual information like Caleb
Jimmy Jake
Sally Sammy and Sarah well when we do
this little connection thing we have a
new connection between these tables
we're taking the key of the membership
which is this column right here so
here's our key and we are taking that
key and we are moving it over into the
member table so now this column right
here within a member table points back
to the key of the membership table this
is known as a foreign key now this will
help protect the integrity of our
database that's because there's only
nine possibilities for the membership
and if someone puts something else we
could flag an error the other thing is
we can have it to where it will not
accept an empty value and then if for
some reason we decide to change our like
let's say we wanted to change silver to
like I don't know diamond well then we
could change it here
and because this value is not over here
it's only a reference it will
automatically figure it out because you
see the key never changed the key still
one so one still points using one so
this connection is still here we value
all I'm side I guess it should have been
to whatever you get my point up up we
can change the name of gold we can make
it epic if you want an epic membership
well now we don't have to change 6000
rows within our member table we only had
to change one row within our membership
table and all these connections stay the
same so the IDS help create better
connections between tables requiring
less maintenance for our database and it
also protects our integrity because we
don't have to worry about incorrect
values within the membership because
it's all connected back to the
membership table which we change from
here so we update epoch it updates every
single instance of epoch within our
entire database or it gives us an error
or something we can set it using what's
known as foreign key constraints F key
at foreign key constraint
so because we're using what's known as a
relational database which is the type of
designing we're doing right now we have
relations tables and everything is
connected across the database it's not
all stored in one individual table but
to protect our integrity of our database
we create connections between keys that
way we don't have to worry about
incorrect data so what do keys oops I've
got my job what do keys do for us let's
write it up well first thing they
protect our integrity I made a video
over integrity so if you want to check
that out be sure to do that
so they protect our integrity how do
they do that well we don't have to worry
about only some values updating if you
remember we have the members table and
when we updated gold and we named the
epoch it updated every single row within
the member table so it protects all of
our values so it updates less
maintenance for us less incorrect data
what else does it key do keeps
everything unique and you might have saw
that in the member table we used the the
key number one multiple times we had
three people with the member ID outside
the membership ID one so three people
had gold for example well it's still
unique because they're still only
talking about one individual gold over
here in our membership we had gold was
one of the options we could have three
people
all right you see up for hunter arms
these three people can all have a gold
membership and it's still unique because
we're only talking about one individual
value with three references to that
value if we got rid of these foreign
keys and we just had to say what
membership status they had well now this
guy's going to be gold this guy's going
to be gold this gal is going to be gold
so now we have one two three times that
gets rid of the uniqueness from the key
so protects our uniqueness it improves
our speed so basically uh improve
functionality of our database I'm just
going to function on my not a room and
it does a whole bunch of other things
basically it makes updating easier so
let's work for us because we don't have
to go through manually and check every
value we can just update that individual
value you know the other thing is it
allows for added complexity this long
one oh my hands get tired oh okay
and I you can even see all that ok so
here's just some examples I'll see I'll
show you how we could say it allows for
added complexity let's see I'm going to
redraw the example we had but I'm not
going to draw a super in-depth so don't
don't wait dummy don't worry it won't
take that long
we add a members and then we had a
membership all right now let's focus on
this membership
table let's make a little bigger
actually what we had earlier was we had
an ID we had one two three four and so
forth and then we had the title of
whatever they are so if you wanted to
draw this better you could put the
column headers so we could have like ID
and then we could say name of the
membership and then we could title the
table we could have it membership the
membership yes that worth well what we
can do we can have added complexity
because now we can add a new column and
we could say more about the gold
membership so we could say price and we
can have a monthly price of $60 for
example if we didn't do this whole
lookup table thing and we put it all
within our members table let's see how
that would look let's try it all right
let's have a members table and let's not
even have a membership table well now we
have the guy with the ID 789 and 3 and
we'll have their names be Caleb
Tommy Tracy so those are those three
people's talking about with the gold
memberships well what what membership to
death we got gold gold and gold now how
much does that cost them sixty sixty and
sixty just with this little example of
three people we already have four
unnecessary values because we have
repeating data we have G in doing G
twice more we have sixty sixty twice
more that eliminates the functionality
of our database because we're having
tons of repeating data so you might
think the best way to do this is get rid
of this price well now we get rid of the
complexity of our database and sometimes
complexity is a good thing because it
allows us to store more information when
we use the common aluminum sign we use
the lookup table
we can just have that as another column
we can put more things we could have
another column saying how long does this
membership last we have another call I'm
saying I don't know special perks or
what can use within our gym or what can
we use and are we allowed to bring
friends what's the price for friends we
can do all that kind of stuff within
this table and just reference that
within the other table it's only a set
number of options so we reduce the
repeating data if we wanted to do it all
well we'd have to put each individual
column and we'd get tons of repeating
data you know what I mean yeah so that
is an example of how
you
because that would take forever so
that's very common it's common for
things with a set number of options so
like membership type there's only so
many options you can have states
sometimes sometimes people do it for sex
male or female some people do it for mmm
I can't think of anything else right off
the top of my head but anytime there's a
set number of options they will often
put a lookup table with the ID the name
of that option or what that option is
like gold silver bronze or male female
or California all the other states
Wyoming Texas Russia kidding well then
we only have a set number of option so
that's that's the exam we could put more
information about it we could say male
and then like what the male is allowed
to do on the website or anything that
allows for extra complexity for our
database so I know this videos like 60
minutes long and I was rambling a ton
but hopefully that cleared things up
completely and yeah that's all I have to
say so I'll see you guys in the next
