going over something really cool and
it's a little tricky at first but it
won't be too bad basically sometimes
when we're writing music and we use only
main feel of it is triplets triple-a
triple-a triple it da da da da da
whatever it is it feels right when it's
written in tributes so for writing the
song we're going to have to go one two
three right at three above it one two
three right at three above it and so on
for the entire song well they created
some musical genius created a new
concept to make triplets the normal
notes and everything else awkward notes
not awkward but not the normal I'm not
normal and I'm pretty awkward so that's
why I said that anyways now instead of
the quarter note getting the beat squeak
squeak squeak squeak squeak that's the
quarter note we will give the dotted
quarter note the B what's the dotted
quarter note well the dot means to add
half of whatever it is to it so this is
worth a fourth on measure now we're
adding 1.5 on measure which is the
equivalent of saying 3 over 8 so three
eighth notes is another way to say what
this means 383 eighth notes so if three
eighth notes get the beat that means
there's three every beat one two three
one two three two two three three two
three four two three we don't have to
say that there's a three above them
because they're not triplets they wove
it in they sound like triplets and they
feel like triplets but really it's just
three eighth notes because the dotted
quarter note gets the beat so that means
we're playing in all triplets natural to
play
naturally it sounds natural to play in
triplets so how can we signify this well
since the dotted quarter note gets the
beat which remember is 3 over 8 notice
how we have to have it over 8 because it
doesn't make sense to say 1 over 5 1.5
over 4 so we put it over 8 now if we
have three I mean typically we will have
four beats or four counts i should say
in a measure 3 times 4 is 12 so will
often see this written as 12-8 time this
is this differs from 44 or cut time
which is 22 so now every single beat
will get three eighth notes or a dotted
quarter times three so now when we're
writing straight eighth notes quarter
notes i should say it which gets one
count one two three four now we're going
to have to make them dotted quarter
notes so one and two I mean we could
wait we're going to count these in
triplets because it feels natural triple
triple or one two three four if you're
not subdividing now this means we create
the next broken down note it becomes
shrimp list without the threes you guys
we don't have to signify the breeze
anymore because we know that's how it's
to be played one two three one two three
one two three one two three this is all
called compounds time and yes this is
very common so you should know how to
read it and Count it so basically if we
see
over eight that's the equivalent of four
dotted quarters because a dotted quarter
is worth three eighth notes set 3 over 8
plus 3 over 8 plus 3 over 8 plus 3 over
8 well we get that's like saying this
number doesn't change because we're
adding not multiplying so 3 plus 3 plus
3 that's nine plus three is twelve 12 /
8 that's the same thing as having four
counts per measure four beats per
measure with 12 counts i should say so i
get those words mixed up swapped up the
beats the count is how you count so
we've counted 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 that is
how we count compound time but how many
beats are there there's four one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve that's the difference
between um beats and counts so we may
see some and 68 which gives two beats
per measure and anything that's a
multiple of 3 so 3 6 9 12 8 so 9 12 8
Andrea 8 15 but typically we'll see
either 6 8 or 12 8 this will be the same
thing as having two dotted quarter notes
as the beat every single measure and if
we wanted to create a measure of eighth
notes which would sound like triplets it
would be like this triple the triple
123456 123456 so on so if we created
sixteenth notes and we did it in digit
to dig that's like saying diggity
diggity diggity together so that is the
basis of compound time and i'll see you
in the next video so see you then bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
