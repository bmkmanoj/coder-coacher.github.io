going to be talking about the pentatonic
scale if you remember in my last video a
couple not my exact last one but a
couple back Penta is 5 so this is any 5
note scale now it really could be
anything so there's a typical pattern
used with pentatonic scales that
recognized once so really any pentatonic
scales you'll see are typically on these
black keys because there's five of them
and a scale in an octave so that's
really convenient and almost any
pentatonic scale you will see will use
these keys like I just said I'm just
repeating myself so I'm going to be
going over the major pentatonic scale
now what is the major pentatonic scale
well it would be G flat a flat B flat D
flat and E flat
these are assigned do the black keys of
the keyboard how would this scale be
played that's the major pentatonic scale
now we can say these are the notes but
we could also raise it up a half-step
and have G a B D and E it doesn't always
have to be on the Black Keys but the
intervals derive from the black key so
so yeah alright so as I was trying to
say there's consistent steps between
each note what are the steps
well these pentatonic scales we'll be
talking about are always consisted well
they always consist of a whole plus a
half note half-step sorry
and whole steps so we either have three
half steps or two half steps
up to three semitones or two semitones
so the intervals here are whole whole
whole plus half all and then back to the
beginning we have a whole plus F so
here's the pattern
pull-pull-pull plus a plus half so we're
starting on G whole whole whole whole
plus 1/2 is 3 so then a whole and then
hopeless half what you can't go that far
so basically and I stopped it at this
one right here and then just go back to
back down this direction but you don't
have to you keep going up the scale for
example
see what I'm saying but basically these
are the patterns this is the patent to
get back to the tonic and that is the
major pentatonic scale now a lot of
people instead of thinking of these
whole step half step pattern patterns
they will think of it differently
they'll think of it as taking a major
scale such well we have the the tonic
basically what we're going to do is if
we are on f-sharp major scale we go to
so that's the tonic second third we're
gonna erase the fourth so basically just
get rid of the fourth fifth sixth get
rid of the seventh and we are back to
where we started one two three five six
octave so what would this be in a C
major scale it would be C D E G a and C
it makes sense so all we're really doing
is getting rid of the fourth get rid of
that and getting rid of the seventh so
if we're in the key of G G F I'm sorry F
what am I thinking
g a b c d e f g we're gonna get rid of
the f-sharp and we're going to get rid
of the C so now we would have
pretty cool so that is the major
pentatonic scale see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
