time I'm going to be showing you the
scales on his staff because it really
helps make the sense of things so so far
we learned the major scale major we
learned the natural minor oops minor now
we're going to learn what's called the
harmonic minor now if we remember for
now let's just worry about the minor
scales so we started we started on a and
this is gonna be in trouble clef which
means this is G which makes this a so
here's a and then we just go up every
single line or space we don't skip any I
don't it doesn't matter what scale it's
in all the way up until we get to AG in
which that's G so that's a so that's the
the minor natural minor for a minor or a
alright so now what a harmonic minor
does is it will raise the seventh note
so this will become sharp so the
original from A to G is a whole step
from G to C wait wait what am I thinking
alright sorry from A to B is a whole
step from B to C is a half step C to D
is a whole d to e is a whole you to F is
a half now the original I'm going to
write the original natural minor from F
to G is a whole and then from G to A is
a whole so this is the natural minor I
think so so now if we have the harmonic
minor we get whole half whole whole half
but now we get a whole plus a half
because we raised it and it was
originally a hole but now it's a hole
plus a half or three half steps and now
I would say we have a hole but we
actually have a half now this is because
when we take a note and scoot it over so
let's say rather if we scoot it over the
distance between the next two becomes
smaller rather than this it becomes this
four that's just an example of kind of
blur in there for a minute so the
distance between these two notes G sharp
to a is only a half rather than a hole
so here is the formula for a natural
minor scale whole half whole whole half
whole plus half half now that's the
difference between a natural minor and a
harmonica player it sounds a little
different too
more of that uh you know that snake
thing or you like play a pipe and then
like the snakes like whoo sounds more
like that but whatever so when we're
making scales we fill every single line
in space even if it's a major scale now
uh when we are descending basically
going the opposite direction if you
remember a while ago I said the sharp
continues on so you may see a sharp sign
in parentheses or you may see no sharp
sign because it's already assumed to be
sharp it just depends but when you're
ascending the sharp signs still be there
we go okay you see if you can focus on
this a we play the sharp still we do not
skip it on the way back down and play it
G instead we still play G sharp so it's
very important that we remember the
sharp sign on the way back so if we need
to remind yourself with little
parentheses that's just saying to repeat
the sharp sign even though it's already
assumed so that is the harmonic minor
scale versus the natural minor scale
there is one more minor scale we're
going to learn about but it's very
similar so there's not too much to worry
about yes so even even if it's a little
difficult it's a very it's very uh try
to think the joke here give me a minute
we won't use some of these minor scales
quite as often I guess you could say
they play a minor role in our music
theory oh man
get it minor like okay I give up I think
I think I'll just give it a rest I think
our to use that joke dang it I don't
know if I use that joke or not all right
well yeah see you in next video so
subscribe and click like I don't even
think you can see that it says click
like and follow me on Twitter and
whatever else so yeah see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
