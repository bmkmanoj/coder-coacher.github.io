text options now there are 4 of them and
basically the one you want to use is the
one that'll store what you need as you
can see these are the numbers that these
will store so tiny text gives you an
amount of characters from 0 to 255 all
right but long text down here allows for
4 billion 294 million nine hundred sixty
seven thousand two hundred ninety five
so let's say you have a message stored
in a database and it's forty thousand
characters long
alright you go to tiny text you see it
does not fit so cross this one out and
text it will fit and also these two will
also it would fit so which one should
you use well the rule to follow is use
the smallest one that'll store what you
need so as you can see if it's forty
thousand it is under this one of sixty
five thousand and sixteen million is far
bigger than sixteen eighty five thousand
so you will want to use the text box
okay now I have a storage size of these
basically whatever you store in one of
these you will add a byte to four bytes
so let's say you have a twenty character
long input into the database entry to
the database that would be twenty bytes
plus one for tiny text but if you store
it as a long text it'd be twenty plus
four so as you can see this one would be
the better one to use because it's a
smaller file size hamburger how many
characters is this you can see three
three three
so nine so using the character set utf-8
it is three bytes per and character so
three times three 909
nine nine now if we store this as tiny
text that would be +1 9 18 27 that's
like 27 plus one that's 28 bytes here we
have varchar' versus text now if you
remember varchar' was a variable storage
as in varchar' 10 you could enter dog
and it would cut everything short to 3
characters whereas text will also do
that so what's what's really the
difference well that's what um it kind
of depends on a lot because there are
character sets and also table types
so basically varchar' is usually better
with smaller entries such as names
subjects addresses just like small
entries and text is usually better for
larger things such as messages or like
huge blogs and yeah you get the point so
um also Lincoln like down in the
description or wherever it's at in the
future
some articles that will help you decide
what you need to use but what I just
said that's usually what I'll follow
varchar' for small entries and text for
larger entries and obviously varchar'
the limit is 6 5 5 3 5 and 4 all the way
up to long text it was like what was it
4 billion something so obviously if it's
larger than that you have to go with the
text options</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
