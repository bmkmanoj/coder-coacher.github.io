the way welcome to your next music
theory tutorial I started talking about
time with music so everything is in time
well we need a way to display how that
time is written that's used by a time
signature and there's one specific 1
i'll be going over it's called for for
time and wow this thing is so annoying
gosh you can't even see my awesome name
anymore oh it's lame but anyways uh
four-four time is very common that hits
why it's called common time so you may
see this as common time which is
represented with a seat now this means
there are four beats in the measure and
what kind of beats this for represents
quarter note beats so if you don't
really know why we haven't gotten to
reading music yet so basically music is
broken up into little segments I already
mentioned this called measures each one
will have four beats so mary had a
little lamb little lamb little lamb its
broken up and do for that's if is this
was a three it'd be broken up into three
beats mary had a little lamb little lamb
which wouldn't be as fitting for the
song so basically we're not really going
to get too much into time signatures
right yet because i only need to explain
this for the next concept we're going to
learn so this is just like a
prerequisite but all I'm trying to say
is what gets the beat is down here how
many of them are up here so before
represents quarter notes which look like
this and there's four of them and every
measure because why are there four of
them and every measure because we said
so
so that's basically what common time is
for beats a measure and the only reason
we do that is so we can read music
easily ER he's a leader that's not even
a word yet but anyways we're going to
learn that there's four beats in each of
these measures because we said there's
four beats and how what kind of beats
are they there are quarter note beats
because that's what the four means and
you may not know why the four means that
yet but that's perfectly fine because
we're getting a lot later basically the
floor just means coordinates that's all
you gotta know so yeah um what else not
to say about that hmm think wait reasons
I'll give you an example the song here
we have our five line staff it's in
trouble plus and the time signature is
44 that means we can have four quarter
notes pull per measure 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
12 now I want to show you something let
me write two more of these if I play
some on top of each other like this
those are played and harmony and they
only take up one beat because they're
played together one two three four so
that's what I'm saying that is an
example of a song it's probably not a
good sounding song but it's a song right
yes it is because I said it is now I
think that's all we need to know if we
change this to a three that means there
would only be three beats per measure so
we couldn't have these extra fourth
notes one two three two two three three
two three four two three hopefully that
makes sense and that's all I have to say
for this video so next video we're going
to start talking about key signatures
they're awesome so ya see that thanks
subscribe home by the way this is my
name I drew that at the beginning of the
song
it's cool and also if you look over here
it says subscribe follow me it Caleb
curry well that's on Twitter and then
click like so you should probably do
that considering i told you to thanks
