talking a little bit more about
pentatonic scales and mainly onna to
talk about moving the step pattern sort
of like modes so when we had modes we
had old old half oh wow this was the
Ionian mode what we could do was take
this whole scoot it to the end whole
half whole whole half full that was
Dorian mode it's a little too break
would you say there we go
so basically we can do the same thing
with the pentatonic scales so the first
one we had was major so what we can do
is take this scoot it to the end and I'm
using a different color now because I
want to we get whole cool plus half
we're just scooting everything over full
whole plus half
oh and then we can do it again whole
plus half whole whole plus half oh do it
again
Oh whole plus half whole whole whole
plus half and then once again we can do
it again whole plus half pull pull pull
plus half and these this is a major
pentatonic this is the minor pentatonic
so these three in-between are actually
three different types of these
pentatonic scales and I decided not to
go over each one of these individually
because I really have no clue about them
but I'm going to talk a little bit about
them which is odd because I don't know
anything about them all right here's the
other three
this is suspended pentatonic man gone
maybe writ to sin I don't even know how
to pronounce them this may be called the
yo scale which you may have heard of
that I might go over that I don't know
probably not
it contrasts with in scale so anyways
basically you may hear these basically
they're just the pentatonic starting on
a different degree of the scale and all
we're doing is just shifting these over
as you can see there's a pattern
this gets scooted over each time alright
so if we look at a keyboard and we're
playing these on the Black Keys the
major would be like starting on G flat
whoops
make sense this is just an octave of
this one sometimes I don't play that
octave I mean that a note it doesn't
really matter so the next one suspended
is this one would be starting on B flat
we're just going up the scale
this one would be like starting on the
next one D flat rather than B flat so
then finally minor is like starting on B
flat sweetie
yeah sure is so when we talk about modes
we can start on a certain note to make
them all natural notes the major one
would be C so let me use a different
color here let's pull this out of my
pocket
major where can I write this can you see
over there hopefully major would be C
next one would be starting on D next one
e then this one G and then the finally a
so this is basically the first second
third fifth and then the sixth then
we're skipping the fourth and the
seventh we're getting rid of them and
we're back to the clinic so C D E G a C
right so we can think of that as in no
matter so we can think of that in other
context for other scales to fit the
diatonic notes within that scale for
example let's try one in G alright so
this one you can think of that starting
on the tonic second the third so one two
three five and six and let's say we
start on well the fifth notes let's go
with this one the sixth well the sixth
of G would be g a b c d e f sharp g one
two three four five six
and I'll try not to confuse you but the
natural minor to get the the pentatonic
scale from it we take one three four
five seven and then one and like I said
we're starting on this scale degree so
we get is from the e natural the natural
notes we get e skip F and go to G then a
then what's after a B and skip C and go
to D and back to e so this is the E
minor scale and the key of G
conveniently enough this this didn't
even matter because we never even used
that scale degree so it didn't really
even matter so that's probably a
horrible example then but oh well so
let's draw this out on the staff real
quick so we're in the key of G and this
will be treble clef so we start on E
skip the second which would be F and go
to G and then go to a go to B we skip C
and go to C sorry yeah D and then we are
back to e so that would be then we can
descend back down so this would be the E
minor pentatonic in the key of G so guys
that's all I have to talk about for the
pentatonic modes and I didn't go over
too much but that's because we talked
about modes for the major scale it's
kind of the same concept I'll just a
little bit more funky because we're
skipping notes here and there and but
you get the point
really so if you didn't quite understand
that you can go research that online or
read a book over it or something but
basically that should be enough
information to get you started and
Shadia will be going over something new
so I'll see you then and sure to
subscribe if you can't see these pieces
of tape up here
