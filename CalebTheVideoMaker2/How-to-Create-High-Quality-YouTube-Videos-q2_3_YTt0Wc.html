curry this is a video that's going to
help you make higher quality youtube
videos if it's helpful be sure to
subscribe alright so basically this
video is going to cover creating higher
higher quality content and improving the
quality of your videos so I create
tutorials I teach people how to do
things but a lot of these are set in
stone you can use them for anything i'm
just going to give you general of a
general idea of what's going to help you
so if you never seen it in my other
videos i have some other videos on
getting more views and uh checking your
analytics to get better content in the
future and so forth so this is this
going to be a continuation of fat
alright so the first three things that
are pretty much the basics that are
going to help you want are the tags of
your videos your video title and you're
still frame for the video so the tags
what's a tag a tag is something you
would put on your video so it comes up
when people search that so for example I
may make a tag tutorial that will be one
of my tags then when people search
tutorial there's a chance that my video
might come up since I put that tag in my
tag list now there's a lot of people
that will use the tutorial the tag
tutorial so it probably won't come first
up at the top and so forth but it is
good idea to use good quality tags so a
good way you can figure out if a tag is
good or to get some suggestions for tags
is to sign up for Adwords and then go to
on your homepage go to tools and
analysis tab and click keyword planner
and then you can search different tags
figure out their bids and all kinds of
good stuff that's going to help you
figure out what is a good tag to use for
you
video obviously the tax should be
related don't put hot chicks and lots of
money and Lamborghinis and stuff as your
tags so they come up and searches
related to that stuff when you're
creating content on baking cookies make
sure they're related tags you may get
more views if you put certain tags but a
lot of those views are going to be
unrelated and so forth so what I
recommend is to use good tags related to
your content so it does not to be
specific so let's say I make am a
tutorial on how to create a website with
WordPress I can make a tag PHP
programming my SQL programming database
design of and so forth like that
blogging and all those tags that are
somewhat related but not necessarily
exactly what the video is about because
someone who may be looking up PHP
programming is trying to figure out how
they can get a website up and running
and they may find out that WordPress is
a better solution to their problems
rather than programming it from scratch
so if you don't know what I'm talking
about with WordPress and all that junk
don't worry about it it's unrelated
basically what I'm trying to say is the
tags need to be related and good quality
tags that are somewhat connected to your
content I always put the title and
anything similar to the title and my
tags as well as some defaults Caleb
curry Caleb curry Caleb the video maker
to a tutorial free education some of
those stuff for my general videos the
next one was good title so make sure
your title is catchy but accurate don't
make a title that has nothing to do with
your video so I mean I can't really
think of any examples all right let's
say in the future amazon make some
copies something from google and you
make your youtube video about it
explaining this controversy and used you
name it uh amazon is sued by google
and with a question mark and they never
really were you just put that title to
attract people's attention they click on
it well it is related to your content
but it's not a very accurate title and
the changes are you going to get
dislikes so what you want to do is
create titles that are accurate but do
describe the content and are
high-quality eye catching titles so
don't make it Oh video number 112
because I don't really think you'll know
what it's about so look at some of my
titles they're pretty simple i always
just PHP tutorial what number 32 and
then i say what the video is about you
can get more advanced i don't recommend
using a ton of capital letters and fancy
words just keep it simple stupid kiss
method so yeah tags title make sure the
tags are appropriate make sure the title
is appropriate to the content if it's
not you're going to attract the wrong
audience and you're going to get a bunch
of dislikes the third is a good freeze
frame so what's a freeze frame well
that's when you see like related videos
you see a picture with each video those
I call the freeze frames I don't know
what the technical term is but uh what
you want is an attractive freeze frame
now I have the option to upload my own
picture if I so wish I don't do this
very often because I don't really think
it's necessary but most of the high
quality professional youtubers at the
top make a custom picture for each one
of their videos I who is making a
tutorial series of like sex 260 videos
for example I don't think I need to make
a custom picture for each one so what I
do is once the video is uploaded there's
three options that YouTube pics I'll
find one that makes it look clear that
I'm illustrating a concept i'll click
that one it's good if none of them are
good i'll usually find another part in
the video that looks good i'll print
screen it
paste it to paint crop it so it's the
right size so get all the other start
menu and all that stuff cut that out
save it and then upload it and use that
as my freeze frame I have also used some
custom freeze frames so when I made
videos over the c920 logitech webcam I
took some pictures added some text and
then I uploaded those as my freeze frame
I figured those were more appropriate
because that's what the video is about
but if I'm making a freeze frame for PHP
tutorial 27 I don't think I need to make
a custom picture but if you want you can
so all all it really matters is that you
have appropriate tags appropriate titles
appropriate meaning related to the
content an appropriate picture for your
video so those go over the three basic
stamp basic things that can cover any
type of video whether it be comedy
tutorial or anything you want to have
the three main tags title and picture i
also have a lot of other stuff here then
go over the next one just all of these
following guidelines are just a
guideline it's not a rule book you don't
have to do all of this if you want you
can but I'm just trying to give you
ideas on how to improve the quality of
your content specifically improving a
specific video rather than your entire
channel so the first one I want to cover
introductions so this is a common thing
and some people say it's bad some people
say it's good so an example of an
introduction is when you start the video
a logo comes up and then it says what
the title of the video is and who it's
by and whatever and then the video
starts playing so I personally don't
like introductions I've done them before
but they can they can't be good for some
people if they're short that's the
important thing keep them short because
if you make a long introduction well
there's only so much time you have to
attract someone's attention if it takes
up to
let's say 10 seconds is the attention
span of a person watching your video and
your trailer or your miniature trailer /
introduction is seven seconds well then
there's only three seconds left to catch
that person's attention after seven
seconds that persons not going to be
interested in that content but if you
don't have an introduction well the
video automatically starts playing they
grab your to grab their attention they
are more likely to watch the rest of the
video or more of the video sometimes an
introductions are good for example if
you have a branding or a a series of
some sort for example i can think of
Smosh they make comedy videos on here
and they have an introduction it's an
entertaining introduction and it's
different every time that's another
thing I personally do introductions but
I do them inside of the video with
different every single time so when I
make it when I make a video I say hey my
name is Caleb the video maker Caleb
curry whatever this video I'm going to
be talking about this if you like it be
sure to subscribe simple like that takes
a few seconds and then get right into
the content and it's not a blank screen
with a logo that people have to stare at
for a couple of seconds so yeah I think
that's all I had to say about that yes
but always make sure you don't have a
long intro if you have a two-minute
video with a 30 second intro I guarantee
you 30 plus percent of people are not
going to watch your video just because
they have to watch that advertisement no
one wants to watch 30 second
introduction advertising your logo I
mean honestly it's not that fun and if
you have a slow internet connection and
you have to wait two minutes for a
30-second intro to load it's going to
make a lot of people mad and they're
probably not going to watch your content
either that or they will dislike their
content and you don't want dislikes you
want likes obviously so that covers
introductions next thing
audio recording I'm not going to be
talking about actually talking here I'm
going to be saying recording actual
audio eliminate all constant noises so
if you have a fan if you're somewhere
where it's hot or at summer time for
example and there's a fan because even
if it's really quiet turn it off it's it
annoys people I mean it annoys me I
don't know if Emily's other people but
you may not think of it when you're what
listening is the audio content but when
someone's listening back to it and all
the hairs and their ear buds it's going
to drive them insane and they're not
going to be able to focus on your
content an example of mine I had a
battery charger and when you put
batteries in it had this really really
quiet high-pitched noise just like you
couldn't really hear it but it was loud
enough to where it could be picked up by
a video camera audio microphone I mean
so I turned that off when i'm recording
videos or move it to another part of the
room i have dogs in my basement which I
record my videos in so I always close
their door so if they bark it's not
super loud and also in that room there's
a furnace and all kinds of other junk
that makes a lot of noise and it's
annoying one year throughout the entire
video so basically turn off all constant
Moyes's and most importantly of all turn
off the TV there's so many YouTube
videos which have a TV playing in the
background which is super annoying no
one wants to watch TV when they're
watching a YouTube video if they wanted
to do that they go turn on the TV not go
on your YouTube video so turn off the TV
basically you want the entire audio to
be focused on what they should be
listening to not other stuff because if
you have what you're talking about and
then 50 other things in the background
it's going to be harder to focus on you
if possible get to a silent room where
there's not a lot of people
and so forth in my case I make videos in
the basement occasionally you'll hear
noise from upstairs people talking or
whatever i do have a curtain which sort
of helps block the noise but even with
that you can still hear it and it's kind
of annoying in my opinion but there's
not much I can do about it so obviously
I'm not perfect at it either but just
work at it and try to get a high quality
room for audio recording yes so now we
are talking about video recording and
specifically recording in real life so
I'm not going to be talking about on
screen I will but just not yet so
that'll be in a few minutes the first
thing I recommend recording in 16 by 9
aspect ratio that is HD of aspect ratio
so that means it's going to be wider and
not like a square because normal
standard quality videos are in 43 aspect
ratio what that means is that the length
let's say it's 4 inches the height would
be 3 inches well that's not a good
aspect ratio for YouTube because then
you get these black bars on the side of
your video which drive people insane
makes it a lower quality video and
there's you can't fit as much content
with on within the limited amount of
screen you're given so you want a 16 by
9 recording aspect ratio if you can't
find that that's ok but don't do your
best to find that focus so always make
sure your camera is in focus it's
horrible when you create an entire video
and you realize oh the whole thing is
blurry that's really bad and annoying so
make sure it's in focus now there's two
options for focusing there's auto focus
and manual focus it just depends on what
you want to use if you are making videos
by yourself and you're not moving you
may want to use manual focus so you set
how close or how
focused you want to be how close you're
standing to the camera and you leave it
like that for the entire video but if
you're moving around or the focus needs
to change if you're zooming in or you
step out of the video and it focuses on
something else you may want auto focus
so auto focus is going to focus on its
own and it will adjust to different
distances from the camera manual focus
you set on your own and it's not going
to adjust so if you step closer to the
camera you may be blurry for the rest of
the video and that's bad but it can be
good if you practice at it and you know
how far to zoom out or Amina how far to
focus another thing with auto focus
sometimes cameras are noisy when they
auto focus so once you go out of focus
they focus in Crisco show every time it
focuses and it cuts out actual audio and
makes another annoying noise if that's
the case I recommend manual focus but if
it's quiet go for it just make sure
throughout the video it doesn't focus in
a nap I made some videos for when I made
database design videos and the whole
time it would get blurry and then it
would refocus it would get blurry and
then order to refocus it would have been
better if I just put on manual focus and
focus on me the whole time oh yeah those
that's that's it so so far we had aspect
ratio the focus on the next thing is a
cameraman versa tripod obviously if you
have a camera man or woman there you're
going to need another person so if
you're making videos on your own that
could be a problem tripod is good for
that case although if you're making
videos where you need to move around or
zoom in on things but you still have to
be in the video well that in that case
then a camera man may be the best option
another thing is if you're making
cinematic movies or whatever most of the
time they are not going to use a tripod
they will have a professional cameraman
that little movement
the camera beginners usually think
that's unprofessional but experts always
put that in there because it's better
than a still camera which makes it look
like a home video if you watch any
cinematic movies you'll almost always
see some camera movement just very
little because the cameraman skilled and
they have a stable Tamara so yeah I
prefer cameramen for high quality
cinematic videos but for tutorials and
stuff I use a tripod and if necessary
all y'all do the camera work and I won't
be in the video all right another thing
is don't cut things off so if you have
so much room within your camera screen
make sure the subject you're recording
is within that camera screen so for
example I did an unboxing video of the
logitech camera i just talked about
earlier and i accidentally pulled it too
far out this way and it cut off part of
the top of the box and although that top
of the box wasn't significant to
unboxing it it still bugged people and
it's hard to focus on the video when
it's too far out it just gets on peoples
nerves and what you want to do is don't
distract people from watching your
content so I figured that was an a
distracting thing in that video the most
important thing to not cut off is your
head if you're recording a tutorial or
something don't make the video record
from here to here make it record from
here to here because that little bit
over the top of your head is annoying
and if you bob up and down your heads
going to go in and out of the frame so I
always make sure that there's ample room
above me and to the side of me and if
I'm recording something close up
occasionally I'll break the rules and go
out of the frame a tad but typically i
try to be completely in the frame and i
don't mean your entire body obviously
you can't see my legs but i'm not going
to record this video like this because
it would really get on your nerves maybe
possibly and you got to think of people
you know those people who just get
annoyed by everything your goal is to
try to plea
these those people because then the
chances are you're going to please all
the other people to a lot of stuff so
far ah now another thing is when you're
recording something make sure you are
close enough to see what you were trying
to show so a lot of people making videos
expect people to know what to look for
expect them to know how it works and
expect them to be able to see what you
are doing this is not the case so you
want to expect that people don't
understand what you're trying to say you
want to expect that they can't see close
enough and they don't see what you're
doing so what you need to do is you need
to communicate in a way that's easily
understandable you need to show very
close up what you are doing and then you
need to illustrate how it's done in a
simple easy-to-follow manner so that I'm
specifically thinking like if I white if
I write on a whiteboard I've tried to
get close enough to where you can
actually see what's being written or
else the whole purpose of the whiteboard
is annoying and you don't need it now
you may be able to see you may record a
video and you'll test it on your video
on your computer screen you bet I can
see fine that's good that's not always
good enough though what if the person
watching your youtube video is on a few
inch smartphone screen on a cell phone
well then all that little content on
your whiteboard is going to be hard to
read obviously I probably need to work
on this because I don't really focus on
that much and it's freezing so I'm
putting this sweatshirt on so make sure
you are zoomed in enough during the
video but not zoomed in so far that they
have to look at one thing the entire
time and they can't see you talk if
people can see you talk then they have a
higher chance of understanding what you
are saying
so that's all I have for video recording
now I'm going to go to on-screen video
recording my hairs all poofy close
enough alright so when you are recording
something on a video screen always use
some form of screen recorder I mean you
know always have to do that if you are
illustrating something that needs a
handheld camera but if you're making
like tutorial on resetting window size
on a 127 it doesn't really matter i
can't think of anything then you want to
record it with a screen recorder so an
example of a screen recorder is
camstudio probably the most common one
another one Camtasia these are going to
record the screen in high quality easy
to view content if you take a camera and
you put it in front of the screen and
record well then you have hand movement
glare and you can't see pixels very
nicely because just because but if you
have a screen recorder you can zoom in
on specific things you can move around
and it's takes up the whole screen this
is better so get a screen recorder get a
16 by 9 recorder and of the the
resolution you want to record in you
want to record in 1080p quality with
actual video cameras you can use 720 or
1080 personally I think 720 is plenty
high enough to record for making
tutorials so most of my videos are in
720 plus my camera only records in 720
what if it could record in 1080i
probably wouldn't use it that's because
of file size I have to upload all these
videos to youtube and 1080 doesn't make
it much of a difference and I think
seven
20 is high enough resolution to record a
person talking but for recording on
screen if you're using a 16 by 9 a
screen you will want to record in 1080p
to get the whole screen in high
definition and then if you need to show
illustrate something you can zoom very
close up so this little speck can be
blown up very largely because there's a
lot more pixels to record in which gives
you a more crisp image so when I create
tutorials on the screen and I need to
click on a box or something and I want
people to be able to see where I'm going
I'll take around that box and I'll blow
it up to take up the whole screen so now
you see just what I'm clicking and it's
still high quality enough to look like
the same quality it doesn't look
pixelated so you want the highest
resolution possible that is in 16 by 9
recording size typically when you record
the screen the file size would be pretty
large so i recommend you edit it or
compress it with camtasia studio or
something like that as for what came a
camera screen recorder to get there's
all kinds of methods if you get
camstudio it's free there's settings in
there that you may need to adjust to get
the best quality you can find videos on
how to do that check out PCM tech Craig
Chamberlain has one on getting higher
quality Camtasia Studio I'm sorry
camstudio quality that he is a video on
getting higher camstudio quality you can
also use camtasia which is a paid
program but it has an actual studio
where you can edit your videos zoom in
on specific things after you've already
recorded it you can record with a webcam
and microphone
and so forth so I think Camtasia is a
better option but it also is a more
expensive option but if you can use it
to edit other videos and such such what
you're good if you can use it to edit
your video camera content as well as
your on-screen content to make good
videos there's also subtitle options
within the editor and so forth if you
use camstudio you're going to have to
take that file insert it into another
editor such as Windows Movie Maker adobe
premiere Sony Vegas I movie or camstudio
I mean Camtasia editor so yeah hopefully
that made sense basically camstudio is
free Camtasia cost money there's also a
million other so look around next thing
is a transition movements so when I'm
going through a video rather than
recording the entire screen if I'm
recording a specific thing up in the
corner I'll zoom all transition so I
focus on that one point its larger so
people can easily see what I'm doing and
then when I'm done and I go back over
here I can zoom back out to the whole
screen and people can focus on the
little screen but almost all times you
will need to overemphasize what people
are supposed to be seeing don't expect
them to know where to click or what to
do because if they knew that then they
want to be watching your video for
example if you make a video how to
rotate an image in Adobe Photoshop well
if they look that up the chances are
they don't know how to do it so if you
just say okay do this do this do this do
this you're probably going to overwhelm
them and they're not going to like your
video so what you need to do is do it
very slowly simply clearly so that they
can understand what you are trying to
show through the video they want to
understand how to rotate an image you
want to illustrate that in a simple way
that is going to make your video
superior to other pupils another great
thing that's helpful for screen
recording is to use multiple monitors so
that's your computer screen I have two
of them I have one right here so right
here
and then I have another one right here
and it makes things super super more
easier super easy this is because I can
take the Start menu drag it to the other
screen so when i'm recording it doesn't
show all my programs i have up it
doesn't show what program i'm recording
with all you see is what i'm actually
showing you on the video screen i wish i
could show you my screen but i can't
right now so by doing that it gives me
more recording room and there's no Start
menu in the way so that's the first
thing good about it I also wrote that
you can put extra scripts and notes on
another screen so if in a video I have
to go to a website to download something
rather than having to memorize that URL
what i can do is i can have it open in
another window on the second monitor and
then i can record my first monitor which
doesn't have anything on it i can type
in that URL by looking at the other
screen and just copy it from there so
people think that i'm recording on one
monitor and they see me typing in a URL
but in reality i'm using two monitors
and I'm just copying the URL from over
here onto this monitor so basically you
only record one monitor but you are
using to that means you can use all the
editing functions on the second monitor
and record the first monitor so that
means if you need to pause the video you
can do that from the second monitor if
you need to record you can do that from
the second monitor and then you don't
have to have your editing program your
recording program show up within the
video Oh the next thing with on screen
recording is only record what is needed
so if you are making a video on changing
a setting in Windows 7 you don't need to
show your entire monitor if you are
showing how to
to save a picture in Microsoft Paint you
don't need to have your Start menu in
the video so even if you are recording
in sixteen by nine you don't always have
to record in 1080p I know I just said
you have to always do that but what I'm
saying is that's the resolution you want
to record in so you want to set your
monitors resolution to 1080p as for
actually recording you want to record
and sixteen by nine so i'll try to
illustrate this on a whiteboard so you
have two main resolution settings you
have your computer monitor so here's
your computer monitor hopefully you can
see that clear nice and clear now if you
put this in a 1080p resolution first it
has to have a widescreen monitor and you
have to have the right video drivers if
you have it in 1080p your Start menu is
going to be very small that's because
you have a lot of pixels and it takes up
less pixels pixel is just a little dot
that makes up the screen now if you
lower your resolution such as you have
that you put half that resolution well
then your Start menu is going to be
twice as big and you can fit less
content on your screen because
everything on your screen is going to be
twice as big so you want to put your
monitor in 1080 that will give you very
small icons and so forth now when you're
actually recording so I didn't realize
there was a glare on that thing I want
to fix that but if you're actually
recording the screen so here's your
screen again and you are recording in
1080 well you can take your screen
recorder and only record a small portion
of the screen so let's say this down
here and then in your video editor
you can take that small video recording
and blow it up to take up the whole
YouTube screen which gives you a
high-definition clear video but if you
had your monitor resolution in like
something else that's really low well
this quality image down here is going to
be much lower so when I say to record in
1080 I'm talking about your monitor
resolution when you're recording your
monitor resolution you want to record in
a 16 by 9 aspect ratio which basically
just says widescreen because if you
record in a square when you blow that up
to take up a YouTube video it's only
going to be part of the video screen so
flee that's crystal clear probably not
clear as mud yeah that's what I'm saying
you can resume you can zoom in to record
only what you need to record there's no
need to record the whole entire screen
the entire time if you're having
problems giving people clarity on what
to what you're recording just zoom in
more make your program smaller and
record from there because it's going to
zoom in so yeah that's all I really have
to say on recording the screen now back
to audio I'm going to be talking about
recording your voice so i definitely
recommend you have videos with audio
because people like to listen to audio
use a small vocabulary and explain big
words don't expect your viewers to know
everything you already know you can take
what you know simplify allow people to
understand it and keep it in simple form
now as you make more advanced videos you
can refer people back to beginner videos
so you don't have to repeat the same
thing over and over again but at some
point in time you should explain what
you're
talking about you want to be clear and
articulate so I try to be this way I'm
not the greatest but I try not to use
too much slang or I try not to blur my
aunt my my words I try not to talk too
fast if you have an accent that's really
bad or very not bad but strong if you
have a strong accent try to clear up so
you can talk we're all nations will
understand you I mean I don't really
know if I have an accent because I just
don't know but I do try to talk clear I
probably need some work but anyways the
next thing talk loud like I'm
practically yelling right now I know you
probably can't tell that's because
you're watching it through a YouTube
video but I'm talking at a much louder
level than I normally talk to other
people that's because I want my audio to
travel very clearly to these microphones
up here some people record videos and
they talk like this oh here i'm going to
edit you can see if if I just draw this
box and connect it to this other box
well this is a one-to-one relationship
and when they put it in a video editor
they have to amplify their voice like 50
decibels which gives a low quality audio
recording so you want to talk as loud as
possible as clear as possible and
articulate so make sure you say your
syllables very loudly like if a word
ends in 80 you may need to say boat boat
boat rather than boat boat because when
you say boat rather than boat people
don't always hear that T due to the
audio being recorded so you by being
articulate you emphasize all of your
syllables see when I said syllables I
emphasized the S on the end so it wasn't
like syllables souls it doesn't sound as
nice but
I say syllables you know that there's
more than one you can hear it clearly so
yeah that's as the basics articulation
singers do that when they're recording
for when they're singing for choirs or
something they'll emphasize certain
vowels and say them slightly differently
because when people hear them it's not
going to sound good unless they do it
that way so yeah always be articulate
articulate but don't overdo it alright
another thing if you're recording audio
make sure your voice isn't popping the
microphone so what popping is is when
you're too close to a microphone or your
microphones picking your voice up too
strongly and you make a pie or up but or
a cup sound and it it's called clipping
it's too loud it pushes the wind into
the microphone and it's not able to
record that loud of sound eclipse the
audio makes it sound bad so if this is
your problem where your P's and B's
sound bad you need what's called a
popper stopper um if you're recording
tutorials on the screen you can probably
use a popper stopper if you're recording
with a camera and it's happening you'll
probably need some sort of wind
protector or a cushion thing that goes
around the microphone I'm sure you guys
have seen it when people have
microphones and they look like a giant
fur ball so those are going to block
wind and puff and bah sounds if you are
using a microphone such as I've on a
stand or something two ways to fix it is
to move it away from your mouth farther
farther away from your mouth so that way
it's not as close and the pup but
doesn't throw wind at the microphone or
you can get a popper stopper which is
just like a ring which has a thin thin
stretchy material sort of like a
pantyhose I guess you can even make one
out of a pantyhose if you wanted just
stretch it across something and when you
say pop that wind is going to be stopped
by that screen and the rest of your
audio is going to go through it and
reach the microphone to give a higher
quality recording sound and I have an
example of what I can show you what I
mean here just give me one sec here we
are so if one of them I oh there we go
so if one of the microphones I have the
audio can be popped because it's uh it
just does that so you can get one of
these either a wind guard or some sort
of popper stopper which you can then put
on top of the microphone which stops
popping and it's kind of funny because
this whole time I thought I was
recording with these microphones but I'm
actually recording with this one down
here so hopefully this audio is working
because if not I'm going to be super mad
okay so yeah that is an example of a
pauper stopper or wind guard the next
thing is face the microphone so so many
people make tutorials where they are
facing what the subject of the video is
so when i'm recording a video i have a
whiteboard here i'll write something and
i'm talking to where you can still hear
what I'm saying I try not to face the
board and talk like this because the
audio doesn't sound as good but it's
kind of hard for me
it's hard to write look at what I'm
writing and talk to the microphone at
the same time so typically I'll say what
I need to say I'll write it and then
i'll look at the camera so when i'm
talking it's picked up clearly yeah so a
lot of people they will look at the
whiteboard or the subject of the video
and their audio volume will go like this
because every time they're looking at
the camera it's loud and they're looking
at the subject it's quiet so as they
look at the camera and then they
continue to talk as they're facing
different directions the audio quality
is like a roller coaster and it sounds
bad alright so now I'm just going to go
over general oh wait no one more thing
don't assume people understand what you
are thinking be sure to explain yourself
clearly so that's all I really need to
set for that now i'm going to go over
some general tips to create better a a
higher quality video first thing don't
put your back to the audience so if you
are doing something always try to have
the front of you facing the audience
rather than your back so if I'm if I'm
showing you how to set up a camera or
something rather than doing it like this
I can do it like this or do it like this
but still talk to the camera and do it
like this that's how I do it with my
whiteboard I focus this direction but I
try to make contact with the camera this
direction um I probably need to work on
this because I do face the chalkboard a
lot always make sure you have proper
lighting in your videos lighting is so
so important I'm not saying you have to
get 20 spotlights to record on you just
if you have a light above you turn it on
because a dark video makes a lower
quality video and even if you boost the
um brightness later it's still not going
to be as high of quality as if you
genuinely boosted it yourself so
personally I i barely use extra lights I
have to I have to UM lights I can use if
I want but I mean it just takes forever
set them up so I usually just use the
audio in my house and it works good
enough for my needs but if you're making
a really good cinematic movie or
whatever extra lighting helps a ton um
never add a company's watermark so
basically when you're recording videos
if you are using some sort of editor or
a trial of something it may add a
company's watermark such as all this
video was made with this this can be
okay occasionally for example if you
record a video with a certain phone and
you use an editor and it says oh the
following videos recorded with this but
if this logo or this watermark is going
to ruin your content don't do it so for
example while ago I was looking for
video editors besides windows movie
maker and I found a free one I could use
except when i finalized my video there
was a watermark at the top that said the
company's name for the entire video and
that's that's a no no don't do that
that's just a basic beginner tip don't
ever have a huge black square around a
video so occasionally people will make
videos and hear what this will be their
content I know this marker works but on
track okay it works so this let's say
this entire thing is the YouTube player
what you want is it for your video to
take up from here all the way down to
here occasionally you'll see people
whose their content takes up this much
and there would be a big black bar
around the video if that's the case take
your video file put it
programs such as Adobe Premiere drag the
corners to take up the entire screen and
then republish the video and whatever
resolution the video was is going to be
in after you explode it so if it's in
720 if you record a video in 720 and
then you put it in a 1080 program and
then publish it there's going to be
black bars around it because it's not
big enough to take up the whole screen
but if you take that 720 file drag it
and put it to 1080 that's going to solve
that problem and then you export it in
1080 so uh alright another thing when
you when you're talking about titles for
YouTube videos don't ever leave the file
extension name in the title that's so
annoying and it's kind of beginner a new
mistake so if you if you make a video a
cool video dot end before and that's the
title of it on YouTube change it change
it capitalize important words it's a
title so you always capitalize the first
word and you capitalize any important
words and proper nouns within the title
final thing I wanted to say is always
edit your videos if necessary I'm not
saying you have to but what's annoying
is if you have a video and you're doing
stuff that should be edited out just
edit it out for example starting a
camera setting up for 10 seconds and
then looking at the camera getting ready
and then saying Oh welcome to my video
what you can do is just cut out the
beginning part or record and start
talking right then automatically so you
don't have to edit it if you make a
mistake sometimes you want to edit it
out if you redo the beginning of your
video you'll want to edit out the
beginning one just be smart with what
you're doing think things through make a
high quality video and raise your
expectations to the next level because
if you expect a better quality video
which
sorry you'll get a better quality video
don't be lazy and settle for less make
that good quality video and get it done
yeah hopefully that's a motivational
speech right there make a hot quality
video so yeah those are all the basic
things click recap good tags good
freeze-frame quality accurate titles um
all these are guidelines so you don't
have to do everything I say
introductions they are acceptable but
not always recommended never make them
too long you only have so much time to
catch the audience's attention you can
also do the introduction different for
every single video such as doing it in
the video or something like Smosh what
they do you hear that noise come on
that's an example of a annoying constant
noise I'm not going to shut the door
right now because I'm almost done well
it's annoying but back to audio i turn
off fans turn off noisy things such as
battery chargers or whatever closed
rooms with furnaces turn off the TV if
possible get to a silent room record
videos in a 16 by 9 1080p or 720p
recording quality focus on your focusing
so either manual or automatic auto focus
be sure to know if you need a cameraman
or a tripod never cut things off be
close enough to see what you're doing on
a small resolution screen when you're
going on a computer screen always record
with the monitor settings 16 by 9 1080p
get very very close up you can
transition your movements and
overemphasize people seeing things
because they don't always know what to
do
you can use multi monitors to make
things more simple and only record what
is needed there's no need to record the
whole screen sometimes when recording
your voice always use a smoke small
vocab and explain your big words or
words that should be known for the video
to be able to understand it be clear and
articulate no accent troubles so always
try to be clear speak loudly face the
microphone don't assume people
understand what you are thinking don't
ever put your back to the audience
always have good lighting never add a
company's watermark don't have a huge
black square around your video and don't
leave your file extension in the name
and finally edit out content that needs
to be edited out so hopefully that
covers everything pretty well and that's
all I really need to say in the next
video I'll probably going I'll probably
be going over increasing the quality of
your actual content within the video so
you make a better video content rather
than just the specifics that are general
for all videos so hopefully I'll get to
that soon thank you for watching if this
