battery's about to die because I use
rechargeable ones and they're pretty
much crap they last about five minutes
now because I've used them so much so
we'll see how long this goes so this
video might be short
anyways lately we've been talking about
a lot of different things relating to
music theory obviously because this is a
music theory series but I'm going to be
going back to one of the concepts we've
learned a long time ago pitch and
specifically the pitches that are
connected to a key so what's a key well
a key is when you build music off of a
scale such as the D majors now let's go
let's go C major we get c d e f g a b
you probably heard that six jillion
times this series and then when we get
the staff over here is where we put the
key so the key signature is this
specific name so if we were in the key
of D we would have F sharp and C sharp
which would give us these notes right
here that's the key of D now there's one
problem when we're writing music for a
bunch of different instruments not all
instruments are pitched the same or
tuned the same for example a piano
assigns a4 440 Hertz that means it
vibrates 440 times in a second that's
how we hear sound is by vibrations so
the faster the vibration the higher
pitched the sound this vibrates 440
that's about average but let's say a
trumpet of b-flat trumpet tunes lower so
they're a does not equal a pianos a so
let's say this is a trumpet here with
its little button things and a horn
close enough
and then this is a piano here with black
keys and the white keys does not equal
each other so they're there they're
tuned differently well that is a problem
because they're not going to sound the
same which makes it sound unpleasant so
that means we have to fix that problem
and we get what's known as a concert
pitch this is where all the instruments
that are tuned different come together
to one single tuning they're still tuned
differently but they play different
notes to where they all sound the same
for example in order for a trumpet to
sound like a piano it needs to play one
whole step higher so if you're playing a
C on a piano a b-flat trumpet needs to
play a D this is because it's tuned one
whole step lower so it's C actually
sounds like a b-flat raise it a half
step and we get B raise it another half
step and we get C that's the sound but
what we're actually playing c-sharp D
you know what I'm saying now so let's
compare these right here C major scale
on a piano C D G a B C B flat trumpet if
they played all of this just like that
written here's what it would sound like
we would get B flat the she what comes
that could be C
and then we would also get Eve lat I
believe yeah b-flat definitely I hope so
so and or this is what it would sound
like here's what we hear
that's an ear here's what they play
that's a trumpet it doesn't look
anything like a trumpet so how can they
make it sound like this well we would
actually raise these all what they're
playing they would raise it one whole
step so now they're playing D F sharp G
a B C sharp D so a trumpet actually
plays the D major scale in order for it
to sound like C so hopefully that makes
sense that's the idea of concert pitch
and there are a whole other bunch of
different tuning systems that we will be
getting into in these upcoming videos
we're not going to over do it I'm just
going to briefly explain this so you
understand the concept of concert pitch
so hopefully you some hopefully some
hopefully you subscribed and liked this
video because that helps me make more
and motivates me and it's it's also
pretty awesome and I will see you in the
next video so see your f</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
