Caleb the video maker - um if you like
this video be sure to subscribe and in
this video I'm going to be talking about
arrays basically I'm going to put
everything you learned about arrays
together into one video alright so very
first thing I'm going to go through the
absolute basics because we haven't done
much programming all right I'm running
xampp so that is my virtual server here
okay that's the first thing if you want
to know where my files go that I'm
working with it would be your Park your
hard drive xampp and then htdocs this is
where your files would be placed so I'm
gonna move those out of the way and we
are going to make a file just to show
you what it's like okay so I have a new
file here file save as okay I guess I
works I'm gonna make it test dot PHP and
I already have it so I'm just gonna
replace it yes actually I have a better
idea let's save it as index dot PHP yes
I don't know what I just erased oh well
alright so now on a web browser such as
Google Chrome you want to travel to
localhost and if that doesn't work well
that means something is wrong with your
server either your ports are conflicted
or something like that but that's
probably the most likely cause if you're
running Skype or iis then there's a high
probability of ports being stolen and
being used right now but hopefully you
it looks like this now the first thing
we type is this this will tell the web
browser that it's a PHP document so
every time you type something on here
you have to save it so you can go file
save or you can just press ctrl s which
is what I'll do so it may not look like
I save and then you have to refresh it
each time or press f5 so that is what
I'm doing now to make sure this is
working type echo
hey just like that and that is what you
will get
okay so now let's start typing some PHP
oh oh yeah so first we can make a
variable we can make it names now we're
going to make an array so to make an
array you have to have the square
brackets and then we can make a key
value pair so what that means is names
with the key 0 has the value caleb and
then we can duplicate this on four lines
by pressing ctrl d and then we can
change these so i'm just gonna put some
random names yeah there we go alright so
now we have an array and you can see a
refresh it nothing appears if you get an
error you probably have typed something
wrong so now we can echo these back like
this I'm going to alright so this is an
example this is what will come up all
right so now let's look at this
obviously we're using single quotes here
and we're using double quotes here the
reason we use double quotes down here is
because if we use single quotes this
will happen see and okay see it prints
it out exactly because it doesn't
interpret what we want and obviously we
wanted to interpret that this is an
array so we're going to undo that
alright so now let's look at this you
look like now we're referencing the
array names the second key so caleb is
the zero whiskey jimmy is this first
key ties the second gear what I should
say it's key value to Caleb has the
value zero Jimmy has the value one ty
has the value 2 so that will echo out
like this
you look like ty awesome ok so let's try
another example now let's make an
associative array rather than an indexed
array let's go friends so we're going to
make a new array all right so now this
is an indexed array to make it an
associative array we assign a string to
tie to the value so now if we refresh
the page you can see it's empty which
means they haven't messed anything up
hopefully yeah and I'm just gonna add
another one here so let's go yeah
alright so now we have two values to key
value pairs and we are going to echo one
of these out so echo friends and if you
see like the last time we could do we it
would just put a number in here but now
we put a string in here boom so calab
wants to the value of Caleb and you can
see that visually right here
alright now in one of my previous videos
I mentioned when when we put things in
strings we have to do things a little
different so let's try that out we're
going to echo out
you look like friends
oopsies so this is what we have and you
can see it causes an error well when
we're enclosing an array that is an
associative array within quotes we have
to put curly braces before and after it
like this boom so now it works okay and
we're all echoing this up here still so
that's why it repeats that so that is
that so that's one thing you remember
when you have an indexed array you do
not have to use these little curly
braces but when you have an associative
array you do but that's only if you're
in your quoting it so for example if I
delete these quotes here and I just want
to echo out the value of the array boom
it works fine so that is that I don't
know why I keep saying that is that
because it makes no sense but that's
pretty much the basics of creating
arrays and in the next video I'm still
going to be on screen I will be talking
about the array function to create a
race which is just another way you can
do things so if that was helpful please
please please be sure to subscribe and
like this video and if you have any
suggestions or Corrections or comments
or concerns or whatever leave me a
comment thank you for everything and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
