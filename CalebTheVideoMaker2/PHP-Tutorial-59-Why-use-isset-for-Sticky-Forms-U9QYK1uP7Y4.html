can actually integrate it within your
HTML so all we would have to do is open
our PHP tags here that's a question mark
for some anyways we could put all of
this within our value right and then
it'll test to see if as a value if it
does it will in fact redisplay that
value now you may be wondering why are
you using is set rather than not empty
that we talked about in previous videos
well the reason for this is that if we
use not empty it will take a value such
as zero and it will not redisplay it so
for example if you were making a page
where you can get a free book just put
your email address in and there's an
option for a donation right so you can
make a donation or you cannot make an
animation well if you put 0 in here and
then you forget to put your your address
in when it takes you to the new page you
still want their result as 0 to be there
you don't want that to be gone so that
means we need to use is set which will
evaluate as true if any value is used
except nulls so hopefully that makes
sense
alright so let's just show what the
whole thing would look like let's in our
HTML we would say I guess would be input
fools equals let's make it name I know
we can have a value equals open our
quotations and then we're going to start
our PHP have an if statement is set then
we have our super global array post and
then the the key or the associative key
which would be name that points to the
actual value of a associate
alright so we close our if statement we
open and act the the curly brace and we
echo that name we can all do this on one
line if you have room but we don't so
we're gonna go down here
and then we can close that curly brace
and we can end our PHP as so I'm going
to close our value so it's a really
complex
whelming for beginners it's really
complex but basically you just got to go
through it very slowly what we're doing
is we're testing to see if name has a
value when it's submitted if it does
which means this will evaluate is true
we're going to echo that value it's
pretty simple but it looks complex when
we look at the code and I'm in the next
video we are going to be doing this to
our form so that's when you can see
exactly how it looks on the computer
here I'm just mainly explaining the
concept so that's all I really need to
say in this video hopefully it was
helpful and I will see you in the next
one subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
