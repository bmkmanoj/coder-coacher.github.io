I believe this is your 30th tutorial
maybe I don't know I never really I
always try to say it and I never can
remember anyways I wanted to try
something new we're going to try and
make like comments comments section so
we're gonna create a div and all the
comments are going to go within this div
all right so we can have comments be the
title and then we can have paragraphs
for the comments I guess yeah okay the
paragraph and paragraphs
this is the second and I guess the first
comment could just stay the same what
stains pizza to birds oh that's what
Shepards bike alright so this is our
comment section pretty lame well I'm
actually gonna go away from the font of
it I'm gonna keep that font because it's
cool except taking the italic off and
the word off either this just keep it
like that so now we can actually go to a
new type of property which is known as a
border so in case you didn't know every
thing in CSS has an invisible border and
you can't see it because it's invisible
but it's there for sure so if you type
border style and put it as solid instead
of invisible you can now see this really
ugly border we could also create a div I
mean yeah so we get out of order style
for the death and they get solid right
so now we can understand these comments
and I know it's really ugly right now
but as we go we can try to make it look
a little better and so forth so this is
what we can we can address the entire
border or we can go to specific left
right or top bottom so I'll order style
left let's see it would be uh I'm sorry
not border style at the border left
style would be zero picks I'm sorry that
that's not going to work it you can make
it hit I guess as well that just gets
rid of the border and repositions it so
if you see the text is going to move
slightly that's because they add an
extra pixel with the border except for
one D the border is hidden it goes back
so in reality for CSS everything doesn't
really have a border and you just can't
see it borders when you activate them
they mess with these the width and
settings of everything because it's an
extra pixel or so added to the content
so if if it was automatically there it'd
be confusing to figure out how to
position things and everything but you
can activate them on everything by going
you know we've been to this border style
so now that's that's more like it
alright so order left style hidden and
border right stop it so now I think that
looks a little better yeah definitely
sure so we can actually also have some
other ones like they're not all have to
be either hidden or solid we can have
none which is pretty much the same thing
as hidden so we can have dotted we could
just make the top block dotted changed
on back to hit say on a dotted border
I'm sure we could have a dashed border
up since I deleted everything that's a
dashed border we can have a solid border
which we just did let's try a double
border see what that looks like that is
a double border that looks pretty sweet
we can also have a room every groove
borders there's bridge borders lots of
different borders and you can look these
up to figure out their exact purpose or
live they have so many borders but I'm
not going to do that and tell you
everything so I'm just doing all the
possibilities to look at it so yeah
those are the borders let's go with I
like groove yeah that's pretty awesome
no no no it's good double collectible so
here are our are here are our borders
yay so that's pretty much the basics of
border keep in mind that it adds an
extra pixel so it kind of moves
everything over some and alters with the
said layout of your website so that's
all I have to say from this video in the
next video we'll be talking about some
more order features so I shall see you
then thank you subscribe
