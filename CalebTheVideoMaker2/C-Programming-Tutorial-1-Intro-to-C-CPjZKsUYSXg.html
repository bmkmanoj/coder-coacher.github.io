is the first video hey everyone its
Caleb from Caleb's video maker - this
video is your very first video on C
programming now before we dive into the
depths of C programming I'd like to give
a quick shout out to our sponsor onyx
who is going to continually broadcast
his message of water drinking he's doing
it right now did you hear that
and now that we're done with that
glorious introduction let's get started
C is an example of a programming
language in order for us to fully grasp
what a programming language is we need
to understand a couple things first as
humans we want to communicate with
computers the problem is though is that
a computer it only understands what's
called machine code which is basically
sequences of ones and zeros we could
communicate to a computer using machine
code we're going to have long huge
sequences of ones and zeros and it's
going to be very error-prone because
it's so complicated
writing in machine code smart people
invented programming languages that
allow us to communicate to the computer
without having to type something like
this a programming language is readable
to a human once you learn that language
and it's not nearly as complex as
something like this so us humans we
learn the programming language and then
the programming language converts
whatever we put into that into machine
code you can think of the machine code
as individual commands that we tell the
computer's processor so inside of
computers there's this little processor
and all of these ones and zeros
translate into commands for this
processor programming languages make it
easier for humans to tell computers what
to do so everything on the computer
whether it be Windows or Mac or
applications such as Google Chrome or
any other kind of applications they're
all built or created with some kind of
programming language one of the first
and most popular programming languages
even today is the C programming language
now all the illustration is do complex I
can make it simpler
here's the computer here's us and we can
tell the computer what to do using the C
programming language what the computer
does with the C programming language
when we're starting out we don't really
care about all that all we care about is
the fact that we can tell the computer
what to do that means we don't even have
to worry about all that machine code and
all that stuff you could say that stuff
is abstracted away when something is
abstracted away
it means it's hidden from us sort of how
when you drive a car you don't need to
know how the car is built or how
everything works all you need to know is
how to use the car same was
communicating with computers we don't
need to know all the intricate details
right yet all we need to know is C
programming or some other kind of
programming language as you can see I
wrote this up on the board
don't worry about what it says for right
now all we need to know is that this is
something we will learn to type this is
a language we are going to learn to
speak and only have to do to do this is
open a text document and type it out
with very simple well all of this stuff
in here this is known as code or some
people will call it source code after we
type out our source code we have to
compile that source code once we take
the source code and compile it the
output is an executable program this
program is something that the computer
can understand in this series we are
going to learn how to write all of the
code how to compile it and how to make
all kinds of super cool programs that
can do all kinds of fascinating things
by the way another name for a program
would be software or an act or
application all of this is the
foundation for software development
engineering app development all of that
additionally this is one topic inside of
a subject known as computer science and
computer science is really the study of
everything that we can do with stuff
like this by the end of this series not
only do I want you to know how to
program and see I want you to have a
general understanding of computer
science so that the knowledge learned
here can flow into other programming
languages and other areas of your life
this may all seem kind of overwhelming
at first if you're a beginner
if that's the case don't worry about it
in the next video we are going to create
our first program and then we are going
to run that program and it'll do
something fancy on our computer at that
point you'll probably understand all of
this and when you get to the point of
running your first application it's a
very satisfying few so stick with it
guys don't quit this is going to be a
ton of fun and by the end of the series
we are going to learn a lot of
information that is all for the
introduction but there's a couple other
things that I wanted to mention the
first thing is that I took all the notes
that I created to plan out the series
and compiled it into one document and
that is downloadable on my website I
will put the link at the end of this
video and also check the description the
second thing is that if you want to
support me in my channel I really
appreciate when you click like on the
videos and ultimately subscribe to this
channel when you subscribe you'll get
notified of future videos and that way
it's easier for me to communicate with
you and tell you that I have new content
for you to consume hopefully by the end
of the series you see the joy and
excitement that you can find in computer
science and programming and hopefully
you can write some cool apps and see if
you don't believe me that this stuff's
fun well wait to the end and you'll just
have to see for yourself alright guys
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
