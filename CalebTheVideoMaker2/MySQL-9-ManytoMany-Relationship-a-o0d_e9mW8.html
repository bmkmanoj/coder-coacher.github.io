tutorial series I'm Caleb from Caleb the
video maker - and this video is going to
be about many to many relationships now
I highly recommend you watch the
previous video which is one-to-many
relationships because this video is
going to build off of that video a
little bit the reason I'm telling you
that is because this is the exact same
setup we had in the last video and I'll
describe this just a little bit
essentially we're trying to make a
website where you can make auctions and
people can buy stuff right so we have
listings and a user can post as many
listings as they want but one listing
can only be listed by one person so for
example this specific listing is only
allowed to be owned by the user with the
ID of nine or the user with the idea of
ten or eleven but not more than one only
one if you think of some popular
auctioning websites it's generally
considered normal that an item being
sold is owned by only one person now
there might be a couple out there where
you can join ownership something or
joint lists something meaning this item
could reference two people for example
in that situation there's kind of like a
co-ownership meaning when the item sold
the revenue earned is split amongst
people that might not be common on an
auctioning website but it might be
common on a website where you sell
courses or something along the line of
that because a course might be authored
by multiple people and the authors might
split the revenue so this might not
apply directly to an auctioning site but
ultimately that decision is up to you or
the business telling you to design this
thing that's because if you want to make
an auctioning website where you can have
multiple people own a single item you go
ahead and do that it's your website
it's your application there's not rules
saying you can do that so that being
said that's what we are going to do in
this situation we are going to make it
to where a specific listing can be owned
by multiple people right now we have it
set up as a one-to-many relationship but
as you can see we're talking about many
to many so we need to alter this a
little bit now I want you guys to think
about this really hard
if you're going to try to force a
listing to be owned by multiple users
you're going to run into some serious
database design problems how would you
even go about doing that let's think of
some ways let's go with the pizza rolls
we can throw in another user in here we
could add a comma and throw in the user
with the ID of eight but this is going
to break our atomicity or atomic rule
now we have two values for one column
that is not okay so you might think hmm
let's add another row so now we have the
same item with a different user ID but
there's a problem here and that we have
a repeating primary key which is not
acceptable the other problem we are
going to have is that now we have this
pizza rolls in here twice and that's
redundant now this column is probably
not marked as unique if it was then we
couldn't even do this but the changes
are it's not so therefore we're just
going to have duplicate data and just by
chance let's say we could do this and
one time this was updated this one might
not get updated and then we have
conflicting data so bad design like this
leads to conflict and Atta and that's
really bad nearly any time you have a
problem like this the solution is to add
a table I know it sounds like it could
cause problems it's adding tons of
tables but I'm serious so let's add a
table and see if it works what kind of
table are we going to need the table is
called an intermediary table and this
table is going to go between these
tables and just be like shop and it's
gonna separate them this is going to
allow us to store a many-to-many
relationship in a database so what we
are going to do is put a new table here
that's going to be in between the users
and the listings now this table by
convention is going to have the first
table singular so user underscore the
second table plural listings and this is
going to make associations from the
users to the listings so the only
columns we really need in here are the
user ID and the listing ID now let's fix
up this crap first let's get rid of that
row we don't
at all and then I'll put this up here so
we know that we want to put two of those
over here so the first one let's just go
row by row and we'll show how to convert
this data now obviously you're going to
want to design this right from the
beginning so that way you don't have to
move data from tables to tables that's
is bad
the first thing we're going to grab the
listing ID 1 and associate that with
some user let's go with 9 now you can
see this is going to allow us to have
multiple users because we can just add a
new row and have the same listing ID and
a different user ID now these columns
are not labeled unique but actually the
whole combination of both of the columns
can be labeled unique that means we can
have nine one and eight one but we can't
have nine one again because that would
mean both of these as a group are not
unique so that means in this table we
can just get rid of this and then let's
add another row we'll have two user 9 3
and user 8 as you can see we're not
going to need to store the user in here
anymore because all of that information
is found in the user listings table so
we can just get rid of this entire
column now let's draw lines just to show
how these are connected and that will
help us visualize this so 8 goes to 8
and to 8 and then 9 goes to 9 and then
on this side 1 first 1 2 1 2 2 2 &amp;amp; 3 3
now this will help you visualize how we
broke up this many-to-many relationship
we actually broke it up into two
one-to-many relationships for example
look at this ID on this side we have 1
ID that's referenced twice and it kind
of goes in multiple directions this way
like this and that is actually how you
draw a one-to-many relationship when
you're designing tables it'll look
something like that
except prettier you will never have it
where you have an ID breaking off like
this because you can see here now it's
backwards and we have many to many again
we did so that will never happen we
fixed the problem of many-to-many by
breaking it up
so this is a pretty good summary of how
you design a many-to-many relationship
you just need to break things up into
three tables in the next video we are
done I'm going to conclude all of the
relationship stuff and just go over a
quick overview of how to design each
relationship
