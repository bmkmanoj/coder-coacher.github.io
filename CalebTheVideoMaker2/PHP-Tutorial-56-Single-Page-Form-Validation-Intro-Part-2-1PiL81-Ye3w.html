this concept we are going to give the
actual PHP code that will be used and in
the next video we will be adding same
page form validation to our page that we
already created in the previous videos
if you hit work pay if you weren't here
for those videos you can still follow
along you just may have to recreate the
form but basically all we're going to do
now is put the code that we are going to
use and explain how it works alright so
we start with an if statement this is
all within our PHP and then we open the
if statement and basically what we need
to do is we need to make a test we want
to know if the request method has the
value post so the things we need to pay
attention to request method and post and
we need to pay attention to server so
this server is a super global array that
has values these these values this is a
value both all have keys so the key is
request method the request method points
to the value post now another thing to
pay attention to is that both of these
are strings so they will be single
quoted within our code another thing to
pay attention to is that everything is
in all capital letters these up
superglobal arrays are already created
their predefined with capital letters
request methods this is a key that is
automatically generated we don't put
this word in it's already defined in all
capital letters so within the server
array it has a request method and it's
an all capital letters
the value is post because when we submit
the form it will become post in all
capital letters because that's a
predefined value in previous videos we
did test to say on like this for example
well this right here you can see name is
in lowercase letters that's because
that's tied to our HTML our HTML on the
other page and we gave it the name name
in all lowercase letters if in our HTML
we changed that to all uppercase letters
you would have to do the same here so
just know that everything we're using
for this will be in all uppercase
letters so this test one saw
everything's created it looks something
like this
so I kind of kind of started to run out
of room there well I can still explain
this here first thing we're doing is
we're taking the server array then we're
taking the key request method now we're
doing a comparison operator of is equal
to so is the request method key equal to
the value post in all capital letters if
this is evaluated as true that means the
form was submitted if it was false that
means the form has not been submitted so
that's a little test that we can use and
basically we'll put all of our form
validation code within curly braces so
then from here we can evaluate our code
here and then we can redisplay the HTML
down here all right so stick around for
the next video where we will be
implementing this into our super awesome
database thank you for watching and
