video maker - Caleb Kirk on this video I
will be talking about installing and
getting started with Python so python is
a programming language you can just
search it on google and go or go to
their website WWF on org okay so I made
fullscreen this here real quick
alright so a first guy here I can go to
downloads and you can see I'm on Windows
if you're on Mac or other Linux or UNIX
platforms you may already have it
installed by default but that would
probably be Python - and we're gonna go
with Python 3 but I mean you know you
might have Python 3 but anyways my point
is there's two main different versions
Python 2 and Python 3 they are not
similar they are different so if you
want to get into what the difference
between these two are you can click use
a full list and then you can click
here's more about the difference between
Python 2 and 3 and it'll go on for hours
and here's the link if you want to go to
that directly alright other than that
though if so here are the full list here
will list all of the versions that you
can get and yeah so I will just let this
download and I will be right back
alright so once you have that downloaded
you can just click it I actually cancel
it because I already installed it
earlier so you can just open the
launcher and just click run and then yes
yes yes all right you might not it might
not pop up directly but just give it a
couple seconds a user account control
box will probably pop up asking you for
are you sure you want to download this
and you probably just want to click yes
cuz obviously that's why that's what
we're doing so yes you do want to
download this so you can probably see it
flashing over here on the side and you
just click that and click yes and then
allow it to install
I burned my hand yesterday I caught a
Marcia okay so I wanted to make like
s'mores but it drives me crazy because I
don't know how to make the chocolate
like melted without like melting or
losing you're dropping it in the grass
so I got some M&amp;amp;Ms and I like embedded
it in my marshmallow yeah you can just
click finish and then from here you can
go to all programs Python 3.4 or
whatever version you installed and we
have two main things that we're going to
use the idle or the IDL II that's the
graphical user interface or the Python
command line so let's take a look at the
command line first but anyways my
marshmallow caught on fire and the human
M fell and my first instinct was to
catch it while it was on fire because
I'm an idiot
so there's melted chocolate landed on my
hand and like it wouldn't come off so I
just like rubbed it in my pants alright
anyways that was the command line we're
not really gonna do much with that
that's how you can work with Python the
other way is with the user interface
which is probably the best way to start
out when you're learning Python so we
can click the IDL e the idle and I'm
just gonna woops my bad so here is the
idle now what's so special about the
idle is that it will allow us to get
results from our programming our code
instantly while we were working with it
so I'll show you this in action so I can
put hey sup dog and then enter and it
will do that code instantly as soon as I
press Enter and not only that I mean cuz
that's them really not that special
that's I mean we could do that in any
ways but it color codes is so it's very
easy to read we can say here we have
functions here we have text and if we
have like other things
oops
any programming keywords will be orange
the other thing that that this thing can
do is as a autofill so if I put P and
then press tab well then you can see all
the possibilities of like it's going to
make assumptions of what you're trying
to say so I want to say print and then I
press space and then I can bottle I go
on typing yes so that is an example of
something it can do the other thing we
can do is when we want to test our code
again we can press alt and then hold all
and press P and that will bring up the
previous code that we typed if we press
P again still while holding alt it will
go back to our previous one and then we
can do it again
so we can go back through our code and
then we can actually edit it to change
things and submit it again by pressing
enter we can also once we go back so
let's say I'm back here we can go
forward by pressing alt and then
pressing in so that way we can kind of
like go back and then we can go whoops
sorry about that and then we can go
forward by alt n so yeah you get my
plane the other thing we can do is we
can adjust some of the Preferences so
let's see the options configure idle
here we can pretty much adjust like
everything the font and then the
indention in indentation and I'll
explain that in just a sec the
highlighting so we can change the
different colors for different things we
can change some more information in here
which we're not really going to get into
super depth for that but yeah so
basically it when we are using Python
everything has to be indented what that
means is here just watch I press ENTER
and it's indented and the default is for
spaces we saw that in the options for
spaces so I can increase this to 6 for
example and that's going to increase
that space there
now basically anytime we have a block of
code we have to indent that so if five
is greater than four then I want it to
print yo and then we press ENTER go to
the next line and then we can press
ENTER to finish the entire thing and
five is greater than four so it printed
yo so that's just the basics of the
Python shell yeah so that is this will
be the best way for us to learn Python
because we can use our code instantly we
don't have to worry about X we don't
have to worry about executing anything
all we have to do is press ENTER and we
don't have to do anything fancy so this
is probably one of the most useful
shells graphical user interfaces ever
and yeah it's pretty simple for a
graphical user interface but it's still
really great so thank you for watching
and I will see you guys in the next
video thank you and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
