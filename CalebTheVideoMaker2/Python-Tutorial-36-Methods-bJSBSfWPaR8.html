will be an introduction to methods so
we've actually talked a lot about
methods and we've used them even but I
don't really explain exactly how they
work or what they do for this video I
will be doing that now so there's two
words that you need to know it's their
function and method so these are very
similar words a function is something we
could just call and we can give it data
and it'll do something with our data for
example abs will give us the absolute
value of a number such as 4 or negative
5
basically how far away it is from 0 that
is a function we call it and then we
give it data to do something with well I
method does the same thing except we
have to say what we are going to do it
on first so we would we would put
something like let's make a little it
let's make a a string we'll make it
legit and we'll just call it we'll give
it the value PI now what we do is we put
legit period and then we call a method
and you can see all these options pop up
when we wait long enough and use our all
the methods we can call on legit so
let's just use find find is an example
of a method so here's how we set up a
method we say the object we want to do
something on and then what we want to do
to that object so we want to find
something within legit so what do we
want to find let's find the index of E
and it gives us 2 that's an example of a
method so here's the object we are doing
it on what we want to do and then we
give it arguments so are you you may
also hear the terms arguments and
parameters now these these two terms are
slightly different although you will
probably hear them interchange quite
often basically when you define a
function or a method you give it a
temporary variable such as like X and
then within that method you can say
print X well the value that we give that
variable is the argument the variable
itself is the parameter so earlier when
we define functions such as the a cat so
what we do is we have a variable here we
could say X and then we could say print
X okay well this right here this is a
parameter right and then when we call
this function cat we give it the value 5
or sorry oh yeah let's give it so this
is an argument that we give to the
parameter so when we do something such
as legit find dot I'm legit dot find our
period find and then the letter e well
this is the argument that we give the
method so methods and functions are
pretty much the same thing the only
difference is that methods must be used
on a specific object so if you have to
put dot and then the the name of the
method well then you know it's a method
if you can just call it like like this
well then you know it's a function
alright so sometimes a method can allow
for multiple arguments which means they
have multiple things you can do so let's
just go through some of the basic string
methods and we will give them each
arguments if required so let's just use
legit and we will use let's use the
method count now what count will do is
it will count how many times something
is in the object
so let's since we only have three
letters let's just count I and it's
going to return one because there's only
one I but what if I assign the legit to
the
and then I go legit count and I count
the east
well now you can see there's seven es so
that helps us do that's helps us learn
more about our data there's some other
things we could there's some that return
only true or false
such as so ends with you can think of
this as a question you could say ends
with I false we could try it again
ends with e true because you can see it
does end with an e so it's basically
you're asking does legit end with E and
it returns true it does there's some
more we'd go lower I'm sorry we got
legit dot lower which basically just
lower cases everything and you can see
this doesn't need any arguments because
it already has everything it needs all
it needs is to know what it needs to do
it on so we could also do legit sorry
upper now we'll put everything in upper
case another half method or function
that we can do on these are our strip
and else strip and what these will do is
it'll take a certain it'll get rid of a
certain string or phrase or letter at
the end of a string so let's say we have
legit and well it's a sign at the value
pi okay and what we want to do is we
want to get rid of the exclamation mark
we could say legit our strip we use our
strip because it means right strip so
that means this side and then within
these parentheses we give it a argument
we could say this and you can see it
actually returns it and prints it out to
the screen without the the exclamation
mark and now when we we call it or when
we print it out I'm sorry oh it's a
legit and it will see uh the thing is
the our strip temporarily removes it but
it doesn't actually change
the original value you can see when we
when we call legit or when we type legit
we could print it which will return the
old value so when we do our strip it
doesn't actually change the value in
some of these work this way well let's
try okay let's look at legit dot upper
and then let's print legit you can see
it's still lowercase so if it returns a
value like this it might not be actually
changing the original values so how we
could change the original value so we
could say legit equals legit upper now
when we print legit it changed the
actual value by the way guys in the
previous videos I always printed like
this which works although it if you just
take out print for learning sake you can
just put legit and it's a whole lot
easier but when you're making a program
you may want to use print so for future
videos if I don't use print and I just
type out like legit well that work
that's basically the same thing so those
are just some of the methods we can do
here's a couple more we could use we
could use replace so let's go legit
replace hey let's um first assign a new
value to legit let's make it
I like de llamas and now let's go legit
replace llamas and then we put a comma
ostriches and it returns that and then
when we have legit print it out you can
see it didn't actually change the
original value so some of them are going
to change the value others are just
going to return the value and not
actually change the original value so
keep that in mind let's do let's do one
more we could say a title so legit dot
title what this will do is it'll
capitalize every first letter
I like llamas and then you might want to
assign that to legit so we could say
legit equals legit title and then we
could say legit all right well that's
all I have to say in this video so
hopefully that was useful and be sure to
stick around for the next one thank you
