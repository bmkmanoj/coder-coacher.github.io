okay now we are going to put all that
information that's scattered around and
put it to use to create different types
of intervals which have different sounds
which allow us to alter the way our
music sounds for example I can have
major chords which I need to turn this
up some oh I fixed this piano by the way
or I can have minor chords minor chords
are kind of sad and I know you don't
really know too much about this yet
although if I want to create all this
deep emotional song I'm not going to be
like I'm gonna be like okay maybe I
didn't fix the piano but anyways the
interval size is very important so we
had Buena Center octave we're going to
ignore all a compound crap because it's
not that important and you can figure it
out once you learn all the other stuff
so we had a nice block here we had 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 &amp;amp; 8
now when we have a unison with zero half
steps C to C it is called a perfect okay
I almost forgot it there for a second
it's called perfect this is called the
interval quality now if we have a second
from C to D with three half to half
steps are impede it's called major just
stick with me this will make sense in if
we have a third C to e it's called major
if we have a fourth from C to F it's
perfect C to G would be perfect and I
know you don't really know what these
are but that's okay
six would be major seventh would be
perfect I mean sorry major sorry gosh
major and then finally an octave is
perfect and we'll get into why they're
that in suit so what's this mean
remember those are called equality and
when he raised this this will have zero
half steps this time too
this should have four five seven wait
I'm lost here what's going on okay five
steps 7 6 7 9 11 and 12 so here are the
half steps let me show you this if we
start at C it usually works out pretty
good so C to D that is a second C D how
many half steps one two it qualifies as
a major let's try a different on them e
to F it's a second e F see how many half
steps
start e go to F that's only one so it's
a little different so when there's this
many half steps in them they're called
this they're always for these interval
sizes so perfect cannot be seconds so
what's this what this means C to D
that's a second we know it is they made
your second not a perfect second I know
that sounds kind of weird considering we
haven't even learned what these words
mean but it's it's kind of just a word
to describe the concept so what we've
learned is we can say these are the
types of intervals and these are how
many half steps there are so if we go
from D to D that's 12 half steps I can
show I can prove that to you
here's one two three four five six seven
eight so I know it's an octave with
eight one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten eleven twelve
so it's an octave of twelve qualifies it
as a perfect interval so we've learned
that there's two types of intervals so
far we have perfect and major intervals
perfect in it
this one's so squeaky and major
intervals there's two different types
and that's important because those can
describe our music in greater detail so
we have a major and we have perfect so
if you notice the pattern one two three
four it goes down to eight we have
perfect major major perfect perfect
major major perfect that's how I can
always remember it so if I need to
recreate this I set my numbers one two
eight and then I go perfect major major
perfect perfect major major perfect now
I know if we're starting at C it's all
of the white keys so let's start to see
you know I'll teach you what I mean
little C C to D is a second sorry unison
CC is a unit is a unison with zero half
steps so I know this is a perfect unison
with zero half steps see the d12 as two
half steps so it's a major with two half
steps D I mean C to e one two three four
it's a third with four half steps now C
to F one two three four five oh five
half steps and then fifth would be two G
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 6 would be 2 a 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 now so 7 would be B 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 9 10 11 and an octave is 12 because we
only have the Marquis 12 so here's how
you can just figure it out without - to
memorize it all I have to remember is
perfectly major major perfect perfect
major major perfect and sweet so we now
know there are two types of intervals
perfect and major and these can be
affected although you don't know this
yet I can create different sounds from
these to create minor sounds upsetting
sounds like anxiety which can be like
augmented and stuff and that the half
steps is very important so I perfect
unison is always going to have 0 half
steps 2 4 5 7 9 11 and 12 that's how it
will always work so if you need to
recreate that and you're not sure how
just start on C so if you need to know a
perfect sixth is start on C and we know
1 2 3 4 5 6 it goes to a how many half
steps 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 9 half steps is
in a 6th Oh would you look at that boom
so now we are going to move on to
something called minor intervals now
that you know there's other kinds these
are more like the happy kinds minor is
kind of sad and that's this concept of
ear training the difference between
or it's it's kind of sad or even better
happy set now that's all you need to
know for this video so subscribe and
I'll see you in the next one thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
