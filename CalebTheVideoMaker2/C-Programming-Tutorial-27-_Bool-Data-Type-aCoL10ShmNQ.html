Caleb the video maker too and in this
video we are going to be discussing
boolean data or boolean depending on how
you would like to pronounce that boolean
data is anything that is either true or
false so this is similar to binary which
is in two states you can think of 0 as
false and 1 as true so let's create a
new file that we can use to test some of
this boolean data alright so in here we
are going to create a boolean variable
so to do that you put an underscore bool
with a capital B then you make some
variable name and that is how you
declare a boolean variable now pay
attention to the naming convention here
this is what's known as camel case if I
haven't told you guys essentially the
first character is lowercase and then
every word after that starts with an
uppercase letter this is one popular way
to name things and see another is to do
underscores so you can do something like
this but make everything lowercase now
you're probably wondering why in the
world did I name this caleb is fat seems
like an odd variable name I named this
variable caleb is fat not because he is
but rather because he might be
I'm not saying hey Caleb is fat I am
saying Caleb is fat is either true or
false this is the foundation of boolean
logic you will find boolean logic and
many subjects including discrete math
computer engineering computer science
and a ton of other cool useful stuff now
we've declared this variable but how do
we assign a value to the variable in
order to do this we have to ask
ourselves is Caleb fat now I wouldn't go
so far as to say I'm fat but I could use
some trimming around the waist in fact I
had to buy new dress clothes for my
videos because I'm so fat
therefore I'm going to say yes I am fat
to do this we use a 1 this
represents true again if you want to say
false you would use a zero now the only
real important number is zero which
represents false all the other numbers
represent true so you don't have to use
a 1 here if you put any number it's
going to be stored as 1 so I could put
caleb is fat equals 9001 now my fat
level was over 9000 but how do we
actually output this data well as always
we are going to use the printf function
and inside of here we need a format
string we'll start with something like a
question is Caleb fat and then we'll
just kind of give a key of what values
are important one is yes zero is no and
the format character we are going to use
is actually percent I that's because
we're actually using integers so percent
I and then we'll go to a new line the
variable we are going to try to display
is Caleb is fat now let's save it and
run it is Caleb fat one is yes zero is
no one so as you can see according to my
program indeed I am fat now this is cool
and all but a lot of this isn't very
intuitive for example if we go back to
our code why in the world does this
datatype have an underscore and an
uppercase B that doesn't seem to match
any of the other things we've learned
also using numbers is just kind of weird
like why can't we put true or false for
example well that problem is going to
actually be addressed in the next video
so hopefully you guys check that out
where we are going to be exploring even
more with boolean data
thanks guys please be sure to subscribe
click like and as always I'll check e
I'm not gonna check you out but check
check out the next video thanks n peace
