markers get worse and worse every single
video and uh I would get some new ones
but it snowed a ton and I can't leave my
house darn it I don't get a good at
school tomorrow
oh oh night oh whoa whoa so anyways
let's get back on topic if we have a
five line staff we can represent not
only notes but rest because everything
is in time with either play or don't
play we can't just all play occasionally
we don't play so we represent no rest ah
well the whole rest is represented like
this a little bar below the third line
from the bottom no from the top no
either one so that's how that is a half
rest would be represented like this all
right now the reason I'm showing it on
lines is cuz they all kind of fit on the
lines better so yeah that's why okay so
you're wondering so a quarter note rest
is the hardest possible thing to draw in
the entire mmm huge world it looks like
it looks like this not even kidding
that's what it looks like well has more
about I'll just show you a picture just
give me a minute now we can also have a
thrust which looked like a little ball
with a stem like a little ball on a
seven so now if we move keep going we
can have um sixteenth note rest which
look like that and then finally we can
have 32nd notes rest or even whatever
comes next the 64th note rest which I
doubt you'll ever see one of those and
if you do good luck so let me find
proper pictures for this thought it'd be
fitting to put a music theory joke in
here but I thought I'd give the jokes
arrest
oh here we go that is a quarter note
rest would you look at that would you
just look at it you just look at it I
can't even draw that I don't even know
oh and I'm drawing these on the wrong
line aren't I yeah I drew these on the
wrong line
but that's no biggie so this should be
this should be up here one this should
be up here and then this one that one's
correct and that one's great
yes so that's how to draw all of your
rest so if we were to make a little song
and the beat the beats per minute was
let's say this this is a tempo not the
beats per minute sorry the tempo and we
have two quarter notes followed by rest
and coordinate rest followed by a
quarter note would be one to rest for
one to rest for one two that's basically
counting the quarter notes within a
measure which don't take up a whole
measure that'll take up half a measure I
don't know why I drew those bar lines in
there so that's all I really have to say
about the rest for now that's all I have
to say so I'll see you in the next video
it'll be pretty awesome like always like
what's new right like all my videos are
awesome you should go watch my other
videos and subscribe to my channel right
right right
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
