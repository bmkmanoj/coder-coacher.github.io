caleb the video maker too I just wanted
to share a couple things what I'm doing
in my life alright so the very first
thing is I've been writing blogs on my
website Caleb curry com I wrote that
down so you guys probably have this the
right direction right Caleb curry calm
so see a leb CU RR y dot C poke em
forward slash blocks if you specifically
want to see the blocks page but I some
other stuff on there you can check out
Oh basically what I've been doing is
I've been writing database design blocks
of the most recent 3 i'm sure i'll make
more what I'm going to do is I'm going
to create a series based off of my blogs
so if you want to help me make better
YouTube content or you want to play a
part in helping me figure out what to
put in my next videos go to the blogs
reedom tell me what needs to be changed
to prove the pawn or whatever once you
do that I can implement that into the
blog so if their spelling mistakes or I
just completely forgot to mention
something important I can add that in
there and then when i create the videos
they will be based off of what you guys
helped me improve upon so yeah do that
also if you have any other topics that i
could work on just i'll leave a comment
on this video or on one of the blogs it
doesn't even have to be database design
if you just have other cool stuff that i
might be able to help you with let me
know and i will look into it the other
thing is if you want to get updated
whenever I release a new blog you can
check out my facebook page and I know I
sound like I'm advertising but I am so
now the facebook page is facebook.com
Caleb the video maker no spaces note to
the actual page title has spaces but
mania the URL does not have spaces that
are you can make it to where you get
notifications under the like button to
where every time I update my status or
whatever it's called it will give you a
facebook notification telling you I
updated my status which will link to
either my new blogs or my new YouTube
videos or whatever now if you want to do
the same thing from our YouTube
channel I recommend that you click
subscribe because that helps me a lot
and whenever I upload new content it
goes to your subscriptions on the
homepage so yeah you will want to click
Subscribe right there I mean not
literally right there but like on the
video page just click Subscribe you can
also do it from my channel and if you
like a video that you like I'm sorry if
you find a video that you like be sure
to click the little like button because
that also helps me out well lets me know
how many genuine viewers like my content
and I measure what kind of content to
make by what kind of like psychic on
watch which videos and so forth but if
you don't like a video check don't click
dislike that doesn't even do anything
everyone knows that so just if you don't
like something leave a comment telling
me how I can improve and I will take it
into consideration unless it's a bad
idea then I won't yeah so that's pretty
much all i have to say uh recorded this
like four times because I keep messing
up and then I got it really good and it
wasn't even recording you guys hate that
drives me crazy so yeah guys better
subscribe and I hope you guys have a
great summer summertime so I will be
creating more content and I'll be
partying all summer here my basement by
myself okay I'm going now so peace out
everyone and stay cool and watch my
videos see you around peace yeah you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
