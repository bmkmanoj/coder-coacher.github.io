be talking about the Lydian mode now
this is sort of like starting on the
fourth scale degree for example if we're
in the key of C draw a staff here we
have no sharps or flats in order for the
notes to be diatonic we have to start on
the fourth scale degree
CED so let's start on F here's F by the
way we're in trouble clef which I know
I've been kind of ignoring that lately
but I don't like worrying about that
because it takes too much time and it's
hard to draw so anyways F go up the
scale there we go
so the pattern for this is whole half
okay member so the pattern for this is
whole whole whole half so this would be
a whole step whole step whole step half
step whole step whole step and a half
step let's let's show you that here now
we're on F we take a whole step whole
step whole step half step whole step
whole step half steps all natural notes
so it's really easy and this is the
pattern and let's try this in a
different key signature so let's do that
now so now we are in the key of D major
so what sharps or flats are in G major
we have an F sharp and a C sharp so
appropriately placed them on the staff
and of course this is treble clef which
assigns G right here so now let's create
the Lydian mode and the scale of D major
well it's appropriate to start on the
fourth G so let's start on the fourth we
would have I'm use red so you can see
this nice
have ji-hae
so here is the Lydian mode and this
scale of G major so which won't notes
have accidentals this one does C sharp
and F sharp now as I've said before you
don't always have to start on this one
but in order for the notes to be
diatonic or within the scale you must so
let me try starting on one that's not
that's that's not the 4th scale degree
let's start on G sharp well now this is
going to scoop everything up one half
step so this will become F I mean a
sharp this will come B sharp this will
become C double sharp this will become D
sharp G sharp F double sharp and G sharp
again so yeah now you can see that all
of these notes are not fitting to the
scale so it's not diatonic so that's why
if we start on this note or the 4th they
are all within the scale so that's all I
have to say about the Lydian mode this
is similar to the natural scale with
they raised forth so let me erase all
these sharps and flats and I'll show you
what I mean sorry just shattered sharps
and double sharps the major scale of G
we would be G all the way up here and F
sharp is already in there but the 4th
within the G one two three four see
that's not in the G scale we have to
sharp that a sharp that one half-step so
this is like a major scale with a raised
fourth that's another way to think of
this mode so in the next video we are
going to be talking about
mixolydian mode so I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
