over database normalization and
organization um first thing I wanted to
say is that I'm sorry I have a just a
chalkboard I know everybody hates
chalkboards and they're loud right on
them but it's all I got for now and
later I'll be on the computer showing
you some stuff so you won't have to
worry about it and I'll do my best to
show my examples good on here so the
first thing you need to know is what is
the database well a database just
basically stores organized data well
it's usually organized some cases it's
not so much all right so that's pretty
much about all and then also I mean you
may think of like something that stores
data like Excel or access well you're
right that is that's a great example but
this is for more in-depth larger groups
of data ok databases they store data and
what they call tables and I know you
probably can't read this but this is the
best I can do
table stores related data so let's say I
have a website and it's a social social
website you may have a table for it
everybody's user information so their
user name or password or email and then
you may have another table for all the
messages or comments so that's the same
messages that they've ever sent
I'm a bespoke girl I'm not sure
so this is how a database is organized
data so the next thing I'll be doing is
giving you a quick example on a small
database username and password so let's
say our website a good user name would
be video maker and my password that's
just cheese cake don't tell anybody
so you're thinking this does look a lot
like access or Excel or ever the program
is and you are right but it just no I
can be not as organized once you get
into larger groups of data so what you
call these these are columns right here
so let's say you have another username
that let's make it simple Jim and his
password is key so all right so now
these are rows so it just got to
remember that a column is an individual
group of data like just the usernames
just the passwords and the rows are each
individual entry most databases will
have what they call as an ID so the ID
will keep each row unique forever so
this one will have an ID of one and this
one will have an ID of two so if you say
what's the entry of ID one
his name's Caleb usernames Caleb the
videomaker password is cheesecake when
designing tables a more common way to
draw it would be like this let's say you
have a table for books name that the
table name up here and then you write
each individual column down here so book
I D so this would be like 1 2 and so on
up into however many books you have in
the database and the reason for this is
it will keep each entry unique because
let's say they have a title of something
and you'd say that could be a good way
to keep them unique except what if you
have two books with the same title it
could be a very broad title and then you
have a problem because you're not sure
which book it is and you have to go look
at the other information basically this
keeps everything unique if this were
here would be called the primary key
this is a very important term I need to
memorize that put it in your brain all
right now that you know the basics of
what a database is I'm going to be
showing you some problems that occur
with databases all right here's a basic
table we have the columns and then each
row all right it seems good have the
book title and the author and the book
ID now the problem is what if this book
had more than one author what if you had
four authors all right so I'll be
showing you what this would look like
okay guys now you can see that mastering
physics has the four authors what's the
problem here you can see that mastering
physics is listed four times that is a
lot of useless information because
that's three boxes here you don't need
and also you can see that mastering
physics now has four book IDs that takes
three book IDs away from a different
book and also now it's not technically
unique because two and one are exactly
the same so one equals two the only
different that's not true the only
difference is there's a different author
so that's that's kind of confusing are
these different books or lay the same
book with two authors that is why this
design is bad and that is what we call a
normalization normalization is reducing
redundancies and data and also
preventing it so how can you solve this
well that is something we will cover in
a future video and I hope to see you
there so thank you for watching my
introduction to databases and I'll see
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
