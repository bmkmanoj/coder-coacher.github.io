to your second music theory are you
raised it dang it music theory tutorial
so in this video I'm going to be talking
about sound a little bit more and I
addressed it in my first video but that
was just to kind of introduce things so
now I'm gonna go a little bit more in
depth so sound as I said is a vibration
your vocal cords and your neck oh my
gosh we've got huge that happened two
pounds apple is oh that's just disgust
but anyways vocal cords in your neck
throat whatever vibrate and that
produces sound in a way now how this
works is it doesn't actually produce
sound this vibration travels through the
air and then hits our ears which
interprets the vibration as sound
hopefully that makes sense let me draw
this out a bit
get my marker here so here we have a guy
and he's screaming and yeah so he's
yelling at this kid over here who has an
ear yeah that's his ear they know a good
drawer so this guy talks and there's
like this little vibration and it
travels through the air and hits this
guy now the reason this works is there's
molecules or basically just little tiny
dots that's just pretty much in the air
and what this does is it will hit these
molecules and the molecules will get the
next molecules and then these molecules
will hit the next molecules so it's not
these molecules here are not traveling
and hitting his ear these molecules are
hitting these molecules and these
molecules hit these molecules which hit
the next layer of molecules which at the
next layer of molecules which hit his
ear and there's not really layers I kind
of just spread out sort of like an ocean
of these little dots you don't really
need to get into that really much just
think of it as a wave cuz sound doesn't
travel like this it travels in
three-dimensional space so if here's the
front of the guy's face
here's his teeth here's his face the
sound travels this like this and out
this way so it's like boom like
everywhere but it's mostly effective to
where you're pointing your mouth because
that's where it'll push or push forward
to reach the other person's ear now if
we study this vibration a little bit
more there's two stages there is
compression and then there's something
called rarefaction so basically think of
molecules this vibration is pushing
these molecules this way it's going to
let's say there's a layer of these
molecules and they hit these little dis
lab molecules so this layer molecules is
going to push forward now it's here it's
going to slow it's going to come back
sort of in a bam so it's like I don't
like you and it's like right but you
know I'm saying and this is gonna do the
same thing to this layer and this layer
so the first is called compression
because these become closer together
because this one this layer here if you
can see that hits the other layer or
just like kind of all of these like
crunch together
that's called compression and then they
kind of come back as these continue to
go so it's like BAM see what I'm saying
so it compresses and then it rare files
now this is very important because sound
is a vibration essentially and there's
two stages compression rarefaction
that's why we get a graph it's called a
sine wave like this now if you look at
this closer here is it compressing
here's a rarefied compressing verifying
compressing
it's not just one direct wave it's not
like why it's like we're worldwide so
that wall wall wall like dubstep you
know so all sound is a form of dubstep
you know not really
but anyways and that's important so when
we're calculating the frequency which is
how fast something vibrates we have
positive negative that is considered one
so if we have this wave it goes like
this let's look at this we have one here
one here and then a half the wall so
this would be like two and a half makes
sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
