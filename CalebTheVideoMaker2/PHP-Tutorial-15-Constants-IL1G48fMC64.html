video PHP series in this video I'm going
to be talking about constants so what is
a constant well it's also used to store
a value just like a variable oh the one
thing about constants is that they don't
change throughout the program
so basically wants you to find the value
for the constant it's going to stay that
way unless you go back to where you
defined it and change your code there
but it's not going to change as the
program goes so that's one thing another
thing which you probably have no idea if
you're new to programming about variable
scope but it has a global scope that's
basically just to say you can use it
anywhere throughout the program and you
don't have to worry about function level
and crap like that basically just ignore
that we'll be getting into that someday
another thing is you don't define it
with a dollar sign instead you just use
all capital letters so for example I
could say basically this can be a
constant name and it could have the
value Caleb so it's always we it's it's
good practice to do all capital letters
they are case-sensitive and to do this
we actually use a function you know you
probably not know about functions either
if you're watching this from the
beginning and you're new programmer but
we'll be getting into that for now just
memorize this to create a function we do
this define and then within parentheses
we put the constant name so they can say
oops name a coma and then we give it a
value within parentheses if it's a
string so Caleb
so here is the code that I just wrote
we're using a defined function which if
you don't know what troll' functions
don't worry about it basically it's just
going to define a function for us that's
what this code is going to do name is
the name of the function convenient I
know but we could change this we can
make it ma'am if we wanted and give it
the value Caleb the string Caleb
now when we want to use this well we
can't just be like echo hey this is
because if you were looking at this
originally without the idea that a
constant is there you're going to see
NAMM and you're gonna think oh okay we
just want to write PHP isn't going to
know that this is a constant so that
means we can't use constants within
quotation marks so what we can do is we
could say let go hey and then we could
say echo nan so this is going to say hey
and then it's going to write the value
of nail you could also use concatenation
so you could say we could say hey
like that believe that's correct so that
is also going to print this constant PHP
has a ton of predefined constants which
you will probably run into as you are
programming with PHP I'm not going to be
getting into any right now I just needed
you to understand that there's all
there's variables and there's constants
so if you ever see a word without quotes
such as echo hey if you don't know what
a constant is you might say oh it's an
error there should be quote series well
not necessarily because as we have it
right now it means hey is it constant
which points back to value to a value
that could say like a pass code or
something for example or it could say a
name or pretty much any value we wanted
to give it works very similar to
variables the only difference is we
don't start with oh I went through the
difference is already another difference
is it can only be simple values or
scalar that's to say that when we're
working with variables we can assign a
variable a value such as the string
Caleb well we can also use what's known
as an array or multiple values so we
could also use objects we could use some
special data types basically the data
type that a variable can use can have
one piece of information or multiple
pieces of information so for example if
I give this an array the variable name
is going to have more than one value and
I know this is kind of a bunch of stuff
at once but basically if you're using a
constant you can only use data types
that use one value so you cannot use
you cannot use an object you can only
use what's known as scaler I believe
that's how it's pronounced data types
are simple data types so that's another
thing now when you're naming constants
you can start with an underscore if you
want you can also use numbers throughout
but you can't start with a number that's
all you need to know so you can use
underscores you can use numbers you just
have to start with an underscore or a
letter that's pretty much the basics of
constants and kind of went over a lot
pretty quickly there so if it's a little
rough you can look it up it's pretty
simple and it'll make more sense as we
go on and you learn about data types
rather simple or complex or whatever all
that stuff and also variable scope so
that's all I have to say in this video
thank you for watching and be sure to
subscribe I will see you in the next
video yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
