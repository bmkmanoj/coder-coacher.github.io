Caleb the video maker - and this is the
start of a miniature series on how to
install PHP and MySQL on DreamHost
and DreamHost is just a hosting company
the equivalent of GoDaddy or Bluehost
basically you pay them to have your
website on their servers we're gonna be
using dream posts just because they have
really awesome support if you have any
problems setting up your website or any
kind of issues they will go out of their
way to help you and they have instant
messaging and all kinds of ways of
support so they're really really good
when you sign up for dreamhost if you
guys want you can use my referral link
which is right here once you're here you
can just click explore our services and
then you probably are going to be
interested in shared hosting that's
their most simple hosting plan although
they do have other options if you're
planning on hosting something crazy but
we're gonna start with shared hosting
sign-up click continue the next step is
choosing your domain name now the domain
name is basically the address you type
into your web browser to get to a
website well essentially there's a
couple options you can register a domain
and if that's the case you're going to
need to think of what you want your
website to be called or if you already
own this domain such as maybe you have
it purchased on a different hosting
company or you bought it from somewhere
else that's a little bit more
complicated when it comes to setup but
it's totally possible I have a domain
name purchased through GoDaddy
and I'm hosting the website on dreamhost
so I know how that works if any of you
guys need help maybe I could make a
video about it or something
alternatively you can start with a free
subdomain now what a sub domain is is
essentially your name dot another domain
so they're going to allow you to create
a sub domain for free so we'll just go
with PHP MySQL tutorial doctoring
mosters calm I'm gonna go with that
option just cuz that's free for now then
continue oh by the way this is cool
who is domain privacy is free
with all eligible domains registered
with DreamHost and if you have no idea
what that means you can read this or
just let me explain it it just gives you
extra privacy and a lot of other
companies will make you pay for that
extra feature so that's really cool
click continue
they have a couple different options on
how you want to host it I'm gonna go
with monthly because I'm actually gonna
set this up and then that way I don't
have to keep it up for three years
here's a couple other options you can do
these if you want but since we're
starting with PHP MySQL from scratch we
don't want to install WordPress that's
going to do all of that for us and set
up a website for us and if that's
something you're interested in go look
it up but for us we want to do things
just by hand so let's just continue and
we're just gonna fill out a little bit
of information about ourselves down here
it's going to give you a little review
of what you're going to be paying for
and then you can place your order boom
done
you got your account set up there you go
time to go to the web panel this is
where you sign in so you can just put
your email and password and there you go
here's where you're going to create your
database that's going to power the
backend of your website that in addition
to PHP allows you to make dynamic really
cool websites</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
