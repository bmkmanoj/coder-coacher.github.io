maker to this video we are going to be
talking about comments now I know if
you've ever programmed before you're
probably like oh do we really need a
whole video of her comments come on it's
easy yes it is easy but I'm hoping to do
more than just teach you comments I'm
hoping to explain when to use them how
to use them what to do and what not to
do so hopefully this is a little bit
more helpful then hey here's how you
make a comment and if you have no idea
what a comment is that's fine too so
let's get started you can see that I
listed all of the files in my working
directory and these are the files we've
worked with so far in this series I am
going to work with this egg's file again
and I'm going to add some comments to it
so let's open it and see there are two
types of comments the first is called a
single line comment and to make a single
line comment you use two forward slashes
so go into insert mode by pressing I and
then press slash slash this is a comment
inside of this comment we can put
anything we like the compiler just
ignores it I like eggs there was some
person on a TV show I used to watch The
Amanda Show there was this girl in the
bathroom episode who was always like I
like eggs I'm talking about yep right
there she would love working at this egg
company anywho let's get back on topic
the other type of comment is called a
multi-line comment and the main
difference is that a multi-line comment
allows you to type as long as you want
all of this is inside of a single
comment that does not work with a single
line comment for example if I typed
right here well this is going to give us
a compiler error because it's no longer
part of a comment each one of these
comments has a benefit and a downside
for the single line comment the obvious
downside is well you can't do it on
multiple lines but the benefit of a
single line comment is you can actually
put it after code for example here let
me get rid of this line so down here I
can actually explain something after the
code so I can put slash slash this does
something and you can explain what it
does if it's confusing
that way when you come back five years
from now you can read what you had to
say about this code and you can
understand what it's doing this has as
downside though and that anything after
this on this line will be counted as a
comment so I can't do stuff like int X
yada yada yada it's all in the same line
so it still thinks it's a comment with
multi-line comments you can actually put
it inside of other code so I could put a
comment here and say I think I might add
more info here so that way the user
knows what to do something like that and
this is actually gonna be fine for the
compiler except I'd type that in wrong
there we go so often at the top of a
program you can put something like who
wrote it what the program is for all
that good stuff and I have some strong
words to say about these code blocks let
me tell you often times you'll find
extra asterisks so that way it's extra
clear what's going on here there you go
and now we have this little section that
kind of describes what the program does
and I'd probably put it above the
include statement but it's fine for now
you could just the same make these all
single line comments using double
slashes but oftentimes you'll see it in
a multi-line comment oh these multi-line
comments I tell you sometimes they
introduce some really dumb stuff to code
and if you go to computer science school
the chances are they'll tell you to do
this but personally I think it's pretty
dumb because one rarely ever are you
going to have code that's written by
just one person so why do you put an
author here I have no idea and then
let's say you work at this job
and you're really bad at coding so they
fire you well now the next guy has your
code so is he supposed to change this
just to his name because technically he
didn't write it but he worked on it so I
don't know
I think that's stupid the description
and that might be useful they might be
able to say hey what is this page for
the date personally I think that's
stupid and they should get rid of that
too like why would you put a date on a
document that is going to continually be
updated the first problem here is that
that's assuming the code is never going
to be
changed and if you try to fix that and
say Oh every time you change this code
you just got to update the date well
that's stupid because the chances are
you're gonna forget to do that and to
why does it really matter I don't know
most programming companies are going to
use something called source control an
example of this is git or subversion etc
and all of those are going to keep track
of when your changes are so you don't
need to put a date in there either when
I took a computer science class
I got points off on literally almost
every project because I didn't comment
well enough but the thing is the teacher
wanted me to comment so much that I had
more comments than I had actual code if
you comment so much that that happens
when you change your code you'll have to
go search through your comments and
update everything and then what happens
is if you forget to update something you
have comments that are out of date and
nothing is more confusing than a comment
that says code does something and the
code actually does something else that
comment is actually making it harder to
understand not easier so I am one of
those people who lean on less comments
than more comments although I do think
it is helpful to maybe give a sentence
or if you have to a couple sentences
describing what a function does or what
a section of code does if it is
complicated or hard to understand with a
minute or more of studying this could
really help other people know what your
code is doing just make sure you don't
overdo it and describe every single
detail the point of the comment is so
you know what the function or section of
code does not necessarily how or why it
does every single thing the way it does
if you disagree and you think hey we
should use tons of comments give me your
reasons why and I'll see what you have
to say and maybe I'm wrong and maybe I
should try to use comments more but if
you find yourself doing stuff like in x
equals 5 plus 5 and then commenting x
equals 10 or something like you should
be able to figure out the value of x
just by looking at this this is
redundant information and actually
lowers the quality of your code
and will ruin your life oh so yeah that
is my argument for the day I may have
gotten a little off-topic there is one
other thing I wanted to share with you
and that is if you are working on code
and you're working on something but
you're not quite done with it you can do
what's called a to-do comment and what
you do is just say to do and then
explain what you need to do the benefit
of this is that when you need to go back
and update your code you can just search
for anything that says to do to make
sure you got everything done and that
you can update the sections that you
didn't finish so I highly recommend
trying to do that and yeah that will
probably help you out and other people
who are working with your code so yeah
guys thanks for watching hopefully I had
some good insight for you if you have
any other information please leave me a
comment and I will check it out thanks
guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
