going to discuss the histogram so let's
start with a bar plot and let's look at
a feature such as H this is percent with
diabetes and you know we look at people
who are zero and you know 50% of them
have diabetes and then we look at people
who are one and you know maybe 60% of
them had diabetes and then to 30% and
then for maybe 90% and this is kind of
useful because this bar plot is going to
show us trends so it might look
something like this which might show as
you get in your middle ages there's a
higher chance you're gonna have diabetes
then not have diabetes but the problem
here is is that the data is so split by
little tiny bars that we can't see
groups and that's what a histogram is
for it's to see groups of data so
instead of having 0 1 2 3 we're going to
group everyone into a bin based on some
range of values we're gonna 0 to 9 and
see that 50% have diabetes we could have
10 to 19 and realize you know 40% of
diabetes then we could see 20 to 29 and
all the sudden you know data starts
going upwards right and then 30 to 39 we
get this huge spike so now we can see a
little bit more because we're no longer
looking at individual numbers we're
looking at groups and this is exactly
what we talked about earlier with Benny
so literally this is just taking a bar
plot and bending the data which allows
us to more easily visualize the data
especially when we're talking about
outliers we might have a group up at the
end 99 - like 109 and normally we'd have
to have a little bar plot for each one
of those ages and you know it's not very
visual but now we can see as a group
anybody in this age group what is the
chance that they're gonna have diabetes
in general I prefer to look at the
histogram because it's not so continuous
and it's more categorical which is
exactly what the bidding process is for
to make our data
categories so the main difference
between bar graph and histogram is one
is continuous and another is not
continuous but categorical so obviously
I'm not a stats expert and I'm sure
someone on the internet will be like
dude you missed this part and you stood
yeah but I think this is a good
introduction and as you need more data
visualization I'm sure there is
resources out there so thank you guys
for watching and I really appreciate if
you subscribe and check out the next
video thank you and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
