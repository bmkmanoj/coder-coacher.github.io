to be talking about comments everyone
loves talking about comments I just know
that so yeah so what is a comment
basically it's something that's not
going to be rendered it's going to be
ignored
it's not going to be displayed on the
web browser the users not going to see
it it's only there for the coders help
so if you could say okay here's a
comment and it says oh the next
following code is supposed to do this
and then when someone else comes and
edits your code or looks at it or a year
from now you come look at your code you
know what your code is trying to do and
you don't have to decipher PHP because
it's hard to do that so Co comments are
common another reason for comments is
often at the beginning of each program
you will have a list of things which
usually includes like the author the
date and the purpose of the entire
program and a company that you're
working for if possible but I don't know
so that's the main use for comments and
also another great use is for debugging
so let's say you have some code right
here and then you have some code right
here and you have some code right here
and your program is not working right
well you could try commenting certain
things out because if you remember
commenting makes the code not be
rendered otherwise it's just ignored
well if we comment both of these out and
then try the code and it works well then
we know that one's good now if we just
try to comment this one out we know this
one's good and we get an error well now
we know that this one might have a
problem now you got to be careful though
because this if you let's say for
example if you were if you have these
you want to see if the bottom one is
working so you comment these out and
then this one references something from
these it's going to not work out right
because obviously this codes not going
to be rendered so it's it's not going to
turn out the way we like so sweet let's
let's go a little bit more in-depth
there's pretty much two different
classifications of comments that we'll
be using
well sort of I guess HTML comments and
PHP comments some kind of B I'm going to
be teaching both here HTML comments look
like this so this is an HTML comment if
you put this into your HTML it's going
to be ignored
here are our three different types of
PHP comments I have two forward slashes
a pound sign hash tag whatever you want
to call it and we also have
so there's differences between these
these ones are single line comments
which means you can just type whatever
you want on so on but as soon as you go
to the next line
well then it's not commented out anymore
same for this one this one is a double
line comment so I could put this one
down here and then I could have a
comment comment comment comment and this
whole thing is going to be commented out
so those are the main differences those
are our four types of comments with two
classifications PHP in HTML now just
like in the last video we talked about
certain things being sent to the browser
or to I mean to the clients computer
well let's talk about that now so we
have three things to worry about we have
the PHP the HTML
and the client and then I'll get into
another one soon
so here's PHP here's HTML and we have
the client the client is the person
viewing our web application so if we put
a PHP comment it would be here so for
example I use PHP comment well this is
um different than HTML is it going to be
sent to the client well no it's not
because it's client-side
I mean it's server sorry it's not going
to be sent to the client because PHP is
not client-side its server-side that
means everything we type is going to
stay on this side unless we type in a
command that allows something to pass
through such as echo we learned about
that in the last two videos so comments
in PHP are going to stay either
what about HTML comments we could have
an HTML comment here and then a comment
goes right here between those two and is
this going to be sent to the client
well because hTML is a client-side
language yes this call of this comment
is going to be sent to the client so
those are the two fundamental
differences if we are commenting
something about the PHP code it's going
to be invisible to anyone viewing our
web page so you can put some more secure
information in the PHP comments for our
other developers and that's for the HTML
you don't want to put anything that's
obviously because it's going to be it's
possible to get that information now
there's one more thing to worry about
here is the web browser such as Firefox
within this clients computer so this
client opened up a web browser
specifically Firefox now is this comment
right here is it going to display down
here did what do you think do you think
it will that's what I thought too
no okay but no it's not going to display
on the web browser so that kind of
that's probably a better explanation
than what I was trying to explain in the
last video basically PHP always stays on
the server side unless told otherwise by
some sort of command you cannot access
the PHP source code you can only access
you can only view what's sent to the
other side onto the client side does
that make sense so an echo command is
allowing something it's sort of like a
little tube here that allows certain
information to go through sort of like a
cell walls and only certain information
can pass this cell wall so that's one
way you can think of it HTML on the
other hand though is client-side so
anything you type in hTML is
automatically going to be able to be
viewed by the client the only difference
is between comments and code well
comments are not going to be viewed in
the web browser but the the actual like
content of the website will be so how
can you view the comments well in any
modern web browser if you right-click a
web page there's a button that says view
source that is going to show us all of
the HTML source code used to display
this web page so in our if in our c
phenomena muscular example if in our
source code we have a comment that says
my password is blah blah blah and then
this is on our HTML
while the clients computer is going to
have this information the web browser is
not going to directly see it but if you
select view source well then that's not
going to work out so well because you
are going to be able to see this HTML
comment so hopefully that makes things
very clear the next thing I want to talk
about in this video is whitespace so
what is whitespace whitespace is
unneeded well sometimes you might think
they're needed for organization reasons
but they're there spaces or blank lines
or tabs that are extra in your program
and in PHP and HTML
they are generally whitespace
insensitive so for example I could say
in PHP echo hey and then I could put ten
spaces and say man and how is this going
to be rendered out in the web browser
they're going to see it as a with one
space so all of these annoying extra
spaces are ignored all they get is a man
that's what I'm saying when they're
whitespace insensitive so the main three
kinds we have to worry about our tabs
which just hits the tab button it's
about the size of like five spaces for
example I don't really know blank lines
which is just hitting Enter and hitting
the spacebar multiple times so when we
write code if necessary you can space
things out how you would like
or if you accidentally hit an extra
space it's not going to throw off your
program unless you interrupt a specific
word such as echo if you put ec space ik
ho well that's not going to work that's
because they are sensitive to one space
so when I say hey man and echo this
first space here is always going to be
displayed so that way we get hey man
with one space however many so when you
have one space they do see it when they
have more than one space they only look
at the first space hopefully that makes
sense so go give that a few tries just
type up some words make sure you are
running the PHP through a web server so
viewing it localhost and then whatever
like either index dot PHP which will be
the default or a different page you
created that's all I have to say in this
video so please please please please
please please please subscribe and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
