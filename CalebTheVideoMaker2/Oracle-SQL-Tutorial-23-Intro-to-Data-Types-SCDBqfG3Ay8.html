tutorial series now it has been quite a
while so let me just kind of give you a
refresher of what's going on on my
channel well I decided I'm going to make
oracle videos my SQL videos and sequel
server videos and kind of turn it into a
competition and the competition starts
with video 23 which is this one so if
you like Oracle be sure to click like
and watch all of these videos in this
series because the winner is going to
get an extra 50 tutorials oh all right
so let's get started what are we going
to be talking about now well we are
going to start talking about Oracle data
types all of the data that we store in
our tables has to have a data type now
when we create the table we put the data
type after the column name what is a
data type though why do we have to put
that information there well put simply
just look at the name here a data type
is the type data rather than just saying
data we classify it into a certain type
that way the database has a better
knowledge of how to work with it how to
store it how to optimize storage and
speed and all of those things so by
having data types we're able to improve
our database in addition to improve
performance data types also help us
reject incorrect data for example you
might have one column that has a data
type and someone might try to insert
some data into that that doesn't fit
that data type and it will get rejected
by telling a database what type of data
we want for a column or able to restrict
garbage and keep that crap out of our
database onyx can you later cheat now to
help us study databases they are often
categorized you know we always got to
make categories there are three main
categories there are some additional
ones but the three that I'm going to
discuss with you now are the most
important and the most common ones then
the other ones are used occasionally so
we'll discuss those later so let's start
with the main three numeric string and
temporary if you are not super familiar
with these words you could say numeric
is number of data types string is
alphanumeric which means characters and
numbers and in temporal is time spans
and dates and times so these ones have
to do with numbers something you would
do math with string has to do with
characters or sequence of characters so
anything inside of quotes and then
anything dealing with time is temporal
now on each one of these categories
there are some different data types so
in the upcoming videos we're going to
discuss those in more detail but this
video is kind of just get you you know
rough overview so when we start talking
about them you're not like what what an
important thing to know is that each one
of these is known as a character so this
is a five character string other
examples of characters are numbers
symbols as well as letters from other
languages so characters go inside string
datatypes
but numeric data types only take numbers
so these are pretty good categories but
there's one extra thing that I wanted to
mention before we move on to the next
video and that has to do with storage
that's because one thing that all of the
data types are going to have in common
is they all take storage space they take
up space on our computer or our server
and us as database people have to figure
out the best way to store these so they
take up the least amount of space I'm
not going to go over all of the details
on how to do that right now but just
something to kind of keep in the back of
your brain is to use the amount of space
that is enough to store what you need
but don't store any more than that so
for example if you're storing a string
make the size of that string column as
small as possible to store what you need
for example if you're storing a phone
number there's no need to make the
column able to store 300 characters
because a phone number is only like what
10 to 11 characters or something like
that you'd think it wouldn't make such a
huge difference because we're talking
about character data it's not huge file
sizes
but when we're talking about the
difference of one bite across millions
of rows the difference becomes
substantial if you are unsure on how to
size something size it on the larger
side of you're unsure 'ti you wouldn't
want to make it too small and then later
have to figure out oh crap how do I
change this see ya
aim bigger than smaller if you're on
Shore that's all for this video guys
hopefully this next section of videos is
going to be real helpful for you guys
thank you for watching and as always
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
