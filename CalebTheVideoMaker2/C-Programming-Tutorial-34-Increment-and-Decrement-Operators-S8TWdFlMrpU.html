Caleb's video maker - now continuing
from the last video we are going to be
talking about more operators in the
previous video I mentioned how some
operators change the value of the
operands that's what we are going to be
showing in this video and we are going
to be talking about two of the most
popular and most important operators in
programming so please pay attention
these are called the increment and
decrement operators so whenever you want
to increment a value you can actually
use this operator and incrementing a
value actually just means to increase
the value by one decrement means to
decrease the value by one so if we have
a variable called pizzas to eat and
we'll set this to a reasonable number
the hard way to increment a value is to
do this pizzas to eat equals pizzas to
eat plus one and the way this works is
it's going to take the value of pizzas
to eat 123 add 1 to it and then assign
the whole thing back to pizzas to eat so
you end up with 124 in the variable
pizzas to eat but there is a shorthand
way to do this all you have to do is say
pizzas to eat plus plus this is a
shorthand way to do just this this is
very good if you just want to add one to
a variable this format is a little bit
better if you want to add more than one
to a variable let's say you wanted to
add five to a variable up here would be
very easy because you could just say
plus five but if you wanted to do it
with the plus plus you would literally
have to put the statement five times and
you get the point
that would just be slow and cumbersome
and we don't want to do that but
whenever you just need to add one you're
always going to want to use the plus
plus because that is a standard
convention in programming at first it
takes a little bit to get used to this
but once you see it a thousand times
you'll be able to read it as if it
literally just says add one to this
variable now this operator it is a unary
operator which means only takes one
operand
the operand is the variable it doesn't
need two variables it only changes one
variable now I want to play some trivia
let's play a little game okay let's try
to guess the output of some code let's
get rid of this line here and then we're
going to print something well what are
we going to output we're actually going
to make another variable and we are
going to call it output and we are going
to set it equal to pizzas to eat plus
plus and just to make this clear let's
get rid of this line too and we will
also set the value of pizzas to eat to a
hundred we just want this to be as
simple as possible so I want you to
figure out what will happen when I print
output like this I recommend you give it
a try you got five seconds five four
three two one point five zero the answer
is a hundred it actually outputs out a
hundred why a hundred this is one of the
trickiest parts to understand about the
increment operator when we do something
like this pizzas to eat plus plus we are
saying we want the plus plus to happen
after the value of pizzas to eat is
assigned to output what that means is
that pizzas to eat at this point down
here equals 101 but only outputs 100
because the increment didn't happen
until after output got the value to
change this we can actually put the plus
plus before the variable now let's run
the code and I'll show you you can see
that outputs 101 if we put the pluses at
the end you will see that the output is
100 let's save it right there 100 in
addition to the increment operator there
is also a decrement operator and that
just looks like - - and it works exactly
the same way and we need to update this
comment aha don't you hate when comments
are outdated
all right let's try this
the output is 100 that's because the
decrement doesn't happen until after the
assignment so let's print out pizzas to
eat after this point so pizzas to eat
and also I'm going to change the string
here just so the variables don't get
confused here we're going to say this is
output I'll write that and now let's run
it so output is 100 and pizzas to eat is
99 the decrement operator is literally
the same thing as doing pizzas to eat
equals pizzas to eat minus 1 just like
that if this stuff is a little bit
confusing to you that's okay this is one
of those barriers you have to get past
to become an efficient programmer don't
worry about it just watch this video a
couple thousand times and click
Subscribe do a ton of research on
incrementing and decrementing I promise
you promise you this is going to come up
again so don't neglect it thanks guys
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
