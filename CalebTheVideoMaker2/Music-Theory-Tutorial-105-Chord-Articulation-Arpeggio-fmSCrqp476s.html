holy cow Caleb's not in his typical blue
shirt well you're right
Sal's eating pizza and I was like like
all over me
so yeah Caleb the video maker spilt
pizza on a shirt isn't it weird how I
ruined a shirt yeah it doubled in value
just kidding
tripled so yes I have one more example
of articulation and if you remember a
while ago
we have cords like this this is in block
formation we can break it up so it's
like this it's played one after the
other that is called arpeggio if we want
to illustrate and arpeggiated as I head
in the word arpeggiated chords van
rather than spacing the notes out like
that we can draw them in the block
formation and put a little bit for it so
with this little this little squiggly
before the chord this is telling us to
play it in arpeggio which there's not
even forth around landrieu that one but
the style of the way we play it when
it's broken up can vary and I guess it
just depends on how you want to play it
and what sounds good with the song and
also and also you may want to play it in
a specific type of rhythm if it's more
fitting to the song but this is how you
can illustrate an arpeggiated chord
without having to draw the notes out
spaced equally you just draw one chord
and put a little squiggly so a thing
nope nope is that when Iced placed the
notes like this there should actually be
2 here 3 here 2 there is one there so
the reason for this is let me show you
this on the keyboard this isn't 100% all
of the time you may just want to play
each note individually but typically
you'll play the first note add the
second note add the third note release
the third note release the second note
the first note or if there's more than
three he got one two three four and then
briefly one two three four one two three
four rather than gone one two three four
four three two one makes sense so yeah
here's a D minor chord and block
formation DF na now if I want to
arpeggio a tit or whatever the word
would be
sounds nice whoa I'm so dark so what we
can do is play a D in the bass so the
main trunk yeah
sooo I'm saying all I'm trying to say is
that you may not play you can play an
arpeggio ated court or you can play it I
guess it just depends typically you will
add each note rather than playing each
one individually but it just depends so
that is an arpeggiated chord
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
