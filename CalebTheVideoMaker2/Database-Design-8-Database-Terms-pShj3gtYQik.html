me this far on this video I just want to
do a little bit of review as well as go
over the vocabulary that we've learned
so if you don't really want to know
we're going to go over some new ones too
but if you don't want to review then
feel free to skip to this video in the
next one so this video will be about
data and database design terms so the
very first term we learned was data data
is pretty much anything we store in a
database you pretty much know what that
is so nouns pretty good database that is
what we store our data in and then we
have a specific kind of database which
is a relational database and what's
special about a relational database is
that it stores things in tables we have
a database management system or database
manage DBMS for short that is how we
manage a database using code that's how
we control our database we have a
specific kind of database management
system called a relational database
management system which is just used to
control our tables and the values within
our tables of a relational database
pretty simple now we're going to
introduce a new word to you which is no
or null however you want to pronounce it
I've been told I pronounced it wrong but
I don't really care anyways this is when
someone does not enter a value within a
column on a table so if we have a table
and we have something such as fax number
well not everyone is going to have a fax
number so when we have a guy
we'll say we have an ID here we have an
I uh guy with the idea of seven and we
don't have a
number this emptiness is said to be no
so basically you'll hear empty value
although by definition null means no
value so it's kind of a bad definition
but who cares null
basically means there is no data in that
specific field and we'll be getting into
more terms like that in a second
so that is what null means that's one
you will need to know another one is an
anomaly or anomalies so anomalies are
basically errors within our data in our
data integrity so when we have an
anomaly it's something that goes away
from what we expect or from the normal
when we update something for example and
instead of updating one column it
updates ten and it wasn't supposed to
that's an anomaly so yeah you will need
to know that as well the other one is
integrity we implement database
integrity to protect against anomalies
so we went over three different kinds of
integrity we went over entity integrity
we got over referential and we went over
domain real quick what these are entity
integrity is saying uniqueness among the
table referential keeps the connections
the keys foreign keys primary keys they
keep them connected across multiple
tables so we could say these two tables
have some kind of connection and then
domain is basically saying a column
within a table has all of the expected
values so we have a phone number we
would expect numbers not text or not a
date that is a domain Integra
and the word domain is basically the
range of values that are acceptable to
store within a column so these are our
data vocabulary that you should know now
we're going to move on into the design
terms okay
so designing is what we're here for so
this is fun very first thing you need to
know is an entity which is anything we
store data about a user a a mortgage a
transaction a credit card information
anything the comments a comment they're
all entities is what we're storing data
about then we have attributes attributes
are the things we store about the entity
in comment a an attribute of a comment
would be the date that it was made the
length how many characters is it who
posted that's an example of an attribute
a relation we're talking about
mathematics it's a connection between
two sets of data when we're talking
about databasing put very simply it's
just a table so we're relation is
another name for a table where we have
data within our database so we could
have a structure of different tables so
these can be connected just I don't know
however you want to connect them this
can be our database we'll each one of
these different sets of different sets
of information our data is known as a
relation it's a table
next term is a couple however you want
to pronounce that to just winging it
here that's another thing for a row it's
a it's all the attributes' about a
specific entity so if we have this guy
we can say his name is Caleb his phone
number is blah blah blah his address is
age his birth date will probably better
how long he's been a member of this
website or whatever it is this all of
these values about this entity that's
what that is a couple that would also be
a row on a table because we physically
represent relations with the table so
when we have a table we have the columns
so we have name phone number address
social security number and then when we
enter all of those for a specific person
of the ID of seven the name Caleb the
phone number blah blah the address blah
blah blah that is known as a double or a
row
another term is a table which we just
talked about that which is just a
physical represents representation of a
relation tables are what we store in a
database to organize am I like cutting
my head off there ok I see to organize
our data within a table we have rows and
we have columns the rows would be a
specific individual entry within our our
table so like that guy we just drew all
of his values would be his row the
columns are that specific and a specific
attribute of that person such as a name
this is the column where we would put
the value Caleb all right now we also
have another three three more terms that
we haven't learned yet which you will
possibly hear they're kind of older
terms but they they're just talking
about the same thing you may hear the
terms file record and then feel so what
are these talking about well file is
just another name for a table a record
is another name for a row and a field is
another term for a column so other than
that we have the words value a value is
the information that we put in to a
specific column so here is a value okay
or subscribe
or beggar or 700 or June sixteenth
whatever it is those are all values all
right oh man it's already 10 minutes
then all right then we have an entry you
may hear the term entry which I like to
use this for the like the it's almost
like a verb the when you enter data you
get an entry so basically an entry is
just another name for a row so on
there's obviously a lot of similar names
and we'll be making a table saying what
we're just just giving it database
design the process of designing your
table to remove anomalies and have data
integrity get more schema everyone
pronounce that that is just a physical
that's just a drawn out structure of our
our database then we have a new term
here is called normalize or
normalization normalization is basically
just a bunch of steps that we're going
to follow to help us get the best
database design so that's just that's
part of database design when we go
through these normal forms to get the
best database design we'll talk about
that or in an upcoming video but just I
want you to know that the term
normalization is the process of building
the best database design the other one
naming conventions a naming convention
is just a consistency used to make
things consistent so we name tables a
certain way we name columns a certain
way we name our database a certain way
we draw our database schema a certain
way so basically convention is anything
that is done repeatedly to create
consistency and the last one here is
keys
which I'm not sure if I talked about
this or not yet I think a little bit but
not much
but key is something to make everything
unique within a table this is how we
make connections among tables we connect
IDs we may say oh this comment was
posted by the user with the ID of seven
well that points back to as a user table
we do all that with keys and we'll learn
more about those as time goes on all
right so you see we have a lot of terms
and a lot of them are repeats for this
meaning the same thing for example we
have a relation and then we have tables
and then we have file so relation table
and file are all talking about the
physical structure a table pretty much
record would circle these ones record
would be in a row so we have a row and
then we have a tough these are all
talking about rows within a table and
then we have how should I do this let's
just cross them out columns and then we
have attributes and then we have a field
those are all talking about a column in
a table of an also entry you can kind of
think of as a a row because you put like
you enter data into the table and you
get a new row the value is just a
specific you can think of it like leave
your some of this we have this table and
we break it up into columns so we have
ID name and then phone number for
example those are a column headers and
then we have specific values 7 hey look
up above the top and then we have
another guy 8 well if we separate this
into cells which is another term we have
a specific value that we put in here
such as John that is a value now entity
that's the only one that's in so we just
went over value entity is what's left
that's not circled or crossed outer
squared or something entity is I don't
like to really assign this to like a row
or a table or anything because of entity
is just something we're storing data
about so that could be an individual row
or it could be the table type so for
example we have a table for users while
the user is the entity what a specific a
specific entity would be a row within
this table because we'd have the entity
for this guy over here and then we have
one for this guy down here or for this
chick over here or lady I should say so
these all get their own rows you see so
an entity that's just something we store
data about so yeah I know that was super
long and hopefully that was helpful and
if I just was rambling on I'm sorry but
I'll see you in the next video be sure
