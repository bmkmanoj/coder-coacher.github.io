SQL tutorial series this video we are
going to start designing a seer of let's
goal this video again in this video we
are going to be designing a miniature
database with the primary goal of
applying what we know about foreign keys
and how to design them so we're going to
start with this a simple thing three
tables and we'll make some connections
with some foreign keys and we'll go from
there
so what is the goal of our application
this database is going to power an
application where people can create an
account sign in and then they can make
projects so this is like a project
management software imagine like JIRA if
you know what that is essentially you
create an account you make projects and
then you add people to those projects so
that's all it's going to do for now so
we're going to put the projects on this
side and we'll put the users over here
can you guess what goes here yeah it's
going to be an intermediary table
between projects and users we'll get to
that in a minute first let's talk about
the project's table this is this going
to have information about the project
including a project ID a reference to
the user that created it all that good
stuff and the way I'm going to be
designing this is following the erd
pattern which stands for entity
relationship diagram essentially what
that fancy word means is we're going to
make tables as boxes and we're going to
list the columns down this way and we
basically just ignore rows we're not
going to care about what data is put in
because as long as we put the column and
what's allowed that's all that matters
so in the user table we'll have a user
ID a user name first name and last name
I'm not going to worry about data types
for now all you need to know is that if
you have a foreign key it needs to match
the data type of the column at
references now over here on projects
want a project ID we'll have a creator
which is a reference to the user now
this brings up the question do we
reference the
d or do we reference the username yeah
do we reference the ID or the username
and it's ultimately up to you I think
it's kind of important to get experience
with both referencing primary keys and
referencing things that just have the
unique constraint so for now I'm going
to use the username and I think that's
going to improve our readability but as
we go on I think what we choose will
change I'm just trying to get us all
familiar with everything here so Creator
just going to reference user name will
also have a project title and if I
wanted to get real fancy you could put
in like a creation date and all kinds of
junk like that but that's really good
for now now what about this team well
the only other table we need is a table
that lists what users are part of what
projects and that is a many-to-many
relationship that's because we designed
it that way a lot of this stuff you get
to choose for example in this situation
a project can only have one creator
that's because it's a column inside of
the table if we wanted to where a
project can have multiple creators we
would need to take that out into a
separate call a separate table and name
it like project creators for example but
when it comes to the users that can join
a project I'm making that amending to
many relationship so what that means is
one user can join multiple projects and
an individual project can have multiple
users the way we design that in database
design is using two one-to-many
relationships that calls for an
intermediary table now the intermediary
table name by convention is just a
combination of this table and this table
so you can pick one to be singular and
the other one is going to be plural so
we could have project users or we could
add user projects I think it makes more
sense to have project users so that's
what I'm going to go with and this is
going to have two columns a project ID
and a user ID and these are both going
be foreign keys now you see in this
situation I decided not to use the
username but I could have if I wanted to
in fact I could have used the project
title here instead of the project ID but
then that gives you the limitation of
that they have to be unique now let's
figure out which tables are the parents
and which ones are the children the
users table is going to be the parent
that's because it has no foreign keys
you see all the arrows point to the
users table now the projects that's the
child of the users because you see it
references the user name now the project
users table that's a child of both of
these tables so I guess if you had to
draw it out you'd have this being the
users table
this being the projects table that's a
child of the users so and then we'd have
project users down here which is a child
of both of them the next thing we want
to do is ask the important questions
about the foreign keys let's look at all
the foreign keys we have here we have
one two three so we need to ask at least
two questions for each one of these so
let's start with the users table and
kind of move down the family tree so
we'll go to its child and we'll start
the projects and we'll look at this
foreign key creator should it be unique
best way to think about this is to ask
what would it be like if it was unique
and what would it be like if it was not
you if it's unique that means within our
table we had a column and it's a creator
we can only reference a specific creator
one time so if it's 7 that means that's
the only time that creator can be in the
projects table personally I don't think
that's a great idea because essentially
what that is saying is that a person can
only create one project that's up to
your business decisions on whether
that's a true statement or not but in
this situation I'm going to make it to
where a user can create multiple
projects so it's not going to be you now
is it going to be not null well if it
isn't all that means a project can exist
without a creator
and I don't think that makes a lot of
sense so I'm going to say not all and we
can look at these IDs and if you want
you can go through the whole process but
I've come to the conclusion that this is
going to be the same for all of the
foreign keys here because we're not
going to want to make it to where a
person can only join one project or a
project can only have one user and stuff
doesn't make sense and it also doesn't
make sense to have a project with no
user inside of the project users table
so obviously want it to be not at all
hopefully that was not a little too
quick for you guys but hopefully you
guys get the point and just it's really
important to really think through this
stuff like a lot of effort can be saved
now
by working harder on the design and the
engineering of the entire solution
rather than rushing through it and just
pooping on a database and trying to get
out good data structure it and then your
data is going to work out I know it's a
lot of extra steps but it's worth it so
thanks guys
really appreciate everything you guys do
thanks for watching these videos liking
them and ultimately I really appreciate
you subscribing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
