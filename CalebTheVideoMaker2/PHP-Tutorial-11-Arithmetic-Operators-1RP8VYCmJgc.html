your 11th PHP tutorial in this video I'm
going to be talking about numbers
hopefully you know about numbers if not
you should probably start with like a
different series but I mean you can go
for it you don't know about numbers just
go for it you can do this so numbers
they're quite common in PHP we will be
working with them I loved my eyebrow
itches so just like if you have a
variable let's say number so creative I
couldn't think of anything well just
like you can assign straight you can
sign this a string value you can also
assign it a numerical value so I can say
5 the thing about this is different it's
different than a string because it
doesn't have quotes so this is treated
as a string this is Street treated as a
string this is treated as a number and I
know that doesn't mean much now but when
you're working with these numbers you're
going to get incorrect results if you
are treating a string as a number or a
number as a string so you have to get
those correct all right so and you will
also do a lot of arithmetic or basic
adding subtracting multiplying stuff
like that so you will need to know what
are known as arithmetic operators I
forgot this voted write operators so
that's basically something that is going
to do something with your value like
give it two values it'll add them
together for example just like a while
ago we talked about the assignment
operator where you had
Caleb well this this right here this is
the assignment operator and what it does
is it makes this variable point to that
value pretty simple
well there's also arithmetic operators
one of these is plus one of them's minus
one of them's divide one of them is
multiplication sorry to drawl it's the
up asterisks capitulate thing there's
also the modulus I think that's it
and there's also a negative sign so
let's say we have the variable X okay we
can and it's it's value is five okay
just just for reference just so you know
I mean well we can also put a negative
sign before it or a minus sign pretty
much this is going to make it a negative
five so yes that's an operator that only
affects one value we could also that
only uses one value we could also use a
plus sign so they could be like plus
three and this is going to give us eight
cuz 5 plus 3 is 8
cause to subtract 3 and get 2 because 5
minus 3 is 2 we can divide which I don't
know how to divide 5 and I don't know
how to do that so let's say this is 6
divided by 3 well that's going to be 2
it also multiply 6 times 3 that's going
to be 6 12 18 then we have the modulus
which is a remainder so this one's a
little more tricky let's say this is the
value 7 okay and we're going to get the
modulus of 3 well basically we count how
many times 3 goes into 7 and then
however many is left is the result so we
could get
3 plus 3 which is 6 we see if we try to
add another 3 it's not so that's too
many so we have 6 and there's a total of
7 that means there's one left over it's
the remainder basic math here so this
would give us the value 1 if X had the
value 7 and we got the modulus like this
this is going to give us the value 1 and
you could try that on a lot of other
different types of numbers so those are
basic arithmetic operators oh darn it on
a spell arithmetic there we go I don't
know anyways that's all I really have to
say about arithmetic operators they're
fairly easy to understand so thank you
for watching be sure to subscribe and I
will see you in the next video yeah yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
