will be speaking about scale degrees and
chord progression this is where things
get really cool so I hope you're excited
because I am alright so we have the
scale degrees of a scale so an E major
scale such as the G Major scale g and b
c d e F sharp and G so the scale degrees
so we have the tonic which is the start
of it in this case its G we have the
super tonic which is a in this case the
second one then we have the immediate I
think it's gone which is B then we have
sub-dominant which would be C dominant
which would be D and then we have sub
median I don't know where to write this
it's right up here I guess whatever sub
Mediate which would be e then we have
the sub tonic I think it's called which
would be F sharp is sometimes known as
the leading tone or the sub tonic now
we're going to call this the leading
tone it can be the sub tonic in certain
scales but for the scale it is the
leading tone because it leads us back to
the next key which is G now this is all
cool and all this is a scale degrees
well these scale degrees are actually
pretty cool because we can figure out
what's called chord progression with
them and I'm going to
explain this using the G Major scale all
right so when we do chord progression
it's the idea of going from a different
scale degree and make a chord out of it
so I'll play something all right if we
are in the scale of C the tonic would be
C we can make a C chord on it help if I
jump in on it
now if we take the fifth which c d e f g
that's five also known as the dominant
so if you take the dolmen it which is g
to make a chord out of it it sounds nice
then if we go to the sixth that's an
example of chord progression but we're
going to get into that so let's start by
making a staff all right so we're going
to start on G now the key signature all
of this will be in the key of G which
has one sharp in it if you don't know
this look at your circle of fifths or
create a G major scale using whole whole
half whole whole whole half you don't
know what I'm talking about
well I'm not gonna get into that just go
to see my other Sam videos or whatever
so that would put an f-sharp
it would create for this line instead of
an F it gives us an F sharp so so now
you recreate the scales we start on G
not the scales to the chords we're
making triads so they need to be a third
apart one two three one two three I just
took him out he's already breaking so we
start on G then we go to the second a
the third oops we just basically just
climb up the scale of the G Major scale
fourth sub dominant and the fifth and
the sixth
on the seventh and then the tonic again
alright so now the scale degrees are now
turned into triads so this was the Dom
this is the tonic
this was the super tonic or mediant lead
I'm not leaving turn sorry now this is
sub dominant dominant sub media leading
tone and the tonic again now if we're to
figure out which ones have F sharps in
it well we look here F sharp so where
are s here's an F there's no notes on
the line so we have to worry about that
so this one crosses an F here's one
here's one and here's one F sharps so
just keep that in mind that these will
be affected from the key signature now
let's try and figure out which ones are
major minor diminished or augmented or
yeah that's it none of them are 7th
chords so we have G to B to D G B D G to
B one two three four that is a major
third which is the start of a major
triad B to D one two three
so this is a major triad because that
was a minor third to make a major triad
to record it's a major third plus the
minor third if you don't remember so
this one is a major G major so we're
just going to represent it with a
capital F or a major
what about the next one well F a CEO of
a this consists of AC e 8 a 1 2 3 C 1 2
3 4 so 3 4 that's minor plus major which
is the making of a minor chord not a
major chord say a major minor this one
has an f-sharp in it so we have to
remember them
we're starting on B this is a B chord 1
2 3 which is in we need a D 1 2 3 4 so
the making is 3 plus 4 or a minor chord
hopefully you can see the song good
let's try the next one that starts on F
a C so let's see see yes see ha ha 1 2 3
4 2 ke 1 2 3 4 G which is how what this
is written in c e g so this is a major
chord 4 plus 3 is major next one has an
F sharp which will be ad chord D 1 2 3 4
F sharp remember 1 2 3
so D F sharp a that is the making of a D
major chord now what about this one
which is an E chord we're starting on e
e 1 2 3 yes on G and then 1 2 3 4 so
that is a minor chord that's a minor
chord now let's try the next one F sharp
a and C
f-sharp 1 2 3 1 2 3 oh that's not major
or minor that is the minor plus a minor
which creates a diminished chord I'll
put it in red because it's different
than all the others just so you know
now the next one starts on G and we
already know the G is major because just
just because we moved it up an octave
doesn't change anything so this is Major
so this is the chord progression we will
always find when we start with a major
triad and I will be explaining this in
the next video but for now I want to
show you that when we're labeling chords
we will get what's called major minor we
label ok the scale degrees we label them
with Roman numerals remember I was
saying 1 3 4 5 and all this crap when we
label the first one with a 1 or an i cuz
this Roman numerals if you don't know
Roman numerals that's ok second one
would be to lowercase eyes the reason
it's lowercase is because it's minor
we represent lowercase with we represent
minor with lowercase same for this one
this is 3 now major capital I V which is
Roma dating rules for for V is 5 in
Roman numerals minor be so lowercase V I
eyes represent once so if we put in
before V we're subtracting so that's 4 5
minus 1 4 5 5 plus 1 6 now this we have
V by with a degree sign to represent
diminished remember that but then read
the I diminished then we have major
which is again represented as so this is
the basis of chord progression so when
you see I capital on capital
that means for the forth of the scale
and its major if this was lowercase I V
it's the fourth of the scale and its
minor so that's all I have to say for
this basic chord progression
introduction this stuff is very fun once
you get the hang of it and I encourage
you to learn this as best as you can so
pay attention subscribe to my youtube
channel follow me on Twitter and that's
all I have to say for this video so I'll
see you soon thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
