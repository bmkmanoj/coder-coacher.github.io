oracle tutorial series this video and
the upcoming videos we are going to be
discussing datatypes in much more depth
so we're going to start with char and n
jarred specifically this video will
cover char so char is short for
character this can hold a string of
characters and the thing about this is
that it's a fixed length of datatypes
that means every single string is going
to be the same size and if for any
reason we don't give enough data to fill
that whole length it will Pat it with
extra spaces so for example if we have
something like this chart in char but we
only pass in hello well hello is only
five characters that means it's going to
add five spaces for us now this key word
here char this is known as a qualifier
you can think of a qualifier as
something that describes something so
kind of like an attribute describes an
entity this qualifier describes what
this ten means specifically this is
known as a length semantics qualifier
lots of big words here especially that
one so what does semantics mean
semantics describe the meaning of
something so if you wanted to put this
in English you could say that this char
describes the meaning of the length so
the describes would be the qualifier the
meaning would be the semantics and the
lengths would obviously be the length
but if that doesn't make any sense or
you just think it's a bunch of useless
information all you got to think of is
that this char describes how we
interpret that 10 in this situation we
are saying 10 characters now if we don't
put this chart here the default is
actually byte if you want you can throw
in that byte keyword that way you can be
very specific or a better word would be
explicit so if you explicitly do
something you are putting it there even
if it's not necessarily needed you're
giving extra information
you're being very specific and what you
want but if for some reason you don't
put either one just like this you no
longer have 10 characters but you have
10 bytes and remember one character can
take
multiple bites depending on the encoding
now if the default is bite why do we
even need that bites keyword can we just
leave it out well some people like to be
very specific so people know and
additionally there is actually a default
setting so you could change the default
to char and then in this situation this
would be ten char and then if you wanted
to change it back you were throwing that
white word and then you're no longer
following the default and instead you
have ten bytes you can see how it can be
pretty complex generally what I would
recommend is just go the extra effort
and throw in that keyword regardless
even if it already is the default for
example let's say the default is byte
but you want it to be in bytes throw in
the keyword byte that way there's no
confusion in addition to always throwing
the byte there's another way you could
do it and what that would be is to just
change the default and then never use
one of these qualifiers so if you never
put something here and any other create
statements then you know all of your
database objects have used at the
default the benefit of this though is
for consistency if you have some columns
using byte length semantics and then
others using character length semantics
it's going to be very confusing
regardless of which one you decide to
use want to be sure to be consistent if
you want to change the default go ahead
and look up NL s underscore length
underscore semantics and then you can
learn how to change that and also the
downsides of changing that now last
question what values are actually
allowed in these parentheses that's what
we are going to be discussing in the
next video so be sure to subscribe click
like and as always I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
