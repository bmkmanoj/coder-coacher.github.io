going to be talking about submitting a
form so as you may have figured out from
the last video we can't actually do
anything with the content people put in
the form that will need a server-side
scripting language although we can do
everything we need to except for that so
we're going to learn as much as we
possibly can with HTML then if you want
to learn about us making forms do things
check out the next series I'm going to
make probably PHP so the trick to make a
form is first we create a submit book
and it looks like this we're going to
create a new paragraph which you don't
really have to do that just decide to
yeah yeah input type and this is going
to be a submit type value submit so
refresh now you have a submit button it
says submit that's the value so if I
change the value submit now and
subscribe okay it's a proper grammar
there we go that we got with that we
call it a code
oh shoot all right so now we have this
form with the submit now look and it
does absolutely nothing wow that's
impressive so what we need to do is
create what's called a form in HTML we
can have a form tag alright so in order
to do that the way we do it is a little
more complex but it's really not that
bad once you get the hang of it so I'll
just type it out first then you can then
I'll explain it
oh I already actually I already
accidentally had the form tag here
because I worked it out beforehand but
anyways you open a form basically open a
form and then close the form and have
all the content within the form then we
have this thing action
that is telling HTML where we want to
send our information method that's how
we want to send it this has to do with
PHP or or some other programming
language so we're just going to ignore
that for now all you have to do is put
it there action that is the page we want
to send it to well if you look now if we
submit now it goes to the same exact
page that's because we don't have
anything in here it's basically the same
thing as having a pound sign see it does
the same thing so we can make a fake
page submit okay
validate form data dot page B that's
just a page I just thought of so if we
had a PHP script we'd submit now and it
would process that data and give us the
next page but we don't have that page so
we're we can do that right now all right
so I did a little bit of modification I
actually created a little PHP script
that basically just to show you how it
works it's that it's on a local server
and I'm not going to explain how to do
this because you have to install a
server and all kinds of stuff but
basically if you just get the no page
page that's fine which makes no sense no
page page anyways this is what submit
now congratulations you have submitted
the form successfully you are now logged
in if you want to know how I did this
well it looks it looks like this I
created a PHP script that echoed which
basically just writes to the page
congratulations you have submitted the
form successfully you are now logged in
and then I ended the PHP script then I
ran this through the web browser at
localhost validate form data so forth so
that's it nothing too special
and really I just did that because I
thought it would make more sense so now
we have this form well the form is not
complete we can make it look a lot
better before
better by adding some content alright so
the first thing we're going to do is we
are going to write field set alright now
I know you probably know what this is
but just like the form we're going to
put it around the content and this is
what it will do it'll create this I
don't know why that blocks there all
right yeah all right so I made a mistake
here I forgot to end this input type so
it's still there ok to appropriately fix
this problem very simple I forgot to end
the fieldset tag because I'm an idiot
alright so there we go
sorry for that guys so we put a field
set at the top and then we end the field
set I accidentally put too so it made
two boxes within this page so that's
going to add the school box and then to
make it even cooler we can add what's
called a legend if you know anything
about maps or anything a legend tells
you what's what you're going to look for
so legend sign in so now we have a
little sign in right here which means we
can get rid of this h1 tag boom now we
have this awesome form that looks pretty
high-quality well we can still do one
more thing for performance reasons add
it add what's called a label right here
and then end it again this is for
improved performance to create a
finalized form so now it looks the same
so this is our finalized form and we'll
be adding even more content to this to
create a whole bunch of cool stuff so
this is what it would look like on a
real website you see you enter your
content enter your password submit it
and then you've submitted the form
successfully you are now logged in so
just as a quick review when creating
forms here's what you do
form tag then you create the fieldset
tag then you create the legend then you
end the legend and then you can make a
the label tax the individual label tags
and the label tags and the fieldset tags
and the form tags and obviously within
within a labels you could have the input
types which I'm just saying for a form
if you look at this refresh it we now
have this new form box which obviously
isn't going to do anything unless we put
content in it but that's pretty much it
so yeah you should memorize these terms
memorize this setup which will be still
working with this in future videos so
don't worry about having to memorize it
right the second but I do recommend
learning this setup so that's all if you

everything and see ya wrap</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
