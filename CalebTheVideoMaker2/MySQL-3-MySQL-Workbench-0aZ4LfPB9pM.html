maker - that's my new official theme
song so this is where we left off in the
command-line but I don't really want to
use the command line so we're going to
learn a new tool called MySQL workbench
so to open that you need to go to your
Start menu and I know mine's cut off a
little bit but that's okay and you can
just search workbench now when you open
this there's already something listed
here and this is the default connection
your localhost that's exactly what we
want to use so it's nice that it already
has that there for us but we can add
connections clicking this little plus
button and you can type in all the
information you want but for us we're
going to go with this localhost so
double click that and it's going to bug
us for a password now this is the
password that you gave when you install
MySQL if you have no clue what I'm
talking about
go watch the previous video and then I'm
going to click Save password involved
you know because I want to make sure I'm
using the most powerful account and have
the password saved so that anyone can go
in and delete my stuff no but in all
reality this is a development
environment I don't really want to have
to worry about forgetting my password
and all that junk so let's click OK and
wallah it opens up our database server
so just like in the command prompt we
can type in SQL we can do that here so
we could say select 5 times 5 and then
execute it
and you can see it returns 25 so that's
how you run SQL commands inside a MySQL
workbench there's a lot of stuff you can
do to customize the view here for
example there's these buttons over here
you can press and as you can see that
makes things happen and you can hide
stuff there's also this button up here
view and you can go to panels and
basically do the same thing I'm going to
enable all of those just so we can see
everything and if you look down here
over on the left you can see here our
our schemas so it's kind of hard to see
so we have to drag this down a little
bit but essentially this is going to be
our databases so here is a database and
it has these tables in it so when we
create a new database it'll come down
here
one interesting thing you can do is
press this little button here and
essentially what that's going to do is
hide all of this other junk so let's
click that and you can see it's all gone
boom and if you need to see it again you
can click it again
there you go also when you click that
you can go down here and click this
button to get to the other tabs so for
example we can click this button here
and it will bring back the schemas
that's kind of useful because a lot of
this jump I don't really care about
right now so I'm going to maximize that
and just keep it like that
now if you need to go back to the home
page that opened when we first started
you can go up here and click this little
house and there you go
MySQL workbench is a very popular
program for designing databases so to do
that you can go down here to the model
section and click plus or you can dork
around with the one they already have on
there one thing that might come in
useful for you is this MySQL utilities
thing I never actually installed that
but you can download that that will give
you some extra stuff you can do with
MySQL but we're not going to need that
for now so I'm not going to download
that see you guys that is a very rough
intro to MySQL workbench now I actually
have an entire video over MySQL
workbench that I went into detail on how
to do different things and design
databases and you can watch that if you
want I'll just check it out oh Claire
sorry guys there's a stalker on the
loose anyways you can check that out if
you want or you can just go through the
series and we'll be covering some of
that information in this series so
thanks guys
hopefully this worked out for you if you
have any comments please leave them
below click like if this video is
helpful and as always I will see you in
the next video be sure to subscribe oh
it's still recording</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
