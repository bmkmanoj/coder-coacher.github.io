second HTML CSS tutorial series so in
the last video I showed you that you
could use word wrapping I showed you how
to install notepad plus plus but I
realized that this file is actually a
file that came with it it wasn't just a
new file so if you want that content
back you can go to edit undo and click
that a million times or you can just
press ctrl Z and hold that down that's
if you want to get your old content back
although I mean it doesn't really matter
so I'm just going to exile it no I don't
want I want to open a new one first so
I'm gonna save it by clicking this
little blue button here as you can see
it says save then we can do there's some
extra files here and I'm gonna go turn
my close the door real quick because
there's a bunch of noise coming up all
right I'm back so what you can do if you
look here there's another button here we
can figure out what it does you hover
over it make sure you have the window
selected so try clicking on it hover
over it says new we can click that and a
new window pops up and see these little
tabs here to switch between different
programs that we're making what we can
do is go to file save as and then we can
do I'm gonna save it to the desktop so
on the left or wherever you want
find your desktop and this is where I'm
going to save it what am I going to say
save it as I'm going to put it as index
dot HTML
that just means our websites home page
and I'm just going to use that for our
website now save as type it is normal
text file because I put the extension
here that says dot HTML it should work
fine but just just in case we can just
put index and then find HTML or
hypertext markup language here and that
will save the file as index.html so now
this is our official first HTML file I'm
going to X out of our changelog and what
we can do now is start typing an HTML
program well - how do we run this
program
well we actually open it
so we as you can see we saved it here on
our desktop index it's opened with a web
browser such as Google Chrome Firefox
Internet Explorer those are known as web
browsers so what you can do is you can
click it and it should come up with a
web browser like this if it doesn't
don't freak out it's okay right click it
and click open with I'm sorry not I
click I show I hovered ever share with
click open with hover over open with I
mean choose default program you can look
in the recommended programs or you can
go to other programs look from there if
you still can't find it go to browse and
then you can go and find your web
browser so I mean I don't know where the
lines at let's look then when go to
Chrome application and then click chrome
so that is now the default program which
it already was so I didn't really change
anything so yeah now we have our our
first HTML program and you can see right
here and the file location its file
forward slash forward slash forward
slash G yours is probably C but doesn't
matter users Caleb desktop index.html
that is how we oh that's how we can find
our file if you ever get lost or you
don't know where it's at but you have
open this is where it's located but we
know it's at because we just saved it to
the desktop so we have two files here
shortcut to notepad plus plus index HTML
so our web browser is a tool that will
take our HTML code interpret it and
display it to people viewing the website
so we want to create content but we need
to tell the web browser that we are
creating HTML content that fits a
certain standard of some sort so how you
can do this you make this little carrot
here you can zoom in here so you can see
a lot better exclamation mark
which is the one doctype HTML this is
just telling the web browser that we're
about to give you some HTML you can
press ENTER to go to the second line and
you can you can skip lines if you want
it doesn't really matter now what we do
is we store our HTML code that is how we
start HTML code and then we fit all we
have all of our content here so our
content goes here and then we can close
our HTML so here's how you open HTML if
we start from the beginning first thing
we do save it as an HTML file tell the
browser we're about to give some HTML
code open our HTML code put our content
close our HTML code so that's that's our
very first HTML program so if you want
to be like every other programmer in the
world and make your program I guess your
website or whatever you want to think of
it as if you wanted to say hello world
you can go right ahead which I can't
even spell yeah you'll learn quickly I'm
really bad at spelling like seriously I
look up almost every word I spell ever
so you can say hello world but I'm
rebellious so I'm gonna make it
something else hello my name is Caleb be
sure to check out my video and then I
put a little smiley face now well I
already saved it but if you don't save
it and you try to refresh this nothing's
going to happen so for example I mean
let me delete this real quick save it so
as you can see my stuff is here but when
I when i refresh my page over here
nothing shows up now there's a way to
fix this we go to on notepad plus plus
we go to file scroll down to save which
is ctrl s for a shortcut or we can click
this button up here which it already
saved so we came from do it again so
yeah that's how you save the file and
just say oh it's still not
that's okay just click this little
refresh button at the top or on the side
of your page somewhere refresh so now
this content shows up now when I go
through the series oftentimes I will
save my file by pressing ctrl holding it
pressing s and then I'll go to my web
browser and press f5 that's above the
five button just has an F with it that
refreshes the browser to load new
content from the website you can also
click up here and then press Enter
that will also refresh the page so yeah
that's a lot of content oh I almost
dropped my microphone out of it bad now
when we're creating HTML pages we
usually actually have a few more things
in this document we have what's known as
a head and then we close the head I'm
just going to fleet this for now then we
have the body and then we close the body
so you can have it like this or you can
have it like this so here is what a
typical HTML starting template will look
like the very absolute minimum looks
something like this then if we want to
add more well what are these exactly
where do we put what what I don't know
where to type well let's start from the
beginning these are known as tags so we
have an HTML tag a head tag a body tag
we also have a closing head tag at
closing body tag and a closing HTML tag
so we will use a lot of tags when using
HTML almost everything has a tag body
this is where we put content so I just
saved it by pressing ctrl s make sure
you always save it or not that no
changes will be visible i refresh it
pressing f5 now just a side note some
keywords have a F mode button by
pressing it it disables all F keys so if
your f keys aren't working you can
refresh it or you can try and find
that button or figure out why your f
buttons are not working so f5 refreshes
it we see content head that is where we
can post extra information for example
we can give this page a title if you
look here closely it says index.html at
the top on the tab well we can actually
give a new one by putting a title tag
and ending the title tag within these
tags we can give it a new title first
HTML page refresh save the save the file
refresh and now you can see it's its
first HTML page rather than index.html
which looks a lot better so you can also
put in here other stuff like well I kind
of again just depends on what you want
you can put a a style sheet for CSS
which if you don't know what that is
don't worry about it but it will look
something like this style sheet and then
type and so forth I'm not going to
finish it because I'm just showing for
example you may also see a script tag
which looks something like this and that
is where you can find JavaScript files
if you don't know where that's at if you
don't know what that is don't worry
about it it's just another element of
web development but if you don't know
what it's about
don't worry about it so that is
everything I'm going to be explaining in
this video sorry if I'm going too slow
trying to make this a beginners course
so that's everything see you in the next
video which will be over some new tags
as well as comments and so forth I think
so I'll see you then my name is Caleb
