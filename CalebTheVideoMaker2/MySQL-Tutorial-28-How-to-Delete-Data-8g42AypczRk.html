little different but it's still pretty
similar so we've been creating all this
data and altering data now I'm going to
teach you about deleting data so I mean
besides just delete button we're gonna
SQL this up so basically here's how you
do it key we'd from members
so let me capitalize this because this
is SQL and we like to capitalize the SQL
my apologies for messing that up but let
me read this this is simple you say the
type of command a delete command where
are we deleting it from from members so
syntax is just delete from table to
table name pretty simple so what are you
going to delete we're going to delete
the columns where the last name is equal
to curry because I don't like him he's a
weirdo so we say leaf remembers lat we
have a where clause so where last name
is equal to Caleb so don't shoot very
sweet so actually let's do some a little
differently let me see what we have the
open numbers up here so let's see we
have last name John so we're going to
delete these guys or the whoa yeah so
we're going to delete we're lastname
equals John click go
yes two rows deleted so you can see two
people have this the last name John this
guy in this guy Lennon John and Jim John
sweet so that's how you do that now
basically you can alter the where clause
is what to do who to you it allows them
to know what people to delete or gross
so for example we can say all this ideas
of like I don't like these gold members
they're really they're weird
I'm gonna get rid of them so we can just
say we're membership status pretty
simple actually could go o for us we did
there guys like my old database
Byam now we just got Caleb Caray and Yao
Ming so that's how you do delete and now
while I'm at it might as well just
completely drop everything so SQL this
is new type man drop so drop table and
then the table name members click go yes
and oh we just lost everything we have
well now off to create all that again so
hopefully that was worth it
but basically what I was trying to say I
would show you some more but I just
deleted everything that's okay you can
choose what you want to delete so if you
need to get certain people out of your
database you can use a where clause to
make things better now you can also use
a limit so let's say you only want to
delete like us I can just make sure you
don't accidentally do something wrong
and say delete everything and you just
want to delete one person like the
person with the ID six then you could
say limit one this kind of is like a
safety like a seatbelt so you don't
accidentally delete and screw things up
like I just did so I know that was a
drop command but it so I'm basically you
use a where Clause to say what you want
to delete and then you can use a limit
to say how many you want to tweet so
hopefully that was helpful
kind of short and I just destroyed my
database but it's okay so it was all
worth it because I love you so bye and
subscribe thanks this video is so
