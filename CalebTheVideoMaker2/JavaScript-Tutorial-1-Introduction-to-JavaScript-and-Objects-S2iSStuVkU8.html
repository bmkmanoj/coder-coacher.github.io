those of you who know me and you're if
you're wondering I will be getting back
to my PHP tutorials once I get some more
batteries for my camera but until then
let's go for JavaScript all right so
what is javascript javascript is an
object-oriented scripting language it's
not Java so if you've worked with Java
or if seen Java javascript is not Java
to make that clear right now don't
forget that here's a few things you
should know before you start writing
scripts all right so it's a scripting
language basically that means a program
takes our code and runs it JavaScript
for these tutorials we will be running
it through a web browser so for example
Google Chrome you can take your Java
scripts JavaScript scripts and run them
through Google Chrome or Firefox or
Internet Explorer javascript is mainly
used for a web development programming
language it contrasts with a compiled
language which takes the code and
creates an executable file such as C for
an for a compiled language all you have
to do is like click the icon for example
and it will run the program
that you aren't going to need a program
to take our code and run it it just
compiles itself so object-oriented if
you don't know much about objects or
object oriented programming that's ok
just to get this off just to say this
for those of you who do know this is a
prototype based rather than class-based
in a class-based language you create
classes and do not create objects I mean
sorry and create objects as instances of
those classes so basically in JavaScript
we don't do this
objects are created pretty much
automatically and works a different way
than normal object oriented programming
languages so if you don't know what that
means just ignore it we'll get into that
later so to start off we have variables
a variable is used to store a temporary
value so that means it can change
throughout the program
so we have the if we look here we have
variable color so right here this is the
name of our variable we can change the
name if we want so we could make this
clouds or Caleb basically we can name
this whatever we wish that is the name
of our variable and then we assign a
value this is the assignment operator or
an equals sign we'll get into that in
future videos and we're going to assign
it the value blue the string blue in
quotation single quotation marks and
then we end the entire line with a
semicolon sorry and we may change this
again later so for example here we
changed color to equal green and now has
a different value
so each everything in JavaScript is an
object so we have the variable color
this is the name and we're assigning it
the value purple this variable is an
object of type string that means this is
a string and a string is just a sequence
of characters enclosed within quotation
marks they can be single quotes or
sometimes double quotes there are many
object types string is just one of them
objects well each object consists of
methods and properties methods and
properties together are known as the
members of the object so everything
within an object or object members so we
can look at this little picture here yes
I did draw that in paint because I'm pro
but that's besides point so this entire
object everything within the object is
known as the members we have methods and
only have properties and we'll be
getting into what each one of these are
so first let's look at properties if we
create an object we have a variable
named food and we assign it the value
the string beef so it's an object of
type string
now a property it's a value that is
defined when an object is created so we
can access these properties we can
access a property using object notation
basically that is where we use a little
period and then we put the property name
you may also hear this known as dot
notation so dot length or length this is
known as a property and this specific
property does something this property
will tell us how many characters are in
the value of the variable food so let's
look fou this is our variable name and
it has a value beef the string beef will
each one of these is a character whoops
yeah so we have four characters the
value of food is beef a string beef has
four characters therefore the property
food dot length gives us the value for
that's what this property does the
property length figures out how many
characters is within the string and
returns that value the methods on the
other hand well if you know about
procedural programming languages you may
hear of functions but for now we'll
lists we'll look at these as methods
because we're in object-oriented
programming so if you don't know what
that means don't worry about it if you
remember methods are also members of the
object if we look here at this script I
mean slide there's methods and
properties we already looked at
properties now we're going to look at
methods so methods take the value of the
variable and do something with it so
once again methods are very similar to
functions in a procedural programming
language but that's not an
object-oriented programming language and
when we not getting into that in this
video all right so to access a method
it's very similar you put a period and
then the method name with two
parenthesis opening and closing
so it's very similar to accessing a
property the only difference is it ends
with this right here so what's the
difference a property's value is defined
and does not change unless the value of
the variable changes and method takes
the value of a variable and does
something with it
so basically property has a value a
method does something with the variables
value food dot length is going to give
us for where a food to uppercase which
is a method it's going to take the value
beef and put all the characters to
uppercase giving us back the value beef
in all capital letters so if we want to
learn a bit more about methods a typical
method does not change the value of the
variable it just gives us a new value so
food to uppercase will give us the value
beef if we then look at the value of
food it will still be beef and lowercase
as you can see there's a difference here
this is uppercase this is lowercase to
uppercase is going to give us the value
beef and all capital letters but it's
not going to change the original value
of the variable so for example variable
food is assigned beef variable food and
all capital letters we can assign food
to uppercase so this is going to take
this value uppercase it and then assign
it to the variable food with all capital
letters
so obviously JavaScript is case
sensitive so we can also change the
original value of a method but it's a
little more complex so basically we
assign a value to a variable food and
then we can reassign the value food to
uppercase so this this right here is
going to give us beef and all capital
letters of course and then that's going
to assign it back to the original
variable so that's just the basics of
JavaScript and some other stuff about
object-oriented programming and
JavaScript
so hopefully that was helpful and I will
see you in the next video thank you and
