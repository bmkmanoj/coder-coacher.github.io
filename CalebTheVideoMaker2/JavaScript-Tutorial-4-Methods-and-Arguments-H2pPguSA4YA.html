fourth JavaScript tutorial so if
everything's going well that's great but
if you're kind of confused feel free to
leave me a comment and tell me how bad
of a teacher I am but if everything is
going good then continue so methods also
known as functions well what what are
they they take a value do something with
it and return a new value so earlier we
had the example got to find somewhere to
type to upper case which took the
original lower cased value or whatever
cased value and turn them all to upper
case we always have these parentheses
after methods so let me illustrate this
in an awesome high quality painting I'm
going to make right now live this is
live guys this is it this isn't planned
this is live art all right so let me
illustrate here we have this value okay
and then we have this awesome method and
then we have a variable such as ok so
now we have this variable with the name
name pretty cool name and now we also
have the name Caleb which is assigned to
the variable so the variable has a value
of Caleb the variable name is name makes
sense
hopefully it's kind of simple well the
reason we have var here is because we're
defining the variable right now we
haven't used it before so we need to
define it so to define a variable we say
var and we say the variable name so this
value is right here Caleb and this is
the method
you case this method is going to take
the value put it through any method and
it's going to submit out a brand new
improved elite version of the original
value so now we have Caleb and all
uppercase letters so this is what this
function does takes the value puts it
through this little magical tunnel thing
and submits or returns a new value well
this value is just kind of here on its
own it doesn't really do anything
because we haven't told it to do
anything it's just kind of floating here
by itself well we can assign this to a
new variable or do something with it so
for example we can free a sign to name
like this we can say name is now equal
to name to upper case and what this is
going to do basically this last part
right here this represents the final
value over here it is going to reassign
it to the value to the variable name or
we can assign it to a new variable so we
could say for X is equal to name to
uppercase like this so that's an example
of what a method does now that we just
wasted like three and a half minutes we
can finally look at the power point so a
lot of is going to be repeating myself
but that's okay methods are functions of
object-oriented programming javascript
is an object-oriented programming
language everything essentially
everything we make in JavaScript is an
object so methods come after an object
in using what's known as dot notation or
object notation
either one so basically we have the
object name and then we have a little
period and then we have the methods name
with parentheses at the end
so to help remember to think of methods
as an action they do something so let's
define an object here we have a variable
with the name food and we assigned at
the value pizza food is an object of
type string as you can see if an object
because we defined it using the vault so
basically we defined it here and it has
a value that is a string because it's in
quotation marks so because this is an
object of type string it has some
predefined methods so in JavaScript we
can actually make our own functions to
be used as methods and as well as ones
that are predefined when you create
something of type string for example
it's going to have some methods as like
to uppercase which is the one we just
used so I couldn't think of a title here
here we have food to uppercase because
to uppercase is a method it will take
the value of food and do something with
it
in this case it would take the value
pizza which is what we assigned if we
look here we assign the variable food
the value pizza and it will return pizza
and all capital letters so what do we do
with the return value there's a
multitude of things we can do with the
return value for example this value can
be assigned to the original variable or
assigned to a new one so here we we
defined the variable food gave it the
value pizza now we're overriding the
original value and and replacing it with
food to uppercase so basically it's
going to take this value upper case it
and reassign it to the variable food
this right here is known as a comment in
JavaScript JavaScript will ignore this
and it the code will still work or we
can take this value and assign it to a
new variable such as food in all capital
letters which is different than food
lokah lowercase letters we can assign it
food to uppercase so both of these are
essentially two two things we can do
with the return value some methods have
what's known as an argument sometimes we
can provide an extra value or more to
the method these are known as arguments
they go within these parentheses I can't
believe I forgot what those are called
for a second
for example the method called cat takes
the original string and adds something
to it so we have the name Caleb we can
use the method concat and we can add on
the videomaker to the string the
videomaker - so it's going to take these
two strings and it's going to combine
them into one like this and we can just
like that boom something like that you
get what I'm saying I'm gonna go back
probably just confused there but this
does not change the original value of
name though as we saw in our picture it
just returns the value and we have to do
something with it so let's see this in
action let's start programming some
JavaScript ah yeah so here we have you
can just ignore my extra code I have
some junk in here but basically we have
a HTML document we have the head body
and then we have a form but you don't
worry about that and then we have a no
script in case the person doesn't have
JavaScript and then we also have a
script tag at the very end of the body
before the body is closed sometimes we
will put JavaScript in the head of the
JavaScript page but for this case it
doesn't really matter and it's dependent
on what you want to do with the
JavaScript so right now we're just going
to put it at the bottom before the body
closing tag so this is what our page
looks like over here and if we look at
our office sorry I forgot to save my
clear JavaScript all right so what we
can do so we can have a variable
so here we have a variable with the name
name and has the value Caleb now we can
reassign this and then we save it
oh and obviously it doesn't it's not
going to do anything with the value yet
because we just have variables to see
what they are we can use what's known as
an alert and we can alert the variable
name so now it's Caleb and all capital
letters if we put the alert here
very fresh make sure you save it each
time it's going to be just Caleb with
the capital C and then basically here's
where we're at in the code gives us a
little pause now it's going to reassign
the variable name to Caleb and all could
uppercase letters and then boom I got
Caleb and all uppercase letters so
that's how that works
now let's take a look at the concat
method so we can have let's leave those
alerts there
so within concat I could say so the
First Alert is going to give us Caleb
with a capital C the second alert should
give us Caleb the video maker to read to
save whoopsies alright I messed
something up so let's see alright
obviously the problem here is I'm using
a single quotation mark and closing it
with a double quotation mark this is not
going to work in JavaScript because you
have to use both of the same kinds so I
fixed that and then refresh first first
ones correct second one is correct okay
so now let's continue on with our
PowerPoint each value passed to a method
is known as an argument in some methods
we can use more than one argument so
contact is one of those that can take
multiple arguments as you can see here
we have four and we can use more than
that if we wished but now the value of
full-name right here is going to be
caleb the video maker - we get the same
result just with more arguments that's
just probably a bad example but that's
just an example of how we can use
multiple arguments arguments can also be
variables so for example we have first
name which is equal to Caleb last name
which is assigned curry not they're not
necessarily equal they're assigned so
full name is first-name where we add on
a space and the last name the reason we
have a space is because if we didn't we
would just get Caleb curry without a
space so adding that extra space in is
going to give us this and to do that we
just have single quotes to enclose a
string that has just a space in it and
then to separate this first argument we
have a comma and then a space just
because I spa after comas that's just
normal and then we have the second
argument which is last name or curry
so there's a multitude of methods that
we haven't covered yet there are also
methods that that will do things with
numbers such as to fixed which will take
a number so here we have a variable
money which is equal to thirty four
point six three three four four three
two fixed and then we put a two which is
our first argument it's going to cut us
down to two decimal places so now we get
34 63 which is the appropriate way to
present money in America probably
everywhere but I don't know we have not
talked much about the number data type
this is only an example and what I mean
by that is basically if you look here
this is not enclosed within quotation
marks because if I had quote quotation
marks then it's a string not a number
which there is actually a difference
here but that's pretty much all I have
to say for this video hopefully that was
helpful and if you liked it be sure to
subscribe cuz that's what's awesome and
if you subscribe you'll be like super
awesome so yeah share with all your
friends all your programming nerd
friends if you have any hopefully you do
see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
