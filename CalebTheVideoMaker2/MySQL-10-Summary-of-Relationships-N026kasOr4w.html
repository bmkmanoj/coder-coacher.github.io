tutorial series my name is Caleb from
Caleb the video maker - and in this
video we are going to be summarizing our
discussion on relationships now I'm not
going to do a whole lot of drawing just
because I wanted to talk about it I want
you to understand conceptually what you
need to do when you have one of these
three relationships and you will always
have one of these three relationships
when you're storing data in a database
if you don't remember all the specific
details that's okay you can always come
back to these videos and watch it but I
want you to think through this try to
memorize the content of this video
because I'm not going to give you any
specifics this is going to be a rough
overview and a rough summary so the very
first one we talked about was a
one-to-one relationship this is an
attribute that describes an entity and
you can just store it in the same table
you don't have to create a whole nother
table for it you can though if you want
if you want that separation for some
reason for example if you want some data
of the user stored in a different table
that's fine the only thing you're going
to need to remember is to mark the
foreign key as unique that's because we
don't want to have multiple entries
relating back to one entity that would
break the rules of one-to-one and that
is actually how you set up a one-to-many
relationship in a one-to-many
relationship you can store as many rows
as you want referencing back to a single
entity and that foreign key is not going
to be labeled unique the parent table
that's the table being referenced
doesn't need to know about this other
table you don't have to put any foreign
keys in that table to that table that
other table doesn't exist it's just
alone by itself but that table that
references it knows of the parent table
so the foreign keys reference the table
but there's nothing in the other table
to reference it back there is a layer of
separation and you can do that to
separate one-to-one relationships like
that or you can do it to make
one-to-many relationships now the third
option is many to many relationships we
actually can't store these in databases
very easily so the way we do it is to
break it up into two one-to-many
relationships in this situation you are
going to need three tables one to store
one entity one to store the other entity
and then an intermediary table to kind
of break that many-to-many tension but
Queen the two tables so kind of think of
like the two tables fighting because
they're both trying to reference each
other and they want to be the the one
imagine I'm just kind of trying to
reference each other and one wants to be
in the lead or something like that
something to imagine conflict and then
this intermediary table steps in cuts
that tension in half and separates the
two entities and fixes all the problems
in that situation you are going to have
one too many relationship facing this
way and a one to many relationship
facing this way now inside of that
intermediary table the combination of
the two IDs or the foreign keys are
going to be unique that means the entity
over here can be in there multiple times
and the entity over here can be under
multiple times but not the combination
at the same time multiple times that's
because it's an association if you
associate a row from over here and a row
from over here they're already
associated you don't need to associate
them multiple times that would not make
sense you can actually use the
combination of the two IDs as the
primary key so in summary one-to-one is
just one table one-to-many is two tables
and many-to-many is three tables
