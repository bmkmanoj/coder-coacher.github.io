this MySQL stored routine series and my
dogs over here making a bunch of noise
so I apologize if you hear them eat and
some food or else anyways the way in
this series is kind of going to work is
I'm going to introduce topics and not
exhaust all the details of that topic
this isn't supposed to be designed like
an in-depth Advanced Course the reason
being is I want you to get the rough
overview so that way you can look at the
big picture
rather than getting lost in all the
details and not really understanding why
to begin we're going to start with the
topic of variables and just the word
probably make some you cringe because it
brings back memories of math class in
high school
I think math can be fun if it was taught
right which it probably wasn't so I'm
gonna try and teach it right and this
video is going to look at variables from
a mathematic standpoint what is a
variable
well it's something that holds data X
everybody knows X it's basically a
variable to store some number or some
formula so then if you do to X whatever
X is you multiply it by 2 it basically
allows you to simplify your math problem
so for example X could equal 5 and then
you could either do 2x or you could do 2
5 and these are essentially the same
thing
so wherever X is you can basically take
that data and replace X now you might be
wondering what the heck is the point of
this X here why don't you just put the 5
there and I know that's a very valid
point and that's why a lot of people
don't understand variables when it comes
to math you could put it in line like
that every single time but what if X is
something like 5 squared times 42
divided by 32 well you could take all
that and put it in for X but this is
much simpler
it looks more appealing to the eyes
sometimes we use variables simply for
the sake of making things easier to read
so one use for variables is simplicity
the second reason is to store unknown
data so what do I mean unknown data well
it's not all of the time you can type in
the data in line and when I say in line
might be essentially what I wrote
earlier two times five where instead of
writing X you put the data in the line
and whatever you're writing for example
if we're working with a database we
might take a value from the database and
assign it to a variable to use later if
we wanted to hard-code that in and put
it in line we'd have to know what that
data value is up front and sometimes
that's just not reasonable let's say we
have a classroom and we need to
calculate who's gonna pass and who's
gonna fail the grades over so it's not
like we have to predict the future
everyone already has their grades in all
we have to do is take all the people who
passed a passed a certain class or
whatever so we might have a score that's
considered passing so let's say 66 is
considered passing we could store this
in a variable so we could call it X but
just to make it more simple and more
readable we can name it passing now in
our SQL we could do something like
select then you could say something like
all of the students first and last names
and then you can put a where clause then
all you got to do is take the column for
their grade probably named grade and do
something like greater than or equal to
66 and you might be wondering what's the
point of this variable well we're
actually not using it here we could very
well just put passing here so what's the
benefit of putting pass in here instead
of 66 why not just put 66 in here well
this is a very simple example
in some situations it might be about
something else and this is some kind of
huge algorithm and we don't want to put
it in line in our SQL because it makes
it sloppy another thing if you come back
three years later and you read this you
know exactly what the heck it's talking
about because if you read it in English
it's you're selecting everything where
the grade is equal or greater than
passing but if you just put 66 in here
and you don't have this up here you
might come back and be like I know I'm
selecting something but I don't really
know what and I don't remember what the
significance of this number is that's an
example of simplicity we're assigning
useful names to data and then we can use
that name in place of directly using
that data so instead of using 66 we
should definitely use passing so that's
kind of summary of the start of
variables in the next video I'm going to
be giving you the syntax like I said
this is kind of just from a math
perspective next video we'll get the
syntax on how you declare variables and
give them values so we'll see you then
and catch you there I already said that
piece do you have something like that's
getting my light just fell yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
