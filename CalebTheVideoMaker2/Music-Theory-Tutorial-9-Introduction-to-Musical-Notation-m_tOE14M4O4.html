over music theory I hope you've been
taking notes notes oh man that was good
one this video is going to be going over
musical notation and basically that is a
way to write down your music for future
reference
now we typically can write things on
five line staff we have a treble clef or
whatever we give the specific pitches in
time so we have these measures we have
168 beats per minute and there's 63
measures and then we have the final note
and boom we're done
oh well that'd be part of the 63 and
then sometimes we're gonna have repeats
which will bring us back to this we can
have sections so play this one twice and
play this one three times and then up
that allows us to write our music out
although there are multiple different
forms of musical notation for example if
you play guitar or pretty much any
instrument you've probably heard of tabs
or tablature which allows us to place so
we can say like these are the six
strings of the guitar place this note
and yeah you get the point it's off it's
a way of representing the certain
fingerings for certain instruments
rather than writing it out of paper on a
staff five long thing and making them
figure it out themselves this video is
going to be going over musical notation
and basically that is a way to write
down your music for future reference
now we typically can write things on
five line staff we have a treble clef or
whatever we give the specific pitches in
time so we have these measures we have
168 beats per minute
and there are 63 measures and then we
have the final note and bow we're done
oh well that'd be part of the 63 and
then sometimes we're gonna have repeats
which will bring us back to this we can

rather than writing it out of paper on a
staff five long thing and making them
figure it out themselves now when we're
going into the whole notation concept
it's basically a way to differentiate
between different notes and chords and
all this stuff so we have a couple
concepts as I've showed you earlier we
can have c4 and if you don't remember
you can see for yourself
where to go oh man oh man
but anyways oh man that was a good one
so we can represent different pitches
like that then we can also have concepts
like C dot or C which we'll get into
that in the next couple videos there's
different ways to represent different
pitches and there's sometimes a way to
represent time and if you remember time
was a very important concept of music to
keep everybody following and consistent
tempo or beat and uh
this will allow us to place these
certain notes within time although for
common songs that everybody knows the
melody - let me think of an example mary
had a little lamb like I I played
earlier that or yeah
so that is a common melody that
everybody typically knows so if I write
out the specific pitches I could say
what is it other ways I could say e d c
d e e d D D si si si si
so now with this we can look at this
okay play an e followed by D followed by
C followed by default by de DDD's whoops
that's alright ee or some people play
or something I don't know but they don't
always play the and now you can actually
take this and I'll show you something
really cool we're gonna take these
pitches say let's say E is 6 D is 5 and
C is 4 we can actually play this on
telephone
that's close enough
hits point so that's an example of pitch
notation by knowing these we can figure
out how to play the melody same for
harmony I could say play Cee and G
together and then we do that oh oh
there we go
stupid tablet those are all examples of
notation musical notation how to write
out music and allow other people have
figured out or to memorize it and that's
all for now and in the next video I will
be going into a specific example of this
