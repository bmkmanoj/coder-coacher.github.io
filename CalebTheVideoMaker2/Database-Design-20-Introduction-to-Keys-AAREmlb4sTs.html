video we're going to be talking about
keys so a key is not something you use
to unlock a door keys and database are
something else a key keeps everything
unique basically that's that's the
easiest way to remember what a key is so
when you think in a database it we kind
of structure things and tables so I'm
going to kind of do that we do we do
that we do do that ha ha ha anyways if
we have a table here we have the columns
which are the attributes of each thing
so like let's make it a user account
table because that's always the easiest
example okay we've got user so that's
the title of the table now each
individual row within this table is
going to be a new user each column is
going to be a thing about the users so
the columns can be user name a first
name last name password and email just
for an example and you can really put
whatever you really want in there well a
key is something that is going to
separate this row from the rest of the
rows so in this example think of the
things that could be duplicated think of
all the possible values that you could
put within one of these columns and
think is it possible to duplicate it in
your application I mean yeah it's
possible to duplicate it if you allow it
to be duplicated but what naturally
should not be duplicated so typically
when you sign up for a website or a a
game or something they'll ask for your
Gmail right now when you sign up you put
your email and you typically have to go
to your email
and click like confirmation or something
to register your email so they know that
it's a genuine email account basically
just so they can have your email and
they can send you emails and stuff but
yeah that is an example of what we could
use as a key that's because every single
row within this kabah table should have
a separate email some websites allow you
to use the same email more than once if
that's the case then this would not be a
good key this kind of key is known as a
natural key because it's naturally
already in our data our table we don't
have to define a new column just for the
sake of a key and we'll be getting into
more of that in upcoming videos because
doing a little bunch of videos of your
keys so you get them like really good Oh
like I'm going to go over pretty much
everything but anyways
if you make it to where only one person
can hat use a certain email and that
email can only be used by one person
well then that could be used as the key
the way that works is it basically let's
say we have emails 1 2 3 @ blah blah
blah
ABC blah blah uh XYZ blah blah blah and
these are three separate rows well this
is going to let us know which person
we're talking about and like now if
someone has the first same first name
and last name by chance let's say we
have two Caleb Curry's Caleb curry
Caleb curry we can't use the name as a
key because two people have it and it's
not it's going to confuse us because
okay do we have two people with a name
caleb curry or as one person caleb curry
in the database twice is that an error
on our part or what so we can't have the
key be in there more than once so it's
never there's a it's always unique
because i'm
so the key is always unique
he said exits it yeah hangs it alright
so what is another example of a key that
we could use in this table let's get rid
of this email let's say we're not using
the email anymore and let's say the
website allows multiple emails from
different people so like if my mom
signed up and then I wanted to sign up I
could use my mom's email so we have two
people from the same email that's an
example of some websites that allow you
to do that but not tons of websites do
that but it is a possibility
it all just depends on what you want to
do it's up to you because well I guess
it's up to thee if you're making a
database for yourself whether it's up to
you but if you're making it for someone
else then you get your their rules and
you follow them let's think of some
other ones
all right well email let's just say it's
not you password well that's really a
bad one because passwords they're not
necessarily unique because two different
accounts can have the same password and
if if you didn't allow that to where
they can have the same password you try
to put in a password for your new
account and it'd be like oh this
password is already in use then you're
like oh so then you can try that
password on other accounts and try to
hack into people so that would not be a
good database design obviously so
password that ain't gonna work because
not every password is unique first name
last name it could possibly work but
it's really bad maybe first name last
name and middle initial or middle name
but even that there's there's people
with the same first name last name and
middle name so that's first name won't
work last name won't work and the
combination of first name and last name
won't work
and yet skis can be a combination of two
columns we'll be getting into that too
what we have left is username well a
username is a generated word that is
used to represent your account it's
typically not a name or an email it's
something like Caleb 1 2 3 or whatever
you know what I'm saying so then when
people talk to you they're talking to
Kayla 1 2 3 rather than Caleb curry or
they could put the name there but some
websites use user names or some games
use user names or programs use user
names so you have a username and a
password well a username is always
unique because if you have two people
with the same username when you try to
sign in how is the database going to
know which one you're trying to sign
into you know they're you they have to
be unique so hopefully that kind of
makes sense that could be used as a key
because we could have user name table
food and then we could have dog one two
three and then five these are three
different people all the other stuff
first name last name password email they
point to that key so we have a first
name and a last name and password and an
email for the user with the username
Caleb
see that's how the key works we have a
first name last name password and email
for the person with the with the user
website we have first name last name
Pass email for the user with the name
dog one two three and then we have a
first name last name password an email
for the user with the username PI that's
kind of how the key works the other
thing is that the key should never be
changing
so the second thing ever changing now
why is this
well that's because when we create keys
we use them to kind of structure our
entire database everything points
towards the key in the last example we
had I'll just draw key for a
representation let's say this is the key
and we'll just say it's the user right
whoa every other column is part as
points back to that key so we have the
name of the person we have the password
and we know that these are pointing to
this specific person if we've got rid of
this key and that we have two people
with the name caleb with the password pi
well now are we talking about the same
person are we talking about two separate
people or what we don't really know but
now if we give it keys every key you get
that key back so this probably not close
enough all right here's our key now we
know that this Caleb points to this
specific person we could have it be the
username or you might often see numbers
like 72 the ID which we'll talk about
that too soon now if we have a separate
key like this well then that is a
different person so we could have this
guy have the username caleb is awesome
72 this got me like sexy chicks 74 sooo
I'm saying so that's kind of how the
keys work we never want them to change
because then it's kind of it's confusing
because all of these objects are part of
this key basically this key is used to
define uniqueness well if we can change
it
questions the integrity of our database
because between tables we connect things
by keys so let's say this is a user
table this is a comment table if we have
it to where we can change the key well
then this connection is you have to
update this connection all the time
now if we have 50 tables connected to
this user table I'm just going to draw
for snakes why I won't draw all 50 well
now when we update this key this key
connection so we have a comments by a
user we have sales we have friends we
have messages whatever it doesn't really
matter well then we change this key well
that means every single one of these
connections I don't have to update that
requires a lot of work from the server
make sense so we don't want them to
change because we don't want to have to
have that extra work from our database
so that's one thing unique never
changing the other thing
these are just three general rules
there's some other suggestions and stuff
and I'll get into that soon but the
other thing is never know that means
empty VAT are no value so when we have a
table and we have a key value let's say
we have a user ID this guy six this
guy's five disguise for this guy's 38 it
doesn't really matter the order and then
we have their name whatever blah blah
well we don't want it to where we can
have a blank ID and still have
information like Sally this Sally
doesn't have a key that is another thing
we do not want to do with our keys so
here are the three main rules and we'll
get into more and upcoming videos but a
key should always be unique never be
changing and it should never be M
you should not allow a row without a key
yeah that's bottle so peace out check
you out and next I mean see ya
peace out check out this video and don't
even know I was going to say there be
sure to subscribe I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
