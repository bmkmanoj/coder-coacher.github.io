to do speak about the three different
types of modes because I know they were
all just an arrangement of whole steps
and half steps but there's three types
major minor and diminished so let's go
over the major modes we had Ionian which
is basically just the major scale so of
course that's going to move major then
we had Lydian we also have mixolydian
these are the three major modes why is
that because we can get these by
altering the major scale for example the
Lydian is the same thing as a major
scale the only difference is it has a
sharp or a raised fourth so the Lydian
mode starting on C would be c d e F
sharp G a B mixolydian on the other hand
is a flat in seventh so this will become
b-flat rather than be so this has a flat
seventh so the mixolydian mode of C is
right here now for the minor modes we
have you lien this is the same as a
natural minor scale we also have Dorian
and then we also have Phrygian so the
Dorian applies to a minor scale because
what it does is it's a natural minor
with a sharp sixth the Phrygian on the
other hand is a flatted second so we're
just altering the minor scale so let's
create AC minor scale we got C D E flat
G a flat and C flat and then Nazi flat
should be B flat duh and then see now if
we were to have a Dorian mode in the NC
we would sharp the sixth one two three
four five six so this would become be
sharp no be natural because we're only
raising it a half step I'm just using
the term sharp the sixth to mean to
raise it half step that doesn't mean to
put a sharp sign so I guess it would be
more appropriate for me to say raise it
a half step although when you see this
this is telling you to raise it one half
step so for the Phrygian the way to
create a AC Phrygian mode scale or
pattern would turn this back to the
natural minor so the B flat and we flat
the second so this will be C D flat
hopefully that makes sense all this is
doing is altering the minor scale
remember the minor scale just takes a
major scale lowers the 3rd 6th and the
7th that's why these have flats rather
than natural notes the last group of
modes we have is the diminished group
there's actually only one sees mode
within this so the only mode within the
diminished group is the LA Korean so how
does this me well it has a flat and
third it's taking it from the minor
scale it flattens the third and the
fifth so what we end up is with and
let's create a c-major scale first and
i'll show you what i mean c d e f g a b
to turn this into a minor we make a flat
chief sorry not G flat a flat B flat now
we lower the third and we also lower the
fifth so here are our lower notes this
interval right here is a minor third and
this
nerville becomes a diminished fifth
which is the makeup of a diminished
triad this is conveniently the makeup of
a C diminished triad so yeah that is the
lock green mode and it's diminished so
those are the three groups of modes in
the next video I'll be arranging these
in the method in in an order that
follows the circle of fifths this will
really block everything together and
make you understand the difference
between these modes so I'll see you then
