about figuring out triads it's very
similar to what we just did where we
created triads but now you're giving it
triad and you have to figure out what it
is so what is this triad right here
alright so the first thing to do when
you're figuring this out is figure out
what cliff you're in which tells you
what notes are where that means this
right in line right here is G ok ok so
that means this right here is e 1 before
E is d so this D so we know it's a d
chord in some way shape or form possibly
maybe how I don't know what that bit but
what kind of court well we know this is
an F so f DF and then this is an a
pretty simple is it major minor
diminished drug mented well I do know
when we're crossing from d here's d2f oh
wait let me let me just show you on a
keyboard cash my drawings horrible
alright alright alright here's d here's
F now is it uh what kind of interval is
a major or minor well count the half
steps 1 2 3 oh it's minor which means
the interval can either be diminished or
minor and then from fta see if it's
minor major 1 2 3 4 it's major that
means it's a minor third followed by
major 3rd liner plus major which is
equal to a minor triad and it's a d so d
minor triad job let's try a different
one let's go for I gotta go I got a good
one no no
here here and here so every good boy
deserves fudge this is an e to eat a
g-sharp all the way up to be sharp which
AKA see but it's actually be sharp
because we can't skip that line so we're
starting on e go up to G sharp that is a
major third one two three four G sharp
to be sharp which is actually see one
two three four which qualifies this as
an Augmented you try add so II augmented
triad let's try one last one which
should set us off pretty well let's try
I gotta go my god oh god let your line
what is it alright see it means we have
notes here here and here and I'm going
to flap this note and flop this note
alright so we got see because that's see
that's where it overlaps with the bass
clef if you remember that so I got C and
then we have e flat and then G flat so
you can use up you can see that see but
followed by E flat followed by G flat
can you figure it out what it what it is
I'll give you 20 seconds see
eflite g flag Claire will not leave me
alone oh my gosh maybe alone Claire you
figured out yet figured out you figure
it out you figure it out yet okay a few
more seconds all right I'm tired of
waiting all right it is actually a
diminished chord this would be B this
would be a C diminished chord try it
whatever we call it I don't really care
so that's because C to e flat is three
half steps one two three e flat to G
flat one two three three half steps a
minor third followed by a minor third
because minor thirds have three half
steps qualifies this as a diminished
interop triad so great job that's all I
really want to do in this video just
some more practice nothing too major to
be true oh so in the next video we'll be
going over some some really cool stuff
so i'll be sure to see me there and I'll
be sure to see you there yeah so
subscribe thanks
