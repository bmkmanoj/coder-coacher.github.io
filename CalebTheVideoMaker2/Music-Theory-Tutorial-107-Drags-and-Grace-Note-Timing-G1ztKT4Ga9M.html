one so you may hear this as a drag or a
rough and this is the same concept just
two little dots before the note like
this so rather than you'll have two
notes there's a duck to duck to duck to
step now that's the same concept and you
can also have it in groups of three this
is horrible drawing like that that be
does it add up to the data that's very
common to and what I'm saying dude it's
dumb just playing the rhythm I guess it
could be on any instrument so that is an
example of a drag right here and then
you can have three nodes before the beat
which is the same concept or you could
have four nodes before the beat I don't
know how to count this devoted a did it
it it it gets harder to pronounces you
add so basically that's the concept of a
drag now the flam which just had a
single note a very similar concept just
dun dutta dutta two notes right beside
each other play as one be so you may
sometimes see this as a different given
beat but that's just to illustrate how
to play it when you see in music you
won't see you'll see off let me explain
a little better you won't lose time in
the measure because of the note so for
example if you're in four-four time you
can have four quarter notes one two
three four if you were to add a flam
into this or a grace note to one of
these notes oh no now you have more than
four beats well not really it's written
as 4 so this gets one two three four
even though there's this little note
here it's connected to this as a whole
it's not counted as a different beat in
the measure when i was talking earlier
about alternating flam's we had 68 time
the 6th beat of one measure sixth count
i should say sorry the sixth count of
one measure was the grace note and then
the one on the next measure was the
actual note so 6 1 2 3 1 2 4 5 6 1 2 3 6
123456 123456 123456 want this is a way
to illustrate the timing between these
two notes but typically you will not
have a specific amount of time that this
note takes up therefore you will not be
given a different amount of time in the
measure so you will you will see typical
notes you have for how many no's 6am
that takes up six of the eighth notes
available one two three four five six
but I could add a grace note one of
these and it still doesn't take up extra
time you just play it as if this note
had more add a little beat before it so
123456 123456 123456 123456 for physics
that's the illustrate that this note
doesn't get its own timing within the
measure so yeah that's all I have to say
in this video hopefully that all made
sense huh I guess I guess we're gonna
move on to the next video we're really
dragging along huh oh man now's a good
one come on give me some credit so yeah
I'll see you then thank you and good
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
