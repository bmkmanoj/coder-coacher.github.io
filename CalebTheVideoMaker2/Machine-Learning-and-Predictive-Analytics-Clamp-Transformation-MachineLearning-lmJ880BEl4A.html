are going to be talking about cleaning
our data specifically outliers and we're
going to be going through a process
called a clamp transformation so when we
have a particular feature such as income
where there may be some outliers we can
go through something called a clamp
transformation and this is going to take
the extremes and just kind of you know
just like scooch um over a little bit
scooting over down to a more reasonable
value so we're not just deleting them
we're not saying oh yeah we're just
going to make them more reasonable okay
so this is kind of deceptive because it
is kind of warping reality especially if
these outliers are legit but it's nice
to have a good you know small amount
rain a small range and to not have any
extreme outliers as most people would
have learned in any stats course or even
small math courses outliers warp our
data processing and can make things be
represented inaccurately
for example the range if you take the
biggest number and subtract the smallest
number well if you have a super big
outlier your range is going to be much
different I'm not really like a stats
Pro or anything in case you haven't
noticed so bear with me if my examples
aren't always the best but I do know
that outliers are bad so let's try to
fix them and do it in a non super
destructive way just just sort of
destructive okay so we have a range of
values here and these are like low
outliers and these are high outlier Oh
essentially what we want to do is we
just kind of want to like it's kind of
like you know just kind of bring it in a
little bit how much do we bring this
down and bring this up well there's a
couple different ways you can decide
that but generally it's anything that is
farther than two standard deviations
way is going to be moved to this to
standard deviations of value this is
probably a lot easier to see with one of
them
Taco Bell curves so here's the mean
here's like a standard deviation and
here's like two standard deviations and
in my stats video I mentioned that this
is going to take 95% of all values
meaning all this out here and this out
here or about 5% together so this might
be 2.5 and this might be 2.5 and
essentially what we want to do is clip
this if you've ever done audio
production and you yell into a
microphone you get audio waves that look
kind of like this you know like very
flat not good and can destroy speakers
well we want to do a similar thing with
this sombrero okay so we just make all
these values and just move them over to
this line right here same for this right
here let's move them over right there
wah that's it that's all a clamp
transformation is I probably could have
just said that so if you want to
represent this programmatically it would
look something like this this is like
super pseudo code but it's okay so if
and then whatever the value is so you
know you would do this inside of a while
loop or a for loop to go over all of the
values and you would say a value is
greater than two standard deviations
away then what I want to do is I want to
make the value equal to whatever two
standard deviations is away else if
value is less than negative two standard
deviations away then we want the value
to be negative two standard deviations
away and then finally else well at this
point you don't really have to do
anything but if you want to be explicit
you could say value equals value which
would probably just go away once you
compile it
but that's okay so this is some really
sloppy code that shows you how a clamp
transformation works if value is two
standard deviations
or greater away and then the value will
become the same value that we're
comparing to and if it's less than the
negative version then we make it the
negative version otherwise you do
nothing okay that is how you do a clamp
transformation thank you guys for
watching and be sure to subscribe
finally in the next video we're going to
go into a new topic of machine learning
I don't know what this is okay peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
