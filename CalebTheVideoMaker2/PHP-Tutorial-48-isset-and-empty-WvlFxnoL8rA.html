series if this video is hopeful please
be sure to subscribe alright so in this
video I want to talk about checking if
entered values have a value so basically
when you have a forum if someone puts
something blank so if the s for your
name we want to be able to check if that
was left blank using our PHP script
because we don't want people leaving
required information blank so within an
HTML form you have the boxes for people
to input data so your name your username
your password your email your location
how much money whatever it is it doesn't
really matter well we you want to create
what's known as a required field which
means they have to put that information
in so when you're logging in to a
website for example you'll have your
username and then you'll have your
password
those are both required fields because
if you don't have your password if you
leave a blank well then you're not going
to grant get granted access to the
account so with PHP when we want to
check to make sure that they put in a
value all right so to do this there's
two main functions which we'll get into
all the concepts of functions with this
that we will be using so there's two
main functions the first one is this and
this says is set so it's almost like a
question is the form value set well this
is how we write this and then within
here we can reference that data using
the array notation we talked about in
the last video and I'll be getting into
that as we make forms in the future well
what this function does is it will take
our data and it will check if it is set
so that means this function has two
outputs
true or false if there is if the value
is set it would be true so if it's false
then it would be empty and then this
result we can test it so we can check if
we get a true result which means it's
set or we can check if we get a false
result in which we can check all right
so how this would work is we could use
it within an if statement so if in here
we could put our function and then we
can do something here if it's true well
what we would do is because it outputs
either true or false well that's what if
statements test as well so how
convenient so basically if true then
this is ran well we could put that
function in there and then the result of
that function is going to be used in the
testing so if it is set we do what's
here and if it's not set we do the else
clause or nothing so that's the basics
of how it works so the first one that we
talked about is is set the next one is
empty what this will do is it will test
for an empty value so that means it has
two options if it's empty it would be
true if it's not empty then it would be
false so this one would be empty this
one would be not empty this is how the
basic test works so we can check if
values have inputs
using if-if inputs have values using
these two functions now there are some
problems with these so for example is
set that's only going to return a value
that mean basically if this is only
going to return true if the value is not
known which is basically say no value
that's what null means all right so that
means all of these will give a value so
we have an empty string which has
nothing in it but is set would still
count this as true we also use zero for
example well that means when someone has
a form such as a name and they leave it
blank and then they submit it well this
gets sent to the PHP script as an empty
string that just means a string with
nothing within the quotation mark so no
spaces no letters all it is is an
opening quotation mark and a closing
quotation mark this is an empty string
that that's what will get sent so that
means if they leave it empty it will
still trek test is true saying that it
is set so that's also a problem so how
do we fix that that means we are going
to use is set for things that don't have
input values so for example if you go to
a web site you may see this
well with this default form here
these are checkboxes or what you would
call radio buttons you would see this
now with this default for me if it's non
modified this is not going to be able to
give us an empty value so it's either
male or it's either female and if you
don't select one then it's given as null
not an empty string so if if we select
male so let's say we color in male so
that means female is not colored in that
means it's going to be set so this will
evaluate as true and if we instead check
female well this is still going to
evaluate as true and if we don't check
any of them this is going to evaluate as
false which is to say it's not set so
with these kind of things this function
is going to work if we were to use a pea
input box a text type well if it's empty
it's an empty string which tests that's
true which means PHP thinks it's set
but for us well there's not really a
value so that's not going to work and if
you put something it's going to evaluate
as true still so if you use a text box
it's always going to evaluate as true
which is not any testing because for
testing we want to check if it's false
or if it's true so that means we're
going to use is set for things such as
radio buttons where you can only pick
one or the other empty on the other hand
is a little different so basically if
the value is empty it becomes true if
the empty if the value is not empty it
becomes false
so that means if we have a string like
this an input type and we put nothing we
leave it blank
well what empty does is it tests if it
has any empty or false what they what
empty test is false so basically a zero
empty string or false
all of these or an old all of these are
here these are going to test as true so
that means we can sort of flip this
around to test is it not empty so if
it's not empty that means an empty
string with nothing in here this will
evaluate as M right because M a open
string with nothing in it evaluates as
true right so I know that's a little
confusing but basically what we're going
to do is we're going to test if this has
an empty value so if we want people to
put in their name we can use this empty
function to see is this an empty value
if they put caleb well this is not an
empty value this with nothing in it
is an empty value so it actually does
test if it's true or false now what we
can do is we can flip this around we can
use an exclamation mark which means not
empty so now we have a new function the
way this works if it's empty its false
if it's not empty it's true so as you
can see it kind of flipped things around
so that means we can test this value
using not empty which okay so let me
give you an example if we put caleb is
this value not empty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
