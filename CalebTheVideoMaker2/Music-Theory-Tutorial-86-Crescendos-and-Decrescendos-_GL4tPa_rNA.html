video I'll be talking about two terms
called crescendo and decrescendo this
marker just died the squeaky one out
crescendo now what does these what did
these mean what crescendo means to get
louder or to project more decrescendo
means to get quieter basically so when
are these used well if you remember in
the last video we had terms such as
forte and fortissimo well if we want to
go from Forte straight into fortissimo
i'd be like duh duh and it's like almost
like okay let's say this is the volume
level it's not very it's almost like Oh
jump sometimes that's good sometimes
that's bad but sometimes we want the
volume level to go like this rather than
like this makes sense this is ace this
is a slowly getting louder until we
reach fortissimo rather than just
jumping to fortissimo so that's what a
crescendo does and a crescendo just will
do the opposite it'll go down rather
than like straight up like that watch
they'd be more like yeah so that's what
crescendo and decrescendo does now we
can go from any of the terms they give
you in the volume terms dynamics in the
last video we had Triple P pan de sisse
mo double P P and s mo P that's o P f
double F
triple-s and yeah that's pretty much all
we'll ever see now if we're going from
one of the B's to an F it will
automatically be a crescendo if we're
going the opposite way so basically if
you're going from this one no matter
what you'll be doing a crescendo because
you can't
okay well unless you're going to
quadruple piano then you'll be doing a
crescendo because you can't for example
if you're at piano and it's impossible
to de crescendo to Forte because de
crescendo means to get quieter or to not
play as loud for example so that means
we have to go up and volume when we're
doing a crescendo down in volume when
we're doing a day crescendo so that's
all cool now there's two styles for
doing crescendos and decrescendos now
this means when we are let's say we're
going from piano now let's go a triple
piano all the way to triple forte and
we'll see a little bar like this which
is this telling us to get from little
tube loud we can either gradually go
from piano to let's say in three seconds
we get to double piano and then three
seconds we get to piano and then three
seconds we get to Metsa piano and then
in three more seconds we get to Metsa
Forte then met so then Forte and then
fortissimo and then fortissimo and so
forth so that's a linear increase in
volume so that means let's say we draw a
little graph here get rid of this crab
oh by the way follow me on Twitter okay
so if here is our graph this is time
this way this is volume this way and
we're at we're at the beginning of our
Christian note and we are at triple
piano and we want to get
- triple Forte or piano pianist issome
oh I don't know if I'm saying it to
fortissimo it would look like this
so after through after three seconds
we're here after three seconds over here
after three seconds were here well
sometimes it sounds nicer or more
effective to give an exponential graph
like this and what this means is we
slowly go from piano to we're slow okay
so let's say P double pianos here triple
pianos here and then we just quickly go
up to triple Forte in a exponential
graph so whoa see what I'm saying versus
whoa the reason for this is it can
affect the audience or the listeners
differently and it can be more impactful
for example when everything goes silent
then you can go like into a straight
either exponential versus linear which
eyes kind of looked the same but
exponential would be more like all
linear whoa
so yeah that is the difference between
the two so now when we're in music
writing the music we're reading the
music will typically see these below the
measure so he fears the measure markers
dying on me ah and here's the next
measure this one we want Forte this one
that's a piano but we don't want to just
jump up to Forte will draw a little
mouth or alligator or whatever you want
to think of it the bigger one
the louder one I should say will always
be on the larger side so if you see
something like this something's wrong
somebody doesn't know what they're doing
unless there's something i I don't know
about which I doubt that's true cuz I'm
a genius so that's that's what's going
on so this this is how you draw add a
crescendo which means the louder one is
on this end and the crescendo is the
opposite direction and basically that's
just saying get quiet I mean be quiet
and then get louder
now there's another type of marking I
want to teach you and that is s P Oh
what's that mean loud plus quiet well
that's actually sick sad Forte piano it
means get loud uh and then get quiet
instantly so it's like here's our chart
again
you stick marketer here's our volume
here's our time right and be like can we
get louder again so if we see something
like this Forte piano get louder I'm
cutting all this off basically we get
really loud uh uh pretty much yeah
so that's all I really need to say about
crescendos and decrescendos remember
crescendo means louder de crescendo
means to get quieter so thank you for
