video maker - this is going to continue
your create table video for sequel
server now so far we are in the process
of making this animals table and you can
see here it's there's a little red
squiggly saying this table already
exists so I already created this table
so that means when I run this command
it's not going to work
Oh see it didn't work like I said gosh
if you just trusted me oh so now you
might be thinking how in the world am I
supposed to change this darn table well
you can't just go in here and change
things for example this was originally
50 and I changed it to 30
well that's it's not going to work so
there's two options on how you can do
this the first is alter the table and
then the second is drop the table and
recreate it altering the table is a
little bit more complex and that's
actually something we are going to cover
in a lot of depth in the upcoming videos
but for now I think the easiest way is
to drop the table and recreate it so the
term drop means to delete so we are just
essentially getting rid of the entire
table this is different than just
deleting the data in the table it's
going to delete the entire thing so what
that means is all of your data in the
table is going to be utterly destroyed
so make sure you look through the data
make sure there's nothing important and
if needed you can backup the table or
whatever but we'll deal with that in
another video we don't have anything in
this table so it's not essential that we
worry about the data so the command to
do this is very simple all you say is
drop table animals now the thing here is
that we want to make sure we're talking
about the right database you can see
here this is on master again which is
kind of annoying that it goes back to
that a lot of the time but just make
sure you are on the correct database or
things aren't gonna work out right so we
are going to drop this table that's all
you have to put you don't have to put
parentheses or pass anything into this
you can think of it as just a
modification of the create table because
it's kind of the same create table
animals drop table animals so let's run
this and it works and now that's going
to allow us to go in here and edit
things so we can make this 20 characters
for example and you can see it allows us
to recreate that table so this is pretty
cool we can you know
delete things and recreate them but now
if we try to run this drop table command
see what happens oh yeah that's gonna
work because I just recreated the table
but let's run it again okay there it
does not exist or you do not have
permission so now this is giving us a
problem so you kind of have to check to
see if the table exists you have to run
this and then if it works you drop the
table if it doesn't work then you need
to create the table essentially it's
super annoying it would be nice if we
could do some kind of if statement
saying hey if this table does exist drop
it if not don't worry about it and
that's actually very easy to do in
sequel server all you got to do is go
after this drop table and say if exists
that's literally all you have to do so
now I can take literally the entire
script and just run the whole thing and
you can see it works and if we drop that
table and then run the whole thing again
you can see it still works so what's
going on is it goes here and it says
drop table if exists it checks if it
exists and it doesn't so it doesn't drop
it and then it moves on to the create
table so that is how you can do that
conditionally that'll improve your
scripting and you don't have to worry
about executing sections like this or
having errors show up here annoyingly
that's all guys hopefully that was
helpful and in the next video we'll be
covering something pretty delicious so I
will see you then thanks guys
