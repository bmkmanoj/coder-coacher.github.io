Caleb the video maker - and this is your
MySQL tutorial series we are going to
continue our discussion of beginner
terms in the term we're going to start
with is the foreign key a foreign key is
a column that references another column
in another table often this will point
back to a primary key it does not have
to reference a primary key it could
reference a unique column essentially
it's just a way to reference another
entity and that entity has to be labeled
unique or else it's not going to know
which entity you want to reference for
example if you have these two people and
you want to reference the person from
over here somewhere how do you tell it
which one you want to reference
there has to be a way to uniquely
describe these people so often there'll
be an ID and then you could say oh the
person with the ID of 7 is being
referenced in this row all of these
rules including primary key unique and
foreign key these are all known as
constraints constraints are something
that are very important to protect our
data integrity that's because they force
relationships to hold true if we didn't
use constraints we could still use the
value 7 over here but we're going to get
rid of this reference and that means if
this person gets deleted or something
that this 7 is no longer meaningful for
anything in that situation our data
would be outdated we don't want that
that would violate data integrity rules
so to force those integrity rules we use
constraints another way that we force
integrity is using data types it's
pretty bad MySQL has a plethora of data
types and we are going to discuss many
of them in upcoming videos every column
is going to have a data type that way
the database knows how to interpret that
data the way the database works with
data depends on the data type one area
where this is important is if we have a
numeric column that means numbers and we
try to store a string in there that's
not going to work and by that not
working we are taking another step to
protecting our data integrity so this
here would be a string value and we are
trying to store that in a numeric column
that's not going to work
there is one situation where you need to
be extra careful with the data type that
you give a column when you have a
foreign key word right here and it
references a primary key these both have
to be the same data type that's super
important if you're having problems
creating foreign keys that might be part
of the problem the primary key might be
a different data type than what you are
trying to make the foreign key one other
key word I got for you is index you can
tell the database to index important
columns and in fact it's going to index
certain columns automatically primary
keys are automatically indexed unique
columns are automatically indexed
foreign keys on the other hand are not
automatically indexed but oftentimes you
will want to manually index them because
we use them so much what an index does
is increase the speed that we can work
with these columns so when we are doing
a select statement if we are selecting
the columns that are part of an index we
are going to have a much faster query
now the last thing I got for you guys is
that when you have a foreign key
referencing a primary key or a unique
column this is known as a relationship
and that is what we will be discussing
in the next video so thank you guys for
watching hopefully this was helpful as
always please click Subscribe if you
want to support this channel and if
you've enjoyed this video please click
like if you guys got any suggestions at
all leave a comment and maybe I can make
a video about it thanks guys and I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
