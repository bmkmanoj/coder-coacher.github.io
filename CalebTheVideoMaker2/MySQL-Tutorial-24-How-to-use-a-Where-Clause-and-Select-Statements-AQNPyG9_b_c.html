actually going to show you some select
statements and some where clauses
I think I'll Bend into this a bit but
I'm going to expand on it so I'm in my
jam database members table
let's click SQL from here basically a
selectman first things first
say what type of command you're making a
select command then you're going to tell
my SQL what you want to select
so select everything which is a
asterisks or like shift 8 to get that
and then from so from members and then a
where clause so where Clause just says
what you want to take back so if I take
away the where clause and just go like
this you'll see what comes back it
brings back every single thing from our
our table and we have all the members
here are all their first names and last
names to see who they are so if we go
back to that oops
now let's say I want to get all the
silver members I could say oops sorry
I need a stop sign webstore membership
status is equal so you have to set type
is to say equal to silver and then from
here just click go
so basically selecting everything from
members where the membership status is
silver so when I say select everything
that doesn't mean select all the rows
and within the table this is saying
select the first all the column so the
first name last name membership status
phone birthday and member ID so when we
click go you'll see that it brings back
all this stuff and it only brings back
to people because only John Lennon will
Lennon John and Yao Ming or retrieve
because they're the only silver
membership status so if we go back to
the SQL one more time
well maybe not one more time select
everything from members where we can say
first name is equal to Caleb now we will
click go here and I want to show you
something you can see that the first
name is actually Caleb with a capital C
but this is actually not case-sensitive
so it doesn't really matter so this is
how you if you need to find somebody
with the name Caleb or let's say the
phone number let's type let's go back to
this SQL members where what is it phone
equals 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 click go and
you can see that this brings back my
phone number so be sure to call that and
hit me up we can hang out sometime maybe
probably not I'm too busy in my basement
being a loser it's awesome but anyways
that's basically how you can find
specific data entries in your database
so if we go to members here are all of
our tables there's only one column I
mean yeah one
row with the first name Caleb and for
the gold numbers it got these specific
rows it did not get these two because
these are silver there's actually no
bronze or not a number of people so
that's that's pretty cool and then let's
go a little more in depth what we can do
is this is get rid of this where clause
and change this little asterisk um these
little back ticks aren't really
necessary you can put them in if you
want like that which is just the key
above the tab but it doesn't really
matter so select we don't have to select
everything and actually sometimes this
is a bad idea to select everything so
let's select first name last name looks
go this brings back everybody's first
name and last name and the reason it
brought back everybody is because I did
not give it a where clause if I said
we're first name is equal to Terri and
last name is equal to Smith then that
would come up so I want to show you
something first thing I'm going to do is
create some more columns I mean rows
sorry alright as you can see I added two
new rows and we added Caleb Caray and
Caleb balls because I couldn't think of
anything really good so if we go to the
SQL will show I'll show you something
cool so select everything from members
the where clause will eliminate what we
get so we're first name equal to Caleb
and you'll see we should get screw that
up
oh okay we should get a three responses
and we did Caleb curry Caleb Caray and
Caleb balls but now let's try select
everything for members where last name
is equal to
we go and boom it only brings up two now
as you can see this brings up the member
ID the birthday the phone membership
status first name and the last name and
sometimes it's just isn't necessary and
it requires when you have a whole bunch
of stuff to bring back this will slow
things down so to get around this is
instead of let me do that same query
well make it where first name is equal
to Caleb and then uh instead of
selecting everything so all I'm looking
for is the persons that have the first
name Caleb and let's say I want their
phone number so I can call them you can
say select first name and then comma
last name comma and then phone this will
bring back the first name last name
phone from members where the first name
is equal to Caleb it's like English so
click go BAM it brought back every
single person and their phone number and
obviously he's stupid because he did
something wrong can't ever get people to
do things right alright and also what
you can do is if you click Edit over
here on the side and bring the same
query up you can change this and if you
rearrange things let's say I want the
first name after the last name just
highlight it and drag it or you can just
retype it doesn't really matter and then
when you click go let's go down here you
can see actually changes so last names
first and then the first name so all you
really need to know from this is the
order and then the where clause what to
bring back so the order of the what you
want to bring back last name first name
phone that's the order I used as you can
see up here and then the where clause is
what you need to select out of the total
options so I only wanted the people with
the first name equal to Caleb and I only
wanted to retrieve their last name first
name and phone
the very last thing I'm going to show
you is a you can use and/or other things
such as that and I might get into this
later so and last and I think this this
should be capitalized and last name is
equal to curry if I click go
it brings back one result curry Caleb
this is because it goes through this it
looks for a person with the first name
Caleb and brings back three things and
then the last name curry and only brings
back one so if we change this you can
say or or the last name equal to pulse
click go and you can see where
first-name is equal to Caleb we have
three of those Caleb Caleb Caleb and
then or the last name is equal to bulbs
and you can see this one actually fits
in both so this is actually not even
necessary you can delete it it'll work
fine but we can say last name is equal
to John click go and we see we got a lot
more results here because we have John
Lennon which that's actually backwards
it should be
Len John here but then Jim John so
that's that's that and hopefully that
helped you with some stuff and I'll
catch you in the later video peace out
and subscribe and like this video thanks
