cleaning process this video we are going
to be talking about irregular
cardinality now when we discussed
cardinality in a previous video we did
discuss irregular cardinality a little
bit and I just mentioned how when you
have odd cardinalities things get more
complex not odd is in an odd number like
1 3 or 5 but odd is in really huge so
maybe I should have just said huge yeah
so if you have a huge cardinality that's
going to be an issue but there are also
some other cardinality issues that we
need to discuss so let's do that now so
first off let's talk about what we
already talked about cardinality that is
how many different values we have for a
particular feature so for example age
well you know people can live to be like
130 or something I don't know so there's
up to like 130 different values right
but we might not have every single age
represented so we might have everybody
from 100 from zero to hundred and then
we might have a gap and we might have
100 1728 so we might have you know a
hundred and eight different values for
this age we can go through a process
called binning which I talked about and
that's going to group these into
categories so you could have 0 to 24 25
to 49 50 to 74 however you want to do it
where you can do it in 10 so you could
have tens twenties 30s you want to make
the group big enough but not too big for
example if you just made it under 100
well that's just going to group
everybody together and that's not going
to contribute any extra value so we want
to go through a bidding process for a
large cardinality but there is another
cardinality issue and that is when the
cardinality is one so for example in our
analytic space table we might have a
column where a feature is patient and
this is for a doctor's office so it's
not about how much patients someone has
we have is patient and then we have set
and an age and all that other good stuff
okay now let's look at this is patient
every single person in here has the
value one so the cardinality is one well
the rule is that if this is like this
then you just want to delete it this
makes sense because if everybody in here
has the same value it doesn't contribute
any extra information on correlating
descriptive features to the target
feature of whether or not someone had
diabetes so we just get rid of it
another way to look at it is if somebody
is a patient can you tell me if they're
more likely to have diabetes or not no
you can't because every single person in
here is a patient that's gonna make our
process and our analytics based table a
lot simpler
another example is an incorrect
cardinality and this can actually sort
of go into the invalid data issues where
data wasn't pulled correctly from
different sources but I am just gonna
throw it in here because you might see
it and I want to teach how to address it
so for example we might have the column
sex and we might have a bunch of rows
and we have values like this the issue
here is that we have two values that
mean the same exact thing but the
computer doesn't always know that the
computer will look at this and try to
make decisions based on whether someone
is an F or a female the fix for this is
to combine these values so basically you
do anytime there is an F you can just
change it to female anytime there's an M
we can change it to male so we reduced
our cardinality from four down to two
which is the correct value so that's all
I got for cardinality in the next video
we are going to be talking about
something new so please be sure to check
it out as always I ask you dearly just
to subscribe to this channel I
desperately want to you know like take
over the You Tube and such so yeah I
could use your help thank you guys and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
