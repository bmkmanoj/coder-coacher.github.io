music theory tutorial in this huge
series my name is caleb curry and I'll
be your teacher for today and hopefully
every day and I know I sound pretty
ridiculous right now but I'm kind of
sick but when comes to sickness ain't
nobody got time for that so we're gonna
get started I'm using this piano here
that on this iPad I stole from my school
huh just kidding
it's not from my school okay but anyways
um I don't even know what to say
basically we're going to get started I'm
going to say what music theory is my
name is Caleb curry already said that
follow me on Twitter sure to subscribe
to my youtube channel for upcoming
series and videos if you have any
questions post them in the comment
section down here or wherever it is 20
years from now and I will try to address
them in a comment or video or something
so I may add a question and answers
video on to this somehow okay but
basically music theory is the study of
no is the study of how music works in
time so we'll figure out how chords work
scales frequencies and all kinds of cool
junk and how sound works and also how
why songs sound good and we'll get into
composing ear training a bunch of other
cool stuff so it's going to be pretty
fun and I'm glad you're here so to get
started we work with a piano or keyboard
whatever you want to call it and you can
see the different keys here and the
sounds interact with other sounds and
ways to create nice sounds for example
let's start here here's a C chord
sounds good basically after this you'll
definitely understand pop music pretty
easily and although we're using a
keyboard it doesn't have to be a
keyboard for example one second here I
have an acoustic guitar each one of
these frets is the equivalent of a key
so here's C which on a guitar it's right
here and if we move up up to this black
key it's the same thing as sliding down
one fret or up one fresh should say cuz
you're going up the board this will work
for any instrument we will get into
reading music and I'll teach you how to
read rhythms all kinds of other sweet
stuff but this is this is mainly helpful
for pitched specific instruments such as
we can't just play random things on here
it's um
spell out certain chords with our
formations of our hands same for
keyboards and other instruments so this
is gonna be pretty fun now I do have two
boards here basically I was going to use
this one but then I realized how puny
was but it's not that bad so I decided
to put it on bigger board and use my
little tablet genius on out so if I have
my old my main stuff will be right here
I may put a couple pictures up here for
illustrations and I'll write anything I
need to up here but I probably will
probably just leave an advertisement up
there so we write music on a five line
staff and each one of these represents
different pitches and you will write
notes on each line and although you do
not have to learn music while writing it
that's what will typically do because
that will allow you to be better
musically as in you can't you can be a
great musician without reading music
although it limits what you can learn
and what you can work with now writing
on the staff is fun and all but it's
more important about how things sound so
I will be teaching you how to read music
but it's not necessary for example you
can be a great piano player without
having an idea of how to read music and
there's a lot of people like that so
we're going to study
the sound and the interaction of certain
notes in a notes just like that's a note
that's a note that's a note it's it's a
term you can use for a lot of things
such as that's how to draw a note
although people use it a lot for a bunch
of different words so anyways sound is
basically a vibration in the air and
then that vibration reaches our ears and
we interpreted so the way the sounds
vibrate and reach to our ears affects
how we hear them for example a low
pitched sound which sounds like that
vibrates very slowly compared to a high
pitched end and there's only eight notes
we use a through G and we also have
things called accidentals which are
sharps flats and other things like that
but those aren't that important the
accidentals are the Black Keys usually
and these are the white keys usually yes
always pretty much so um we're going to
study these different types of notes and
although there's only eight it goes up
the keyboard eighty there's 88 keys on a
typical keyboard so for example here we
have a G savings to this here we have G
1 now we here we have G 2 so
the reason they're both labeled G is
because this G vibrates twice as fast as
this G and that's called an octave so
yeah that's about it for now so be sure
to follow me on Twitter and subscribe to
my channel I'll see you later oh by the
way all these videos will be available
in a playlist on my youtube channel
Caleb the video maker too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
