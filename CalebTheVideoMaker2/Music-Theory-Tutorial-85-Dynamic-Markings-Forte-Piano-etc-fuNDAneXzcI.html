will be talking about how loud to play
things we get terms to describe how loud
we should play things and obviously it's
going to differentiate from instrument
to instrument because we can't say for I
mean for example as a snare drummer most
some people will say piano which is very
soft or soft some people say it's 3
inches some people say it's half an inch
I guess it just depends but basically we
have piano which is soft and Forte all
my markers are falling Forte which is a
lap alright so if we want something very
soft we add B C Mon here now if we want
something very very soft we add another
s in here so P and SE semo I think
that's how you pronounce it I don't know
I know a pen but um once you gain a
multi-syllable as it gets kind of
confusing so we have piano now same
thing for for forte we can say
fortissimo or for test system which
means this one means very loud this one
means loud so that's an example of quiet
versus loud so there's also medium so
how do we represent medium well we can
have medium loud or we can have medium
quiet hopefully that makes sense so
basically medium loud sort on the louder
end medium quiets sort on the quieted so
we represent medium by the term mid so
so for example if I say met so piano I
mean medium soft mezzo Forte would be
medium left so now that we know the
medium terms we can make from beginning
the quietest all the way up to the last
now we we can keep adding for example P
is the quiet two pieces quieter three
pieces even more quiet and then four
pieces even quieter but my highest you
really ever see is three
so that would be Triple P
which is pianist sysem oh and we have
two piece which is basically if you have
pianist system well it's basically
playing like nothing right if you can't
say that I just said just say triple
piano Claire won't leave me alone
so double P is and miss su mo single P
piano you'll see that one a lot
then we have mezzo piano then we have
mitso Forte this is medium loud this is
me this is medium soft this is medium
real loud basically not quite loud but
on the verge of being loud so you don't
want to play too you don't wanna play
loud you want to play medium then we
have Forte then we have double Forte or
fortissimo triple Forte or fortissimo
so basically very very very soft very
very soft well very very soft very soft
soft medium soft medium loud loud really
loud really really loud that's basically
all the volume words you'll hear you'll
or here's some more and I'll go over
those soon all right so when we have a
song it's usually not just the same
volume throughout the entire song for
example we can break up songs into
segments such as the a segment versus
the B segment so once you finish a you
go to the B segment now let's say we
want the starting kind of soft so I
could say medium piano and then I want
it to be like boom you just got hit with
like this most intense orchestral
beautiful
sound that just overwhelms your soul and
brings tears to your eyes so I'm going
to have people play loud here but I'm
actually still saving it for the finale
which would be C which will be quadruple
millions Forte's well probably not that
loud because then just sound like Boop
but you know what I'm saying
so that's what I'm saying that's what
those markings will do they will allow
us to change the volume of how loud you
play throughout the entire song and
that's about all I have to say about
that remember it changes from instrument
to instrument and from composer and
composer and also from director -
director and the directors for like a
director of a band is just the person
who directs it they may conduct or not
then they'll have a conductor if not so
that's what you need to be aware of and
that's about all I have to say for that
and in the next video I'll be going over
crescendos and stuff and it's gonna be
pretty awesome so I'll see you there
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
