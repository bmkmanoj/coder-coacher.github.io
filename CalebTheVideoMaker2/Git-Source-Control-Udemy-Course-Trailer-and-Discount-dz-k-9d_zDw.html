get source control source control is an
essential when it comes to programming
or software development no employer will
even take you seriously unless you know
some sort of source control management
now that being said get is one of the
most popular ones out there so i would
highly recommend it as your choice of
source control and this course is going
to take you from being a beginner not
knowing a thing up to the point where
you can start using it effectively by
yourself or with a team now there's two
types of videos in this course there's
going to be ones where i'm on the
computer going through examples those
will look like this photo and every the
other kind is where i'm standing here in
front of a white board those will look
like this like this hopefully you guys
find this course useful i'm not going to
bore you with the details but at the
same time i'm going to give you a little
bit more information than the general
beginners course the first couple of
sections will just teach you some basic
commands and then we'll go into some
configuration branching and so forth as
time goes on there's going to be more
stuff added to this course when i get
the time i will make new sections or go
over revisions on older videos and try
to answer as many of your guys's
questions and concerns as possible when
you buy this course you basically get
lifetime access to a continually growing
project until i literally run out of
ideas of what kind of videos to make i
got one more thing for you guys before
you go some of you might be asking who's
this Punk on the screen trying to teach
me things well let me introduce myself
my name is Caleb I've been making videos
for a very long time nearly half my life
and I have this philosophy in these
videos that if I'm teaching and you guys
aren't having fun then you're not
learning so I try to keep that
philosophy in mind when I'm making these
videos I like to keep it fun interactive
and kind of laid back you know I'd like
for you guys to enjoy these videos I'm
also a youtuber i currently have
eighteen thousand subscribers and here
on you to me i have nearly 40,000
students so a lot of people know these
videos and a lot of people enjoy them i
work as a software developer and we do
use get as our source control other than
that uh well i just got
this year my favorite pizza toppings are
pepperoni and bacon I play guitar some
I'd like to pretend anyways and yeah
that's about it so hopefully you guys
enjoy these videos and I'll see you in
the first one piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
