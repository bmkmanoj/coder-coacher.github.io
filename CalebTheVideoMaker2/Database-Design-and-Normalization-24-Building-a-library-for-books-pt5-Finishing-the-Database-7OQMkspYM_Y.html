classes table so let's what I'm going to
do is make a column and here and change
this to professor's students and their
classes would you say that's a good idea
well you know what I have to say that no
absolutely not
you know why because let's say there was
four students in a class that means the
class would be listed four times as a
foreign key and the professor would be
listed four times as a foreign key which
ain't bad and then the student ID would
be listed four times but you see the
professor ID is only need to be put in
there once having it in there 400 times
for four hundred students that's a waste
of space and I don't really like that
idea so I'm changing my mind and I'm
actually gonna make another table man is
getting crazy and this is going to be
students and their classes and we are
going to have class ID and then student
ID like that int instead of us
oh yeah also set them both as primary
key because the connection won't ever
change now the foreign key defer class
ID references classes and a column class
ID connects with the other : class ID as
you can see here you hover over the
green that's how it is connected and
then we make another one which will be a
student ID
dan goes to students where's that there
we go student ID student ID now they're
connected all right now let me explain
this a little bit because I don't want
to confuse you guys what you may think
to do is go up here and put the students
classes that they're in with this table
now that could work but I don't really
like that idea and you shouldn't either
because then that's that's not really
connected with the students information
yes asked to do with them but as you can
see this has all this all has to do with
the person this doesn't have to do with
the person's classes
whereas this table down here is
specifically for their classes so if I
needed to change a class I don't have to
mess with the students information
that'll all stay put and I don't have to
worry about screwing something up and
then having big problems in the end now
the way the class is over here and the
class is over here are connected is
through this table right here the class
ID let's say class ID 67 has a subject
math 101 oh sorry the subject would be
math and then the class name would be
like advanced algebra class number would
be like alg 101 for example which
wouldn't be advanced algebra would be
beginner algebra or intro but anyways
then 67 will be over here and it will
also be down here so if you change the
class title to algebra for beginners and
then then it will change over here and
okay guys I'm fairly confident that I've
covered every single thing that we
wanted in our database just to go over
this a little bit
I will real quickly we had students and
they all and then all the student
information is connected right here it's
pasted right here now the books that's a
very broad thing so they put it into a
new table and a book has a publisher
genre an author and a topic and the
reason this extra table is here is
because it has many to many relationship
and to remind you what that is that
means a book can have more than one
author and an altar can write more than
one book that's why we have this
intermediary table to list which author
wrote which book this reduces useless
redundant information same for the book
topic because it is also a many-to-many
relationship and then over here we have
best friends best friend is connected to
the students right here and as you can
see I actually forgot to connect these
so that's why it's good to review
everything so over here we're going to
edit this and make a new column
best friend
and their foreign key used to make that
again best friend II which was the best
friend you find the column which is at
the bottom we just made it and it ties
to the same name that that's why you
make the names the same it's a lot
easier so you look over here you can see
the little red dot is hovered as goes to
this table and then of the columns I
like to drag that to the top to make it
consistent okay so now you can see the
student is connected the best friends
best friends can have a school a major
and a minor that's why we have these
tables here listing the common schools
and their information
the majors available and the minors
available same for students because the
students can have a major in a minor
now it is assumed that all the students
in this database goes to the school that
this database is for this extra
information over here for schools it
does not store the college information
now we also also want all the classes
available and then all of the classes
with teachers and all the students in
the classes so to have all the classes
available you would have a class as call
them and it would list all the possible
classes and also their subject which is
connected over here
and then over here it'll list which
classes have which teachers and then
over here as the professors which has
all their information that you would
ever need maybe not every ever need and
this will connect over here so let's say
there's a professor that doesn't teach a
class he's still in the professor's
column he's just not in the professors
in their classes because he doesn't have
a class or you could put him in here
with a normal class so that way you know
he's still available for teaching but he
doesn't necessarily have a class yet
same for classes if a class does not
have a professor
and then the students and their classes
is connected up here to the student ID
we do not store this information up here
because it is not related to the student
information it's related to their
classes and then classes I said classes
classes so many times right then classes
it's connected over here by connecting
to the student ID so it lists what
classes are connected to what student ID
so a student let's say a class ID 67 as
said earlier had 30 students in here
class ID would be listed 30 times and
the student ID would be listed for each
student and this is just a foreign key
to this so it's technically only one
entry of a class that way we don't
actually have the name of the class
we're in 30 times if we need to change
it we can just change this rather than
changing this so that's a quick sum up
and in the next video I'll be teaching
you where to go from here and this will
be probably the most helpful video so be
sure to watch it thank you and I'm
hoping that this all helped you and
helped you clear everything up in your
head and now you understand
relationships and all that other stuff
which I'll talk about that in the next
video thanks so subscribe and like this
video goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
