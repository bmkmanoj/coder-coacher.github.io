YouTube which is like all my subscribers
anyways this video is going to be
talking about the return statement so
let me type that out for you so you can
see it return I'm going to be explaining
how this works
but as you can see for this video I'm
going to be using the shell on the left
hand and then a new file on the right so
file new file I'm gonna bring this up
and then just file save and I just named
mine legit py legit PI all right so
before we define what the return
statement does let's create a function
because that's where it will be used
very commonly so def and we'll just call
it subscribe right and then sorry I mean
to quote that we put a variable in here
this is called our parameter so this is
the person who's going to be subscribing
to me on YouTube which will be you of
course but anyways subliminal message
yeah and what we can do is we can use
the return statement and then within
parenthesis just like a a print
statement we could say or I guess I read
a return function we could say thank you
and then we use % s so I I thought
there's something my leg it's like a
giant spider anyways the percent s is
basically just a reference to a variable
which we will use at the end of this and
I'll show you that in a second thank you
please have a nice day and then what we
do on out outside of the quotes we use a
percent or a modulus or whatever it's
called and then we use the variable that
we want to have placed right here so we
are going to be using this variable this
is the parameter and whatever value a
person uses when they call this function
will be given right here so let's say I
type
let's just say four three I put look
down here at the left subscribe Caleb so
that's my name right well that means the
value of this variable would be Caleb
this value is placed here so it would be
Thank You Caleb please have a nice day
so let's try this out hey let me delete
this because we're not actually going to
be running that yet so what we can do we
can just call this function by saying
subscribe now we can put our user name
in here like pizza dough dog no idea
what that means
alright so now we can press ctrl s to
save it and then f5 to run it and okay
let's try this again okay so it's not
running for some reason what is that
reason well you would look at me like oh
well it's not printing out it's broken
let's destroy well actually
the return doesn't automatically print
out values before when we created
functions we just used print and we have
these values print out so now when we re
when we press f5 you can see it it
prints that out over and over again over
and over again as every time you press
f5
well what return does is it just returns
a value and we can do something with
that value so for example we could be
like we could print this and now we run
that okay we got an air give me a sec oh
yeah obviously there's an S here though
so we want to return and then we can
print this control save and you can see
it prints it out so it works the same
way but now our function doesn't have to
print the value every time and this
allows us to do more things with our
function for example we can assign it to
a variable so we could say let me get
rid of these this point we could say
the subscriber is or we can say
subscriber message is the value of this
function let's try it ctrl ctrl s to
save f5 now when we print subscriber
message down here you can see it prints
that message the same thing we can do it
up here within our program print
subscriber message so we're not
necessarily limited to just printing it
out we could do much more with it like
assigning it to variables and then we
can use those variables within if
statements or anything like that so the
return just hands a value over the value
that hands over is thank you
or whatever the so they could at the
same this example would be thank you
pizza dog dog please have a nice day
this value will be handed over and we
can do whatever we want with it rather
than printing it out to the screen
because that's not always what we're
going to want to do with that value for
example we might want to assign this to
a variable without printing it out so we
can get rid of this print save it and
then refresh it and you can see it
worked
it just didn't say anything because
we're not having it say anything if we
don't have this return if we just like
print or something well this doesn't
return anything and it's not going to
work
see watch if we print out the way it
works right now is it's printing this
message here and then if we print this
out print subscriber message I think
that's fun right and we run it it says
none because it never passed a value
because there was no return so that's
just the basics of how a return
statement works hopefully I'll is
helpful and in the next video we'll be
talking about some more stuff so be sure
to keep watching and I hope you guys
were encouraged to subscribe by this
video but if not that's okay I mean I'm
only going to eat your soul
all right we'll have a nice day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
