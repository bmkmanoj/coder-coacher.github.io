going to be a quick video over naming
conventions so a naming convention is
just a pattern that people do or that
you do to keep things consistent so not
only will this naming convention help
keep my database consistent across
different tables and columns but this
naming convention is not only mine other
people use this naming convention that
means when I go to a different person to
review my database they already
understand what's going on now obviously
there's multiple different naming
conventions there's not one way to do
everything and it's not required this is
just how I decide to do it and this is
because most people who use MySQL which
is what I learned first use this but for
different relational database management
systems you may have different systems
of naming things so I'm just going to
explain what I'm going to do any time I
write SQL I put it in all capital
letters so select is an example
fortunately we're not going to be doing
much SQL so I'm not going to have to
write in all capitals on a chalkboard
because it's quite complicated but when
we're talking about anything I name
myself I use all lowercase letters I
just use all lowercase letters because I
just think it makes it more simple so
when we have a table such as a user
table
I don't capitalize the U and then when I
have an ID
I just put user ID or just ID whatever
but I don't capitalize ID I just keep it
lowercase and four spaces I just use an
underscore so I don't use any spaces so
basically that's my naming convention
that I use and yours will vary in a way
I'm really got to this yet so you might
not understand this but if I have a
fourth key basically if I have a copy a
connection over here to where we have
the same column over here I just make
sure their name both the same thing so I
know what they're talking about so yeah
I some people will do things such as put
like user table or they capitalize
certain words and if you want to look at
other naming conventions for your
specific relational database management
system go right ahead in fact I'd
encourage it but just so you understand
what I'm doing here I will be doing that
another thing when we're talking about
stuff in the real world sometimes I
don't necessarily use that naming
convention because if I'm writing
everything I need to store about a user
well I might just put we need to store
the user's address I'm not going to put
the underscore users underscore address
I might just put the user's address with
space in English and then when I convert
when I start making this into a database
structure or schema whatever you want to
call it then I'm going to convert that
to just address lowercase so yeah that's
introduction to I already it's wait till
a it's like four o'clock that that's
basically our convention so yes
see you in the next video be sure to
