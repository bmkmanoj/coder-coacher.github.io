about swing rhythms swing rhythms is
like giving it's sort of like rather
than counting eighth notes we would
count okay well we normally count them
death death death death pronounce them
that's already counting one and two and
three and four well now it's one and two
and three and four and one and two and
three and four and basically rather than
having an eighth note equal in eighth
note we set an eighth note to equal an
eighth note with a dot dotted eighth
note plus a sixteenth note so now it's
that's sort of what it's like and yeah
cool I know so see in the next video
just kidding this is common for jazz
especially very common in jazz you
probably won't be able to do jazz
without knowing what swing is and even
if you don't know the term you probably
understand the feeling so now these are
worth three sixteenths 1 1 e and a 2 e
and a 3 E and a 4 so if I tack the beats
remember these are worth 3 these are
worth 1/16 3/16 1/16 so for counting
this one is going to take let me write
out the counts for you guys one E and
two E and three E and four E and this
one is going to take three of the
sixteenth if you remember dotted rhythms
add half to whatever it is so if it's an
eighteenth note it's going to add a
sixteenth
to its camp that's a quarter note that's
going to add an eighth note so it'll
become one and a half beats so this is
going to take 3/16 to count it so that's
going to count one e and that will go to
this one and then the AH will be the
sixteenth note one E and AH one E and AH
two E and AH three E and four when you
speed it up sorry to count do both I'm
not very good at this
hopefully that makes sense little
awkward at first but you get the hang of
it really quickly
you
so let's make eighth note triplets and
then I'm going to make a little rest
there rest rest
so how would this be counted if there
was no rest if you remember from the
last video well now if we take out the
middle triplets see so if we speed up
some 92 beats a minute that's basically
the concept of a swing pattern so if we
put triplets in a swing pattern it fits
pretty nicely so simple so for the swing
we put a rest in between here that's a
rest these are notes it'd be okay hey
let me put it right let me swap these so
the teaser is read so now we have swing
rhythm duh duh but this time there's no
rest in there so we actually count it
that's cool it's triplets with swing fit
real nice they see me doomed
that's basically a difference between
this versus this hopefully that makes
sense
and the next video I'll be going over
something really super awesome so I'll
see you then
thanks see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
