teaching you some common terms most of
them you've already heard already in my
last video but I'll just be writing them
down make sure you know them first one
databases
what is the database do you remember the
database stores information organized
well at least you want it to and next
one a table stores related data in a
database so the example I gave was was
it account info and comments
these may be two tables that way your
data is more organized next one I went
over was I think combs yeah these are
tables an example of a column would be
user ID rows rows are pretty much
individual entries into the columns so
user ID the 27 name
that would be a row of data mmm
primary key do you remember what this
was
it's very important
primary key is what keeps everything
unique so the user ID would be a great
primary key so I'm gonna say go to right
here I don't need or anything that's
basically what it is it just keeps it
unique so yeah that these were both the
primary keys new one in this video is
foreign key and don't worry if you don't
understand one of these by the end of
the series I promise you will be a pro
well I mean I'm pretty good teacher
all right so foreign key is a reference
to a primary key in a different table so
let's say you have comments right here
I'm gonna get some room to teach this
you have commerce and under the comments
you have the message so this is the
table that is the primary key which is
also a column column stores individual
rows
I mean multiple columns makes rows so
then the actual message is the next
column and then who is the comment by
instead of writing the username a
billion times for each comment you can
just have it say it can reference the
user ID over in this users table
now what everything stays consistent if
there's a change over here it will
change over here
there shouldn't be a change that's
another thing but these connect these so
there's no it reduces the chance of
screwing something up and having
incorrect data or unorganized data so
this right here is a primary key let me
know no no no foreign key sorry this
here is a foreign key this is a primary
key if that's confusing don't worry I
promise this will make so much more
sense in the next few videos yeah that's
right
so basically a foreign key is a
reference to another primary key
all right the next term we have here
I believe this word is surrogate the
primary key I may be wrong on that and
I'm too lazy to look it up just kidding
but many ways what surrogate primary key
is it's like a primary key it actually
is a primary key
it's just when there's no logical
primary key available you make one up
let's say you're running a website and
you have a table for your comments from
everybody so let's say you have the body
of the comments and then who it's from
what would be the primary key well
they're technically isn't a good one I
mean you could use the body or the
subject or something but that means you
can't change it and that it has to be
unique from everything else so let's say
you're your comment is hey and that is
used as the primary key well then that
means nobody else can have a message
that says hey it's just not allowed
because then it wouldn't be unique you'd
have two of the same so that that's kind
of confusing so what you need it is a
surrogate primary key a surrogate
primary key is just a primary key that
you make up so instead of having body
subject and who it's from
you would have comment
this is a serviette primary key I say
that because each opponent isn't going
to naturally have an ID it has no
purpose other than being a primary key
hey guys the next thing I'll be doing is
going over some more advanced terms the
first one I have to say it's not super
advanced don't worry this now I'm pretty
sure that's brown's tuple maybe tupple
but I'm pretty sure it's tuple anyways
it's probably wrong either way this is
another name for a row so so you're
gonna memorize is the same thing as a
row can you see that
yeah I'd say now attribute is each
individual in individual cell nine can
each individual row here or tuple so
this is a tuple that's tuple now on a
tribute would be each individual a box
here that's the tribute that's an
attribute that's an attribute that's an
attribute this can also be called as
field so attributing the oldest
right now what is atomic let's say you
have a field and it is main and you put
a little curve in that field like that
now this is not atomic atomic means you
cannot break it up any farther so if you
wanted to make this atomic you would
make it first name and have that as
caleb then you have another one last
name and have that as curry its cuz
that's as low as you can go I mean
obviously you're not gonna break it up
into letters like first names first
letter I mean that's that's crazy so
that is what atomic means it means you
can't break it up any farther another
good example of that is like where you
live you would have instead I'm just
saying where do you live and then they
put their address and stay and
everything you have state city zip code
and then add street address</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
