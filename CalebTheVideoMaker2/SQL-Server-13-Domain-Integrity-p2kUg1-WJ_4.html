over sequel server I'm Caleb from Caleb
the video maker - and we are going to be
covering domain constraints this video
is going to be pretty simple and to the
point that's because a lot of this
information we've covered in the other
videos coming up to this point I'm just
going to leave all this information here
though in case you need to come back and
look up what a domain constraint is or
you just forget you need a review so
before we talk about what domain
constraints are we need to talk about
what domain is the domain of something
is the appropriate or accepted values
how do we know what's acceptable this
comes from what's known as the business
rules now there's a fine line between
business rules and domain so don't take
it all too seriously and try to divide
one you know just learn them both but
essentially business rules are the
English or spoken language equivalent of
domain so your boss might be like hey
loser do this we're gonna get fired and
then you take his commands and convert
that into domain so he might say yo Punk
we need to restrict this data from here
to here
nothing hired nothing lower and your
response is to convert that into domain
using SQL now sequel server is awesome
when it comes to domain constraints
that's because we can get very specific
on what data is a laugh and it's very
easy to do we'll talk about how we can
do that in just a moment but first let's
talk about some of the more general ways
we can restrict data obviously we can
use data types what that does is force
the data to be inputted in the database
to be of a certain format that means if
it's a numeric column it's going to
reject string data we will cover the
data types in an upcoming video but just
understand what they are for now the
other way is using constraints so we
could say the unique constraint and be
not null constraint unique is going to
force every single value for a column to
be unique not null is going to say every
single row has to have a value for that
call
so we can use these to be a little bit
more strict on what's allowed so let's
say a value has already been entered of
17 for example and that column is
labeled unique and you try to put 17 and
again it's not going to let you do that
or if you don't put a value in at all
and it's labeled is not null it's not
going to let you do that either these
are the general ways how to restrict
data but the sequel server has something
known as a check constraint now a check
constraint allows us to be very specific
on the data that is allowed so this
allows us to do things like between and
then you can satisfy your boss by
restricting the data to be between two
certain numbers that's really super cool
one of the other common database
management systems MySQL does not have
check constraints so you got to go an
extra step and add database triggers or
find some kind of workaround to make
this work so all of this is a way to
protect our domain integrity I wrote
constraints up here but more generally
this should be integrity and then these
are example of constraints we can use to
force domain integrity making sure we
have the right data type and the right
constraints as well as all the specific
check constraints is really all we're
going to need to make sure our domain
integrity is being a okay that really
sums up everything I got to say in this
video if anything is confusing I'm
probably gonna have videos over each one
of these things so you can go check all
those out so hopefully that was helpful
as always be sure to subscribe and if
