Caleb's video maker - and in this video
I'll be talking about these I'm walks
custom reserved pad in this box here so
yeah this this isn't the practice pad
huh
I'll be kind of wait though anyways I
did order this pad last year and it took
a really long time to get here I did end
up getting upset that it was taking so
long and I posted a video on YouTube but
they they sincerely apologize and I did
remove the video so now that I finally
got the product it's good we're good so
let me just get my knife here because I
totally didn't already open this package
so oh yeah
open just tape it's very clear tape so I
did I'd to get two of them so within
this box there are two other boxes and I
wasn't really sure the best setup for
the camera so sorry it's awkward but
here is here's what it will look like
when you get it and then I'll just bring
the game over here so here's the box
comes in pretty nice box actually I like
it I'm gonna keep that for a while - can
you open it it opens like that they do
have a cushion - you keep your fabulous
and this is what it actually looks like
so okay so here is my custom reserved
practice pad oh this is the 14-inch one
it is the single sided with the snare
mechanism the difference between the
single and the double sided is if you
get the single sided you have this one
side and then you have the snare
mechanism on the back if you get the
double sided you will have this side and
then on the back you'll have this gum
rubber stuff all the way through it but
if you have the single sided it kind of
cuts it out and you have the snare
mechanism so this is kind of like two
pads in one with the snare mechanism you
have the the front side and then the
back side so yeah even the double sided
one I'm sorry even the single side one
this one will have
this gum pad on the back alright so this
is the 14 inch you can tell they come in
either 12 or 14 inch you can tell
because of the tension rods so there's
10 of them if it's 8 and then it's the
12 inch one all right so the main parts
of this practice pad we have obviously
we have the base this is the wood base
and these are all customizable then we
have the actual rim so I like this thing
because as a rim rather than like other
practice pads that just have the pad and
no rim well this is nice then we have
the actual pad then we have this back
pad we have a snare mechanism and then
we have the tension rods okay so from
there I guess I'll just talk a little
bit about each part so for the front the
actual pad we'll talk about that first
this is a Kevlar slash carbon fiber
laminate the laminate is optional if you
don't get the laminate you have more of
like this rubber feel but if you get the
laminate it's more of like a plastic
feel I guess but there's still
16.0 160 of an inch of this gum rubber
underneath the laminate and yeah so this
is 0.262 something I don't I don't know
if the top my head but it's all on the
Diamox website when you're binds pad
will talk the description your product
it'll tell you the size of everything so
the base is the base is an inch the base
and everything else so all this the gump
at the rim and the base is an inch and
3/4 3/4 sorry it's about 7 to 9 pounds
it is really heavy if you had to carry
this I take it to school to play between
classes when I have time and it is like
super heavy so if you're looking for
something to like carry around either
get the smaller 12-inch one because that
obviously will be not as heavy or get a
different Pat from them
doesn't have as many features and weight
because it is heavy I'm not gonna lie
but it is durable it feels nice it's
better than just like a practice pad you
get from like Amazon or whatever all
right so it's enough about the the head
the rim it is removable these tension
rods that you can adjust with a drum key
see so you can actually if you wanted
you could remove this pad and replace it
with a different color
these are you can unscrew this from the
actual body of the straps pad also when
you first get this product you may want
to tighten these snares on the back a
little bit this is really adjustable so
I actually lost one of the nuts because
I'm an idiot
so I just replaced it with an i lock nut
which that's just temporary I hope to
get another one but anyways you want
these to be a little bit tighter than
finger tighten you don't want to be able
to be removed simply by using your
fingers so when you first get your snare
drum practice pad you'll want to tighten
it as much as you can with your fingers
and then probably give a couple turns
with the actual drum key if you don't
have a drum key tries using like an
adjustable wrench or a really small 8 or
12 point socket a speii 8 or 12 because
a six point is not square and these
these are square so yeah but I just try
to just want to get on the drum key
alright so the rim it's fully removable
it's nice because you can practice like
grand clicks or rim shots um some people
say that you can't really hear the rim
the difference between a red click I
guess you can only see that and a rim
shot um it is kind of hard to tell the
difference but there is some difference
so that is that is one minor concern but
it's I think it's fine I mean it doesn't
really bother me
so yeah moveable rim customizable we
have these
so indents for your sticks that they can
go across and then like they don't roll
off Fairleigh they stay on there fairly
on it's not like perfect obviously but
you have to worry about him like ruling
off super easy because like yeah now the
tension rods you can get different
colors it's pretty much all I have to
say about them base you can get
different colors and then on the other
side of the base the backside you have
this gum Roberts um so that's also like
a practice pad in itself here's I'll
show you I'm not gonna play the lot
versus this actual snare side I'll
probably play some more later so you
guys can hear bugs going over the actual
a structure of it first so that is that
pad there you can use that to play on
it's quieter and you get less of these
snare effect um so that is the the
actual gum practice pad on the back now
for the snare mechanism you have this
metal plate here that you tighten and
within this metal plate I'll show you in
a sec you actually just yeah I'll show
you later
well you tighten this to where there's a
bunch of these metal balls inside of
this plate that when you hit the snare
it vibrates the metal balls and you get
the snare sound effect a very realistic
sounding it's really awesome you want it
to be loose enough to where you get that
vibration but not so loose that there's
not enough tension because then you
don't get the snare sound but you don't
want it too tight to where it's too
tight to vibrating so think of like two
plates with these metal balls if it's
too loose you hit it the balls aren't
going to like vibrate against anything
because they're just like laying there
so you tighten it to where the it'll
vibrate make the snare sound but if you
tighten it too much it won't vibrate the
balls it'll just have a dull sound so
yeah obviously you can adjust the snare
so
out the tighter the back here the
tighter the snare sound will be and then
you tighten it too much in the snare
sound and pretty much go away completely
same thing if it's too loose it'll
pretty much go away completely
oh yeah the snare sound is the best
right in the center because that is
where the snare mechanism is on the back
so up here you kind of lose some of the
snare effect but I'm sure you can get a
good fit for you by adjusting this to
how you like this pad is awesome because
even at the smallest height stick height
you get that snare sound even like
seriously like this is a great snow
height and when you hit it it still
sounds like a snare drum and you still
get that snare drum feel okay so when
you when you buy this pad you will get
this this little piece here which you
can put on the inside of this to mute
the sound from the little metal balls
and you get just the plain sound like
that without the snare effect so I will
show you that now so as for this you can
remove these pieces here hey let me move
this nylock nut and my nylon washer you
have these little metal washers I don't
know if you can see it very well with
this camera it's probably all blurry but
anyways um with that you will want the
rubber part facing down on the metal so
you want the rubber part facing the
metal to absorb the vibrations so it
doesn't mess with your actual nuts on
here so yeah you just loosen all these
with a drum key
and finally getting there and they are
off okay now I will take off the washers
as well actually didn't lose my fourth
washer which is nice but okay so the
actual inside of this plate the plate
the inside of the plate is just plate
but inside of the kind of compartment
you have obviously of your screws which
you put your nuts on but you have these
metal balls which cause the snare effect
so you can if you really want you can
get like super into adjusting the snare
you can remove some of these or put more
in there or you can use this here this
little piece of rubber or whatever it is
I mean not entirely sure and you can put
that on and then you can put this metal
plate back on now to get these on here
you'll want the rubber side down up
those down I just I always turn this is
weird but kind of off topic I always
turn counterclockwise first to get my
threads to line up so that way I'm not
twisting on threads that don't line up
so that's just a tip for you guys if you
want your threads to line up easier um
if if it's hard to get these nuts on
just try to push down on the plate some
to give you more space on the actual
screw but after the first one it should
be pretty much fun like I said just I
tighten it to where my fingers won't
tighten any more and then I turn it a
couple times with a drum key I think
that just gets the best sound and I
don't have to worry about my actual I
have to worry about losing my nuts
castrate my snare drum okay anyways once
you have these tight on there you can
try it out and it sounds more sounds
more like a general like and it's like
really quiet you could play that like
midnight in your room and not have to
worry about your next-door parents or
neighbor waking up alright so I just
took off the mute earthing man I figure
out that's cold but anyways it does take
a while it takes a couple minutes you
saw me put that in and takes just so
much time to get it out um so you may
want to rather than do that just like
adjust your snares to where the sound
fits like wilfer like uh if it's too
loud or too quiet make it adjust it to
where it works you gotta be careful not
to tighten it too tight though I mean
you don't want to completely eliminate
the mechanism and you don't want to
break any of these nuts because that
would be bad okay so for your guys
information this is this is what it
sounds like when it's too loose right
you kind of get more that dong dong dong
dong dong rather than the chin chin chin
for the snares it just sounds like just
like a normal pad it almost sounds like
the backside just with a little more of
the spring sound
alright guys so there's only a couple of
things I want to say about this pad
before I in this video a first thing is
the price on these actual custom
reserved pads start at about 70 I think
that is where a double sided that's
without the snare mechanism 12-inch this
one was 90 starting out this is the
single sided with the snare mechanism 14
inch then you can also pay extra for the
laminate which i think is totally worth
it I think it's up to like I don't know
like 16 bucks or something I'm not too
sure maybe twelve or fourteen but the
laminate is what separates this from
like any other pad you can get that
awesome snare effect at like half an
inch or like up here all around I just
think that's awesome if you do not get
the laminate it's not quite like that
you have to like put more umph
your hits to get that snare effect so
down here you're not going to get that
awesome snare sound then you can also
get certain colors for the bass which
would cost you like an extra four
dollars and then you can buy other
things with the snare pad so you can get
extra rim extra tension or lots
different colors different color rims to
like replace if you want or you get like
a stick tape or sticks or metronome
pretty much like a bunch of stuff that
will add obviously that I'll add a bunch
to your price and then you
for shipping and finally if you live in
California to pay tax but overall this
thing costed me like 135 or so and it
was buy one get one free for me so I got
two for 135 but I don't think that sales
going on anymore obviously because sale
doesn't last an entire year so yeah you
can expect to pay around for like this
exact copy you can expect around a 135
or you get it a lower end one for around
90
that's what's shipping and everything if
that's still too much for you if you're
just a beginner and you're not sure you
want to invest that much you can get
different bags from zai mocks for
cheaper yeah so you might want to look
into that okay so as for the actual
looks of this practice Pat it looks
flippin sweet on the rim makes it look
really awesome for one you can customize
it like completely so your friend wants
a blue practice pad you want a green
practice pad you can get a green one he
can get a blue one it's it's exactly
what you want so the look of the drum
varies but it always satisfies the
customer because you get just what you
want I got pretty much all black with
chrome tension rods and a yellow Kevlar
uh laminate so yeah this is exactly what
I wanted the only thing I would like is
a black all black one so I can if I
wanted I could buy new stuff but anyway
so the look of it is awesome guys for
the sound it sounds awesome
you can get that nice sound like I
mentioned earlier it's very beautiful
and the sound it sounds like an
instrument rather than a practice pad
house bad
versus something like this like you
wants to listen so yeah you can actually
use this for performance aspects like I
can perform something for my family or
my friends without annoying everyone
within a 50 mile radius it's quiet
enough to where I can perform joyfully
without annoying people ears I can
practice in my room but it's loud enough
to where I can use it to play for other
people rather than just a little rubber
pad it is kind of loud so if you want a
quieter you can either use the back side
or you can use the sponge to mute the
metal balls and the snare mechanism now
for the feel feel of the actual drum
when you play it it feels like a real
drum that's like the best part I've used
other practice pads and this one is the
one that feels the most like an actual
marching snare drum at the same exact
feel it feels great um you don't have
like you don't have this gel feel like
that you feel that the sticks are doing
all the work and you're not really
getting any work out of it you're not
just sitting here throwing your arms
down and letting the sticks bounce all
around it's springy
but it's controllable it's not like
playing on a gel pad like this where you
don't really feel like you're getting
any work out of your hits
it's like it just bounces around but at
the same time it's not too hard solid
that you are like playing on a pillow or
something it's like the perfect feel for
practicing you're my opinion
and also you have the back side which is
a little more of the gel feel if you
like that that free-flowing feel oh yeah
oh there's multiple ads for different
personalities well it's not like this
click on this pad yeah I like this rock
side that requires a lot of a lot of
forearm it's not like that but it's not
also like this
this is gel side right you feel like
you're getting no workout it's like a
perfect balance so it feels great all
the rim makes things awesome I can
practice rim shots practice rim part my
ring links or Knox or whatever you can
do stick tricks on it fairly easily it's
bouncy enough to do that it's really
awesome
just all-around awesome I can do a drum
roll with this rule but seriously as for
rolls it's like the perfect amount of
rebound to where you can do each
individual stroke and when you're faster
speeds you can still kind of maintain it
not super great with fast rolls but you
can even triple rolls
feels great buzzer will sound awesome by
the way see ya in conclusion this is a
great product if you are interested you
