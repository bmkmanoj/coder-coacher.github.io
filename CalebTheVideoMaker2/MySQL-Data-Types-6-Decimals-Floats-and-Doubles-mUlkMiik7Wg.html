that will include decimals like six
point four for example all right now
first things first real right here it's
the same thing as a double for my SQL or
my sequel Oh Dinah mean cross that out
I should cross out real so just forget
about rule for now so we have decimal
float and double and I will be going
over decimal first and explaining
everything about that and then I'll be
going over floats and doubles together
then that'll be comparing all three of
them if you remember with like varchar'
and also int you could put parentheses
and put more information in here that
would alter what was allowed now for
integer and gistic affected the display
for this there's actually two so what is
commonly used are the variables m and B
but I mean you don't really need to know
that you just need to know what they do
so if you replace this with a six and D
with a three
all right so six is the precision three
is the scale
so what precision is is how many digits
are in the number and scale is how many
digits after the decimal so 300 point
zero
this is has a precision of six one two
three four five six and a scale of three
one two three so this can go all the way
up to 65 and then the scale can go all
the way up to 35 this means it can have
35 decimals after 35 digits after the
decimal which leaves 20 before the
decimal another thing this number right
here can never be larger than this
because that'd be saying okay you can
have four digits total but you're having
five after the decimal so basically
that's impossible
okay now if you don't actually put
anything in here you just don't put
anything the defaults are ten and zero
so precision of 10 and then the scale of
zero and that allows for 10 before the
decimal and then zero after the decimal
which that's kind of stupid because and
then it's not really a decimal if you
think about it it's more of an integer I
mean that's just the way the minute
float and double I hope you can see that
it's kind of dark over here so a float
it's a real number which means it allows
for decimals and it's single precision
mmm 32-bit number compared to this which
is a 64-bit number so basically this
number is way larger than this number
but well the allowed number so basically
if you don't need to store a huge number
then there's no reason to use this
because you don't want to use more than
you need it's waste and it can demand
more of your computer for like for some
instances and may require more RAM to
use a double comparative float all right
now afloat it's accurate just up to
approximately seven decimal spaces so we
got a decimal so let's see a six point
one two three four five six seven
anymore after that when you do math or
actually when you just store the number
and you retrieve it it can change on you
and be inaccurate and a double so that's
not good at all a double is accurate up
to about 15 so if you need more accuracy
then you want to use a double obviously
so if you want as much accuracy
out of these two you will use a double
because it's accurate 15 when you need
exact accuracy you will not want to use
flow or double because as I said they
can be inaccurate as times you want to
use decimal instead now when you don't
need exact accuracy with large decimals
you can use float or double and
obviously you don't wanna use one that's
not going to be as accurate as you need
if you need accuracy twelve digits in
then just approximate accuracy then flow
is not what you want because remember it
only goes seven where the double goes
accuracy of about fifteen decimal in the
other hand is it's accurate
now the reason is it's actually a double
stored as a string and that allows for
exact accuracy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
