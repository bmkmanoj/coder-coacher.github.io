series if this video is helpful please
be sure to subscribe so now that we know
a little bit about is set and not empty
we're going to understand how those work
in conditional statements all right so
first let's look at is theft because
that's what we learned
first as we know it tests if it's set
that means anything besides null so over
here on the false side is normal over
here on the true side is everything else
so this is true this is false so the
only way it's going to be false if the
value is null and because text boxes
such as username if you don't put
anything in them it's considered an
empty string an empty string is not null
so this evaluates as true so what we
need to do is use this for stuff that
does not have a text input such as
gender you just select male or female
not empty on the other hand it's going
to evaluate as true or false it will
evaluate as false if it's either an
empty string 0 false or null so that
means if we have a text box and we leave
it empty well that's an empty string
it's going to be evaluated as false
that's just a quick overview of what the
last video covered and that is what
we're going to be understanding in this
video to create conditionals if
statements alright so the basics of an
if statement looks like this
basically if whatever we put in here is
evaluated as true this whatever we write
between these bars is going to be ran so
within
these curly Britta oh man I'm fried it's
like 2:00 a.m. but between these
parentheses what we do is we can test if
something is set within these
parentheses so basically what I just did
is I put the function is set with the
parentheses so basically this I put that
within a set of parentheses so that
means this right here goes within
parenthesis that's why you have two
parentheses at the end so basically is
set parentheses all of this goes within
a pair of parentheses so you get this
double parentheses thing so I'm just
gonna rewrite this so it's clear if it's
set and then we run it well we have to
test something if it's set or not well
we can do is within the is set we use
something such as request gender so this
represents the value that someone put in
into our HTML form so you have two
options either male or female if you
check this well then it's set if you
don't check anything it's not set if you
check this it's set so if you check
either one it's set if you leave it
blank it's not set pretty
self-explanatory well we can put this
within the is set function so now this
is what we have
whoops request gender let me close with
the square bracket close the is set
function so all this and then we close
the if statement and then we have an
open brace so this is the complexity of
just testing if gender is set so how
does this all work out all right we look
I always start in the middle I'll work
my way out so first we have gender
within these square brackets this points
to an HTML form which had the two
options either M or F right now what we
do from there is we say if they put a
value so if this is set it's going to
evaluate as true pretty simple then
within our if statement because it
evaluates as true whatever what we have
within these curly braces is ran so what
we can do if it has a value we can
assign it to a shorthand variable for
example so gender equals well is a sign
I should say request gender I'm not a
room here all right so now what's going
to happen if this is brand as true so
that means it has a value well this
right here is going to be R and that
means we are going to assign the value
stored within the super global array
which would be let's say it's a guy for
example ginger would point to man right
that means we are signing gender the
value male right pretty simple not too
complex now let's here I wrote this out
here again earlier for some reason just
so you can see it clearly right that
this is the next example I'm sorry I'm
going crazy so we can also use not empty
such 3-star this is for use this is used
for string input values such as name
password email stuff like that if
statement now within this statement
within here we put the not empty
function which will either return true
or false and within here was Travis
crappy we've put the value of the tests
or the input value so we would say
request and then curly square brackets
we would put whatever it is so it could
be email right so this is basically how
its collapsed which then once we put all
that together it will look like this
pretty complex but it's really not that
bad
basically we get the value of email
within our request which is an array
which stores email this is the key and
it points to whatever the email is right
so we get the request we check if it's
not empty so if it has a value that
means it will evaluate as true then
within the if statement if it's true
that means we will execute whatever that
code is so basically this is going to
test the value and if it's true we're
going to do something basically we can
assign it to a shorthand so that means
if it has a value assign it to the
shorthand variable email that way we can
easily use it as a string in the future
or if it's false we could make it no so
let me just show you what I have here
basically uh let me just show you if
it's not empty the requests name then we
that means it has a value which means we
assign it to the shorthand variable name
if it doesn't have a value though we set
name equal to false or null side we set
equal to null which means later in our
script we can say we could test it so
once it has a value either null as you
can see we assigned it the value null if
it doesn't have a value so if it has a
value
gets whatever the value is as the
shorthand variable if it doesn't have a
value we set it to no that means later
in our script we could do a test like
this if email and then we can open our
brackets so what this is going to do is
it's just going to test the value of
email so that means if it's true it's
going to have the value of whatever the
email is if it's false then that means
it's normal so basically if this was the
one executed it's going to have this
value if this was executed it's going to
have null and the way this works is it
converts that into either true or false
or value no value which means we can do
anything such as echo back the email
echo blah blah or do whatever we want
really within the script and this with
when we combine a bunch of tests such as
for the name username password all the
stuff we can do a giant if statement
which tests if they're all true which
means the person used every single field
within the HTML form so yeah that's the
basics and scan pretty complex so I will
be doing an on-screen video where I will
be actually showing this but I just got
to explain a couple things first so I
will see you in the next video please be
