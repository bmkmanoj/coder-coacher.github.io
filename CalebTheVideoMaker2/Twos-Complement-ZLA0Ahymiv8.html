over tubes complement in binary systems
if you have no idea what that is and you
just accidentally ran into this video or
you need to learn about it for something
or if you know what it is and you want
to learn more about it
well two's-complement is a method used
to store negative values in binary so if
you know anything about how binary works
basically you have zeros and ones zero
is zero and then we have one which is
one and then to represent two we have to
go to the next place value and put one
zero and we can keep doing that adding
more place values and so forth but how
do we represent a negative value because
if you notice the numbers only got
bigger well this is something known as a
sign bit some work with binary let's say
we have the number 101 this every single
one of these placeholders is known as a
bit so a bit is just 1 or 0 that's what
a bit is 1 when we have 8 bits we would
say we have a byte and so forth so if
you know about bytes a body consists of
8 bits so a bit is just a 1 or a 0 a
sign bit is used to represent a negative
value in binary so let me let's say we
have a a 3 bit word length that means we
have 3 bits in the number system and
we're going to represent every single
possible value we can make with 3 bits
if you watch my introduction to binary
video this may look familiar to you so
we had 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
oops my bad
and so on come on Caleb get it together
one zero one one one so here's how you
represent 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so as you can
see the highest number we have highest
value is 7 1 1 1 and we have a total of
8 values 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 the reason it's
not 7 we have to include the zero so
this is 7 not 8 with 8 total values well
so we have a range from 0 to 7 well how
can we represent negative values well we
could use a sign bit and let's say we
could say the first bit farthest left
the first left bit we could use this as
a sign bit to represent whether the
number is positive or negative
so we could say 0 is positive and one is
negative so now you can see we can
represent positive numbers and negative
numbers there's only a problem there's a
1 problem here for example this is 0
this is 1 2 3 this is negative 0 which
is another problem we'll get in that in
a second negative 1 negative 2 negative
3 so now all we can represent is
negative 3 all the way to positive 3 so
the same same amount of values besides
the double 0 thing so one less value
actually and the highest number is 3 the
lowest number is negative 3 so basically
we just move the range to cover some
negative numbers well the other problem
with this system is well you can see we
have two zeros positive zero and
negative 0 that means we have two values
that pretty much mean the same thing so
the total range of values is one less
because if we have 0 in there twice we
get negative 3 negative 2 negative 1 0 1
2 &amp;amp; 3
how many values is this one two three
four five six seven so now I only have
seven possible values because zero is in
there twice
well two's complement is a strategy to
fix this problem it still has a sign bit
so you need to know about sign bits and
if the first digit to the left the first
of the farthest left digit I should say
if it's a zero it's positive if it's a
one it's negative so this is a negative
number that is a positive number
so how does this work well every single
number in binary has a two's complement
equivalent so let's say we have the
number one right and it's a positive one
that means we have zero one okay now we
can basically store these within a bit
word let's say the bit word length is
eight bits that means we have to take up
eight spots eight so now we can
represent this as zero zero zero zero
zero zero zero one
now if you remember before we had zero
one and we said this was the sign bit
that's because it's the farthest left
zero so it doesn't mean this one it
means this one so I put it in an a bit
to represent that it's not this one but
this one now we can convert this to
what's known as two's complement and to
do this here's what we do we invert
every single bit within this bit word so
now we get 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 and then
that's the first step so the first step
is to invert every single digit all the
zeros we come once we just dry it down 1
one but ones become zeros and then the
next step is to add one so that's zero
we're if we add one this is now going to
become oops one so this this number
right here this is a representation for
negative one so that is negative one so
to convert back what we can do let's say
we have negative one now one this is
negative one
what we can do is convert them all to
zeros or no basically switch it so if
this was a zero for example it will
become a one but in this case they're
all ones so all we have to do is make
them all zeros five six seven eight
and then what we do just like in the way
to convert to two's complement to make
it positive we also add one this is
positive one from negative makes more
sense
now why do we use this system well the
very first thing is we only have one
zero so for example this is zero
we can't convert this to binary because
if we converted it to binary
we'll get one on one one get one two
three four five six seven eight ones and
then we add one so we would basically
push all these over and then we would
get one zero zero zero zero zero zero
zero zero
well we're stuck in 8-bit word lengths
this mean this 9th bit we just added is
the overflow system gets rid of it so
now it just cuts it off and we're stuck
with zero zero zero zero zero zero zero
zero that is still the same thing as
this
so the two's complement four zero the
negative zero it doesn't work so we have
an extra value we can use with an 8-bit
system the other thing we can do is we
can work instead of subtracting binary
we can always use addition so I just
created a video over addition and
subtraction of binary numbers well we
can use the addition system to you with
two's complement to do a few things we
can subtract as well as add so we
actually use addition to subtract it's
kind of weird but I'll get into it we
can also subtract numbers that are
smaller so like let's say we have this
number here positive number and I have
another positive number right there all
right as you can say this number is
bigger than this number so we can use
subtraction for that but what if we
reflect these and put this one on top
and this one on bottom and we just
wanted to subtract them well we're going
to get a negative number which we can't
do that with normal binary subtraction
without getting super complicated and
adding and sign but in having to worry
about double zeros and so forth so we
have two's complement which we can use
to subtract larger numbers from smaller
numbers when we're working with this
two's complement system let's say we are
in a 4-bit word system and we want to
represent - well that do is represented
like this in binary because this is the
twos place well if we're in a 4-bit word
system it would be like this this
represents positive - so this first bit
on the left so not the first pit but the
first one on the left
so the farthest left bit work bit is the
sign bit which tells whether it's
positive or negative hopefully you got
that by now so we could also have which
by the way is not negative two because
we did not do the processing but this is
a negative number so let's figure out
how we can represent negative two well
first we change all the digits so one
one zero one we we invert them and then
what we do is we add 1 so 1 1 0 1 + 0 0
0 1 to do this well we add these and we
get 1 0 1 1 1 or you can just think of
rather than 1 we get up - but it doesn't
really matter so here is a
representation of negative 2 so now we
could also use this system to represent
just mathematics so let's try to - I
mean 2 plus negative 2 so we have
0:01 oh this is too and we convert that
I forget what I had so we had one so we
had one one one zero this is negative
two so we basically have positive two
plus negative two so how does that work
well if you know much about math adding
a negative is basically the same thing
as subtraction that looks bad
basically this you can think of this as
adding for example let's say I have five
hundred dollars okay
I have five hundred dollars or whatever
currency are using in your country in my
bank okay and then I get a bill for five
hundred dollars I add in a bill of five
hundred dollars so now what is a bill a
bill in general is designed to subtract
money so if you think about it I'm
adding and taking away money I'm adding
the bill in which takes away five
hundred dollars so it's sort of like
adding negative five hundred dollars
which in reality is like subtraction so
with the two two's complement system we
can use subtraction by adding a negative
number and we can use addition as well
so that is why the two's complement
system is good we don't have to worry
about subtraction we can use all
addition so well what is two - I'm sorry
two plus negative two or two - two well
the answer is going to be zero so we can
try to work this out and figure out what
we're going to get so we can just ignore
this this over here we add these
together 0 plus 0 is 0 1 plus 1 we have
to carry the 1 drop a 0 1 + 1 carry the
1 drop a 0 1 + 1 carry the 1 drop a 0
so this is the ones place twos place for
place eights place 16s bit place so the
answer is 16 that's not right what's
with what's up with that well if you
look we're in a 4-bit word system this
limit allows this to work so basically
we can only have one two three four bits
anything after that is ignored so now
our answer is zero which is the correct
answer
let's try something such as 4-6 well the
the actual result is going to be
negative 2 this is because we subtract 6
from 4 so to represent to being able to
sorry for us to do this in two's
complement we're going to make this 4
plus negative 6 pretty much the same
thing I talked about this earlier so
let's do this first let's figure out the
binary value of 4 so we have the ones
place twos place force place so 1 0 0
here is the VAT binary value of 4 we
also have a sign bit so we're in a 4-bit
system we then we're going to figure out
the two's complement of 6 in order for
us to do this we first find 6 1 1 oh
right
so here is 6 this is because this is the
eighths I mean the fourth place and its
second to place 4 plus 2 equals 6
now we convert this so 1 0 0 1 basically
flip all the bits to the opposite and
then we add 1 so we get 1 0 1 0 so here
is the two's complement of negative 6
shoot what was it again
I don't know so I'm going to be a real
quick game 0 1 I had 101 oh so this
right here is basically saying 4 plus
negative 6 then we added 0 1 1 1 alright
so now we have a two's complement
negative representation of a value so
now we have to figure out what this
value represents so we convert it the
other way around so we put all these
we get zero zero zero one and we add one
zero zero one zero is the final result
this right here this is the equivalent
of two that means this right here is the
two's complement representation of
negative two pretty complex system but
it works and we can do more complex
mathematics with the to complement
system so this is a binary
representation of negative two we can
try another one if you would like let's
try to figure out eight minus sixteen so
what place value is 16 1 2 4 8 16 so we
have five bits plus a sign bit so we
need a total of six bits so we are at 6
bit word six bit word lengths all right
so this is what's required first let's
figure out what eight is one two four
eight here is eight now let's figure out
what sixteen is so we are going to
subtract 16 from eight another way to
represent this is 8 plus negative 16 so
let's figure out the negative value of
16 so let's first figure out 16 which
would be 1 0 0 0 0 that's because this
is the 16th place and then we convert
this so 16 we convert it to two's
complement with the negative sign so we
just flip all of these bits and then we
add 1 so the final result is going to be
1 1 0 0 0 0 okay so this is negative
16 1 1 0 0 0 0 we're going to add these
these become 0
these become 0 these become 0 this
becomes 1 this becomes 1 and this
becomes 1 so this is the value we have
now this is a representation of a
negative value so we have to figure out
what negative value it's representing
that means we have to convert it to a
positive number by reversing the two's
complement system so we get 0 1
I'm sorry not one sign 0 0 0 1 1 1 now
we said we add 1 so this becomes 1 0 0 0
what is this value well - I mean 1 2 4 8
so it's in the eights place so that
means the final value we got was 8 and
if you remember what we started with we
started with 8 minus 16 so the final
value is negative 8 which is correct so
that is the example of two's complement
so in quick review two's complement is a
system we can use to represent binary
values a good thing about it is there's
no double zeros so the only 0 value is 0
0 0 and however many bits you have this
is because the these two two's
complement
represented representation for negative
0 would become 1 1 1 1 plus 1 which give
us 1 0 0 0 this is in the overflow bit
because we're on because we're obviously
in a 4-bit system we have 1 2 3 4 so
it's going to go back to 0 0 0 0 pretty
awesome I know so the way we convert a
positive number to a negative number so
if we have 1 0 1 this is equal to 4 5
and it's positive so we're in a 4-bit
system we've converted like this 1 0 1 0
we flip all the bits so if it's 0 it
becomes 1
it's one becomes zero and then we add 1
so this up here is 5 this down here is
negative 5 and then we can also convert
it back by doing the same process 0 1 0
0 adding 1 1 and this becomes 5 again
alright so then we can use this to do
mathematics we can always use addition
because we can subtract by having a
pause we can have a number over here and
we can add a negative number so this is
going to come out as 0 you can also use
two's complement to do things such as 18
minus 24 which is going to come out as
negative 6 the only thing is you're
going to have to convert the negative 6
two's complement value into non two's
complement value - to figure out what
value it represents so it will come out
when once you convert oh come on is
positive that is because we are figuring
out what number it represents in two bit
VAT in the two's complement system so
let's say we have a value just ignore
this let's say we have a value 1 1 101
oh this is a negative number we
automatically know it's a negative
number but what negative number is it we
have to convert it to a positive number
to figure out so we flip all the signs
and then we add one so we get 0 1 1 0
which this is equal to 6 so this is
negative 6
right here it's negative 6 its negative
6 negative 6 negative 6 so that's pretty
much a sum a quick review of everything
for two's complement hopefully that was
helpful if it wasn't be sure to comment
and tell me what I could improve upon or
whatever else so thank you be sure to
