going to be creating our MySQL variables
and something awesome about SQL fiddle
that I wanted to share with you guys is
that when you create something like this
it has a unique identifier you can see
up here in the URL bar we have this code
here and what you can do is you can take
this code and I'll show you guys let me
open a new tab and paste that and Wow
it opens up to exactly the same thing so
that means as I code stuff I can put
this little identifier in the
description and you can open it and jump
right to where I am if you get lost or
can't seem to figure out what I'm doing
and then you'll be right up to speed
with me so that's really cool so be sure
to check the descriptions for these
including this one to get right where we
are right now for the rest of this video
we are going to focus on the query panel
let's create some of our own variables
we start with the Select command and
then we give it a name let's call a
variable 1 and we'll give it a value 5
the other way is using the Select so we
need to say a variable 2 and then we can
give it a value using colon equals hello
make sure I put that as a string and now
let's run this SQL so as you should have
expected the set did not return anything
but this one did and it returned the
value of the variable perfect now let's
just go over a little more in depth
example let's create a couple variables
variable 2 we'll assign the value 10 and
then let's create another one variable 3
and it's assign at the value negative 7
we can reference multiple variables
within a select so let's try select
variable one variable 2 and variable 3
and now we can see all of our values
down here and we can actually add those
together so let's say we want another
column and we're going to say variable 1
plus variable 2 plus variable 3 awesome
seems to be working just fine another
thing we can even assign this value to
another variable so we're going to make
it variable 4 colon equals let's run
that yeah and it's still 8 so everything
seems to be working good and then later
I can reference variable 4 again gotta
remember to put my semicolon now we get
2 responses 8 8 great so everything's
working out now let's go over an example
of what can happen if you forget this :
let's just start from scratch here let's
say we have a variable and we're gonna
name it ID and give it the value 1 and
we're going to select everything from
the pets table we're ID is equal to ID
let's run it great so we're getting back
this row and that is the row from this
table over here that we want to get well
let's say somewhere in our SQL we want
to change that ID so we make a select
and we put ID colon equals 2 this should
work out just fine make sure we put that
semicolon and let's run it perfect we
are now getting the second row in our
table well you could see if we forgot to
put this colon and we ran it the
response is still the first row so that
might confuse you if you don't know what
you're doing another thing the response
from this select here is a zero what
does that mean well this is actually
being evaluated as true or false so
we're asking is ID equal to two and if
it's false it's going to return zero if
it's true it's going to return 1
so let's turn this to let's let's say we
set this to five and we check to see if
the ID is equal to five let's run it and
the response is one so it is and that's
awesome here because we can check the
value of a variable but it's not always
awesome if we're trying to assign it a
value such as 50 and then we get a zero
as a return result that's not what we're
expecting so make sure if you are
assigning to use the colon equals and
also even in set you can still use a
colon equals and a lot of people will do
this just for consistency sake so they
always think colon equals as the
assignment that will prevent them from
accidentally leaving it out and to
select just because they know anytime
they need to assign a value to a
variable they have to use a colon equals
and then they won't get funky results
which this isn't gonna do anything
because we're selecting a row that
doesn't exist the ID of five another
thing guys I wanted to show you is you
can always search things on Google and
find the MySQL reference and it is
really cool so here is an example that's
very similar to what I showed you
wherever creating some variables and
then we're selecting those variables and
then making an assignment within that it
also talks about using the colon equals
and the just be equals and it says how
the one without the colon is treated as
the comparison operator but for now
that's all I have to say about variables
thanks guys I'll see you in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
