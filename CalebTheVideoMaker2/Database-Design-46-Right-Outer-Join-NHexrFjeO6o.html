be a continuation of the last video
about left joints so let's get right to
it
we're gonna be talking about right outer
joins now the right outer joins work
basically the same way as the left outer
joins but instead of the left table it's
going to be the right table that keeps
all those a good throws now if you don't
know what I'm talking about please watch
the last video or two that's gonna
solidify your knowledge and you'll be
like ready to tackle this because I'm
not trying to get you to watch my other
videos I'm trying to teach you something
that's a requirement to understand this
and I don't have to reteach at all for
the sake of one little concept so let's
draw this out a little bit we have it to
where we have two tables hey use a
customer table and a card table so this
would be like for a bank or something
and let's first see how what a left join
would do a left join would take all of
these customers and then it'll take only
the cards that have an Associated
customer and return those so we return
we basically connect the dots and then
we would get a joint view which is going
to list all of the customers but only
the cards that have a customer so it's
just gonna be like customer list a card
they have and if they have another card
it's gonna list that customer again list
the card they have and we discussed that
in depth in the last video well for a
right joint it's going to work the same
way except now it's going to do it for
the other team so we're gonna the same
exact set up we're gonna have a card I
mean a customer and card table and now
if we set it up with a right outer join
it's going to take all of the cards put
them in the join table so we'll have
every single card and then it will list
the associated owner of that card so car
and end the customer now there's
something to consider with this if we
set it to where within the card table we
have
customer ID we give that column
characteristic of not know that's gonna
that might confuse you a little bit
because then every single card here is
going to have an Associated customer
which kind of that's the whole point of
the right outer join or they left outer
join for that sake is to include the
rows that don't have that association so
if it's set to not null it's going to
return them all anyways whether you use
the right outer join and and so forth
you guys understand because basically if
we use the right outer join for this
it's going to return them all but it's
going to return them all anyways because
every single one has an Associated card
what discuss that more in the future
don't worry about it now there's
something else to consider this
basically works the same exact way as
the left outer join
except it's switched around so when we
discussed in the last video how you
could say which table was the left right
where the from Z up basically the form
would be like a select maybe and then
you'd have like the columns first name
last name and card amount or um you
could have yeah card amount oh that's
good and then you have something that
says like from well the column that you
put right here or the table you put
right there it's considered left when
we're talking about this design stuff so
in theory you could switch it around to
where left join works the same way as a
right join you're just switching the
direction of the tables so in practice
most people don't even use your right
joins I'm only teaching you so you
understand when you see one instead of
using a right join they'll often use a
left join and then they'll just flip the
column the tables I'm sorry so like this
if you have your two tables and I'll
give you two possibilities that are
gonna give the same result you could
have your customer and then the card and
you can use a right outer join or you
could have it to where you have over
here you have the card and the customer
with the same exact columns and same
exact foreign keys nothing changed
except InDesign you just switch the
things and when you make the SQL
statement you're gonna switch the
location of the call of the tables
within that statement but overall the
function works exactly the same and now
you're going to use a left outer join
these are going to return the same exact
thing because if you do this one it's
going to return all of these rows and
the associated columns with those rows
if you do this it's gonna return all of
those rows and all the associated
columns those are us so either way
you're getting all the cards and part of
the customers see so in practice a lot
of people only use left outer joins for
consistency and clarity so if someone
else sees it they already know it's a
left outer join they don't have to worry
about left or right and then draw it out
and get all confused most people just
use the left outer joins but you can
always use read our joins if you really
wish that is up to you so yeah that's
all for right outer joins there's one
other type of join which we have not
discussed and that's full outer join
