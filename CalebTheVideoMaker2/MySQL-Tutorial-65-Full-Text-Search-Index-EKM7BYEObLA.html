like 300 videos ago I told you I would
eventually go over full-text indexes
well that's what we're doing that means
we're done with the functions whoa
ha ha that feels good but but anyways
I'm going over full text now full text
is an index what this means is it
basically allows for quicker searching
now it takes content from whatever you
index and you can search it almost like
a search engine you see so um within
parenthesis you can actually put more
than one column so let's say we have a
restaurant and you can send reviews for
like comment reviews like messages you
say like great food and stuff well you
can actually in full text index multiple
columns such as the title of the review
and the actual review but when you're
going to search back you have to search
those two together you can to search the
just the message so if you wanted to
search just a message you'd have to
create a full text for just the message
so for a full text index so you must
have a my I Sam table type this is the
storage engine type there is also nodb
and there's a couple others that you may
use in your databasing career or your
databasing adventure
whatever you look at it is so this so
those are the couple rules there's also
my some other searching rules that they
follow for example some words are really
popular so if you're searching for those
single words will actually ignore them I
can't think those are called stop words
you can look up on the mysql reference
manual and you can find out what words
are ignored my nose itches um but
anyways and also words that are under
four characters long will be ignored
because they're not I don't even know
why
but just because they're under four
characters so they ignore them if 50% or
more of the results are returned due to
your search because they have the
relative content then actually no search
results are returned basically that's
saying this word is too common to get a
data detailed search for it that
actually works good so basically has to
be under 50% of the results containing
this information now what you do is
after a where clause so you have a
select clause first select blah blah
blah blah blah where and then you get
say the word match MATC H MATC H match
and then within parentheses you put
columns that were part of your index so
if let's say we have the reviews concept
we have the reviews right here reviews
column and then you say against now then
here you say the words that you want to
search for so we can say against taste
now what this will do is it will search
reviews that have the key term taste you
see so now this is over for K this is
over four characters over three
characters so if over half of the
results have relevant content to taste
then none will be displayed now if you
were to put multiple words in here you
would not put a comma so I could say
taste something about our pizza
and money no cost so now if something is
related to these things it'll come up in
the search and the ones with the most
relevant content to your search will
come up first so basically all you have
to do is say match what columns against
what terms and you just have to practice
it and you'll get used to it after a
while so try that out and that's all for
this video and in the next I will be
talking about what they call in boolean
mode I don't know what that is so it's
not scary but trust me it's easy and
this is just basically an extension for
this that will allow you to choose what
words are more important than others so
please also one last thing I forgot to
say the words here should be in
parentheses I'm not parentheses sorry oh
yeah they're in parentheses but then
they also need to be in quotes so like
that taste pizza and cost</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
