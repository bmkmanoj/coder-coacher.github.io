with me still so in this video I'm going
to explain one more type of input or
form this or whatever you want to call
it but it's pretty much useless without
another script that's why I put it off
to last and this is actually the upload
option so on some websites you'll see
like a button to upload files and it's
actually an input type equals file and
you can have an a name for this just
upload it or whatever so this is what it
looks like choose file and then you can
select something so by M and then it
shows up right there but it doesn't do
anything once you click it this is
because I don't have a script to process
it but it works as a file selection
looks cool for one but uh choose file I
don't know how to change that word right
there
I've tried value equals cool but I don't
know how it doesn't seem to work so I'm
not sure if there is a way to change it
or if I'm stupid so if you guys know let
me know but I'm pretty sure you can't
change that it's the default unless you
use some sort of JavaScript upload
button or something like that but that
is the input type of file and that's
pretty much all I'm gonna go into that
I'm not even gonna put it on our form
because we don't need we don't need to
upload a file to register for a website
so unless you're like uploading a
picture or something which that's
different so let's do a quick review
first of all we have a form with the
action of where this information goes if
I submit it it goes to my valide form
data PHP script but I changed that to
Bob's on me to print it I changed it so
it actually gives me options for years
which that was this person that was uh
something I did so it pretty much works
fine how it is but because we don't have
a PHP script anyways the method it's
blank because we don't we don't have a
method either because we're not using
PHP or designing HTML forms now the
fieldset and legend fieldset mixes box
here right legend is this right here
that that's the legend of the box what
the box is about awesome now each of
these things are entered in a paragraph
form so all these are grouped in
paragraphs so then we have a label for
each one so we have label enter your
user name input type 2x blah blah same
thing for the password remember password
covers up the letters but it's still not
a security method because we can inspect
the elements and change that to the text
oops
and remember you're not supposed to hack
your friends that share my videos on
their stuff don't do that so sex is a
radio button so we you can only select
one checkboxes you can select multiple
and then birthday or drop-down box these
were generated with PHP but you could
just as easily type it out if you have
all day I'm just not I just don't have
all day it's already 10:25 I'm working
on videos since like 4 o'clock so I
don't have time to do all that crap now
this right here this little bar here I'm
pretty sure this is a a browser thing
not an HTML thing it doesn't let me
shrink it smaller than what I allowed it
to be I gave it 6 hours and 34 columns
but I'm pretty sure the idea of making
it larger is a Google Chrome thing
let me try an internet explorer
you might copy this no flag come on here
we go
X out of that one it's not working
anyways so with HTC this this one
doesn't have the draggy bar so this is
what our our form looks like in Internet
Explorer so when you're developing with
HTML and CSS it's very important that
you try different browsers as well as
cell phones and tablets so if you can
get your files online you can do that
locally using xampp so i'll show you a
little bit about that right now
I am an Apache friends org /e in English
if you speak English
ford slash xampp dot HTML then you can
download it for Windows and then you can
download the Installer which right there
and then the Installer which I don't
need to download it because I already
have it but what this does is it allows
you to run locally on your computer and
you can pour it forward that to allow
other computers to get on to it or you
can buy some sort of hosting like I have
here which my hosting sucks so I'm gonna
get new one a new hosting service soon
but yeah I could all I could also test
these HTML pages on my website if I just
downloaded some File Transfer Protocol
mechanism such as FileZilla so FileZilla
is how I get my files on my website so
that's pretty much all you need to know
about that I just thought I'd do a quick
review and give you some extra
information this video is kind of short
but I don't have anything else to say so
I will see you in the next video thank
you be sure to share this video and like
it and subscribe to my youtube channel
