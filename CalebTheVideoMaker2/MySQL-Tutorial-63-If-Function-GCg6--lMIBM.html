this video I will be talking about the
if function now normally you'll hear as
the if statement
well this isn't a statement because in
MySQL it's used as a function it looks
like this if and then there's
parentheses that is how you define a
function with the parentheses we'll take
three things within these parentheses we
will have a test that we put here so
test this and if it's true return this
and if it's false return this so how
this works is let's say 4 is greater
than 5 if 4 is greater than 5 it's like
English if 4 is greater than 5 call cups
now if it's false we could say call your
mom and tell her that 4 is greater than
5 which she'll be completely confused
because it's not so basically if 4 is
greater than 5
call the cops so you just read it like
English just read it so let's just
ignore this right here and pretend it is
true ignore this pretend this is true or
test it if this is true if 4 is greater
than 5 come call the cops you you see
it's like English that's why I like the
way this is set up rather than some
examples with other programming
languages that you can't necessarily
read but if it's false call your mom so
you better be calling your mom so I know
this it's like a really stupid example
and you're not really going to get the
opportunity to use this for MySQL like
this I'll give you another example so if
I have a database with a bunch of people
in it I want to select their name and
run some tests on their name so we do
create a select statement and this
probably isn't the best example either
but you know me I always give horrible
examples it's what I do
so select we're going to select the name
come what else are we going to select
well we're going to create a temporary
column and it's going to be if within
parentheses I can say name equal to
Caleb curry within within quotation
marks marks if select name if name is
equal to Caleb curry then I want you to
do something and if it's not that only
should do something else so then I can
say I can put Caleb keurig in and quote
to quotation marks now what this will do
is name is equal to Caleb curry you
could say it's Caleb curry or I could
say you know me read something better is
awesome haha stupid chalkboard is
awesome
so if name is Caleb curry I want you to
display is awesome so we'll say Caleb
curry is awesome but if it's a non Caleb
curry don't you put a comma and then I
want you to say is even awesomer which
other it's not a word awesome it is now
it's even awesomer so this is our entire
function right here alright so I know
it's a mess so let me just try and work
our way through this it's going to
select the name from the database so we
have our database here and we have
columns and rows and it's going to say
all right here's the name here's the age
here's their address and it's going to
say Oh Caleb all this guy's name is John
right and it's going to say if name is
equal to Caleb and it's going to create
our result table it's since we're
selecting the name it's going to say
Caleb John and let's say someone else
spilled right here and says if the name
is equal to Caleb display is awesome
Caleb is awesome
and if it's not equal to Caleb's a is
even awesomer so here if they're not
equal to Caleb let's say is even
awesomer right here
you know let's place this right here
because this my name is not equal to K
oh so I'm sorry for my horrible examples
but I don't have any excuse I should
probably go study some good examples and
then teach you but for now that's all I
have for now so in the next video I'll
be going over the case statement which
is very similar but probably more useful
maybe not I don't know so yeah subscribe
like this video and my name is Caleb and
thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
