think I'm gonna talk about subdivision I
just thought of that totally didn't plan
that
but anyways when we're counting
sometimes it's hard to count long rest
for example if we're playing a song and
just going along and then out of nowhere
you have a 30 second rest sixteenth rest
and then a
sixty fourth know you're gonna be like
what I can't play that because it's just
difficult so what you have to do is like
I said in the last video count all of
the rests even with the notes so just
because you're not playing doesn't mean
you're not doing something music it's
okay it's just as important if not more
important to count the rest as it is to
count the notes because if you play the
notes at the wrong time
there's no point in playing the notes
and probably would have been better if
you didn't play the notes at all for
example I'd rather hear you not play
which made no sense I'd rather not hear
you play then hear you screw up
everybody else and if you're doing a
solo then it's either no one's gonna
know because you can pretty much play
whatever you want or it's going to be
super obvious and or realize they're
gonna realize that you're not a good
musician so rest counting your rest is
very important I came to realize that as
a snare drummer it's extremely important
so you can't just go follow da da da and
drumming okay I'm done drumming for six
measures oh look at those clouds whoa
whoa start swiping the air at random
things and whoa and look it around gotta
keep your eyes on the field commander
which is the duty that goes you know the
one oh I got this funny joke oh no but
anyways yes so keeping count is very
important now if we're reading music and
we have an arrest
and then we have two half rests that
means we have two measures of rest and
then we have another half rest and then
we have an eighth rest followed by an
eighth note now the best way to count
this well we can count one wave four
beats one three one because these take
up two beats so this counts one through
four this counts one through two this
counts three through four this counts in
by the way here's where the measures
break this counts for one through two
this one fall shoot there should be
another okay we're gonna have a a
quarter rest in here which that's that
creepy thing to draw I don't know do
okay that's going to take up three and
then we have four and so this is on what
we would say the and of four because
when they're subdividing which is just
breaking the measure up and do smaller
pieces rather than one two three four
it's one and two and three and four and
this is on the and of four because this
is one and two and three and four and
hopefully that makes sense if not stick
with it don't give up don't ever give up
so now when we're counting this we
should subdivide or break the measure up
into eighth notes because that is the
note we are playing now we could count
this one
one two bomb inside okay one one three
one three it's just awkward and I don't
even know if I played it right so what I
should do is count the rests in eighth
notes or even sixteenth notes
you
because this can be considered the um
two eighth notes away from the two
sixteenth notes away from the end of the
measure so I could count this one and
two and three and four and one and two
and three and four and one and two and
three and four five now I know right on
dad just oh right on mid did I miss it
that makes me feel good rather than than
just counting okay okay it's like one
three somewhere around there but now if
I break it up to now you're not going to
miss it
so if you're having struggles in your
jazz band marching band concert band
solo or ensemble or in your orchestra or
in your I can't think of any of the
groups your cage band then stop dividing
maybe the answer so let's say that we
make this even more difficult we have an
eighth rest and then we have a sixteenth
rest and then a sixteenth note how in
the world are we going to count this we
can subdivide in eighth notes and then
just kind of throw that one in there
after the gonna be one and two and three
and four and
oh hated somewhere out there like who
knows
and plus it doesn't have to be like a
hit it can be like like an instrument
like that you winded straight or a
strumming instrument a string instrument
set because well most string instruments
you don't even struggle nevermind okay
just let's go on so the best way to
count this is to break up the measure
into sixteenth notes because that's what
we're playing so we could count this
wony and a 2 e and
three E and a four E and up and now I
know that I didn't miss it because it's
on the O of four as we would say or the
a four basically when we're subdividing
it here is this we would break up the
sixteenth notes of the measure 1 e 2 3 &amp;amp;
4 so we have a half rest which takes up
two beats
that's one beat because sixteenth notes
four of them are equivalent to a beat
because that would four times four is
sixteen hopefully that makes sense and
there's four beats in a measure so
that's one beat that's two beats then we
had a quarter note rest right here boom
now we only have one beat left so how do
we count it we can count one and kind of
just throw it in there after the an
somewhere or we can count for E and up
and on the AH a all for a up for the off
for you hit it that's called subdividing
so as I play snare drum and I like drum
course and you need to be able to come
in at the same time so it's important
that the drum line or the percussion
ensemble in the front pit is constantly
subdividing and if you're in the pit
okay let me just say don't wait till you
play to start counting count when you're
not playing because not playing is
playing because you can't play without
not playing get that through your brain
snare drummers you have to be a part of
everything gosh okay I think I'm done
ranting about this for now so I think I
think this was a good video iyx I think
I explained that pretty good if you
don't if you don't understand or you
have questions then sure to leave me a
comment and I'll
to address them same for any other video
I may make a question and answers
sometime throw this in here so yes
subscribe and I'll see you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
