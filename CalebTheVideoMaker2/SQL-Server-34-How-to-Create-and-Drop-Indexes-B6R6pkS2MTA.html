video make it to this video we are going
to be talking about creating indexes and
sequel server now in the previous video
I discussed the concept of indexes so if
you're really unfamiliar with them
you'll want to make sure you go back and
watch that video but if you have a rough
idea this video will be fine for you
it's not going to be too complex or
crazy or anything like that so right
here on the screen you can see the
tables that I've created and we need to
think what columns would benefit from an
index but the very first thing we should
know is that some columns are indexed by
default and those columns are any
columns labeled primary key or unique so
you can see that this column is going to
be indexed this one this one this one
and this one so we really don't have to
worry about a whole lot but there might
be a couple other columns that we want
to pay attention to and the ones that
usually jump out to me are foreign keys
that's because we use foreign keys for
so much but we often neglect them and
that we don't give indexes to them and
remember that we want to give indexes to
any columns we're going to continually
use for joins and also for selects what
that means is that foreign keys are
basically perfect candidates for indexes
the column I am specifically interested
in is right here species ID it's a
foreign key referencing the ID of the
species table up here the reason I want
to index this so bad is because once we
have all of our data in the tables we
will often want to select all of the
animals and list the species name not
just the species ID but the species name
comes from this table up here and in
order to do that we have to join the
tables that means we're very often going
to use a join on this column so let's
open a new query so we can make some
indexes the syntax is very simple and
probably pretty familiar to you once you
understand how they create table works
the way we create an index is with
create index and then we give it a name
just like in create table we give a name
now what do we name it that's ultimately
up to you or your boss but I'm going to
follow the convention of IX underscore
and
then whatever I want to name it so the
i-x is a prefix that stands for index so
whenever you see IX you automatically
know it's talking about an index the
next thing I'm going to use is the table
name that the column is located in so
going back to our other page you can see
that it's in the animals table and they
column is species ID so we are going to
name this animals and then species you
could name a species ID if you want but
I think this is fine but this here is
not enough we have to tell sequel server
what table and what column this index is
going to be on so we go down to the next
line and say on animals species ID so
the column goes in the parenthesis and
the table goes after on let's run it
make sure it works and there you go now
occasionally it's going to come up where
you need to delete an index and the way
you do that is you say drop index so
drop is the command we use to delete
then you say the index name this alone
is not enough though you actually have
to say what table that index is on so
the way you do that is say on animals
and you can see that it worked so the
syntax is very similar to the create
index the only thing different is that
you don't need to specify a column
because that index already exists on
that column additionally you can make
indexes on multiple columns at one time
and this is going to be a combined index
it's not a bunch of individual indexes
on each column it's one index on
multiple columns so for example if we go
back to our structure you can see in the
animals table we have a name and contact
email and we might use that a whole
bunch so let's say I wanted to make an
index on that here's how we do it create
index and we could just say animal
contact on animals and then in here we
put in both of the columns let's try it
any good see if that works now when you
have indexes like this it adds a layer
of complexity and that's something we
are not going to dive into right now but
that is something we may address in
future videos the last thing I wanted to
mention is unique indexes so if you have
a column that's always going to be
unique
you can use the unique keyword so for
example we could do something like this
now in this situation we are telling the
database that every single species in
the species table should be unique so
let's go back to our structure you can
see this right here would have to be
unique and it's actually already labeled
unique so in this situation you are not
going to need to make this index and I
will address that a little bit more in
the next video as to the difference in
everything like that but for now that's
your introduction to creating indexes
and dropping indexes hopefully that was
helpful for you guys if you've enjoyed
this video please please please click
subscribe because that really supports
my channel thanks guys and I'll see you
in the next video later or I should say
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
