SQL tutorial series this video we are
going to be talking a bit more about
constraints but I'm going to try and be
a little bit more specific and a little
bit more practical by actually applying
these to a real table so we already have
this users table down here with a user
ID column and a username column and just
for fun we're gonna go over the SQL to
create this table so we start with a
create table command and then we give it
a name and then inside of parentheses is
where we put the columns so we have a
user ID which is of data type number and
then we have a user name which is of
type var char two and it has a total of
50 characters so literally we just
created a table in like 20 seconds now
if you already have this table created
you're going to need to remember to run
the drop table command and what that's
going to do is delete the table and all
of the data in it so be careful with
this command but for us it's fine
because we're just learning so let's run
this and see if it works
and it says table users created but the
problem is here we literally don't have
any constraints on this table which
that's bad so let's go in and add some
we'll start with the user name we're
gonna add the constraint not null and
also unique and usually that's fine for
those adding them in as attributes it's
when we get to the primary key and
foreign key when people start to be a
little bit more picky and specifically
we often want to name our constraints so
we'll start without naming our
constraint and the way you do that is
just saying primary key right after the
column this will work but when we create
this and let's go to our table we'll do
a refresh and we'll go to constraints Oh
gross look at those names ah makes me
want to puke that is just hideous
we do not want that so to name our
constraints all you have to do is add
the constraint keyword here and then
give it a name and by convention we'll
name it the table name and then
underscore PK okay so you can see here
there is the user's PK constraint that
is beautiful now there's a third way to
do this and usually this is the
preferred way and that's to add all of
the constraints at the end of the table
almost as if they're their own
column so the way you do that is just
take all of this and then you can just
cut that come down here and literally
add it as if it's its own column
but then inside of parentheses after
primary key you have to say what column
you're talking about that is the most
complex way of adding a primary key but
often that's the way people want to do
it it's really up to you guys but that's
what I'm gonna go for in this video so
let's run that and see how it works so
that was a quick rundown on how to add a
primary key in future videos we'll get
on to foreign keys but for now primary
keys will do so thanks guys please be
sure to subscribe and click like and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
