tutorial and just so you know our view I
already but and just so you know I
already record high okay MySQL tutorial
and I already actually recorded like
this and the next like four videos or
whatever so yeah I'm recording it again
because I lost all the footage so I
think I'm just gonna like get like a
spare camera beside this one just to
record in case this one does something
stupid but whatever so in this video
I'll be going over text functions so
there's a whole bunch of them and I'll
be explaining what they do and how to
use them and some occasionally I'll give
you a good use for them but sometimes
you're not really sure until you need
them so it's good idea to familiarize
yourself with all or some of the most
common text functions I won't be going
over all of them but I will be getting
into a bunch of them so stick with this
and I'm sure you'll learn a lot and this
will be good for your MySQL knowledge
database here are two common functions
length and char length all right but um
they're very similar but they're kind of
different another day making sense
whatever basically this length will tell
you how many bytes is in your word this
will tell you how many characters for
example if I put within these
parentheses here if I put hey is I'm
going to get the response probably three
and if I put it up here I'm probably
going to get three also because these
are probably it depends on your
character set and a bunch of other stuff
these are probably one byte characters
but for example if I use a less common
character it may count for two bytes and
if you remember that's how characters
are stored binary data a byte is a bits
which allows us to create a bunch of
characters so yes this will tell you how
many bytes are in your word and this
characters so if you need to figure out
how many characters are submitted or in
something use character or char length
underscore length and parentheses is so
be like this in parentheses here so this
is what you put in parentheses and that
will give you how many characters you
have so these actually take two
arguments and the first one is a string
and the next one is a number for example
Caleb
here's my string five characters long if
you use left it's going to take a
certain amount of characters off the
left side and return those if you use
right it's going to take a certain
amount off the right side so if I put
left Caleb comma 3
but the returned result is going to be
cow so the same thing for right if I use
Caleb 3 it's not going to turn cow it's
going to turn then Caleb so it'll take
these 3 characters 1 2 3 because you put
them up here and ask for 3 of them off
the right side by using the right
function and it returns this so
basically you just give it a string tell
how many characters to chop off and I'll
return those it won't get rid of them
it'll get rid of everything but that so
if I have a big word like pizza because
that's five letters also and put three
at the end it'll give zza so right you
get the point
I'm just rambling on now the next one I
have to show you is trim this one is
actually a bit more in depth I'll shoot
stupid focus focus
can't you see I'm shrinking things done
oh so next one I have here is trim oh my
gosh so the next one I all you guys see
me you see me focus on me I'm going this
way so next one I have here is trim this
one's a bit more in depth but I will be
trying to explain it the best I can
what you put within here is a string
with spaces trailing or leading so if I
have in parentheses
bass bass bass these just represent
spaces they're an honors horse so hey
it's like 40 spaces in like 20 spaces
that better not I went out of focus so
if I pay with 20 spaces on like each
side it's going to trim these spaces off
and so the result will be this without
the extra spaces well you can actually
use this for more stuff okay so don't
freak out
but there's three options you can also
add to this if you want to make it more
in depth leaning means at the beginning
so I can take something that is leading
away for example I can say or trim then
I could say leading and then in
parentheses I could put a C and then I
can put thrown and then put Caleb in
parentheses which amount of space no
parentheses in quotation marks and it's
going to take any leading C so it's
actually going to get rid of this and I
can also put in a here and it'll get rid
of that too also here so if I used both
then it would remove sees something go
back to C's here I have an in here if I
use both it would get rid of C's at the
beginning and also at the end because it
takes the leading C's and also the
trailing C's if I use trailing it's only
going to take C's from the end and as
you can see there's no C's at the end
there's only a B so if I take this and
sit and replace this with both let me
show you an example here both be in the
parenthesis from Caleb the returned
result the result it gives you is going
to be C al not Caleb because it takes
both the beginning C B's and the endings
B's own gets rid of them but there isn't
any B's at the beginning that's why it's
still like that hopefully that made
sense let me try and explain that a
little better so let's say we have a
strain and
is yay 500 explanation marks here that's
a lot but I'm only gonna write six
so if we use trim we could say trim in
parenthesis both side we say in the
parenthesis say trailing and then in
parenthesis here
quotation mark I'm not quoting our
explanation mark from in parenthesis do
we break this string out here like this
so here's the final result trailing
explanation works from yay and the
return result that it gives us will be
this because it removed all of the
trailing explanation marks for us Oh my
throat hurts already this is like my
first video so angry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
