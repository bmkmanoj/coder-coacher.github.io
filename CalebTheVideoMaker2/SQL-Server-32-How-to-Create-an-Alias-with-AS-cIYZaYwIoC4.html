second sequel server tutorial my name is
Caleb from Caleb the video maker and
this video is going to cover aliases now
an alias is a name you can give
something to refer to something an alias
is essentially an alias for nickname you
see what I did there when you give
something an alias you can refer to it
by that new name you give it why would
you want to do this though well there's
two primary benefits that I can think of
the first one is if you have a
complicated name and you give it an
alias whatever it is it'll be easier to
refer to it by that new name the second
reason though is that it can actually
improve our presentation so for example
these columns down here we can change
the names of these columns in the last
video I talked about concatenating data
and I'm going to do that in this video
and then I'm going to give that column
an alias so the presentation looks a
whole lot better so right now I'm just
selecting everything but what I want to
do is I want to select a new column that
I'm going to generate and it's going to
be a combination of the person's name
and email so we want to select animals
dot name Plus and then in quotes a -
plus animals dot contact email all right
let's run this and you can see that it
returns the data with this nasty column
name so an alias allows us to replace
that no column name with something
specific and the way you make an alias
is with the ASCII word and then you say
what the name is going to be so let's
give this column a name contact and now
let's run this and there you go so if
you need to present some beautiful data
to your boss so you don't get fired what
you can do is give all of your columns
an alias that way it can explain exactly
what they're looking at you can also do
this for other columns it's not just for
generated columns so for example we
could also return animals dot species ID
and then we could say pcs ID now in this
situation we have a space so I think we
need to quote this let's run it and
there you go
this allows us to de computerize our
data and make it a little bit more
user-friendly
now aliases are not just useful for
presentation they can also be useful for
us as developers for example we can give
an alias to a table and then we can
reference that table by
that new name in this example we are
working on an animal dating site so
essentially each one of these animals is
going to be a user in our site so we
could rename animals users if we wanted
and it's just for this query so it's not
actually changing the table at all and
now when we type that out you can see a
bunch of things turn red that's because
we have to address it by its new name
here select users dot name users dot
contact email and users da species ID
now the entire query is going to give us
the same results so what exactly is the
benefit here well if we have a super
long table name for example we can
shorten it and then it's easier to
reference it or when we are doing things
such as joins it just makes life a lot
easier because we can shorten our
queries down a whole lot some people
like using aliases other people thinks
it adds a layer of confusion the
decision is ultimately up to you and the
people you're working with so hopefully
everything you learned in this video
we'll come and useful for you someday
even if you're not using alias as
yourself
I can guarantee you at some point you're
going to come across this as keyword so
now you know what it means so thanks
