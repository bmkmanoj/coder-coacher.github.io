Caleb the video maker - this video is
part 2 of how C programs work so the
only real purpose of this video is to
break down what we discussed in our
hello world program two videos ago so
that program looks like this the first
thing that you need to notice is right
here this is a function definition
whenever we define functions it's going
to have a very similar look to this so
it's best to familiarize yourself with
it right now because long down the road
in this video we're going to create some
our own functions for now we do not have
to worry about that all you have to know
is that the main is a function and
inside of that function is the stuff we
want to do so once again as a reminder
what is a function you can think of a
function as just a name for an algorithm
now the name mains doesn't have a lot of
meanings but by convention this is the
function that is called when we first
run our program main it called when the
program runs it's the first function
that is executed in our program now this
thing here is called the identifier that
is a general term to mean the name of
something so in this case the identifier
of this function is me identifier is a
very computer science e term so be sure
to throw that in your sentences if you
want to impress the ladies or turn them
away because you know that happens too
with computer science
let me notice that so all inside of our
function we have each thing we want to
do the first thing we want to do is
print something and then the next thing
we want to do is return something we
discussed what the return means in the
previous video both of these are
examples of statements and you can
clearly see that they're statements
because they both have semicolons you
can think of statements as committees
the zero here says that the program
worked as expected we could if we wanted
or some other value for example we could
return in negative one we can make that
mean you know things things that go so
good but in this situation there's no
reason why we should return anything
other than a zero up here we have what's
known as the datatype of zero and we'll
get into datatypes later but just think
back to math class integers are whole
numbers zero it's a whole number so
we're just saying hey we're going to
return some integer that's all that says
this line right here is actually another
function call that means somewhere there
is a function called print f that was
defined so let's just say we have this
file over here and inside that file we
have print F and then the algorithm of
how printf works here we are calling
that function so we're just saying hey
we want to use this code over here
inside of our program where is this code
located well actually comes from some
library in that library is denoted right
here so you can see here we have
standard i/o and inside of this library
one of the functions that is available
to us is the printf function and I can
assure you it's going to look more
complicated than this but thankfully we
don't have to write that function that
function was made available to us all we
had to do was include the library in our
code to make it accessible to us if we
didn't put this here and we try to
compile this code right here the
compiler is going to be like dude what
what is this what this isn't a real
thing there is no such printf function
you speak of so that's why it's always
important to make sure you use the
include last thing I have to say is this
little backslash n a little weird thing
or a year this is called the newline
character
whenever we use this backslash end we
are saying we want the console to go
down to the next line so what this is
going to do is going to print exactly
what we have and then when the console
tries to print this backslash end what
happens is it goes down to the next line
and then this is where the cursor is now
and then that's the end of our program
because we return 0 so the program is
going to end on a new line that's all I
got to say on how AC program works as
you can see there's a lot of information
that's kind of crammed in this video on
the previous video and the next whole
series is going to be devoted to
breaking down each one of those things
in depth and learn some more features
and more functionality so by the end of
the series you can write this with your
eyes closed and much more so thanks guys
for watching be sure to check out the
next video click Subscribe and as always
be sure to like this video and yeah
that's about it so thanks and I'll see
you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
