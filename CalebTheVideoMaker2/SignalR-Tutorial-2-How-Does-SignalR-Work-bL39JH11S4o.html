signal our in this video we'll be
discussing a little bit more about how
signal R makes real-time applications
now let's go over a theoretical example
let's say there's a social network what
are some of the primary things you can
do on a social network let's talk about
it well I've thought of three of them
you can update your feed you know see
what new people have to say about their
lives you can update your status or your
your own feed so then everyone else can
know what's going on in your life or you
can send direct messages or something
similar these are kind of the three
primary things now when we're talking
social networks they are almost always
real-time or very close to real-time
they simulate real time what I mean by
that is when you update your status
everyone's going to know immediately
because this is 2016 we ain't got time
to click refresh and check our stuff we
want the social network to tell us now
that's where real-time apps come in
signal our makes it possible to make
these real-time apps and it uses four
different technologies and we'll be
discussing all these in depth in the
upcoming videos but I'm just going to
write them out so you can kind of get an
overview these are the four technologies
signal are uses to make real-time apps
and we're going to talk about a more in
future videos so I'm not going to
explain each one but I am going to break
them up into two different groups we
have these three and then we have this
loner by himself and the way these are
broken up are the first three are
actually real-time applications this
long polling it just simulates real-time
application so real-time kind of
real-time and these all have their
benefits but in general the top is the
best bottom is the worst the way signal
art works is it's going to try
sockets and if it doesn't work it's
going to go to event source if that
doesn't work it's going to go to forever
frame if that doesn't work finally it's
going to go to long pulling that is the
order and you can specify a specific one
if you want such as hey I want just this
one you can do that but usually you just
wanted to pick whatever one you want so
we'll be discussing about all of these
in the upcoming videos so thanks guys
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
