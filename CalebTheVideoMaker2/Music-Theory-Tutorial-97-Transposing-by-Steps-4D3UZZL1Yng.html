be talking about transposing the melody
so I want to get some light in here so
uh here we have a staff let's say our
melody is yeah just simple triangle sort
of oh now if we wanted to transpose this
up four half steps it's actually very
simple we can look at a piano this is an
e on by the way we're in trouble cliff
I've been completely ignoring that for
the past one hundred thousand videos but
um it doesn't really matter what clef
were in really for now so he transposed
up four half steps one two three four G
sharp so this will now become i'm gonna
use yellow so hopefully you can see it I
don't know this one is a G 1 2 3 4
becomes a beat now this one is ad D 1 2
3 4 u sharp this one is a be so we are
on your fun be here whoa which then p 1
2 3 4 becomes d sharp d sharp d sharp d
sharp be sharp oh where am i oh yeah d
sharp see so in case you haven't noticed
every single time we are going up one
line so this one we come here now we
just have to figure out the half steps
here is e e transpose it up four one two
three four comes G sharp G sharp but we
guess what we should have known that
already because that onesie too so that
is our pattern let me go over this so
you can see it here in the blue or
yellow or whatever color you want to say
is our new melody there's not much to
say else about it
just scooting things up the appropriate
amount of half steps and then rewriting
them it's very time-consuming you could
say but it's one way to do it and
there's actually a third way I'm going
to be talking about which probably isn't
much better I'll i think this just
following the scales would be the best
way but anyway is possible so we should
learn them all in the next video I'll be
sure to be more aware of what's going on
and hopefully you have been learning
some things so I'll see you then thank
you for watching and subscribe follow me
