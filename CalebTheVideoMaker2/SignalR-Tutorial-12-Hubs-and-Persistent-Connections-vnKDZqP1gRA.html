going to discuss the difference between
hubs and persistent connections so these
are the two different ways you can work
with signal are and the very first thing
just if you want like a one sentence
summary hubs are higher level I mean you
have to know less about how they work at
the fundamental level so if you want a
simple way to go hubs is the recommended
route and actually the signal our
documentation recommends that most
people use hubs instead of persisting
connections so usually persistent
connections aren't needed but we may
discuss some more in the future but
starting off we'll be using hubs that
being said we are going to discuss the
differences because you are going to
come across both of these so if you
remember from the last video I talked
about objects and in classes well these
are both classes you inherit from one of
these when you create your own custom
class you have to inherit from either a
hub or a persistent connection and then
you can say that your class is a hub
class or a persistent connection class
and that's the class that's used for the
client to invoke server-side methods
well the difference here has to do when
the classes instantiated for a
persistent connection its instantiated
when the connection is opened and then
that connection persists I always have a
hard time saying words that end with s T
and when you make them plural persists
it just just doesn't flow off the tongue
very well persistent connections persist
until the connection is closed
hubs are a little bit different because
there is going to be an instance created
every single request so let's go over a
theoretical example we have this web
server right and this thing allows for
signal are so you connect as a client
and immediately a hub is instantiated so
a hub object is created and that can
process things when we have a new client
joint for example we could announce to
everyone
hey somebody just joined yeah give them
five that will happen and then also if
the client requests any more information
from the server such as making a call to
a server-side method it's going to
instantiate another hub and when it's no
longer needed the object will be removed
that's the primary difference the
persistent connection as the name
suggests persists throughout the
connection until it's closed the only
exception to this is if you're using
forever frame or event source because if
you remember from the previous videos
those are one-way connections they allow
the server to send the client data so
whenever if you're using one of those
connections and the client wants to send
the server data well you're gonna have
to make another persistent connection
instance so that means within these
classes you usually don't want to define
instance variables to maintain state and
I'll explain that a little bit but first
let me write down instance variables
instance variables are variables that
can be assigned to objects so when you
have a hub you have the hub class and
then you make objects from that hub
class and an instant variable is going
to be like x equals 5 and x equals 12 it
can be different for both objects the
reason you don't want to use these
instance variables is because the
objects are going to be created and
destroyed like that so you don't want to
use instant variables to maintain
something that's important for example
if this number or whatever you assign to
the variable is important you don't want
to use it in an instance variable you're
gonna have to use a static variable or
something else and we'll talk about that
in another video because we're going
off-topic I personally think the naming
here is kind of confusing because in
earlier videos I talked about persistent
connections with WebSockets event source
and forever frame but this persistent
connection isn't talking about that when
they named a persistent connection you
get the impression that only the
persistent connection class is going to
use those three technology
that's not true both the hub and the
persistent connection class are going to
use WebSockets event source and forever
frame the persistent here talks about
the lifetime of the object just so you
guys know that so if you use a hub it's
not like you're going to get some
different technology that doesn't allow
for that open connection that we want we
are going to still be able to have a
persistent connection from the client to
the server even though we're not using
the persistent connection class so
that's all I really got to say in this
video that just gives you the very
surface of what's the difference between
these two and that will give you the
understanding you need to start
developing in signal or which by the way
that's what we'll be doing in the next
video so thanks guys
see you then and we'll start digging in
in the code please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
