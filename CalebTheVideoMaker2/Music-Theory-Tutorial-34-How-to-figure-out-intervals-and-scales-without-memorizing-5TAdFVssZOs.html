I've talked a little bit about in my
previous videos but I think I can
address it a lot better now since we
went over the major scale so if we start
on C we can figure out a ton of
information that'll help us a lot when
we don't remember something
so here's C I believe yes C now we can
figure out all of our intervals because
you remember minor is only taking a
major subtracting one diminished is
taking a minor or perfect two
subtracting the one and an Augmented is
taking perfect or major and augmenting
it one so now all we have to know is
that the C major scale will shows us the
perfect and major intervals so this is a
perfect unison this is a major second
this is a major third this is a perfect
fourth this is a perfect fifth this is a
major sixth major seventh perfect octave
which is the C one octave above it
twelve Keys now if we wanted to find a
minor key we could just take a major
such as major third subtract it one note
or one half-step becomes a minor third
kind of sad so that is how to figure out
all of the interval sizes and qualities
using the C major scale so if you can't
remember it follow the C major scale
such as well I don't remember how many
half steps is in a perfect fifth well I
know this is a perfect fifth from C to G
so one two three four five six seven now
I know that a perfect fifth has seven
half steps there's also something else
cool that we can do with the C major
scale and that is figure out the pattern
for a seam for any major scale for
example if I start on G whoops it's
different but it's still the same key
pattern
a whole whole half whole whole whole
half to memorize that we can look at a
c-major scale and we cross a black key
so that's a whole across the black key
that's a whole don't cross a black key
half whole whole or half the reason this
is a half and not a whole is because
we're only traveling one key from this
note to this note but this this one to
this one travels two keys you see we
have to take two steps from D to D sharp
to e so that's two steps from D to D
sharp d sharp to e but B to F is only
one half step boom we don't have to go
up to a black key so we can figure out
the scale using the major scale how
convenient as long as you remember to
start on C won't pull half whole whole
whole half then we can recreate on
different notes as long as you follow
that pattern you can figure out any of
the major scales
fade in I'm overhead alright sweet so
that's how to figure out interval sizes
interval qualities and also the pattern
for a major scale whole whole half whole
whole whole half using the C major scale
very useful especially when you're
taking a quiz and you can't remember the
patterns or you can't remember the
intervals follow the C major scale
that's why it's a very useful important
scale and that's usually why people
teach it first because it can help you
with much of the other stuff so yes
that's all so see you next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
