tutorial series this video we are going
to be talking about the number data type
so what is so stinking special about the
number data type you know what it is it
static can store whole numbers and
decimal numbers so it could store
integers and real numbers both in one
data type so that means we can store
something like 2 or we could store point
2 I know that doesn't seem like a big
deal but it is it's really super cool
Oracle attracts my liking because it has
fewer data types that are more versatile
rather than some other database
management systems that will have like 4
data types to do the same thing now
number can be used to store huge numbers
it can also be used to store very small
numbers and I'm not talking like 1 or 2
I'm talking like point 0 0 0 0 0
whatever 9 or 5 or whatever something
smaller than 1 now the Oracle Docs you
can get these specifics on the range of
acceptable values well in general you're
not going to have to worry a whole lot
about it because this can store pretty
big numbers now the thing with this is
that it's stored in scientific notation
now the chances are when you learn this
in like third grade you were sleeping I
mean I was - I had to relearn all the
stuff so let's do a quick recap it's
essentially a way to express a number
using a power of 10
so we could say 2.2 times 10 0 10 to the
0 evaluates to 1 so 2 point 2 times 1
equal to point two now you could
theoretically take this dot and move it
so we can move it this way or we can
move it that way
generally it's supposed to be right
there so this is a really crappy example
but let's say we have the number 30
that's that's a good example 37 . now we
could take this dog and move it and that
will change the power of 10 so now we
have three point seven times 10 to the 1
which evaluates to 10 so 3.7 times 10
equals 37 you can see we represented the
same exact number two different ways
either 37 times 10 to the 0s or three
point seven times ten to the first now
we really don't have to worry a whole
lot about the scientific notation part
of this that's all kind of done behind
the scenes so we need to worry about is
significant digits we could represent
this as seven point seven times 10 to
the fourth
I just think about that one pretty hard
and the way we get that is we start here
with a decimal one two three four which
leaves us right there and you can see we
really only have two digits that are
important to us seven and seven you can
say that these digits are significant so
we really don't care about zeros coming
don't take it offensively zero I
personally care a lot about you but in
general no one really cares about the
zero because in this situation they're
not considered significant the actual
number of significant digits is our
biggest limit now the limit from this
data type comes from either these
significant digits or from the total
size we can only store so many
significant digits and at some point our
number is not going to qualify or we
could just be trying to store a number
that is way too stinkin huge like 2.2
times 10 to the three thousand or three
thousand one and in general that's this
way to thinking big
now when you declare this data type you
have the option of specifying two extra
options so many options like subway
oh I was so cheesy and we can specify
the precision and B scale and these are
defined in parentheses when we give the
datatype so something like this this is
the precision and that's the scale if
you decide to set a precision you have
the option of giving a volume 1 through
30 and what this number refers to is the
total number of digits in your number so
for example this number has one two
three digits so we could say that the
precision is three scale on the other
hand is the number of digits after the
decimal point so in this situation the
scale is two and note that the precision
includes the scale so the entire number
is considered for the precision but only
the number after the decimal point is
considered for the scale so to quiz you
a little bit think about the maximum and
the minimum values for something like
this to figure this out you can subtract
the scale from the precision and that
will give you the number of digits
before the decimal so we're going to add
four and the biggest numbers would be
nine nine nine nine and two of those are
going to be reserved for after the
decimal minot and also the negative of
that
so negative nine nine nine nine point
nine nine the scale is a little bit
interesting because the actual
acceptable values for the scale is
negative 84 up to 127 it all explains
how that makes sense of having a
negative scale and also having a scale
that's bigger than your precision but
that is a topic for another video on the
biggest thing to take away from this is
that if you're going to specify the
precision in scale the scale affects the
size of the biggest number because if we
have let's say a precision of six like
this example and we say a scale of two
well we are cutting the max size of our
number by two digits so if we had six
further
vision and the scale with zero we could
store this and this would allow for a
much larger number so if a bigger number
is what you want then you are going to
want to keep the scale as well as
possible and the precision as high as
possible I think you can only store up
to 38 but if you want a lot of numbers
after the decimal point you can make the
scale very big and the precision very
big so that is your introduction to the
number data type we will be discussing
it more of course because there's still
a lot of more information we need to
cover but this is a great introduction
