of two-way encryption what this means is
you can encrypt the data and then you
can decrypt the data so basically you
can insert and then you can retrieve
that data and see the original way it
looked
so here are two well one encryption
function there's encrypt and decrypt
there's some others but this one's
probably the most secure so that's what
I'll be explaining I might explain some
others later on but basically how this
works is you will give it a string to
encrypt within quotes so and crap me you
know you see this this string wants to
be encrypted so then you can also give
what is called a soul S alt and then you
would put this so these are this is
within the parentheses you would put the
soul here so now what the salt is is
basically just a way to convert this you
encrypt the data by following this salt
and when you decrypt it you use the same
salt so basically this will convert it
to some secret code and then the only
way to get it back to the original data
is to say this is the salt to the
decrypt and then it will give you the
original encrypt me I know that seems
like a law and it's kind of confusing
but basically all you're really doing is
giving it some random string of data and
it will do something with that string of
data to encrypt this the longer the soul
the more secure it is so if I just use
instead of this is the salt if I just
use Thai it's not going to be it as
secure but then I could encrypt it so
let's say let me give you an example I'm
going to encrypt my my security code for
my business to get into the steel doors
that go fast
when I type in my closing door code and
the code is 6 3 5 8 5 1 right that's my
code to open and close the doors and I'm
gonna store this in my database because
I don't know why it's because I want to
store this in my database and all these
workers have a different secret opening
in store closings code and they'll
insert this with their information and
then we'll encrypt it the equipment is
going to be yo bro what's up can't even
fit this you'll grow us up you know so
now when I use AES encrypt KS encrypt
it's going to give me this bunch of
random characters that look like a
foreign language right and you're not
going to know what it is there's
somebody who's trying to crack it it's
going to be a lot different difficult
because they don't know the soul but
when we decrypt it we can say AES
decrypt and then we can say the the
column storing the salt so AES decrypt
we can say AES decrypt and then put the
column security code code and then we
can say the salt
yo bro wassup and then it will take this
original message and all decrypt it back
to the original which was I can't even
remember guess that's why you'd sort a
database so you don't forget it
you can store your salt within your
database and random people shouldn't
just have access to your database for no
reason so only you or extremely secure
people should have access to your
database and you can store your salt
within your database if you wish and one
reason for this is you can actually
randomize this by using one of the other
encryption functions the s sh sh one or
sh and a two to get a 40 digit random
code and then you can use that or part
of that to encrypt your data randomly
that way you don't have the same salt
for every single thing for example what
if you found a salt for one thing and
then you can figure out them all it
wouldn't be good so if you have a random
salt that's stored within your database
they're not going to be able to crack
your soul easily so yeah that is two-way
encryption / decryption and the next
video I will actually be starting to
design and explain a banking system
database that we will be programming it
won't take long just very simple so
don't get overwhelmed but be like oh
yeah that's a lot of work it'll be easy
trust me so yeah catch me there catch
you there subscribe click like please
follow me on Google+
yeah I bought it subscribe share my
videos link to them all of your friends
yeah well no I'm over Oh cow no I'm over
here holy cow does this man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
