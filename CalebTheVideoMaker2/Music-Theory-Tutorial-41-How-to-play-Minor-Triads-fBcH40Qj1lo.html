theory series in the last video I spoke
of major triads consisting of a root
where you start by the way this is what
you call the note or the chord so C
triad C major whatever then we had a
major 3rd and then a minor 3rd on top of
that you want to make minor triads we
take these and we swap them basically we
flatten this to a minor 3rd so this
becomes a minor 3rd but now since we
move that one down a half step that
means the distance from this one to this
one has increased a half step let me
show you what I mean starting to C to e
GG oh it's breaking it it's gonna sound
bad alright anyways here's a major chord
if we scoot this one down a half step
the distance between this one and this
one just grew a half step one two three
four so we can actually even though
we're only flattening this one we just
basically just memorize that swapping
these so a minor chord consists of a
minor third one two three one two three
four that is how to create a minor try
it so what's the formula minor third
followed by major third so here it's out
okay this is for minor for major its
root
major third followed by minor third so
if we just swap them we can get what's
called major or minor it depends on what
you're looking for
major sounds typically happy minor
sounds like it not so happy but I like
both of them I think they both sound
nice and I prefer I don't mean I like
both of the chords so yeah now I'm going
to show you some minor chords on the
piano
cuz it's fun alright so we have a C
major chord all we have to do is take
this note and lower it enough we get a
minor chord that is C minor chord we
have C sharp one two three four
one two three take this middle note
lower half step C sharp minor and yes
you can't have a sharp note that it's
minor for some reason people correlate
sharp not being my but they're totally
two different things
so you can either make a major and lower
the middle one one half step you see
that one half step or you can just count
minor third followed by major third one
two three that's a minor third one two
three four minor C major chord sorry a
minor C chord or triad
so yeah major minor minor major major
major just going through the difference
in some of these minor minor can you
hear the difference
and the difference that is the basis of
the difference between a major and a
minor chord one note one note not to
because we're only moving let's say that
see right there and then that E and the
G if we just only move the second one
down a half step it becomes a minor
chord so that's all you share subscribe
and I'll see you in the next video where
we're going over some more chords
