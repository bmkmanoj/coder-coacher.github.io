probably be pretty quick I'm going to be
showing you what's called a show command
and it just helps you learn more about
your database or your tables so I opened
my gym database and then I click SQL and
from here if you remember how you
created a table it was like this create
table and then it'd be like table name
so as we had it before members and I
want to show you something pretty cool
that if you put show before it it
creates a show command and it will tell
you more about the state of it table so
you click go and then under options we
can select full text and click go from
here and it will say everything about
our database when we created it so um
this will help if you forgot something
that you made or if sometimes MySQL will
actually change some of these specific
details in here for performance reasons
and as you can see down here as an
engine which ever need to talked about
yet and character sets but basically
this will tell you more about your
database if you need to learn about it
and you can also from the SQL uh what's
called query window you can say show
tables just like that and click go and
it will say all the tables we have so
members tables in the database Jim
another cool thing you can do is say
show columns then you can say from and
then say members or basically the table
name and this will just basically say
everything which you can see on here it
will show all these columns the member
ID birthday phone membership status
first name last name and it seems kind
of stupid when you can just click this
rather than type in a query but if
you're not using phpMyAdmin and you
don't have all these graphics and just
text then this can be useful and it can
also be useful if you're just using the
SQL box so if I click go I'll show you
what I mean
and it also tells you a lot more about
it as you can see so we have the field
which is just basically the column then
the type is all the information about it
so we can see small in five unsigned
date chart n so if you need to figure
out what one was you can just say show
columns from and in the data table name
members no no as you can see none of
them are allowed to be null they all
require an entry and the primary key is
member ID and none of these have a
default except the phone number has a
default and the membership status is a
default
extra just displays some extra
information about the column and as you
can see it is Auto incremented which if
you don't know this by now it goes up by
one each time by itself and uh that's
all I had to say in this video I know
it's pretty short I don't really have
anything else to talk about but I feel
like I'm cutting this video a bit short
maybe I should add something uh I'll
just see you guys in the next video
thanks for watching and subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
