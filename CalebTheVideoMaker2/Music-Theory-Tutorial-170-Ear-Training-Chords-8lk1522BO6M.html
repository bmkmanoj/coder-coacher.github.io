series of her transcribing and ear
training now I'm going to be going over
the specific steps that I told you and
maybe some little more give you some
details and then first one I'm going to
go over is figuring out the chords now
before you go figuring out specific
songs chords i recommend you work on
your ear training which I kind of forgot
to mention in the last video but that's
that's what this is also ever your
training so figure out what certain
chords sound like practice them over and
over again on a piano and just drill
them in your brain so you can hear them
and figure out what they are and not
only if that's kind of difficult try
figuring out the types of chords so for
example figure out the difference
between major minor augmented and
diminished this is a very achievable
task because once you're been once
you've been with music a lot you'll be
able to notice the difference between a
major and minor chord almost instantly
may take a while but just go on a piano
press C E and G C major and then just
move the middle key up and down to
create the difference between major
minor listen for like lay on the ground
get a piano out lay there for like eight
hours or a keyboard whatever and just go
go between one in the other and listen
to the difference and then do that for
other chords such as G major and G minor
E major E minor C sharp major C sharp
minor so forth so that I'll drill in the
difference between a major and a minor
chord also you can go from augmented and
diminished and minor and so forth so you
can go through each possible cord that
is one of the best things you can do for
this then what you can do is get a
friend if you if you have any my case
just record yourself play some notes and
then play it back since you don't have
any friends no I'm skin but seriously
then get someone else to play on and
then you can guess what they're playing
either major minor lamented or
diminished obviously they're going to
have to know how to play chords or
they're not going to know which one it
is let's say you then play that chord
ha was it major and they'll be like yes
or no got to make that a game then you
can see who can get the most courts
correct so that's one of the things you
can do for that that's the core
differences next thing is listen to the
bass guitar in the song often the bass
guitar will match the root of the chord
so if we're on C major chord that
consists of a C and E and AG the root in
this case is see this is the third
that's the fifth so we need to listen to
the room oftentimes the bass guitar will
be playing a low c which matches the sea
in the cord so that's a great way just
listen to the bass guitar to figure out
the root of the court once you got the
route you can figure out if it is a
major or minor and so forth once you got
the root I mean sorry you got the root
so you know it's AC chord you just got
to figure out if it's major minor and so
forth and also be aware it may be an
inversion so be careful listen closely
and figure out what's going on see ya
next thing scale degrees I mentioned
this a lot in the last video such as
going from i to v 2 I to V figuring out
the chord progression so as I said just
try some of the common chord
progressions I to V I to the 4th to the
5th to the 4th again and so forth most
of the time it'll go from a v2 and I
because that's that's the best sounding
jump so that's another tip so just try
some of the common ones the thing about
these common ones is if you went into
public and played them over and over
again and just change the patterns
thousands of people will go up to you
and be like hey I know that song even
though you're not playing a specific
song you're just playing chord
progressions they're so common almost
all pop music uses the same chord
progressions and so forth so go on
youtube type in 50 songs three chords or
four chords or 100 songs two chords so
forth you'll see how songs are very
repetitive so
one way try the common listen to the
jumps oh yeah listen to the jumps is the
next one just listen how big of a jump
from chord to chord and try and figure
out is it going from the tonic to the
third or the tonic to the fourth or to
the fifth sixth and so forth and
oftentimes inversions will lower that
jump such as let's say our own c e and g
g instead of going gbd4 a G chord we can
just go D and then be over here so we
can just go from these three one two
three to these three to make a G chord
night I made no sense so just ignore it
I'll show you on my little tablet here
but I had to give it back so it's not
actually here next one listen to 7th
chords set of chords usually have a
distinct sound as an especially dominant
7th chords because it adds a little
extra tension so if you can hear the
dominant 7th go from a dominant 7th to a
major just major triad major triad
dominant 7th triad same try it so C
major see dominant step c major see Dom
innocent and listen to the difference
drill that in your brain because once
you figure out the dominant 7th there's
a high possibility it's going to be on
the fifth so you're going to get a v7 or
57 so let's say you do that and maybe G
well that tells us that the tonic is C
and so forth so if you figure out that
there's a high possibility it's on the
fifth which allows you to figure out the
rest of the chords and what key are in
next check if it matches the melody so
listen to the song learn the melody or
something play it with it see if it
matches if it doesn't chances are
they're not the right chords and you can
try again so that's all I really have to
say about ports for ear training and
transcribing so in the next video where
we going over something new subscribe
