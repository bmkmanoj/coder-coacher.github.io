going to do a quick review and we're
going to learn something new all right
so what have we learned so far when it
comes to cliffs we know that we have a
treble clef a bass clef and we just
learned the new alto clef Sophie Claire
are you kidding me why can't someone
stalk me use not a weirdo wait anyways
treble clef look something like this
bass cliff look something like this
altec left when we just learned look
something like this
cool so we're going to learn a new one
it is known as the travel base alto and
tenor so we're going to learn about the
tenor clef very easy to learn and let's
do some with that and so quickly I'm
going to draw staffed with this cliff so
before we learned the alto clef and
where does this assignment it assigns it
right here to this middle line middle C
to the middle line well now if we take
this and scoot it up well we get a Nuke
left don't get you under here alright so
I'm going to overlap this let's see if I
can do this right
there we go so now the arrow between
okay so we have the dots don't like this
little arrow looking thing this always
points to see okay so now if since we
moved it up a line where's middle C is
now this new line right here so the blue
is the alto clef red is the tenor cliff
so what's the difference between these
well tenor clef actually gets a little
bit lower pitches because now we scooted
everything up which allows the lowest
note to be a little bit lower because
middle C is closer to the top hopefully
that makes sense so if the all toklo
alto clef is a little too i you can go
down to the tenor clef and now middle C
is on the fourth line up so what does
that mean that means ease right here see
if I go backwards Hayes right here and
g/f right here and then D is right here
so the red is intent or cliff if we go
with the blue we get kind of running out
of room here
a left and then if we go down below on
this would be deep so to get the same
notes with the alto clef we have to go a
little bit lower that's the difference
between alto and tenor clef now you
might be wondering why is it that these
both have the same sign well that gets
into the concept of Tessa Torre's or
Tessa churros I'm not exactly under
percent sure to pronounce it and that's
something we'll be going up going over
in a really recent future video so maybe
two videos from now I'm not too sure yet
so let's do a complete quick review of
what we've learned I know we just did a
review what we're doing another one we
have the treble and it looks like this I
drop bigger here this loop thing is a
sign G so wherever that's pointing
that's G now let's go to base bush
this line right here that is a signed F
cool now let's go to the alto / tenor
Alto close enough this little arrow
that's middle C right so we're talking
about the treble clef it is talking
about the g above middle C so I probably
should put up here for illustration
reasons but it's okay when we're talking
about bass we're talking about the F
below middle C that's because on the
grand staff we have trouble not really
that doesn't look anything like it but
it's okay then we have the base
one-two-three-four-five
one-two-three-four-five this assigns
this 2g this assigns this F middle C is
right in between these two so detective
a clef would actually be right here
although we don't actually write it in
there because these are big enough to
cover enough of the notes all right so
that's all I have to say for this video
and the next video we'll be talking
about some more stuff so i shall see you
then bye and if you want to help me out
be sure to subscribe to my channel that
would be extremely helpful thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
