to be conceptually talking about the
standard deviation so we're not going to
be calculating the standard deviation
because right now we don't really have a
use for calculating the standard
deviation and I'm not a huge fan of just
doing calculations just because even
though I just did that in the previous
video crap
anywho the standard deviation is a
little bit more complicated so my goal
is to help you guys understand what the
standard deviation means and then if you
ever need the standard deviation you can
look up how to calculate it way simpler
than trying to memorize some formula or
understand it in a whole lot of depth
right now so the standard deviation is
based on a normal distribution a normal
distribution is when we look at a
particular feature for a bunch of data
and we plot it we get what looks like a
bell and it makes sense when we're
working with data that kind of occurs
naturally usually so think of like
height for example there's going to be
very few very short people there's going
to be a lot of average height people and
then very few very tall people that's a
normal distribution so if we plotted
this which we just did this would be
height and this would be amount of
people so the farther this way the
taller you are but the higher this way
the more number of people there are that
are that height so in here we can split
in half and this is going to be the
average so on average people are about
halfway through and I kind of kind of
went to the right a little bit but you
know just right in the middle that's
going to be the average in this
situation that's also going to be the
mode because that's the highest point
which means most of the people are going
to be at the average now what is the
standard deviation it's essentially a
calculation for how far something
deviates from this middle point and it's
split up into sections to where we have
measurements of one standard deviation
two standard deviations and three
standard deviations so we can just kind
of crop our data
in this section right here a particular
person who is about you know this high
right here and you know there's a lot of
people that high those are the people
who are one standard deviation away from
that center point the average so anybody
who is one standard deviation is pretty
close to the mean or the average now we
can go a step farther and grab people
maybe here and here and anybody in this
area these are the people who are not
super short and also not super tall this
is going to include a larger majority of
the people because a lot of people are
within two standard deviations away from
the mean we're only a small section of
people are out here so this will include
anybody who is sort of close like if you
were you know this tall on the height
height measurement well you're still two
standard deviations away from the mean
so you're still technically sort of
close three standard deviations you know
now we're getting kind of far these are
the people who are really short and
really tall but still not those giants
and those really really short people
okay now this looks terrible it's really
messy so I apologize about that but
essentially what you need to know is
that you can measure how close something
is to the average based on these
standard deviations so if I said
something was like three standard
deviations away well you know that's
pretty kind of far from the average
either that's that's pretty far distance
meaning the person is either pretty tall
or the other way pretty short because
now he's only like this tall rather than
like that tall no I'm saying I drew a
new one because it was looking pretty
terrible if we wanted to classify how
many people were in a particular area
well there's actually some standards
because you know we're basing this off
of the perfect example so generally
within this first deviation this is
going to include 68 of the people inside
of the second deviation that's going to
include those 68 plus some more so it's
actually going to be 95% of the people
now all the way up to the third
deviation well now we're talking holy
cow man that's like a lot of people
everybody in this box here well that's
actually going to be like ninety-nine
point seven percent of the people so to
get three standard deviations away from
the mean you basically got it I mean
almost everyone's gonna be within that
range two standard deviations that's
getting closer but still ninety-five
percent of the people you picked a
random person they're more than likely
gonna be in two standard deviations
sixty-eight that's getting a little
smaller so that is a little harder to
get into and but still the majority of
the people are going to be in that
little sliver yep so that makes sense I
mean if you had a hundred people 68 of
them would be within one standard
deviation ninety-five would be within
two standard deviations and ninety-nine
point seven of them would be within
three standard deviations and point
three if a person would be beyond three
standard deviations away from the mean
so hopefully that makes sense if you
want to know how to calculate that
search the internet and I'm sure that'll
be lots of fun so thank you guys for
watching please be sure to subscribe and
I'll see you in the next video that's
all these stats I have for you right now
so we're gonna get back into the machine
learning goodies so see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
