we're going to be discussing events
source this is also known as server-sent
events this one has to do with what's
known as a content type things on the
internet have a content type so when you
create an HTML page it has a content
type of text slash HTML there's a very
similar thing for JavaScript and all
other kinds of data on the Internet
well with the event source when you make
that first request to the server it
responds with a content type of text
slash event stream this text slash event
- stream is where the magic happens when
the client gets this it starts listening
for new data it's a stream it's
expecting to get new data so this opens
a one-way persistent connection from the
server to the client very similar to how
forever frame allows the server to send
stuff to the client just like forever
frame event source will have to make a
new request if the client wants to send
data to the server I would suggest that
the best way to think about this is the
subscriber concept so the client
subscribed to the server's stream of
continual content kind of how when you
subscribe to my YouTube channel you're
going to get notified of any new videos
hits hint well believe it or not that's
really all I have to say about event
source in the next video we'll be
talking about my favs
WebSockets see you then guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
