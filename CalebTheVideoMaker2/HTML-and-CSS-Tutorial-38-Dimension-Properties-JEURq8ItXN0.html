I'm going to be talking about dimension
properties I think that after out the
eye dimension yes there we go alright so
I use some of these actually but I never
really explain them so as you can see
when we scroll out our width of the
width or distance from left to right of
these comments or articles get bigger as
we scroll out you see what I'm saying
this could be a problem or it could not
be a problem so as you can see it always
goes to the default of the full length
so it no matter what it's going to
extend all the way across so I'm going
to get rid of all these extra divs and
stuff cuz it's just confusing me so now
we just have a div with three paragraphs
refresh all right awesome now we are
ready to start building awesome websites
right so excited
oh my goodness so very first thing we
can do is set a well within the
paragraph because that's what we're
going to affect we can actually now
let's do the div let's affect the div
yes oh I it appears that we have company
oh well with then wit and we can set a
min with what well it doesn't do
anything because as I said it always
extends past that you see I'm saying
so the minimum width is as small as it
can get it but by default it goes to as
big as it can get so it doesn't even
look at the minute clip but we can set a
max width and refresh it 50 pixels not X
oops
alright so now it crunches each one of
these did the entire div right here this
little red bar down at 50 pixels
obviously that's way too small that's
like almost nothing so we're going to
crank this up to 500 pixels which will
give us a good size comment there we go
that's that's pretty good so if I go to
default zoom that's it that's good for
comments articles to probably let it be
a little bigger let's change this
departments so now we have our comments
with a max width so we got a min width
which once again is not going to do
anything just by default it goes to the
max width so but we also have other
content that we can flick such as
minimum height this one actually will be
affected let's put this in a paragraph
tag so we can make a minimum height of
50 pixels all right I need to make a
colon not a semicolon so now each
comment has a doe has a default of 50
pixels at least so that means it's a
minimum height that means it can go
larger no lower than 50 pixels but it
can go larger than 50 pixels so let us
see if this is 450 pixels it probably is
because it's
pepper grass rocks with chair giraffe
jurors paragraph dare Dara graph graph
breath alright so now you can see it
extends farther than will be a lot of it
of the minimum of fifty pixels so
minimum for height does matter because
by default a website doesn't go to the
very bottom but by default websites do
go from the entire left to the entire
right and take up the entire page but we
fix that so now we have this these
comments that do not get limited by what
we put in them we can have let's put
this max width within the paragraph and
you can see the difference you can see
with the div the div is now extended so
we can have a full page web site we
could say something like max width let's
go eight let's go nine 960 pixels let's
go night-night urge because we're on a
small screen here so fresh so that is
the full size of the div so I can I can
explain this by let's let's let's write
some stuff I'm just gonna write content
literally content
so it goes beyond and if you want you
can turn the appropriate word rap to cut
that I think it would be rap
obviously break word it's because I
wanted to break the word I was getting
all confused but I got to figure out so
that is the example this can be our
website here this is what we have so far
see if I can render this word rapped
equals break order alright awesome so
now you can see the comments have a max
width of 500 pixels when the entire
website is 900 pixels wide so that is
really useful stuff you can also have a
max height and you can also combine
everything into one group with just the
it'd be either width or height so we
can't put like for example just width
and that's the exact width like 500
pixels or I could say 400 pixels which I
don't think it's going to do yeah so
that that sets it has 400 pixels so if
it's set at 400 pixels we have a max
width of 5 new pixels but it's not going
to reach that max width because the
width is keeping it at 400 so that
doesn't override the width hopefully
that makes sense well yeah that's pretty
much all I have to say about width sorry
for my little mistakes here and there
but I shall see you in the next video
