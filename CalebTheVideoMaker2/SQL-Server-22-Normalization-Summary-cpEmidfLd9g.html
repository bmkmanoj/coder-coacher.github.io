Caleb the video maker to this video we
are going to continue our discussion of
normalization now we've discussed the
three normal forms so I'm not going to
go back and explain all of that
information again that's what the
previous videos are for the point of
this video is to kind of summarize it so
you can look at the big picture now I'm
sure you know that the big picture is to
help our data be correct or essentially
to improve the integrity of our data but
still I think there's a couple things I
can add to help you understand why we do
normalization and why it's important if
you had to summarize normalization and
say what these three normal forms do you
could say it helps us better describe an
entity it helps us make sure our data is
describing what we want to describe that
means that all of these relate to the
key in some way so the first normal form
the purpose is to make sure everything
is atomic for one but ultimately we want
to make sure that the attributes
describing the entity are appropriate
for that table so we want to make sure
that everything in that table describes
the key in the smallest way possible
meaning columns are singular and each
row only stores one value for that
column so for first normal form we need
to make sure that all of our columns
depend on the key so a key is just a way
to describe the entity so we'd say user
ID would be the way we talk about a
specific user because think about it we
have to pick an attribute that allows us
to talk about an individual thing we
could use a picture we could use
something else we decided to use an ID
this is the primary key and all of the
columns in this table need to depend on
the primary key and each attribute needs
to have its own column now a second
normal form things get a little bit more
complicated because we no longer just
have this simple dependency we have
what's known as a partial dependency
essentially what second normal form says
is that every column needs to depend on
the entire key if we have multiple
columns so this is most common in many
many relationships that's because will
often have a combination of columns here
as the primary key which means any data
in this table needs to depend on both if
it doesn't depend on both it's what's
known as a partial dependency so second
normal form
everything describes the entire key now
when we go into the grounds of third
normal form we're talking about columns
that do depend on the key but they
depend on the key transitively meaning
through another column so if we have a
table we have three columns for example
you have to have at least three this
column might depend on this one which
depends on this one so you could say
this column depends on this one through
this one this is a transitive dependency
so in this situation this column right
here depends on the key transitively
here but it also depends on this column
too so in this situation there's two
dependencies it might be a little easier
to think about this if we switch these
columns so let's say this one depends on
this one which depends on this one so if
we had to label these ABC we would say C
depends on B and so third normal form
gets rid of these transitive
dependencies another way to word that
though is to say that every column
depends only on the primary key so in
this situation C doesn't only depend on
a that's because it depends on the keys
and another column so third normal form
makes sure that every column describes
only the key so to summarize first
normal form every column has to describe
the key singularly second normal form
every column describes the entire key
and third normal form
everything describes only the key or
some people say nothing but the key so
they'll say the key the whole key and
nothing but the key so that's a pretty
good summary of all the three normal
forms hopefully that was helpful if you
guys want to learn more about normal
forms I do have a database design series
where I discuss some more examples and
also you can research online boyce-codd
normal form and some of the other normal
form
we might get into some of those later
but for now I think this is adequate for
what we are trying to accomplish let me
know what you guys think be sure to

channel because that really helps me out
thanks guys and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
