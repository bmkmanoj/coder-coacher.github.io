will be talking about suspended chords
basically a suspended chord is just like
a power cord but you add either the
second or the fourth so i know this is
getting fancy and all tricky and stuff
so let's just go with a chord we
probably know already C major chord see
e.g what is this consistent of we have
the root the third and the fifth that
that's a c-major chord and if we come
off of the C major scale we got c d e f
g a b and then back to see we've got one
two three four five that's good enough
for now scared of these so what we're
going to do is we're going to get rid of
the phone the third and we're going to
replace it with either the D or the F so
typically it'll be the F so we could say
C sus which means see suspended that's
how you will typically see it written
now commonly you'll see either a two or
you will see a for written after it but
if there isn't anything there you should
assume that it's for because it's the
most common so now let's say I see
suspended we are going to have C F and G
and it's going to give us a new sound
it's a suspended sound if you remember
the old concept of figured bass which we
went over a while ago it's where we
place the notes above each other by the
amount of half-steps so we have the
route followed by followed by the second
two half steps what was that followed by
the fifth seven half steps and often see
like whoopsies you'll see like that now
if we're going with a suspended 4th we
will have the fourth five half steps
followed by the fifth seven half steps
so that is
so that is figured bass notation you can
go see my other video if you want to
learn about that or you just learn it
from road I just did it's just how many
half steps to the next note how many
half steps from the first note to that
note now as far as inversion skill well
it's actually kind of cool i think for
inverted suspended chords let's create
one we have see first let's go with
suspended 4th F and G now we got the
suspended second C B and G so basically
to invert this we can take the c scoot
it to the back so we got F G and soaps
and C so this becomes let's make this
the tonic this is the second and this
the fifth whoa so the fourth suspended
4th becomes a second suspended second on
the fourth scale degree that's the say
where the scale c c d e f g a b from
assy assy for suspended see suspended
4th we get an F suspended second so if
we take this and scoot it to the end we
have D G and C now we do it again to get
the second inversion we get G C D so I'm
just going over G C D which is actually
if you look at it which this now becomes
the fourth suspended 4th on the fifth
scale degree so we go from C to this
this if this is a second this is a
fourth if this is a fourth this is a
second now notice this is in first
inversion and this one's the second
inversion I know that was kind of
confusing but I don't want to get into
that because I could explain that for 10
videos I can talk forever so yeah that's
all I'm going to say basically the
fourth suspended with first inversion
becomes the second the second and second
inversion becomes suspended on the fifth
if you don't understand that just ignore
it it's not going to help you with
anything it probably won't help you that
much so yeah that's a lot to say so see
you later
