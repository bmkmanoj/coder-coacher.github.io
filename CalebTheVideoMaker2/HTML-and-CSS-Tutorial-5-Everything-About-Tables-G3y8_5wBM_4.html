HTML and CSS tutorial series once again
my name is caleb curry
it's 5:23 p.m. so let's get started this
video I'm going to be talking about
tables not like tables you eat on or
like tables you put stuff on I'm talking
about like digital tables so view of the
saw my databasing series you probably
know a ton about tables we can actually
create tables with HTML by the way check
out my databasing series it's awesome
off the hook
yo see ya just go do that there's like a
hundred videos come on how could you not
love it so to create a table we have
rows so what does a table look like well
let me open up Microsoft Paint
alright so here we have paint here's
what a table would look like let me find
a tool here we have a box and then we
have let's say it looks like this
alright so as you can say we would have
two columns column one two rows rows row
on row to row row your boat get it like
the song row row alright I'll stop so
this could be child let's say songs yeah
I got I got an idiot
this one is name this one is age so it
can say we have Caleb he is 14
then we can have odds gets Muniz el
libro look and that would be he is 18
then we have um mr. Jill he it's 84
whoops so yeah that's the idea of a
table I know it looks crappy
but we can figure out content and we can
store content within a table to make
things visually more appealing so let's
learn how to do that so we have h1
tables so that's that's our title to
start a table we put TR which stands for
table row no end the TR then within a
table row we have table data so they
call it so table data so let's try this
we could put just Caleb let's just see
what it looks like refresh oh and also
just to make things easier to see I'm
going to I'm going oh yeah forgot one
thing
press you have to type in table and then
we end the table so that is how you form
a table then you have table rows with
table data within them so now let's look
at it it still looks the same so I'm
going to add a little border put that
implication marks refresh now we have
Caleb let's add another one we go
so now we have two columns they have
name and age so yeah that's pretty cool
I know I forgot to end at h1 that's why
everything's so big so now we have the
appropriate content so let's create a
new table row all right now we could say
instead of name we could replace that
with a name we could put Caleb age 14
now within a new table row we could add
a new person we can go add a new table
data and table data what's in here we
put el fondo
and we could say he is 43 53 whatever
same thing now we have Caleb who's 14 el
fondo who's 53 then once we get this we
can kind of just duplicate it to create
some more copy and paste makes things
really easy we have Rebecca she is 74
and we also have Samantha she is 17 whoa
so now we have four rows two columns
first column would be the name and
second column would be the age there's
only one problem though we don't know
which what is this supposed to be just
random numbers there's this age or is
this how many times they've jumped off a
cliff and survived how many times they I
don't know gosh geez well now we can
actually add table headers which will
help us to visualize what's going on so
to do that we go to the top alright
where's the top
okay all I'm do rather than Western
sighs put table header and table do that
twice first one can be a second one can
be aged fresh now that is cool so we
could have a lot of cool data basing
illustrations and we can put content
from a database on these tables and so
forth which will look really nice and
visually appealing and nice and
attractive and did I say visually
appealing exactly so yeah tables are
awesome so yeah that's all I really had
sample tables just remember we have it's
kind of confusing at first but once you
get used to it it's easy we have the two
table headers a table row and on that
table row so this is the first row right
across here we have two columns table
data kaleb table data 14 let's see what
happens when we add a new table data
awesome so this is a description whoops
sorry about that guys again I don't
think you saw that something popped up
in the background my video editor all
right so now we have a whole new
category
let's see none of the other none of the
other call a rows have that so that's
the difference we could add up table
header description refresh so now we
have the description of the person so
that's how tables work if you want to
add a table header goes at the top it
works just like columns just right
across the top and then each row has
table data which is another word for
columns say if you didn't hear that
TD equals column sweet so that's all I
have to say about tables and I shall see
you in the next video thank you and
