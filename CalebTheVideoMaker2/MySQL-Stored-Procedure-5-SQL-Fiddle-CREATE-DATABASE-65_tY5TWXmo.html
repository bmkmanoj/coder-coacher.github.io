stored procedures and functions series
and just so you guys know me and my wife
are just chillin at my parents house
where I make my videos and we forgot
every essential that we'd ever need
including our suitcase and my microphone
so if the audio is a little wack I'm
sorry but we'll try to get a her
microphone sometime soon but for now
I'll just get started hopefully it's not
too bad the very first thing guys is I
wanted to introduce you to a very
awesome tool this is called SQL fiddle
and you can find at SQL fiddle com and
what this does is it allows you to type
SQL commands and use multiple different
database types but you don't have to
download anything and it's really cool
because once you type something up you
can actually save it and you can send it
as a link to somebody to show so to
start we're going to build a simple
database over here on the schema panel
so to begin we're going to create a
table and with SQL fiddle you don't have
to say create database or anything you
just start with your table so we can
just say create table and then give it a
name and we'll just call it pets we're
going to make a little table for pets
and list their names and their owners
and cool stuff like that now within
parentheses is where we put all of the
columns that we want in this table so
the very first column you're going to
want is an ID it will also have a name
owner sex birth that's going to be the
day they were born and then we're going
to have a death and this is not the
correct way your one going to want to do
this I just wanted to write out the
columns so next thing we're going to
need to do is put the the data types so
we're gonna have an int far char and
then you can give an amount so how many
characters you want it to be able to
store let's go with 50 and owner in a
more complex database you might have
another table that has a list of owners
and you might have this as a foreign key
but for now this is okay so we're gonna
have that as a varchar' as well sex
we're gonna make that a character just
one character so we're just assuming
either M or F birth that's going to be a
date same for death
that's not quite all we need to do
though we need to go back and we need to
go a little bit more in detail for this
ID we need to tell it that this is going
to be a primary key and that's going to
keep everything unique it's gonna be a
generated number the Auto increment
keyword is going to make the database
automatically increase the number of the
ID without us having to worry about it
so when we insert data into this
database we don't have to worry about
giving it an ID explicitly it'll just do
it itself so a couple other things I
want to add I think I'm going to throw
in a species here let's do it after the
owner and we'll make that bar chart as
well of our car however you want to
pronounce it and another thing I'm just
going to put some of the stuff on a new
line so it's easier to read without
having to scroll over and it should work
just fine so that is our table and just
so you guys can see how SQL fiddle works
we create our table and we can just
click build schema so we've created our
database and now we actually want to
insert data into our database well where
do we do that do we do this on the
schema panel or the query panel well I
can tell you ahead of time that we're
going to want to do it over here on the
schema panel that's because in SQL
there's two types of languages here I'll
just write them out here so you can see
them there's DDL and DML and that's data
definition language in data manipulation
language I think I have some videos over
this in my database design course but
for now data manipulation language
includes insert statements where we put
data into our table and all of data
definition language and data
manipulation language is going to go
over here in our schema panel and it's
really easy to figure that out because
you're like if we build this schema and
then we do an insert over here you can
see down here DDL and DML statements are
not allowed on the query panel for my
SQL only select statements are allowed
put DDL and DML in the schema panel so
that needs to go
over here so we are going to create some
data and put it inside of our table the
very first thing you're going to want to
do is give this semicolon so that way we
can put multiple statements in this
schema window so to put data into the
table we'll use an insert command and
because this is a new command I'm just
going to put that at the beginning and
then you can say into and name the table
that you want to put the data into and
that's going to be pets then what you're
going to do is put parentheses and here
you're going to define all of the
columns that you want to put data into
so we could put an ID here but like I
said the database is going to worry
about that for us so we are going to go
ahead and put every other column in here
and in this situation I didn't mark any
of these as not null but if you want to
force somebody to put data into one of
these you can just put a not null
keyword there and it should work just
fine but it's really not that big of a
deal because we're just kind of playing
around with some SQL here so we're going
to put name owner species sex birth and
death and then what you need to do is
put values parentheses and here is where
we pass in the values and sometimes it's
helpful if if you get confused on how
many is just to kind of put the commas
in ahead of time so first let's look at
the data types we have name owner
species sex birth and death those are
all going to be stored as strings or
we're going to need to give it strings
so that's going to be the name that's
going to be the owner that's going to be
the species sex birth and death and yes
you do pass in dates as strings as I
mentioned earlier this owner might be a
foreign key to another table and if
that's the case you're probably not
going to use a string but an integer and
if that's a situation you just leave
that like that so you know you need to
put an integer in there because you put
the ID of whatever owner it is so to
begin let's give it a name let's say
snowflake the owner just a little girl
named a win because she can't say her
ours yet
species let's say it's a robo hamster
and for the birth the format you're
going to want to use is year month date
same for the death but we'll just leave
that null and for nulls where you don't
want to put that in a string or it'll be
stored as a string that as null which
isn't gonna work for the date datatype
so that should be good for that but how
do you give it another row well you just
put a comma and then you can give it
another parentheses cuddles owner Frank
it's gonna be a kitty poor guy he only
lives one day oh I think that's
everything I don't think I screwed
anything up so let's give it a try okay
unknown column birth and field list what
did I screw up Biff that would explain
it and there you go we made our database
that's why SQL fiddle is really pretty
cool because we don't have to worry
about actually creating that database
and making a table if I want to change
something I can just type it in here and
then build a schema and then boom you're
good to go
but obviously and you make sure you have
correct syntax so now over here we can
give our commands and that's what we're
going to be doing in the next video now
that we have our database and table
created so thanks guys be sure to
subscribe and I'll see you guys then
thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
