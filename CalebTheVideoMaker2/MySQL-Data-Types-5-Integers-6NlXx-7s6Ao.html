of this tutorial series and I'll be
covering all of these data types we have
the intz which stands for integers then
we have the all the decimal any numbers
with decimals and then we have bit
boolean and serial and I will start with
int and I will be explaining everything
about them all right before I go into
explaining this I need to teach you a
term and that is Sun or oxide signed all
right now what this means is basically
has to do with the negatives or
positives if a number is signed it
allows for negatives and positives so
negative 10 to 10
oops that's a signed value an unsigned
value would be 0 all the way up to 20
you see it still covers the same range
because now we don't have to worry about
this first negative 10 numbers so we can
add them onto the end to allow for 10
more so I'll be using this term in this
and just remember that if it's unsigned
it's a bigger number because you'll have
to worry about the negatives unsigned
values do not have negatives another
term is integer I'll just write that
elephant integer now integer is any
whole number such as 7 negative 12 438
an example that is not an integer is
0.65 these are not and
because for one pi doesn't end and that
has a decimal so integer is any cool
number negative or positive
all right now tinyint it store it as a
one by integer it's a one byte and these
increment up by one each time so two
three four and then but bigint
dies eight byte integer all right here
are the max unsigned values for each one
of these so if you remember tinyint max
255 was a one byte storage which that
means it's 8 bit because there's 8 bits
in one bucket so if you take here's an
equation two to the eighth power minus 1
this is an equation that you can figure
out these numbers so this 8 you can
replace it with the bits of each number
if you take 2 to the 16 you'll get
65,536 and then if you subtract 1 you
will get 6,000 65535 and this will work
for all of these now you can see down
here big int is a huge flippin number I
mean I could barely even write that I
was about ready to just be like I
already just read it to you when you use
a tiny it's 1 number between that range
so this will be 0 to 255 so a valid
entry would be 166 entry of 432 would
not be valid you would have to go up to
small n because that 0 to 100 I mean 165
thousand now if you need a negative
number then you'd have to use a sign
value so so let's say you have a
negative negative 166 that's still big
for this because the sine value for this
the lowest number it can go is negative
128 so then you have to still use
smaller now if you remember with um
varchar' you would put something in
parentheses after the end instead of our
char like or which will out for 4
characters or like two characters
anything below 4 now when it comes to
integers it doesn't work the same it
works a little different in 5 this does
not mean that 5 is the max number you
can store and it does all it also
doesn't mean it allows for 5 digits this
is what they call the display with so
basically what this means is let's say
you have a number 49 and you have a
number number 10 20,000 all right so
20,000 has five spots digits 1 2 3 4 5
all right so let's look kind of like
that cuz there's five here this would be
entered as 20,000 across here but the
number 49 you see as it's using 5 spots
as the display width so it actually be 0
0 of 0 49 and a thousand would be 0 1 0
0 0 0
yeah that's right so that's that's what
a display with this it basically the if
this was 6 then there's a bit of a
pattern to the left with another 0 this
isn't really used that much like
especially in the real world and you
only really see in effect when you have
smaller numbers than
this now I'd like to remind you if you
have a number let's say like over 9000
you can't use int well I'm sorry you
can't use tiny int because it's it only
goes up to 255 unsigned so go up to the
next one which allows up to 65,000 so
that'll work
now I want you to remember only use the
data type that will store what you need
so let's say you need a range from 0 up
to 500,000 you could use you can't use
tiny is it too small and you can't use
smaller that's too small you small
across that because that doesn't allow
for 500,000 so the next is medium int
and then there's also a int and then
bigint so which one should you use I
want you to remember to always use the
smallest that will store what you need
if you're not sure don't worry about
going over just if you know you'll never
go over 500,000 then there's no reason
to use big in for one numbers freaking
huge and you're never I mean
realistically you won't need a number
that big unless you do then that gives
you a reason to use it otherwise don't
you want to stick with the smallest that
supports what you need
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
