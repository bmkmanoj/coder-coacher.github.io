inner joins crossed multiple tables so
you're probably wondering okay what does
that mean well when we have a join we
join multiple tables but what if we want
to join that join of multiple tables
with more tables so basically we're
going to have a join over three or more
tables trying to form a green marker
there it is okay how does this work well
let's just draw some boxes this kind of
get an idea of how this might look okay
so you might be like okay cool we
figured out inner joins and how those
work but how do they work when you have
three tables let's let's find out here
we have three tables and when we do an
inner join let's say in the last example
we joined these two tables we had some
kind of join condition which is
something like customer daaad customer
ID equals card got customer ID you know
well it doesn't always have to be that
it just depends on what you're doing
with it but basically you're going to
have a join condition right here and
you're also going to have a join
condition right here if you want to join
in another table these tables don't
necessarily have to be connected like a
many-to-many relationship is when we
design many to many relationships it
looked like this with like the
intermediary table it's not always the
case for example this table could have a
relationship with this table and this
table could have a relationship with
this table but this table doesn't
necessarily have to have a relationship
with this table think of it like this
when you do the join on these two tables
you're going to get a result set right
then if you want to know what your next
results are going to be when you add
this table in think of joining these and
you're going to get a final result set
so if you do an inner join across
multiple tables the end result set is
going to be smaller than this because
you think about it if you join these two
tables you get a result set
but now you have to take all of these
rows and you're only going to display
the ones that meet the requirements of
this join condition which is going to
decrease the size or the amount of rows
in this table and it's going to be
shorter most cases now let's talk about
this a little more let's go through the
example we had before with the cars and
the customer but we're going to add a
new table right so we're just going to
draw a Sal but this is the customer
table and we had a customer ID a first
name last name you can also have any
other junk you want to store about the
customer in there then we had the card
table read the card card ID and then the
customer ID and then they like max
amount or whatever else you want to
store about the card the bill or
whatever the price or the interest rate
now let's throw in another table in this
equation let's throw another table into
this equation it's going to be a card
type table so you know when you get like
a credit card because all you college
students are like yeah I need pizza well
there's the card is it type such as Visa
MasterCard or whatever else America
Express well that's kind of like the
card type generally a bank will just
give out like one card type but we could
say that they can like we could just say
what kind of card type the card and this
table is now when you structure it that
way how many different card types are
there hmm four or five main ones Visa
MasterCard American Express maybe two
other ones that are somewhat popular
there's not that many so if you were to
store that in a column and this one
you're going to get a lot of repeating
data and then for example with
MasterCard decides to change their name
or they get bought out by somebody else
and all the cards now are named
Ultra card then that's going to cause
problems because all of the you can
you're going to have a master card and
then ultra cards can be confusing so
what you can do is use a lookup table
which we discussed in a long video ago
and that's going to be basically a
reference to another table with all the
possible options and that way if you
need to do add a new option you can do
that easily and then just reference that
or if you need to update an option or if
you want to put extra information about
that option for example if Master Card
has a standard fee or something you
could put that within the card type
table rather than within the card table
because if you have the card table like
look if you have card ID and then you
have card type and then you have
something about that card type so card
type interest or something well this is
a transitive dependency which is a
violation of the normal forms I believe
second normal form
don't forget third normal form I'm sorry
anyways that's not good so you want to
take these and put them in a new table
so a lookup table is a defense against
problems like that and it also reduces
integrity problems and it can also
reduce repeating values
so now let's design this we're going to
have a lookup table
cuz card type and this is going to have
card type ID and then the card type
which is going like the name of it and
then you could have any other rows about
the card type in there and then in the
card we're going to reference that with
the foreign key so it's just looking it
up the values through the through the
lookup table so we're going to have card
type ID
that is a Ford key now let's draw these
connections customer ID is a foreign key
to the customer and the card type ID is
a foreign key to the card type so you
can see we have all this information
spread out over three tables and we want
to add eight we want to join these and
create a new generated table that
contains information from all three we
want it to be an inner join in this case
but you can do the same thing with outer
joins and other types of joins will be
discussing this soon but for this we
want it to look like this this is what
we want our generated view or our new
table to look like we want to select
stuff about the customer it's got some
columns and they're just to put in here
the cab on the first name last name
email phone amount paid and then we
could also have the card type right here
it's more room here guys one is
something cool
well we're completely off topic just for
a second I always like drew comics as a
kid and I always like drew a bubble
around like either a thought or a talk
and then I try to fit all the words into
that I never worked and then why master
drawing friends like dude draw the words
first and then draw a bubble around it
it was like the best idea ever but I
still don't do it I mean I always have
to erase the sides of my database tables
to fit more junk in there should always
write the words first and then draw a
square around them but this work these
are all from this table this is from
this table the card type is from this
table it's a joint across three tables
and you could of course add more now the
joint conditions well it would be for
this the customer ID is the same as the
customer ID and the card type ID is this
the card type ID so this table first is
going to exclude here I'll just write
out what it's going to exclude this
isn't part of the table but I'm just
putting here it's going to exclude
customers with no card cards have no
customers that's going to be the first
joint condition because we're going from
here and then the second joint condition
it's going to remove cards with no card
type and also card types with no cards
and that means basically if you have
MasterCard as a card type and you
haven't created any card
rows that also have the foreign key that
references MasterCard or whatever I said
then that's not going to be included
because there would be nothing to put
with it and just say mastercard no no no
no no that's because no cards have it
and no people have cards that have it so
that's the what inner join is going to
do it's going to do all this so the end
result is going to basically get smaller
and smaller and small smaller for every
single table you add now it's a couple
other things to think about here it has
to do with things being null or not null
okay let's talk about it the way we have
a set up is the customers they can have
a card but they don't have to have a
card that's because there's no required
column in here that says you have to
have a card ID so you could have a
customer that has multiple cards for
example we also have a card table and
the way we have a set up the card
doesn't necessarily have to have a
customer if you want to change that you
could take this customer ID right here
and you could make it
not null that is going to change the end
result because now every single card is
going to have to have a customer that
means cards with no customers
although functionally it's removing all
the cards with no
stores every single card has a customer
so the end result doesn't eliminate
cards with no customers functionally it
does though because that's what the
inner join does but since there's none
to remove it doesn't do anything so you
can kind of think of it as not doing
this
even though functionally does remember
that it's a difference all right now we
also have it where the card I would say
it should have a card ID or a card type
ID I should say because almost every
card you're going to get ever is going
to have a card type right unless for
some reason they wouldn't you'd likely
have that as not null so functionally
this is going to remove cards without
card types but since it's labeled as not
an old every single card is going to
have a card type therefore in the end
result it doesn't really remove cards
with no card type because every card has
a card type so there's nothing to remove
now card type there might be a
possibility you're offering a new card
type such as let's say so I can't think
of any cool names like legit card type
12 and like a new company comes out
there you get a legit card type 12 card
and we'll all through your new bank
account and that might you when you
first get that there might not be a card
that has been issued that card type yet
so in the end result you're only really
removing the customers with no cards and
I guess the card types with no cards I'm
going to keep that so that's going to
say so these two are going to be removed
and this is the end result here we're
going to keep card types of note cards
and customers with note cards that was a
big one mammoth roars okay but that's
about all guys so if you understood that
a good job because I don't thank you for
