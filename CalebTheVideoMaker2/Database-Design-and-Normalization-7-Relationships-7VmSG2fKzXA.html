I'll be talking about table
relationships all right now basically in
the last video I went over what was
called a foreign key and a primary key
primary key keeps things unique in each
table and then a foreign key references
to that primary key and I'm really
thirsty so it drink um on this video
it's professional alright so that I got
this up here alright so basically a
foreign key references a primary key now
what we have next are cold relations or
relationships
you don't understand trust me so here we
got relationships
now there's three kinds of relationships
that is one to many actually
here's the three kinds the one-to-one
one-to-many many-to-many if you don't
understand that don't worry promise you
you'll understand okay so let's go over
the first one one-to-one just had to fix
that else
Isis bugging me perfect
do you guys do that when you're making a
video and you look back at the camera
you always have a habit of looking at
the screen rather than the eye cuz like
I always have the screen facing me so I
can see what I'm doing but then one like
make sure it's all in frame when I look
at the camera I always look like all for
the eye then I look like an idiot
rather nuts anyways alright one two one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
