Python tutorial in this video we are
going to be talking about the if
statement or conditional now what is the
if conditional basically it'll take a
question and it will give different
results depending upon the answer to
that question so let's let's think of a
real world example let's say we have
this club right and you have to be at
least 18 to get into the club well a
question might be are you 18 if the
answer is yes 18 or older then welcome
if you're not 18 or older then we'll say
go away well that's a conditional it's
called a conditional because the the end
result depends upon the question answer
so let's see how we would set this up if
age is less than 18 : so this is the
question that we are asking here's how
we set it up if H is less than 18 this
completes the question and then we put a
colon to say what we want to do if our
age is less than 18 now the only problem
with this is that age is not defined you
can see we never defined age so Python
has no idea what age really means so the
first thing we're going to do before we
start this thing so you're gonna have to
go age has the value let's say 15 right
now we can say if age is less than 18 :
now when we press ENTER it's going to go
to a new line and indent it you see we
have this big space here what that tells
python is that anything following this
belongs to the if statement so all of
the stuff we type here will only be done
if the age is less than 18 so we could
say print
and then within here we could say you
are too young good sir
close enough all right so now age is 15
and if the age is under 18 we want to
print this so will it print well let's
think if we can basically just take this
value and swap it for the word age so if
15 is less than 18 print you are too
young good er all right so let's try it
and you have to press ENTER twice
because this continues the if statement
so press ENTER twice and you can see
that it did print the results so now I
want to change the value of age let's
make it 19 okay and then I want to take
the if statement again bring it down
here and now if age is less than 18 we
want it to print you are too young good
now it's 19 so if 19 is less than 18
print this which it's not so nothing
should happen and you can see nothing
happening so that is how the if
statement works what we can also do is
we could have multiple lines right here
so let's try this let's take this back
down here and we say print come back
oops I forgot my quote
come back in a few years please all
right now it won't only say you are too
young gooder it'll say come back in a
few years please all right so now age is
still 19 so when we press ENTER
nothing's going to happen but now if we
set age to 14 and then we do this if
statement again you can see that it
tells us this so what why is this
practical well in a program some some
values are going to be dynamically
assigned what that means is it might
change a pawn who is using the program
and when it is being used it's not set
within Python it's set by the user of
the program so we might have a program
that says like H and then you have to
insert your age when the age is inserted
it's assigned to the variable age and
then we run the if statement so it's not
like we're going to assign it within
this Python shell in all instances
sometimes it'll be created or assigned a
value when the program is being used
that's what makes programming useful so
we can have a program that is only
accessible if you're over 18 or younger
than 18 and vice versa oh yeah why are
you said both of us anyways the next
video that we're going to be talking
about we're going to be talking about
how to use an else clause or statement
or whatever you want to call it and what
that will do is that will basically give
us a new answer if the if the age is
over 18 so be sure to check that out and
I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
