tutorial in this video I want to talk
about super Global's so this is probably
a new concept to you and I'm just going
to be scratching the bare minimal
surface so you sort of understand what
superglobals are when we start working
them and working with them in future
videos so a superglobal is just a
variable that has a value that's an
array which contains a lot of
information it's pre defined so that
means these super bubbles are already
defined in PHP so basically they contain
a ton of information about certain
things so for example one of them is so
this is the server super global array
it's in all capital letters so you have
to use it that way and this is an array
that's going to contain a lot of
information about the server that this
PHP is a running on so for example you
can use within these blocks you can use
I think it's Crips file I am running out
of room sorry I'm gonna have to go to
the next line so pretend this right here
file so oh this is an example of one
this is an associative array that means
we are using strings as the keys so this
key points to another value which would
be the file name and the actual location
of the file so this is going to say
where on your server that this file is
looking
this is just an example just throwing
random stuff together this would be a
value that it would return and you can
actually use this to get the file name
of the file that you're running or
echoing this outline so for example we
could echo out the value of this or what
we can do is assign this to a nother
variable to make things easier we could
say and then we could assign this the
value of the variable server blah blah
you get the point and then we can easily
use the file variable so we could be
like echo file and that's going to
easily give us back the file that we're
using that we are get from the super
global array um there's a lot of super
global erase I will just list some of
the common ones right now my handwriting
is pretty horribly bad but here are some
of the ones you will run across global
server get post files cookies session
request env these all have a bunch of
different information that will be used
on your PHP journeys for example the
request method or not method I'm sorry
the request superglobal is going to
contain information requested from a web
page so if you have something in a name
field and you put a value in you can
access this using the request method or
the post and get method which will be
sorry you can access this using the
request superglobal array and then you
can use that information later or you
can get this with the get in post
superglobal array and we'll be getting
into all of these in the future I just
wanted to introduce
these concepts another thing is the
reason we can assign these two different
variables so like earlier we did file
and then we assign it the value of
server and then the file name thing
well this is because when you're echoing
it out if you're if you're you can't
echo it out directly just remember that
you will need to use the curly braces
when using a associative array and we
talked about that when we talked about
associative arrays so if you just want
to make your life easier just to sign
these to another variable and then use
that variable so echo file rather than
echo server and then all that extra junk
it just makes things easier in my
opinion but that's just an extra step
that you don't have to do and honestly
it's not necessary so yeah those are
just the basics of this and in the next
video we'll be getting into more of this
and actual PHP programming so hopefully
this video is helpful and hopefully
you'll subscribe and like this video and
I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
