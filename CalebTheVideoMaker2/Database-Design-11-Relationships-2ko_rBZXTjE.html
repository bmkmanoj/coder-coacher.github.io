be about relationships and I don't mean
relationships as in dating advice
because I probably couldn't give any of
that but besides that we're going over
database relationships so what is a
relationship well in a database
everything is connected
it's think of it like a giant web
somehow something is connected to
something else rather than storing
everything in a giant table sorry I mean
what my boards kind of wet so it's ah
really writing very well we split that
and then we have two smaller tables for
manageable data simplicity as well as a
data integrity reasons so now we still
have to maintain the connection between
data so we take one huge table break it
into two tables and then we have what's
known as a relationship there are
multiple kinds of relationships and
we'll be talking about that in the next
video but for this video we'll be
talking about the general concept of
relationships so relationships talk
about entities and entity is anything we
store data about so this is an entity
and this is an entity and they are
related in some way they're connected
there's a relationship between them this
Erasers crap die ah there we go
okay there we go
except now my chalkboards all wet all
right
oh why am i side so I have to worry
about entities there's two terms that we
talked about earlier entities and
attributes entities are anything we
store data about attributes are the
things we store about the data well when
it comes to entities weight that
attributes are what we store about the
entities so basically we have Indies and
then we have the image from use for that
entity right and then we have a
different entity so that is part of our
database design we figure out all of the
things we're storing data about think of
like a college we could store
information about the student the
professor the classes the faculty the
whatever else so we can have multiple
entities and then multiple attributes
about that entity and then we can have a
third entity so just think Club student
professor class this is all part of our
database our database so our database
structure consists of three entities and
attributes about each one of those
entities what's an example of an
attribute well it can be the students
name the students address the classes
they're taking the what they're whatever
it doesn't really matter they're a major
that's another 2d we could have an
entity about the majors such as science
or whatever else then we could have
attributes from that like the classes
that are required to get that major how
long it takes and so forth that will
become part of our database struck
well these are still related in some way
because we have a student is a student
is going to school for a major so
there's a connection from this entity
down to the major so let's just replace
these look like here's student and then
okay that looks like crap gonna happen
let's put some specific examples in here
we could have a student we could have a
professor sample proof then we could
have class and then we can have major
well a student goes to school to get a
major a student takes classes the
classes are taught by a professor the
professors typically have a specific
area that they teach so they might be
part of the major like the major lichte
teachers for that major whatever
students yeah you get the point
everything's connected so when we design
relationships that tells us how we want
to structure our tables that's going to
make a lot more sense in the next video
so I just wanted to introduce the idea
of relationships in this video the next
video will be talking about a specific
kind of relationship
so one-to-one that is a type of
relationship there are two other ones
one-to-many and many-to-many here are
our three types of relationships and we
will be talking about each one of these
individually in the next three videos so
hopefully you are interested in seeing
those this is when we really get started
with actually designing databases
alright so thank you for watching and be
sure to subscribe click like and I'll
see you in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
