wanted to go over a term you may see and
your music theory quests and journeys
that is harmonizing a major scale now
this is actually we've actually been
through this this is another way of what
i said was chord progression we're
taking the notes which are melodic we're
taking the melodic notes and we're
transferring transforming them into
harmonic we're just going to go over
this because you may see this term and i
want you to understand what this this
phrase means it's taking the notes in
each scale and adding thirds upon them
for example at the D major scale d e F
sharp G a B and C sharp now we're going
to harmonize these by putting them in
harmony if you don't remember harmony is
notes played together melody is notes
played one after the other so melodic
and harmonic melodic is one after the
other harmonics together so we're taking
this and harmonizing them to play notes
together so we're only going to use
notes within the scale and their third
so basically we just skip every other
one so like that we're going to ignore
these two and we get D F sharp and a now
for back at E we do the same thing we go
e to g e to be e hopes are that be e G B
and we just keep doing that let me clean
this up so we can see
try not to draw on as much d F sharp G a
B and C so you have D F sharp and up
let's see chart below f sharp a EG be F
sharp to see no GF GA be so f sharp a
and C sharp alright have a sharp hey C
sharp then we have G go from there be
any so G sorry d so G B D a c-sharp e
back to be we got B D F sharp now c
sharp we have C sharp E and G so how
does this work these are just thirds
from each other which basically means we
skip every other note from that note now
we're only using the notes within the
scale C sharp this shows that when we
have a seat we need to sharp it so this
is the same concept of chord progression
we talked about earlier this will create
all this would be sharp this will create
a major chord egb creates a minor chord
so this is it f-sharp minor chord this
will be a major chord this will become a
major chord this will become a minor
chord and this will become a diminished
chord same chord progression we talked
about a while ago major minor minor
major major minor diminished now I want
to show you something the first the
fourth and the fifth are almost always
when we're going through this chord
progression they will always be
st. they're both major that this one was
minor these two would be minor same for
these these work like that if this one's
minor these two are minor and then we
have a little diminished all by himself
00 forever alone not really but anyways
that is the concept of harmonizing a
major scale we've been through it
probably 100 times now so hopefully that
sticks in your brain and i'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
