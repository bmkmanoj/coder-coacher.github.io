just loving this series this is a great
refresher for me as well as for you guys
watching and because the last video went
a little long I'm going to try and cut
this one a little short without getting
rid of content just gonna stop rambling
on for 20 minutes so I might as well get
started because I'm starting to ramble
on for 20 minutes
alright so what we're going to learn
about now is we're going to learn about
passwords so if we can could we create a
new paragraph tag and we could say enter
your password so now this is what we
have we don't have an input for it yet
so we could create an input right
awesome all right I'm gonna get rid of
these size and max length carry everyone
keep max like that's cool but sighs it's
just throwing everything off so now this
is what we had this should be over here
the reason this is below this is because
I accidentally stopped the paragraph
before the input which broke these up
into two separate segments so to fix
that boom now it looks better all right
great
we can actually have a new type we can
set it equal to password now what's cool
about this is it blocks out your
character so you can see them so when
you go on to like website and you sign
in they will have the input type of
password right that doesn't mean it's
completely secure but we'll be getting
into that soon so just like input we
could have name equals password ID it's
equal to password value obviously we
don't want to value because if they
haven't value it's going to star them
out like that so I don't think we really
need a value I'm just gonna get rid of
that max length
let's give it 20
awesome so now we have max length
characters a 20 max password and the 60
max you
that's pretty huge so let's check that
20 as well awesome so now we have start
of a form you see it's looking pretty
good in my eyes I like it and I don't
know why that's there what's that for
that's supposed to be down here whatever
alright so what is the problem with
password forms
well hTML is sent to the browser where
as a programming language such as PHP is
kept on the server let me get out my
paint I'm going to show you some sweet
illustrations I like illustrations for
some reason right so let's draw a
computer here we have a computer with a
keyboard and everything and this is the
server s e are the e our server then we
have the client computer alright and
when you go to a website such as whoops
little too long that's why it's I such a
long username Oh
whoops you're actually give it you're
going to a what's called what's called
IP address of this website which we're
not going to get into that that's
something completely different but let's
just say this this is where you're going
you are requesting an HTML page so
they're going to take a document let's
say this is a document the web page HTML
make that red
okay I don't know from cutting this
video short or not at this rate it's
gonna take forever and then this goes to
your computer and shows up on your
computer screen right that means
anything sent through the HTML you have
access to which means it's on your
computer you can do what you want with
it but a programming language such as
PHP well when you send that HTML page
back to the server it hits a PHP script
making sense and then this PHP script
takes the content you put in such as
Caleb curry and with the PHP script you
can check to see if it's in a database
or anything else having to do with the
server so the PHP never goes to your
computer there's a magic wall here that
the PHP script never passes the HTML can
pass through in fact it does see we have
an arrow here passes this way passes
this way Oh wrong direction name which
goes back this way which finally reaches
the server so the HTML goes in this big
circle thing but anything sent to our
computer we can mess with so if you look
here type in a password alright then we
can actually modify this right click
inspect elements at least on Google
Chrome this is how it is here we can
modify all of our HTML and CSS and
everything else that's because it was
sent to our browser which is Google
Chrome so input type we can actually
change this to text and can display what
the form said let's try to get drink
here really thirsty talking a while so
this is a problem this this holds
through on other websites too
so let's go to its good at Facebook
now let's gosh I can't choose it's good
we're all right and I'm going to sign
out and then I'm going to sign in right
so I can type it in actually I don't
know yeah then I could type in a
password here inspect elements type we
can change this to text and boom we can
actually modify this website itself
which I'm not going to change anything
else because I don't want to get in
trouble for defacing the website I mean
it doesn't actually affect the website
itself but on my computer it does so
someone can go onto my website inspect
the elements and they could change this
to hey and it looks like that for them
but when they refresh it it goes away so
that is how it all works
that's why password is only a temporary
form of blocking what's being said from
other people like people watching they
don't know what it said but to safely
pass passwords to servers you're going
to need a little bit more which HTML
doesn't even work with the forms scripts
such as PHP does that so that's all I
really have to say about passwords in
the next video we will be going over
submit buttons and some other stuff so I
will see you then thank you for watching
and by the way don't hack your friends
by if they save their passwords and they
automatically show up when they go to a
website whatever you do don't hack their
password by changing the input type text
don't do that and then don't write it
down and don't sign into their stuff and
then whatever you do do not share my
content on their Facebook page or
whatever you're going on do not do that
I repeat don't hack your friends and
share my stuff thank you and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
