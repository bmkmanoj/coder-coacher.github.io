maker - this video is going to be
talking about the integer data types in
mysql now int is short for integer this
data type is broken up into multiple
data types similar to how the text data
type is broken up into multiple data
types but it's a lot different than the
text data type so don't use that as a
reference but I am going to break this
up into all of the parts now here are
the other available sizes as for
comparison to the int data type it would
go right here in size which is kind of
confusing if you're thinking about the
text data type because the text data
type looks like this so the text is in
between tiny and medium there is no such
thing as a small text and the biggest
one is called long not big so there's
literally no correlation with naming
when it comes to int verses text so
don't associate sizes between these two
so I'm going to put that int in its
right location so we can see it more
clearly the integer data type is a data
type that is used for exact numbers what
that means is that the numbers do not
lose precision when you store a number
and do math with it you will always get
the expected result this is in contrast
with other data types which are for
estimates which we will discuss those
very soon now each one of these has a
maximum size of a number that they can
store if you want to know the exact
numbers you can look those up but
roughly I think this one's 2 5 5 6 5 5 3
5 this one's about 16 mil and then this
one is about 4 billion and then this one
is like thinking a ton and these three
are just estimates now these values are
for what are known as unsigned integers
and unsigned integers do not allow
negative numbers the benefit of that
though is that the highest number you
can store is much higher that's in
contrast to signed integers where half
of the range of values goes in the
negative so imagine this here is a
number line
here is zero and let's say if you range
of values that are allowed is the size
of this piece of chalk if we had a
signed integer half of it would have to
go in the negative and half of it would
have to go in the positive if it's
unsigned we can put all of it in the
positive and get a higher number now the
last thing I want to mention about the
integer data types is that they are used
to store whole numbers probably sure to
set that at the beginning but you know
whatever
so that means 10 is allowed but 10.5 is
not allowed if you want to store a
decimal you need to use either the
decimal type or float or double which we
will talk about all of these in the
upcoming videos so thank you guys for
watching this video hopefully it was
helpful to you if you've liked it be
sure to click like and as always be sure
to subscribe I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
