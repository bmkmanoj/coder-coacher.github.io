tutorial series i'm caleb from cables
video maker 2 and in this video we are
going to start talking about data
integrity now there are three categories
of data integrity
we have entity integrity referential
integrity and domain integrity each one
of these is going to get its own video
so this video is going to talk about
entity integrity entity integrity is
very simple all it says is that every
table needs a primary key when you label
something a primary key it's
automatically going to be unique and not
null
sorry my dog is feasting right now so if
you hear my mom in the background it's
him
I apologize he could not be stopped in
addition to this a primary key should
never change these are the three things
that need to happen for something to be
a primary key now there's actually two
classifications of primary keys
surrogate keys and natural keys
surrogate keys are simple they're just
computer generated numbers that have no
real world meaning so this is often the
ID column in a table natural Keys on the
other hand are a little bit harder to
work with because these have to have
real-world meaning such as a username or
an email or anything that can be unique
a onyx we're licking the floor now this
is not something we tell the database we
don't say yo database this is a
surrogate key or this is a natural key
Onix drink water drink it drink your
water these are just these are just
terms for us to help understand the
different kinds of keys and these are
terms people are going to use so you
need to understand them why is having a
key so important well if you have a
table and it doesn't matter what the
columns are let's just say that's a row
and then we have another row and you can
see this is duplicate data and this
brings up the question do we have one
two entries that are supposed to be
different or is this the same entry in
there twice it's kind of confusing but
if we have a primary key we can always
assume that there are two different
things so for example if we have here 8
and 9 and this would be like the ID we
know that this describes an entity and
this describes in it so these are
unique check they're not all because
every single one has a value and it has
to never change let's see what would
happen if it did change let's say that's
changed to 19
now we're confused because it was 9 and
now it's 19
so does this 19 refer to a new entity or
the same entity with a new ID it's
confusing if we were following the rules
of primary keys and that they never
change I would assume that it's a new
entity and since people assume that we
don't want to change our primary keys
ever so if you're using a natural key
you got to make sure it's something
that's not going to change and that's
kind of hard to figure out like an email
that's pretty good because it might not
change but what if someone wants to
change their email well then they have
to change their account information and
then it's no longer a very good primary
key so you'd have to restrict people to
not being able to update their email
well a user name might work because in
that situation it's not going to change
you can restrict people from updating
their user name that's just for like a
user table example but you're gonna have
those kind of problems with any table
that you use natural keys because of
that I think more people are starting to
use certain keys our surrogate keys
better I don't know that's up to you
there's downsides and upsides to using
either one
for example natural keys are much more
readable instead of having this number
here we could have a string that
actually has a value in and this allows
you to do less joins which we haven't
really discussed but essentially when
you have multiple tables and you want to
get data from both of these tables you
have to join them natural Keys allow you
to use less joints but in general I'm
probably going to go with surrogate Keys
I think they're easier to work with and
I think they're more common if you want
to use natural Keys I'm totally cool
with that just make sure that they're
unique not null and they never change
ever so yeah everyone that's your
