going to talk about foreign keys
specifically on delete and on update
this is Kayla from Caleb the video maker
too but you can snow that so let's not
waste any time let's get started on
delete why is it always look crooked is
the andouille is a way we can configure
the way our foreign key works so let's
go back to the parent-child relationship
concept from the last video and last
video is basically a prerequisite to
this video because I'm not going to
waste all my time repeating all that
information so we have a parent role in
a child row and his child Row obviously
references the parent using a foreign
key so this table will have a column
such as ID and then this table will have
a parent ID whatever the parent is so it
could be like user ID or whatever and
that value references the parent but
what happens if we try to delete this
parent row oh no and I bet you you
cannot guess what Clause is used to
configure that yeah didn't think so
moron it's on delete okay I'm so mean
yeah I'm keep it yeah I'm keeping it in
so on delete can be added after we
define our foreign keys and we can say
what happens when we delete the parent
and there's four main options in sequel
server no action cascade set null and
set default we are going to discuss each
one of these in a little bit of detail
the first one is no action that is
actually the default so if you don't say
anything and you just say this is a
foreign key that references this column
this is the one that's going to be
applied what that means is if you try to
delete a parent it's just gonna throw an
error and say you can't do this you
cannot do this essentially what that
means is that once a child references a
parent that parent is locked into
existence until that child is no longer
there no action is probably the most
safe one you can use because once you
start having all these tables and all
these references and this child
references this
one and this one references this parent
you got this huge network of connections
and when you have no action you
basically can't break any of those
connections accidentally but this has
the downside and that it makes it really
hard to do anything because if you have
this chain for example this row
referencing this row this row
referencing this row you have to find
the most childish of all the children
because if you think about it this child
has a parent which is this child which
has a parent which has parent this
pattern so it's like a literal family
tree you would have to start with this
child delete that row then you could
delete this row then you can delete this
row and then finally you can delete the
parent so if you want to delete the
parent you're going to have to go
through all of that work cascade on the
other hand comes in handy because if you
delete the parent it's automatically
going to pass on those changes and just
delete anything that references it but
as you can see that could be very
dangerous because you have all these
connections and you don't have all the
connections memorized in your head so
you just you just think you're gonna do
something minor it's not going to ruin
much you're just going to delete this
one row no one will even notice then all
of a sudden you delete like 40 rows
because everything's interconnected so
cascade will delete all of the children
referencing that parent set null that
one is going to set the reference and
the child to null so if this parent has
an ID of seven and in the foreign key
column we have that reference and then
we delete this parent this seven is
going to be replaced with no that one's
fairly simple but you're going to have
to keep in mind that this column that's
storing this value has to be able to be
set to null
therefore it cannot be labeled not off
if it was labeled not null you wouldn't
be able to do that because then you try
to put a null inside of a not null
column and this is going to make your
database explode finally we have set
default and what that is going to do is
set the column to whatever the default
value is for that column when you define
the column you can use the default
attribute and give it a value and then
when you delete
parents that value of like originally
with seven will be replaced with
whatever the default is so the payment
is a value of seven the child references
that parent and let's say the default is
one we delete the parent row the child
reference is replaced with one now when
would this be beneficial well a lot of
people actually don't like set default
but some people really like it a good
use of this might be let's say in a
situation where we have a website and
people can post comments so we could
make a user in the user table with the
ID of one and make the username deleted
user for example and let's say we also
have a user Caleb and his ID is seven
and deleted user ID is one now the
parent exists his name's Caleb the child
is as common and this comment was posted
by the person with the ID of seven which
points back to Caleb but then once we
delete the parent the 7 is defaulted to
1 which points to deleted user that's
kind of a way you could use the set
default I'm sure there's a much more
professional and technical explanation
of how you could use set default but
that's all my little brain could come up
with so if you guys got some more better
examples post them in the comments below
and I'll consider them for future videos
and I'm sure they'll be helpful to other
people now there is also an on update
clause this is going to work the same
way because we also have these options
the only difference it's no longer on
delete but what happens when the parents
ID in this situation 7 is changed now if
you use my guidelines on primary Keys
they should never change so the only
time you're going to need the on update
is if you're referencing a unique column
that is not a key for example you might
have a user's table with an ID and a
user name and this user name is unique
now let's say we have a user name of
crazy cat lady and this lady has an ID
of 8 that is not innate and then let's
say we reference this column which we
can deal with the foreign key because
it's labeled unique
now instead of having an ID we'll just
have the username madly on update is
going to make a lot more sense so what
would happen if someone tried to update
their username well let's go through the
options the first one if we had our
foreign key set up as no action the
database is just going to throw an error
and say no bro you cannot do this is
that appropriate well in some situations
yes but some websites let you change
your username for example YouTube so if
we wanted people to be able to change
the username we would not want to use no
action cascade would send the changes
down the line so if we changed this to
crazy cat lady 11 it would go down over
here to the reference and change it as
well that would be more like what
YouTube is doing so that means any
comment that references this username
would change set null would change this
username to null and finally set default
would change it to whatever the default
username is so whatever this tables in
we would have a column let's say
username and this could be in whatever
table it doesn't matter and you would
give it a default so hopefully that kind
of gives you a good summary of on delete
and on update it kind of gets complex
but if you just break it down piece by
piece you'll eventually get it so thanks
