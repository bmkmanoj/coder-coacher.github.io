programming tutorial series now before
we go into more C programming I wanted
to take a break to learn some of the
basic UNIX and Linux commands so when
you are working with a UNIX or Linux
operating system there are a ton of
built-in commands that you're going to
need to know the reason I think this is
so important is because one of the
reasons C became so popular is because
it was the standard programming language
when UNIX and Linux gained popularity so
there is like this special connection
between C and the Unix Linux
environments now if you're on Mac or
something like Ubuntu all of these
commands are going to be exactly the
same
now the actual difference between UNIX
and Linux that's not so important for
right now all you really need to know is
that Linux is a unix-like operating
system so these are actually very
similar because these are so similar
oftentimes people will just use the
terms interchangeably that's because if
you want to teach these commands that
apply to both of these you don't always
want to say UNIX slash Linux so if I
just say Linux just assume I'm also
talking about UNIX which includes Mac
operating systems like OSX so let's get
started one of the biggest things Linux
is known for is determined when it comes
to Windows no one really uses the
command prompt unless they're super
techie and they need to do something on
there but when we're talking about Linux
even the average user knows some command
in the terminal and because Linux is so
popular I guarantee you you are going to
need to know some of these commands the
first type of commands you should learn
how to do are the commands that do the
basic things like working with the
operating system moving files copying
files all of the stuff you can normally
do with a mouse but you want to do it
all in text and a sounds fun
but it actually is kind of cool just
like you can do a lot of things visually
with the mouse you can do a lot of the
same things with commands for example
you can navigate folders you can rename
things all of that good stuff so the
first command I'm going to teach you is
called PWD what this command does is it
prints
current directory or the working
directory which is why it's PWD and you
can see I'm an users flash Caleb curry
/youtube this is basically the location
that I'm in in the terminal to see all
of the files and folders in this folder
you can type LS and you can see nothing
showed up that's because there actually
isn't anything in this folder now I
should probably start using a more
technical term directory that is what
folders used to be called before the
term folder came into existence so
folder and directory that's the same
exact thing now let's say I want to move
to this Caleb curry folder I can do this
by typing CD dot dot now when I type in
LS you can see there's all kinds of
stuff we can actually ask for more
specific information by doing things
such as LS space - L this gives much
more information you can see this gives
the file permissions the dates all kinds
of good stuff so I can just press up and
LS dash L shows up this - L right here
this is known as a flag we can pass
flags to these commands to alter the
output another common command is LS - a
the first command LS dash L what it does
is it lists the long version of what we
are trying to accomplish the LS - a
lists all the files including ones with
the little periods which are hidden
files if you want to send more than one
flag you can combine them in one like
this LS - la this is saying list the
long version and list all the files if
we want to navigate into one of these
folders all we got to do is figure out
the name for example let's say I want to
go into this YouTube folder all we have
to do is say CD for change directory and
then type in the name of that folder and
now when we say PWD print working
directory you can see we're in that
YouTube folder again one more thing
about the LS command is that there's two
special ones in this list if we scroll
up there is a
and a dot dot the single dot is a
reference to the directory that is being
listed right here so the Caleb curry
folder the dot dot is the parent
directory which in this case if we
scroll down and go back to our PWD
command you can see that that would be
the user's folder when we are typing in
the CD command there's two types of
paths we can give there's one called an
absolute path and there's another called
a relative path so I'm going to show you
how to do both of those the absolute
path is from the very beginning so you
say CD slash which means from the very
beginning so we are starting right here
then we can put any folder we want users
slash Caleb curry enter and you can see
that works just fine we say PWD and
we're in that folder the other one is a
relative path which we actually showed
earlier that's changing the directory
relative to where you are so if you do
CD dot dot the parent is relative to
what folder you're in what I mean by
that is if you look up here the parent
of the YouTube folder is Caleb curry but
the parent of Caleb curry is users so
what folder you go to depends on the
folder you're currently in that is how a
relative path works and now you can see
that we are in just users so that is
kind of like your head first dive into
the Linux commands who play it in
overwhelming with too much information I
would recommend just writing down each
of the commands or you can download the
notes that I have on my website I will
have a link at the end of the video and
that'll have them all there for you so
thanks guys for watching in the next
video I hope to teach you some more
Linux commands so be sure to check that
out peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
