11:20 p.m. and let me tell you I am
ready to start teaching CSS so if you
have no clue like zero clue what CSS is
well it stands for cascading style sheet
and what that means I have no idea
well I kind of do but a style sheet
takes text through HTML which we already
learned in the past 19 videos and
formats it in a beautiful good-looking
way well it doesn't have to be beautiful
but you can so let's just start from
scratch I'm going to keep all this
because I might want to come back to it
so I'm not going to delete it so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna save it as
index 2 right and I'm gonna delete
everything and don't it just gonna
delete everything and save it as index
normal yes one of the rates so now I
have index 2 which is just a backup of
what we had we're starting fresh so
let's get our HTML skills rockin HTML so
we always start our HTML files like this
oopsies I am really bad at acting today
well every day but especially today doll
doll body then within the head we can
add a title such as subscribe to so now
for your fresh the page let's go to
sorry I was messing around index dot
HTML we now have a title of subscribe to
see TV m2k with the video maker - all
right what's in the body
that is where we can put our content so
yeah that's going we can just shrink the
head we're not going to look at that
anymore well at least not for this video
we will really soon and body is where we
put content so I can create a new div
and then we can be do and then within
here I can say an h1 man saves 84 cats
semi-truck wow that is so impressive all
right and then I can make another div I
can say Jim Larry Bill Joe Billy Joe
Swanson yeah yeah that's cool name
Jim Larry Billy Joe Swanson say 84 cats
from a semi truck and bursted a sign
word I don't know bursted that stroke
that bursted in mine are places with P
tags cuz it's more appropriate because
we just wrote a paragraph about the
content P so we can we have a div here
so we can basically duplicate this
content we're going to do it again so
now we have a second div and now we're
going to write an article about
el fondo kills 40 hamsters and now
that's that's way too brutal I can't
even handle that kills 39 hamsters el
fondo the mystery killer killed 39
hamsters
yes started a show that is one vicious
paragraph so with this plate space isn't
going to matter it's just going to cram
it all together so this is what we have
might as well get rid of this white
space it's useless
all right so awesome this what we get
now what is CSS exactly well we can put
it in there to make our website look
awesome all right let's go div and to
start using CSS we have ace equals and
then styles is basically what we do so
let's see we can give equals I'm sorry
div style let's see if I can remember
this style and then in quotation marks
we can add our CSS you don't really know
much CSS yet so that's what we're going
to be getting up into in the following
videos but just for example I can say
padding equals 20 pixels and then BAM we
got this nice padding and we can also do
it for this one style equals having 20
pixels
so now we have a better designed article
and then what we can do is if skis
actually believe that div there all
right and put this all within another
div yeah go and I could say style equals
background
is equal to yellow that's just an
example so that doesn't look that
attractive which is just show the
effects of CSS that is called inline CSS
I'm gonna write that out in line the
reason for this is we're typing it as
we're writing the HTML so we don't have
to use inline we also have the options
external and we also have the options
internal which I'm going to be getting
over going over those in the next video
so I shall see you then sorry for
wasting your time writing them articles
but I thought it was kind of fun
so yeah I'm getting kind of tired but up
since like 6:45 that's like ridiculous
not that bad but I mean I'm a teenager
and I stay up all night so it's pretty
bad alright so I'll see you in the next
video III got some energy to continue
going because I just ate an entire plate
of leftover leftover mac and cheese and
that was pretty scrumptious so peace out
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
