maker to this video we are going to be
talking about the Auto increment
attribute now I mentioned the word
attribute and these are the things we
put after the column when we create our
table so we might have something like
user ID and then we could say primary
key and then add Auto increment these
are both examples of attributes and this
would all be inside of a create table
which will discuss create table in
detail in an upcoming video so let's not
get distracted just know that Auto
increment is an example of an attribute
now what is Auto increment though it's
automatically going to increment a value
what does this mean practically though
it means that when we do an insert
statement we're not going to have to
figure out what ID number to put in it
will automatically do that for us so
once we get into the insert statement
it'll make more sense but essentially
what we're going to do is say insert
into and then say some table let's say
users and then inside of here you can
put what columns you want to put and you
can leave out the ID so you don't have
to put the ID but you can put everything
else and then you put all those columns
there and then you say values and you
can leave out the user ID you don't even
have to worry about it because it's not
even expecting the user ID up here it'll
automatically take the highest value
that's in the table for the user ID and
add one to it for the new value so that
way we don't have to worry about adding
one to our value all the time that's
super useful because that basically just
allows us to ignore the IDS it's only
for the database we don't even have to
think about it that's one thing I was
going to talk about in this video the
other thing we are going to talk about
is compound or composite keys a
composite key is a key that consists of
multiple columns and the reason you
would do this is if you need to figure
out a way to make the table unique and
one ID or one column is not enough to do
it you will often see this inside of an
intermediary table so if you don't
remember what an intermediary table is
it's the table in the middle of a
many-to-many relationship so we break up
a many-to-many relationship
into two one-to-many relationships and
in this situation this table is going to
have two IDs an ID for this table and an
ID for that table and one ID for example
if we have an idea over here at seven it
can repeat as many times as it once but
the thing is the combination of that ID
with an ID of this ID needs to be unique
so it's a little confusing but let's say
we have 7 6 7 8 &amp;amp; 7 9 so this is a
little small so let's blow this up a
little bit we could as well have a row
such as 6 9 so in this situation the 6
is repeating and the 7s are repeating so
we couldn't just use 1 as the primary
key that's because it's not enough
information to force every row to be
unique so what that means is we need to
actually make the combination like this
the primary key in that situation that
is an example of a composite key now if
both of the columns are keys themselves
in this situation foreign keys that
point to these tables it's known as a
compound key but the distinction is
small so I wouldn't get uptight about it
if someone says composite or compound
just think of them as the same thing a
key with multiple columns and remember
that the time you need to do that is
when one column is not enough to make
each row unique this table in the middle
here is basically an association table
you only want a specific Association to
be in there one time but not a specific
ID over here or a specific idea over
here because then think about it that
means this one here could not be
associated with any other id's except 6
that'd be stupid we want to be able to
repeat the 7 as many times as we want
but we don't want the combination of 7 6
to be repeated in that situation you
would want to use a composite key and
you can do that when you create the
table at the bottom you can say primary
key and then you can say what columns
you want it to be and you can throw in
two or more columns
this is often a lot more common with
natural Keys which is just a column that
has actual
meaning that's because often takes a
couple columns to make the rows unique
so that's just a rough overview if you
didn't grasp everything in here that's
okay because once we start creating this
information and putting this into an
actual database it's going to make a lot
more sense this is more concept stuff so
when we get there you're not completely
lost but don't worry about the details
of oh how do I create this what's the
syntax and all that stuff
worry about that when we get to the
create table statement thanks guys
