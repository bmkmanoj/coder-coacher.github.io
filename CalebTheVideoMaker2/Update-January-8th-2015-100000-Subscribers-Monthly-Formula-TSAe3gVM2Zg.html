update video and I know what you guys
are probably not thinking whoa Caleb you
ever released any content this week and
you're already making another update
video what's up with that well I've
actually been pretty busy this week so I
just wanted to share a little bit what's
going on and what I have coming up this
next week so the first thing is that i
took a couple minutes and i designed a
simple logo and i'm actually going to
try to put that on a shirt we're just
gonna be sweet not sure if I'm gonna
like sell those or just wear them to
pretend i'm cool &amp;amp; official you know so
people like hey what's that and I'm like
hey that's me if you watched my previous
update video you might know that I'm
trying to start a newsletter which will
go out you know I don't know maybe every
week every other week once a month ah
but anyways I sent that out this morning
so if you aren't subscribed you really
missed out i had some cool stuff in
there i actually showed pictures of my
analytics and my views and all that cool
junk as for total subscriber count I
think I'm up to 8742 which is pretty
awesome as for this week I've gained an
estimate 163 and the way I get that
number is I use my seven-day totals on
my YouTube analytics that is an
improvement compared to what the other
few weeks before this week were but it
is still not my high point so I do want
to get that up and I'll show you a
picture you can see that it goes uphill
a little bit which is awesome I want to
keep it up on that uphill ride like a
roller coaster but I don't want it to go
down and just want to go up forever so
i'll be releasing more actual video
tutorial content this week that way i
can get some more subscribers share my
stuff with you guys and whatever else
speaking of subscribers i just want to
do a little math to kind of figure out
how many subscribers i'd have to get
each month to get to a hundred thousand
by the end of the year and it's actually
pretty crazy I didn't want to do it an
absolute number like oh I have almost
10,000 which means i need almost 90,000
90,000 divided
by 12 because think about that if I
could get like seven thousand five
hundred subscribers in the first month
of this year then by the end of the year
I should be able to get like a million
so I think that's inaccurate so what I
did was I took my total subscribers
count and I figured out how much I'd
have to multiply it by each month to get
a hundred thousand so for example ten
percent increase would be 1.1 so I took
that eight thousand seven hundred times
1 point 1 times 1 point 1 times 1 point
1 12 times to figure out what I'd have
next January first day of January and I
did that to figure out what percentage
would have to multiply by every single
month to get 200,000 basically for this
to work you just take your current
subscribers I have around 8700 on the
first day of January the beginning of
January and then it calculates the ten
percent increase the twenty percent
increase and the twenty two percent
increase you can use other numbers if
you feel like creating it but I ended up
using the twenty three percent increase
and as you can see down here that will
leave me with a hundred and 4323
subscribers at the beginning of January
which would be 2016 so the way this
really works is it just takes this
number your subscriber count multiplies
that by one point 23 you can see one
point 23 and then it basically just
keeps doing that so now it takes 10,000
701 and multiplies that by one point 23
and it just continues to do that all the
way down the line until you get a final
number at the beginning of January so
for in January I have to gain 2001 now
if I want to break that up across each
week I could which would lead me around
500 a week so as you can see I'm quite
far behind schedule but we'll see if we
catch up i don't know it's worth the try
right each month the amount of
subscribers i have to get goes up and
then when i reached december i need to
get almost 20,000 subscribers
and that will give me a total gain of 90
5623 we get 9 5 6 23 plus 8700 to give
10 4 3 2 3 which is the final number of
subscribers that'll have so other than
that I don't really have much else to
say I'm going to be uploading database
design videos this week which hopefully
I can finish that series this month or
shortly in February I'm not sure how
long it's going to be but if you guys
have any suggestions for that series
like something you'd like to see please
leave me a message or comment and i'll
be sure to you know check it out see if
it's possibility or if it's something
I'd want to do and also see if it's
something odd that would take away from
the series and they might need to put in
a different video or different series
I'm considering a whole lot of things
for the upcoming videos so now would be
the best time to give me suggestions if
you have anything and as always please
subscribe if you haven't subscribed
already just asking to subscribe in the
last video has helped I've gained some
subscribers although I apparently made
some people mad because I I lost six
subscribers from last video but I gained
10 as of the last time I checked so I
mean net gain of 4 that's pretty awesome
so I do want to get my subscriber count
to continue going up so if you want to
help me out please subscribe and as
always subscribe to my newsletter if you
would like you can support me on patreon
and you know give me some yo cash right
or not I mean thank you guys and I will
catch you in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
