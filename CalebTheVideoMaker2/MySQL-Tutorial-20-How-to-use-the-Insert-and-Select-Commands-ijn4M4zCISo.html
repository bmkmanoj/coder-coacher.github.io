going to be showing you something pretty
sweet
but first I want to continue on
something I mentioned in the last video
and that was how to insert things into a
database insert rows into columns
so we have the Jim database and we have
the members table then I go to SQL and
still eat this if you remember and went
a little something like this insert into
members so our inserting information
into the members table just like that
then you can put columns
I mean parentheses now you can write the
columns that we're going to write in so
birthday own membership status
first-name stop screw up my typing
someone is something we have to work on
and then you put values so we're going
to tell it what to insert and let's just
say very first thing was a birthday
so put 1936 and remember this has to be
in quotes forgot there for a second
1936 1118 sounds fine
sweet and comma and then next thing was
the phone so one two three three two one
seven six four nine sweet that's a good
phone number comma then we had the
membership status let's say a silver
and then last we had first name and last
name so first name let's make it in
quotes I get this right yow-yow
sweet so here's what we did I know that
took me like forever to type out but
it's okay I have all the time in the
world so I wanted to tell you how to
insert multiple things into the database
so what you could do is copy this paste
it put a semicolon and change some of
this information so insert the values
instead of a 7-foot afford you know what
I'm saying but there's actually a better
way and what you can do is just put a
comma and then put parentheses and then
just put another set of values so what
I'm going to do is actually put all the
parentheses and so then I don't have to
worry about extra work I think the how
many are there we have birthday one two
three four five and then you don't need
to come after the fifth one so he was
born or she was born in 1974 the phone
number nine eight seven seven eight nine
one three two for membership status gold
and then first name
and when this Isaza brother of y'all me
john me sweet and then what you can do
this combines it all into one and you do
not need a comma but let's say you want
to insert another set of values you can
just put a comma and i put another set
of parentheses and so on keep doing that
so from here I'm going to click go and
two rows inserted so if you go to
members over on the left you can see
every single row in the last two yeah me
and John me so that is how you insert
multiple instance eart multiple rows
into a table alright fro so um uh accent
listen um let me just restart ah now
what you want to do is I'm going to
teach you how to select information from
a table so if you go to your table over
on the left and click SQL you see right
here it says this so basically what this
is saying is it just selects everything
from the table so if you click go it's
going to display all the information so
let me let me show the teacher this some
more so we have a select statement that
is how you select information then they
had a little star asterisk which means
everything
so select everything from and then
members for the table members so this I
click go it brings up everything sweet
so this can this you can change us a bit
so don't worry about what they have they
just just type out the select statement
select and then from members now between
select and from you can put what you
want to select so let's say you want to
select all of the phone numbers you can
say select phone from members and then
it lists all the phone numbers that are
in your database so we can actually
change some of this and select more
options so select we can say first name
sorry for at the underscore name comma
last name from members and click go
and I'll show the first name last name
so we have Caleb curry London John I put
that in backwards
Jim John Yao Ming and John me so that's
how you can alter what you want to
select so if you need to get all the
birthdays you can say just alter this
select
birthday from members and it should
display everybody's birthday and we're
also going to display their blast name
so display birthday last name and click
go so basically you're just selecting
the information from the table we're
selecting the birthday or selecting the
last name from the table members yet thy
the from in there so it knows what table
to have selected from because we could
create another table and have two tables
in this database so if we just put this
it's not going to know which table to
get it from so all you have to do is
select and then put the columns and then
say what table you're getting it from so
it's basically just like English and
then you click go and display the
information so person with last name
curry was born in 1999 April 13th so
that is how you do select statements and
I'll be getting into some more advanced
versions very shortly so stick with me
and I'll see you in the next video thank
you and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
