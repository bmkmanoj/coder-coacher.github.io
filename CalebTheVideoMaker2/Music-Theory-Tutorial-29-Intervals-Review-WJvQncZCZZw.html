know all of the intervals we're going to
make a chart out of it to visually see
it and also to easily memorize it and
learn it and figure things out so I
think I started with green last time so
this will be for perfect in major
intervals which are the basis we usually
start from now we have we're going to
make it this way rather than this way
like we did last time so we had a
perfect unison
you know mr. Universal perfect unison
major second major third perfect fourth
and you remember this perfect major
major perfect perfect major major
perfect perfect fifth major sixth major
seventh perfect octave kind of went
uphill but who cares
not me hit so how many half steps are in
these well what we can do is we can
follow the C scale just white keys so
like C to B I mean C to D see the e C
they have to see the G you see it
Hey and so on but I I already have these
memorized because I'm such a genius and
I'm quite humble too so humble that I'm
proud of it oh oh geez that was a good
one cuz like get it humble being humble
so opposite of being proud and like
you're so proud you're so humble that
you're proud of it which makes you not
humble but perfect unison
C to C for example would be zero half
steps or D to D or anything major second
would be two half steps C to D major
third would be C to e which has four
half steps and then perfect fourths
I think that's five half steps seven
nine eleven and twelve cool eh
yeah it is pretty cool so
I want you to memorize that these are
perfect major major perfect just by the
color and I'm gonna erase this up here
and also remember the scale degree or
the interval size I'm sorry now we can
add on to this
so here's unison second third fourth
fifth sixth seventh octave what was the
next one we did if it was minor I think
I used red so this one's perfect we
can't do anything this one's major so if
we take it subtract Poland forget one
same for this one which is also minor
I'm a major and now it's minor because
we effected it this is a perfect fourth
this is a perfect fifth this is a major
sixth which will have eight half steps
this will have Ted say what we did we
just took both or all of the major
intervals which remember this is perfect
major major perfect perfect major major
perfect to four for both major nine
eleven are both major this is a major
second this is a major third this is a
major sixth this is a major seventh
we're only putting the half steps in
here not the size the ones with the red
were originally major and we just took
down a half step so that so these ones
too but the perfect we can't affect this
because remember they can't become minor
they're perfect
you can't make a minor they're too
perfect for that so but you can't make
em augmented that's a different story we
had perfect capital P major capital M
minor lowercase M diminished lowercase D
now we can take any of the minors or any
of the Perfect's subtract my house
subtract a half step from this will
become negative one which yes that's
impossible
this will become 0 this will become two
and some become four so become six this
will become 7 this will become nine this
will become 11 so basically we just took
these and lower
wash them even the red ones so now we
have the diminished intervals and what
was next we had augmented which I think
I represented it in yellow sweet so now
we just take any perfect or major not
minor / perfect or major and increase
them 1 so this becomes 1 this becomes 3
let's becomes 5 times 6 8 10 12 and 13
here is our chart pretty cool and if you
want to you can put what you cannot you
remember how you race that line you can
put the back in if it helps you keep
everything in line so then we just take
a black marker which probably okay it's
working for now and then we say this is
a unison this is a second this is a
third this is a fourth fifth sixth
seventh and an eighth octave sorry and
then there's your chart you want a
diminished fifth boom six half steps
just in case you can't see here is the
chart close up that which is a that's a
1 and a 3 just in case you can't see
from the light as you probably already
noticed some of these have the same
amount of half steps in them so these
are called what because they're the same
pitch but different notes and harmonic
so the in harmonic intervals would be
these two there's a bunch of them five 5
six 6 seven 7 eight 8 nine 9 ten 10 11
11 and 12 and then there's 13 so these
are all of the in harmonic intervals
what I mean by that is they have this is
a sixth with seven half steps this is a
fifth with seven halves
there are different interval sizes but
they are the same amount of half-steps
this one's diminished this one is
perfect because this is a perfect fifth
and this is a diminished cyst the way
things sound is dependent upon
everything else so a perfect fifth may
sound okay may not depending on
everything else around it it's and
there's not really rules if you want
something to sound absolutely horrible
and it sounds good to you go for it I
mean I mean I think music is a way to
show your emotions so if your emotions
are then go for it
send me the piece augmented intervals
sound more unpleasant when they're with
perfect intervals but you may think they
sound Pleasant it's just a it's
different for everybody so let me show
you an example C to C it sounds okay
but if I make it augmented it's kind of
dome kind of spooky that's because it's
an augmented perfect interval and they
sound creepy so that's all I wanted to
say kind of rambling on here and I hope
I gave you a good basis of intervals I
know I talked a ton about them but now I
hope you'll understand them because they
are the foundation for most of music
theory and if you're still kind of
questionable about some of them that's
okay because as we talk about them in
future videos already explain them and
make sure you understand what's going on
so yeah that's all I have to say so be
sure to subscribe follow me on twitter
at caleb curry subscribe follow me on
twitter click like this is my name this
is music theory this is my shirt and my
lucky shirt this is my necklace my
undershirt here's my hair
there's a butterfly yeah I don't know
what I'm talking about but anyways see
you later
Thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
