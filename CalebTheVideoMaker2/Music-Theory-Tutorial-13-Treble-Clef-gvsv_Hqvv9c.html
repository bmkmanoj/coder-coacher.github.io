music theory tutorial and this video I
will be talking about what's called the
treble cliff woo feds name alright this
is called the treble clef now cliff
itself is a term you should know treble
is the type of cliff so we have
different types of cliffs but this one
is the treble clef we draw a treble clef
like this shoot us turtle I'm not a very
good drawer but like that and
occasionally you'll see a little circle
down here at the bottom actually usually
this will be across the five lines now
right here where a circles around that
represents the G so that is the G
remember I assigned this line the G well
that's what a clef does it tells you
what note is on what line - that way we
can figure out the rest of them so now
we know that this is a jean usually this
will be off to the side so it doesn't
cross over it but this is a G which
makes this is C this is D and E this an
F it assigns what notes go to what line
so if we took this in your assessment
all of it and we moved it so this now
points to the third line rather than the
second line from the bottom this isn't a
treble clef anymore it's something else
and won't get into that it puts it the G
on the second line from the bottom of
the five lines it puts it right here G
this allows us to figure out everything
else because each line in space is the
next letter so the line after G would
make this a this B this C this D this D
this F and this G makes sense hopefully
it does so to draw a treble clef we make
a line and then a loop then we scoot off
to the side come back then we scoot off
to the side come back then we loop
around boom awesome
close and off now when we're writing
music you'll often see the five lines
and then we'll see off to the side a
treble clef
Wow these get worse and worse every time
in Rome this tells us that for the
entire song this right here is AG this
here and this here and this here and
this here we can figure out from the G
and I think that's about all I had to
say even though this video is quite
short I'm not gonna ramble on about the
same thing for 20 minutes like I usually
do so thank you for watching and
subscribe see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
