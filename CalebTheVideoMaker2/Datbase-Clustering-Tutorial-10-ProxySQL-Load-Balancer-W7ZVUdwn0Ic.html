clustering tutorial series from Caleb
the video Makoto okay this video we're
going to be talking about load balancing
now we discussed load balancing in the
very first video I believe it was and
essentially what that is is you can kind
of group your entire cluster into this
thing called a load balancer and then
all you have to do is talk to the load
balancer and it will decide where to
send traffic so it's actually super easy
to set up a load balancer with cluster
control and basically the entire process
is automated there's different types of
load balancers but for some of them if
you were to write a software application
you could just talk to the load balancer
if you weren't using a load balancer you
would have to manually in your code
decide which nodes to read and write
from and that can make writing
applications a whole lot more complex
now if you go over here and click this
little tab thing you can scroll down and
find somewhere in here oh the first one
load balancer and you can see there's
like five options to make us have
something more to think about but the
choice that we are going to go with is
proxy sequel and feel free to look up
all these and learn about them but
that's not what I'm going to talk about
in this video we're just talking about
setting up a load bouncer I wish I had
the time to go into all of that but I
just don't right now so we'll worry
about that in another video so let's
scroll down and here's all the
information we're going to have to fill
out so the very first thing is what
computer do you want this to be on now I
would highly highly highly highly highly
recommend you put it on the controller
alright so in here we're just going to
add a password you know whatever and now
this database user stuff I'm just going
to skip that for now because I'm going
to teach you how to configure that after
you have the load balancer setup so just
leave that as is
yes we want to include both of these and
then lastly there's this implicit
transactions thing and if you want to
know more you can hover over this I and
you can also look up stuff on implicit
transactions specifically you could look
up like several nines implicit
transactions and it'll give you some
more information I'm not going to get
into that a whole lot so I'm just going
to leave it as no
and then I'm going to click deploy oh
yeah I want to click no no ok so we got
a new job going and we can open that
Activity Monitor great so you can see
that it finished at first it failed and
I was like oh no but then I realize it's
my internet one out you know typical so
I got it working and if we go back to
our home page you can open this overview
and then click nodes and then down here
there's this new proxy sequel right here
and it says which node is part of proxy
sequel so you can click that and get all
kinds of cool information and graphs and
please wait loading signs one thing I
wanted to mention real quick was this
host group thing so there's two groups
and the way this works is that host
group 10 our readers and writers
so the databases that are in host group
10 you can write to and you can read
from them
whereas host group 20 are just readers
that information is going to be
important when we create a new user so
to create a user what we have to do is
click this users tab and now click this
add new user now we can scroll down now
the way authentication works with proxy
sequel is a little interesting so pay
attention here for a minute
you're going to have to have a user for
proxy sequel and a user for the database
so if you click this add existing user
essentially what that does is I believe
it will take a user from the database
and also put it for proxy sequel
essentially when you authenticate with
proxy sequel proxies equals gonna be
like oh yeah yeah this guy is allowed to
do stuff and then they're going to go
into the database use the same user and
password to do stuff with the database
so the same user needs to be with proxy
sequel and with the database cluster so
we can make this user name something
really good like oh I don't know
Caleb Kerr a good password and we will
make it 10 that's fine
database name yeah it's fine
now these grants what you want to do is
you want to decide what this user is
allowed to do so
grants you could type in all privileges
and then click add user and there you go
that is your brief introduction to load
balancers now obviously I barely scratch
the surface if anything I just confused
you more let's hope not but obviously I
can make an entire series on load
balancers it's not a small topic so the
important thing is to understand the
basics and then if you find hey this is
something I could really use you have
enough information to start researching
to figure out which kind of load
balancers best for you and how to set
them up properly and all that good stuff
so that's all I got for this video the
next video is going to be really really
really cool so please check it out
please be sure to subscribe share it
with your friends and as always thanks
for watching peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
