going to be an introduction to queries
and I apologize ahead of time if my
audio is not the best I'm in the process
of kind of setting up a studio so I
don't have all my equipment set up right
now and this is the best I can do for
now so hopefully it's okay for you guys
I think we'll be able to get through it
so let's dive right in I'm an Oracle SQL
developer which is the app we use to
connect and communicate to our Oracle
database and I have my subscribed
database open now if your window layout
looks any different than mine you can
always go up to here to window and then
reset window to factory settings so what
is a query exactly well a query is how
we get data from a database and
literally people can have an entire
career just from writing queries so this
topic is stinking huge but we're going
to start with the very basics in fact
we're not even going to get data from a
table we're just going to start with
what's known as expressions expressions
are these things that can be evaluated
to something so think back to like math
class you might have something like five
plus five oh my goodness let's try this
again so you might have something like
five plus five and that can be evaluated
to ten so this right here this is an
example of an expression but we can also
have expressions with other things such
as strings
so that is a string in fact we're going
to put hello world and essentially we're
going to try to create a hello world
program which is basically the first
program you usually try to write when
you start a programming language just so
you can get it set up type something
small and get it running so that's what
we're going to do it's going to be a
little bit different than other
programming languages because this is a
database but the end result is going to
be pretty similar so how do we go about
telling the database that we want it to
tell us hello world right now we're
telling it hello world but we want it to
respond well the way we get data from a
database is using what's known as the
Select keyword and that's going to go at
the beginning of your query so now we're
saying select this string and it should
give us the data back
but not quite there's a little thing we
have to do and I'll explain that in a
minute
but in most database management systems
this right here would work but let's run
it and see what happens
you can run it by pressing this button
here or pressing f5 and you can see we
get an error and it's basically saying
that it requires the from keyword so
where do we put the from keyword it's
actually right after the expression so
we put it right here and what do we take
this data from well Oracle has this
magical table it's called dual and this
is going to allow us to basically do
this but in Oracle so when we do this
it's going to respond with hello world
so let's run it and see how it works and
you can see the output right here hello
world so works
you guys just created your first hello
world application it's very very simple
now I ain't trying to make Oracle sound
much simpler than it is Oracle is like a
beast it can do anything in fact it can
even do addition so instead of putting a
string here we can pass in some addition
let's run this there we go
5 plus 5 equals 10 you can also throw
things in here known as functions so a
good one we can try is assists timestamp
let's try that and you can see it gives
us the exact time of our machine so
that's pretty sweet when you're working
with select statements and tables
usually you're going to want to have
multiple columns so in this situation
all we're doing is selecting one thing
but I want to select multiple things so
the way you do that is you just add a
comma and then you say the next thing
you want to grab so we could throw in a
string here say hello world and then we
could throw in another comma and we'll
actually do another math problem let's
go 5 times 5 now the last one does not
require a comma so you can keep it that
way let's try this and see if it works
so we basically have a generated table
here are the column headers
and here are the values although we only
scratched the bare surface of the select
statement I think that's a good place to
end for now and in the next video we'll
begin to setting this and learning a
little bit more about how we structure
our SQL so thanks guys please be sure to
subscribe I really appreciate that and

and I will see you in the next video
peace you thought I wasn't going to say
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
