music theory stuff it's been like a long
time we've learned a lot of stuff and
now we're going into a whole new area of
information this is actually kind of
almost to the point where it's not music
theory although I figure if you learn
this stuff then it's going to help like
piece everything together it is awesome
conglomeration conglomeration of
awesomeness and you'll be like music
note semi case since probably not but
anyways I wrote all this stuff on the
wall because I'm probably just going to
talk about it rather than draw a bunch
of stuff plus I didn't feel like trying
to remember all that in one video and I
didn't want to pause it like 6 million
times and make it cut every three
seconds cuz it's just a lot easier to
get it all out at once so I've been
talking for a minute already let's get
started
psycho acoustics well I put these in
this in parentheses because there's
actually acoustics and then there's
psycho acoustics so you don't have to
have the cycle in there acoustics is the
study of sound and psycho acoustics is
the study of sound by psycho people
sitting on skin it's a study of how we
interpret these sounds so we have a this
is a sine wave it represents sound it
may and this may have actually be but we
may interpret it like that which is a
little bit different so that's a study
of cyclic ooh sticks you may give in to
that sometime I'm not really gonna talk
all I mean all this is part of cyclic
ooh sticks and all the other stuff for
learning fits in but this isn't over
psycho acoustics this is ever music
theory so that's something else if
you're really into the sound studio
design and technology and stuff that may
be where you want to study rather than
music theory after this series of course
cuz you're gonna watch it all I'm gonna
watch it all right right that's why I
thought so next time decibel that is a
way to measure a loudness for example we
have the Bell which is a relative
measurement of loudness by relative I
mean it's not absolute so for example
feet for example I can say that's bad
all right yeah let's say I can't be like
okay this sound is 64 decibels because
it's it's a relative measurement rather
I would say something such as oh I think
I think I spoke Bell wrong too but hello
it's it's 1l I could say something I
increased the sound by three deaths of
those that makes more sense it's a
relative measurement so this is
especially used for technology as in if
you're working with an audio system and
you want to turn the volume up you would
turn up the volume say three decibels by
the way the abbreviation is lowercase D
capital B for some reason all right
frequency well we've already talked
about that a whole lot it's how fast
something vibrates so it looks like when
we represent it on a whiteboard but it's
really just it's not in one direction
like that it's everywhere so bouncing
off walls it's like imagine if we could
see sound you'd be like some trippy
movie or something we're just like whoa
whoa and you'd be like anyways yeah
that's pretty much what sound is like
frequency is how fast it vibrates
because it's more of like a bump into
each other so this one bumps into this
sound particle there's some bumps into
that one bumps in an island bumps a
mountain bumps into that one and then
they go back to their original spot so
it's like whoa yeah so it's a vibration
I think you understand that so sounds
vibrating velocity that's how fast some
sound travels so it's recognized 1 1 300
feet per second or a thousand 130 feet
per second although you may get some
different answers and also depends on
elevation and all kinds of stuff because
it just does because all right so that's
the velocity of sound all true all sound
is said to travel like the same speed
you know but vibrations be changes so it
all kind of like goes together but it
vibrates at different speeds so
threshold of pain is
and completely different than all this
junk so you know the falsely for now
threshold of pain goes back to the
decimal if we increase the sound so high
as to say a 120 decibels up then that is
reaching the threshold of pain and it's
so loud that it can actually give you
permanent hearing loss and ringing in
the air ears so that's the threshold of
pain the opposite of the threshold pain
is the absolute threshold of hearing
that's the lowest sound we could
possibly hear the quietest all right so
that that all has to do with volume
these two are volume and they all go
back to the decibel I probably Group
this together but I did it because I'm a
rebel just kidding subsonic ultrasonic
goes back to the concept of frequency
subsonic frequencies are so slow that we
can't hear them we have a pitch
interpretation range I want to get a new
marker no I don't we have a range of 20
Hertz to 20,000 Hertz represented with a
K 4 kilohertz 20 kilohertz so this is
our frequency range so Pierce something
so high-pitched ah it just hurts your
ears it may be something like 16 or 15
and in reality we probably don't hear
quite 220 probably like it depends on
the person but a couple files like a
thousand less or so but that is what is
said to be how much we can hear in
frequency range so subsonic sounds would
be such it would be something such as
0.8 that means it vibrates 0.8 times in
a second
that is a subsonic vibration that we
cannot pick up with our ears
ultrasonic on by the way subsonic stuff
is more a feeling so you feel it rather
than you hear it also sonic is above
20,000 so that would be like a dog
whistle you know the dog whistles you
can you can blow on but you don't hear
anything that's because it's above
20,000 Hertz dogs
have a higher frequency response so they
hear higher pitches so when I hear that
they come to it yeah so that is the idea
of ultrasonic sounds and also just like
low sounds you can feel them if you keep
increasing the vibration speed it
becomes something new and you can
actually see it which is the concept of
light so light is also very very fast
vibrations and if you keep doing this
you get the idea of like radio signals
so FM and such that can all be
transmitted through these vibrations in
the air picked up by a radio tower and
so forth so all this is really cool it's
not just sound a lot of stuff are based
off of these vibrations so that is
ultrasonic
