ignore the board or else you're probably
gonna freak out and then you then you'll
unsubscribe to my YouTube channel and
then I'll get sad and then I won't be
able to make more videos because I'm so
sad I can't stop crying in them and no
one will want to watch them which means
the less people know how to program
databases which means there's less
resources for database programming and
then my videos don't get viewed because
no one programs databases anymore and
then I don't have anything to do in my
free time and just just don't look at
the board anyways we're going to be
talking about what's known as equal
temperament this quiet buddy this is a
system of tuning so as you may know we
tuned a for the 49th key I believe to
440 Hertz that means it vibrates 440
times in a second
now we can have other systems of tuning
that assign that same key the same
frequency 440 Hertz
although the key right after it let's
say B may be different so the space
between the pitches on the keyboard or
whatever instrument playing may be
different for system different systems
of tuning so most people use equal
temperament which is the system we use
and basically to figure out the next
pitch we take 440 and multiply it to the
power of 112 so ignore all this and just
look down here so we would have 440 and
then ^ 1 divided by 12 and this will
give us the pitch of the next number I
don't know if you can see us I'm gonna
zoom in here a bit right there so
hopefully that's good and you can see at
all so now we can figure out the rest
with this freaky funky equation but
before we get into that I want to say
one more thing on this up 10 we can also
figure it out by multiplying 445 1.05 9
here 6 3 this goes
forever but I got tired of writing
numbers so if we multiply 440 by 1.05 of
nine four six three we'll get an
estimate of what the B right after it so
if here's a four the key of A for the B
right after it if we multiply 440 by
this number right here that's we will
get the frequency of it so that is one
way we can do it as well as multiplying
440 times the 1 to the 10th power we can
also use this funky formula and if
you're not a math fan don't freak out
don't unsubscribe don't stop watching
this after this not much math required
so let's zoom in here a bit and we will
decipher what exactly is going on here I
can't run up tilt down okay that should
work so let's look at the top one here
we have this formula P N equals PA times
12 to the 12 over 2 you can type that in
a calculator I don't know how to
pronounce that properly and then that to
the N minus a power so what does that
mean well very simply we put 4 this is
the answer we are looking for so right
here is with the answer so we don't have
to put this in a calculator here we put
in a known frequency and we know a 4 so
we put 440 and then we multiply that by
this and you can put this in a
calculator just 12 over the power of 2
so this is the same thing as 1 to 12th
power so this is another way to write
this cool all right
then this goes to the power of the
London key which goes back to this oven
and then minus the known key well we
know a 4 is the 49th key so what key are
we looking for let's say we're looking
for middle C
that's the 40th key so that means we put
40 minus 49 and this will give us the
freak
see of middle C so if if you don't
understanding that just endure it don't
ever think of it again and maybe it'll
come back to you someday but I don't
know so that's pretty much all they have
to say about the concept of equal runway
equal temperament and in the next video
we'll be getting into something a little
different so I shall see you then and if
