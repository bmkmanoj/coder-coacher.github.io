to talk about creating race in the last
two videos I spoke about using arrays
and how to access the information within
the arrays but I never actually taught
you how to make an array so with PHP
there are our predefined arrays so
pretty much arrays that are already
created and you will use these arrays to
get information use that information
such as when a form is submitted and so
forth but you'll often create your own
arrays too so just like you can assign a
value to a variable we do something very
similar with the race so let's say let's
go let's say we're assigning a string to
a variable we're not creating array
right now we have name we can assign
this the value to well this is the
proper way to assign a string to a
variable
well assigning a string to an array is
very similar so we could add this little
box to square brackets and then an equal
sign so now we have names square
brackets is equal to or is a signed
string Caleb yeah camed Caleb so now the
key zero points to the value Caleb now
you can add another key key value pair
just by doing this again names
slip right so now the second thing
within our array has the key one and it
points to the string so let makes sense
this is not going to override the
original value it's going to add to the
array now what if we want to override
something in the array well we could do
something like this
names and then within this box put a 1
and then change now this number 1
originally 1 pointed to celeb well now
we're going to change it to Tiger kind
of think of anything so now this one is
override it and it now points to tiger
that means this value here no longer
exists is overridden hopefully that
makes sense another way we can create
race rather than assigning using the
same variable so with that method we're
going to have to write names and then
we're gonna throw repeat names and then
we're going to write names and we have
to repeat names and so forth we're going
to have to write the variable names and
then assign a value to it every single
entry into the array now what if we just
want to enter everything at once
well there's actually another way we
could do this
to do this we create a normal variable
so I could say food and then we assign a
function to this and we I know we
haven't gotten much into functions but
just follow and we can say array and
then we open a parenthesis left
parenthesis and then we can close the
parentheses and allow us to write
whatever you want and then add
semicolon and then everything within the
parenthesis is separated by commas in
each one separated by comma is a new
entry into the array so food could be
first one could be serial comma steak
and and then after the last one you
don't put a comma because there's no
more only when there's another one
coming
so serial comma State comma bananas
comma PI and make sure you put them in
quotes each point so now this is going
to create an array where the index 0
points to the serial the one points to
whoops mistake 2 points to bananas and
the three and the in debt these are the
keys
points to high this is pretty much what
this is creating right now so now if you
wanted to access the pi value of the
array you could say echo food square
bracket and then within the square
bracket write a 3 and this is going to
access the third element which is PI I'm
sorry this will access the third key not
the third elem this whole point to the
key with the value 3 which is going to
graph I hope that makes more sense
all right cool now man dramatic erase
what if you want to give a string value
as the key
well we can also do that just like the
first method we did we could say foods
square bracket and then within this you
can make a string such as saying
breakfast and then this is a sign of the
value of cereal all right so now
breakfast points to cereal breakfast
points to cereal so now you can add
another one foolís now within these
square brackets you could say lunch
that's equal to stick and then that is
going to create a new element where
lunch points to the value steak and it
is side if I'm using single quotes or
double quotes like keep changing alright
so now this is what we have just like
with the the indexed version we had a
function to do it we could also do that
with the associative version so we could
say foods without the brackets because
we're assigning the whole array not a
specific value within the array and we
can say array open the parentheses and
then close the parentheses this is a
little more complicated what we're going
to do is make a string breakfast and
then we're going to put close close the
string of course put an equal sign and
then a greater than sign so it looks
like an arrow
equals
greater than and then assign that a
value whatever you want
serial and then you put a comma which
allows you to do the next one lunch
stick and so forth
so that is the basics of creating a race
just like with um when when you're
creating arrays with the indexed
versions if you put the index when
you're creating it so let me let me show
you if I say foods and then within here
I say lunch and there's already a value
for lunch if I assign this something
it's going to override the other one
within the array so it'll find the key
with lunch and it will override it
another thing I wanted to go over was
when we're using the function to create
a race so foods equals array well if you
want to start an index with a certain
number such as 1 instead of 0 we can say
we write a 1 equals greater than sign
and then give it a value so forth and
then after that it'll start counting
from 1 rather than 0 so we change this
to 3 it will start counting from 3 just
like we gave it a string such as points
to nope we can give it a number 1
and this is going to be its new key
number but it's not an associative array
because it's not a string so I know
that's a lot of confusing this but
hopefully I don't make sense and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
