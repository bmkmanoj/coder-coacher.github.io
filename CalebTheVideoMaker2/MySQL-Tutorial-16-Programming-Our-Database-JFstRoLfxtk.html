programming the database we were talking
about which is for a gym where people
will sign up and stuff so before that I
want to explain a few things you can do
commands through the SQL command line
and you can also do it through PHP my
admin which is more graphical just like
typing it in here and click and create
rather than typing the code and we are
going to be using the code for this
because I am teaching you MySQL not PHP
my admin so we'll be using the SQL a box
I don't really know what it's called if
you guys know what this is called tell
me so first thing you want to do is
create a database in the command for
that create sorry create database and
then the database name so this kind of
test now that we usually all the SQL
commands or all the words recognized by
MySQL will be in capital letters and
words you whoops in words you choose
will be non capital letters so the name
it will be if you name a database it
will be uncapitalized names of columns
and tables they'll be uncapitalized
basically anything you can change in the
everything still works the same they
will be non capitalized all right so
from here you can go down here and click
go use your method go ah it's already
created oopsies
great database test - and there you go
on the side this will display all of
your databases you have created so we
click test and there's no tables in that
database go back to home you can select
test two and you can see there's no
tables found in that database so that's
how you do that and uh - you can also
click through phpMyAdmin click databases
and see all your databases right here so
like test to check the privileges for
people which we haven't set any of those
and I don't know if I'm ever gonna do
that but you can click test and you can
create a new table through this but
we'll be doing it through SQL alright so
now we're actually going to create our
database so the first thing you want to
do is click SQL up at the top and from
here you just like we did create
database and we're going to name it Jim
simple and then click go and on the side
we should have a database named Jim and
from here you want to click the SQL and
now the very next step is to create your
table so it's very similar to creating a
database you just name it like this
numbers that's what we're going to name
members now you put two parentheses and
every every column in the database you
will store in these parentheses so let's
list these we had whoops
remember ID and also going to put a
comma after them and then we had name
birthday what else is there phone Oh
membership status and in the last one
we'll have a that's all not bad
so within the commas is where you store
the extra information so the first step
is just to name all the columns in your
database it's pretty simple now the next
thing you want to do is name the type
that they are now if you remember member
member ID was a small
and name was a varchar' and vice versa
whoopsies arch r60 now you will want to
store these in a parenthesis 60 like
that birthday was a date need to work on
my typing that's what I'm going to do
phone was charged 10 just like that
membership status
what's enum now for enum we also need to
put the possible options so to do that
you make two parenthesis so when you
ever ever whenever you have extra
information for the datatype you put
them in parentheses so the first one in
quotations single quotations it was gold
next then you put a comma and a space
silver comma space bar on bronze comma
space and the last one was not a member
now it's kind of funny because this
table name is members and we made it not
a member but basically that's for people
who haven't been able to get a
membership status yet so if they do not
have gold they do not have silver and
they do not have bronze there this for
some reason that may happen and it's
better to have the security then that it
happen to go back and edit your database
so now that that's done that's good now
also next thing you want to do is put
extra characteristics about the columns
so if you remember this was unsigned and
it was so we're going to go through any
of the numbers and say if they're signed
or unsigned and that's the only one
which is good so then we put the not
null and remember all these were not
null
so it's like that great now we go to the
primary key which will be member ID and
we're going to make that Auto increment
oopsies make sure speller right or wrong
well that's going to account for us so I
don't have to change it each time pretty
simple now let's see if there's any
other things we're going to have a
default for the phone and doing all this
beforehand on on the chalkboard makes
this easier so you have to think about
this too much so to set a default you
put characteristic default to single
quotation marks and you put the default
which would be the area code zero zero
zero three digits zero zero zero and
then four more digits zero zero zero
zero that leaves us with ten so that's
good and then we also are going to set a
default for the you know to do that we
put default and then in single
quotations not a member oops she's not
capitalized great so that pretty much
covers all of our columns but the next
thing we want to do is have our indexes
and I didn't talk about this when
defining the database and I probably
should have but I'm going to set a index
right now and index wait for the member
ID and that that index type will be
primary key
simple as that not to define a key or
index you say the index type and then in
two parenthesis you will put what column
so the column was number ID just like
that now if you notice we have a column
after each individual entry into the
table this is to keep each thing
separate but the last one since there is
no other thing
after it we do not need a coma so this
is our complete creation of the table
and it should work let's see go and you
can see it adds a table members so
everything was good now another one
thing I wanted to say actually I think
I'll save it for the next video so
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next video goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
