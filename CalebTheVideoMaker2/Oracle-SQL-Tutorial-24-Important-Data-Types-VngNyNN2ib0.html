video maker - last night I had this
great idea on how I was gonna grow my
YouTube channel and I could not sleep
for the life of me so I'm a little
cranky today so you better not get on my
nerves you understand me
you're just a bee ah okay where was I
data types now I decided I'm going to
cover data types and some pretty good
depth for Oracle the reason being is
that data types are foundational to
creating good quality tables in addition
to that I am trying to go in a lot of
depth with this series so that way you
have a more deeper understanding of
Oracle and not like you know super
shallow I know how to create a basic
table and blah blah blah
that being said I'm not gonna bore you
with all of the details if you want to
know super depth you can read the manual
or get some books or something like that
my goal is to teach you concept so I
want you to understand concept in depth
because I'm teaching you in depth
there's a chance the important stuff
gets lost in the details and because of
that I decided I was going to create
this video so this video is your shallow
overview of the most important data
types why though why don't we just go in
each one in depth well that's because I
want to give you the most important ones
you're going to be using and then if you
know like oh this is the data type I
need to use then you can go in the
upcoming videos and you can learn more
details about them or research it online
by the end of this video you're not
going to master data types you were
going to know the bare minimum required
to create basic tables the first data
type when we've actually already
discussed is a number oh that was
disgusting oh now number it's used to
store numbers as you may have guessed we
have been using it to store integers so
when you have integer data or just int
data this refers to whole numbers that
means no decimals but numbers can
actually store decimals too so number is
the data type you want to use if you
have whole numbers or numbers that you
need very good precision with in math
for example if you're working with
finances the
azar you are going to want to use the
number data type there are two other
data types that work similarly but
they're a little bit different and these
ones are used for data that have numbers
but not numbers that have to be exact so
for example if you're working with math
of money you want it to be exact you
don't want to gain a couple pennies or
lose a couple pennies or whatever
currency you're in you wanted to be
exactly the number you're expecting well
sometimes it's not that important for
example you might have a number five
point and the farther you go this way
the less important the exactness of the
number is for example if you're
measuring the distance from here to over
there and your answer is this many feet
do you really think it's going to be any
different if the number turns out to be
like this
the chances are probably not that's
because the difference between this and
this is so small so if you're working
with that kind of data there are two
data types that will fit your situation
perfectly binary float and binary
doubles you can use either of these data
types if you're in the situation where
you don't need absolute exactness when
you're talking about far down the
fractional side of the number what are
the difference between these two though
this one is going to have more precision
than the float so if you need high
precision far down you will want to use
binary doubles if you don't need quite
as much precision binary float might
work just fine we'll go into the depths
of how many decimal places will work for
each of these and all of that in a video
in the future but just know what data
types you need if you need something
like this all of this is great if you're
storing numbers but you don't always
want to store numbers in a database
sometimes you need to store string data
the first two data types we are going to
cover in the string category are char
and end char these are both what's known
as fixed length data
that means if we make a column of char
that allows for 50 characters every
single value for that column is going to
be 50 characters even if you store less
than 50 characters so if you put
something like I inside of a 50
character char data type column it's
actually going to store two characters
one two and then 48 spaces and you can
see how that could be a bad thing the
two data types for variable length are
varchar' two and n varchar' two the
difference here between the previous two
data types is that these are variable
lengths and what that means is you could
make a column bar chart to of 50
characters and if you only store
something like high it's only going to
store two characters not fifty there are
a couple more datatypes I want to give
you but I'm not going to talk about
these ones in a ton of depth that's
because there's a lot to them and that
might take another video in the future
but I will still introduce both of them
to you so I'm going to erase this and
then we'll discuss those these can both
be used to store a date in time for some
database systems date will only store
the date well for oracle day actually
can include the time as well as for the
difference between these I decide and
we'll cover that in another video but
just know if you need to store something
that has to do with dates or time you
can use one of these
there's also interval data types and
this will allow you to store data like
two weeks so an interval of time so once
again those are some of the most
important data types you are going to
come across when you're working with
Oracle hopefully that was helpful
if you've liked this video please click
like and hope the oracle videos win the
competition cuz right now they're losing
be sure to like this video and watch the
next video and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
