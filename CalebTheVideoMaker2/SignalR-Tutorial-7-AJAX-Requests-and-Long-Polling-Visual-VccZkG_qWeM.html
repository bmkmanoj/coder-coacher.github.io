we are going to be discussing Ajax
requests and long polling but we're
going to do it visually now if you ever
do research on these topics online I
promise you you'll run across some crazy
pictographic Graham that looks
ridiculous and is super confusing well
my job is to break those down into
understandable language so that's what
we're doing so let's start off with just
a normal website without Ajax and
without long polling what does this look
like well let's split it up over here we
have the server side on this side we
have the client side so we'll start with
this little dot that's your computer it
makes a request to the server now the
server gets that request and it's going
to do some processing now this is where
your server side code is going to reside
your c-sharp PHP Python whatever you're
developing in with this course we'll be
using c-sharp but this is a normal
example without using signal R so you
can imagine whatever you want so that's
going to get all the stuff and needs to
send back to the client it's going to
get the HTML the CSS the JavaScript the
pictures the media whatever it is it's
going to get it already and it's going
to send that back to the client so this
little bar here is processing it takes
time for the server to do all that so
we'll just kind of shade that in now
you're on that webpage and you're just
doing your thing until you want
something new you're bored with looking
at this page so you make a new request
and then that server has to go find the
new data that you asked for and then it
sends it back and then you're reading oh
you're really bored now so you need more
data and this time it sends it back it
just follows this pattern right here
this is the standard web when you
introduce Ajax things change so let's
talk about that now with Ajax the first
request is going to be completely like a
normal standard web
request okay there's not going to be
anything fancy that's because you
actually haven't gotten any files the
way
Ajax works is you code stuff in the
client-side code that you're going to
send to the clients but until they get
that it's just normal so it's going to
make a normal request to the server and
the server is going to get the files and
send them back this looks exactly like
the normal one we just talked about a
second ago
what changes here now that you have the
client-side code this is going to stay
active so this is going to go on until
you're done now whenever you need new
data all you have to do is make a
request the server is going to process
it and send it back this looks different
than the last example in the last
example we didn't have this here it
looked like that and you can see we had
to wait for that new data well Ajax
makes things asynchronous meaning you
don't have to wait for this to be done
you can still look at your webpage while
that's going on and then oh you want
some more data here we go this is
basically the process and the data that
we get back it could be a lot of
different things I don't want you to be
closed-minded about it it can really be
a whole bunch of different things but in
the example we were using it's kind of
like hey do we have any new emails no so
it doesn't always have to send back
content it could just send back a
response of No
so do we have new emails no do we have
new emails yes the magic here is this
this goes on the whole time now there
are times when you might need to switch
pages or something and if that's the
case there's going to be a break here so
in this situation we request a new data
and this was a situation where we
couldn't do it a synchronously so for
example if you switch your pages if you
decide you want to go to a new page on
the website well that is not going to be
an ace
Kronus kind of thing instead we request
it wait for the data and then we get it
back
so with Ajax you kind of have a mix yes
MA Jackson you have some normal now
let's move on to long pulling lung
pooling is going to look very similar to
Ajax and just the normal because we're
still going to have this opening thing
we have to request files before we can
open that connection that's going to
last so once we get the appropriate
client-side code now our client
understands how to do long polling or
Ajax in this situation we'll go with
long polling so this is going to stay
open so after every single response from
the server we're going to open a new
request so as soon as we get this but
we're going to open new request and this
is going to stay open until we get data
oh we got data send it back open a new
request oh we got data send it back I'll
open a new request and same thing
happens here if you want to switch your
page or something you might have to do a
complete new request and that's going to
kind of break this continuation well
hopefully that was all clear that kind
of pictographic lee shows everything you
need to understand when it comes to the
normal web Ajax and long polling thanks
guys and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
