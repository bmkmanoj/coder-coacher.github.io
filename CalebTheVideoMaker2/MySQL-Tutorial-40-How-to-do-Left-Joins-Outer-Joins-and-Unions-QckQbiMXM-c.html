spoke of joins and more specific do you
see that that was weird
more specifically outer joins I mean oh
geez I spoke of inner joins and in this
video oh speaking of outer joins this is
a wreck I'm sorry alright welcome guys
and in this video I will be speaking of
outer joins in the last video I spoke of
inner joins
so there's a big a bit of a difference
and I'm going to show you what that is
so let me show you first we will all
geez I will show uh what is this man I'm
just messing everything up today alright
I'll show you an inner join so what I do
is I pull the pattern select from inner
join then I use using if you remember
using this is a command when both of the
what you're comparing are the same so
basically first name last name and
review because this is reviews for a
slore whatever from customers then we're
going to join on the table reviews using
mmm customer ID oh and this has to be in
parenthesis click go now you can see
here are all of our reviews that are
connected to a customer right so Chuck
Norris best store ever you get the point
so yeah now I'm going to edit this and
show you what let's do this in line what
an outer join is so what we're going to
do is do a left join left join reviews
and then if we click go you look at this
and we can see a new person James Bond
but he didn't say anything so you can
see he's a customer but he never
actually left the place to review this
is the purpose of an outer join because
now it takes all the customers even if
they haven't posted a review and applies
any reviews that are connected to them
now you're probably wondering what's the
difference between like left join and
stuff which I already explained but I
need to explain it again the order of
these customers left join reviews
affects what is being shown so if we had
a review which was not connected to a
customer which shouldn't happen it would
be like this you can find this by
switching these so I put customers here
and then up here we put reviews so now
we're selecting the first name last name
and the review from reviews and we're
left joining customers and then we go oh
now you can see there is another review
which does not have a customer so this
is a good way to test your your database
to see if there's any because this
shouldn't happen so you need to fix your
application or delete this information
from your database so that is the
example of switching the information as
you can see I did an inner join and it
shows all of our people that are
connected with the review if I take this
into a full join and click go you can
see it returns the same exact results so
full joins are kind of useless even
though they should bring back all the
people who don't have reviews and all
the reviews that don't have first names
or last names or all the reviews that
aren't connected to an ID within the
customers table I'm going to show you a
way to fix this but if I wasn't using
I'm pretty sure that MySQL it's not
fully support full join yet so here's a
way around it saying Union
distinct and what this will do is erase
any duplicates so just just fall I'll
explain this in a minute and we're going
to make another select statement and
notice this is a left join here first
name last name review customers and then
we're going to do a right Ewing reviews
we're basically just copying every
single thing except the type of join
using custody now if we click go let's
look at this we have first name we're
selecting all the left join and then by
using a Union distinct we're connecting
it with the right join and basically the
distinct just gets it rid of any
duplicates cuz if I put Union all you
can see it's not what we want so we use
Union distinct this is how you combine
two queries into a single table like
this now you can see we have reviews I
mean people who don't have reviews and
then reviews who don't have people I'm
going to be showing you one more thing
before the end of this video and first
things first I'm going to get rid of
this Union and update this so now we're
back to the original what I'm going to
do is replace this left join with
something new now if you remember we
have left join reviews what we're going
to do is select these from customers and
then put a comma employee reviews so now
we're selecting these from these table
two tables and then we can make a where
clause and say we're customers period
customer ID is equal to review stock
customer ID
so this is going to take the first name
last name and the review from these two
tables only where the customer ID is
equal to the reviews customer ID and if
we click go we're going to see how this
turns out you can see actually turns out
exactly the same so if you are having
struggles memorizing the other method of
doing this you can just think of it that
one less thing you have to remember just
use a where clause and then say what is
equal to what which will be the in this
case a primary key and a foreign key and
that is all I'm going to be explaining
in this video hopefully that cleared
things up and in the next video I'm
going to talk about you have to wait so
I'll see you in the next video and
