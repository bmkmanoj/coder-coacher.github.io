I will be going over the absolute
measurements of the seventh chords so
absolute measure means oh the seventh
chords I don't know why I decided to
write that up there oh well because I
didn't even finish it so we had the
major 7th major 7th we had the minor 7th
and then we had the it's cold the
dominant seventh or the major / minor
seventh half diminished also known as
dim with a little stud sign there and
then we had fully diminished or dim with
a sign without a little cut through so
here are the five seventh chords we
learned so how do we create these what
we know this is built off of a major
triad so this will have a major triad
this one will have a minor triad major
minor well that's actually built off of
a major triad so this is a major triad
diminished that is built off of a
diminished triad and fully diminished is
going off the diminished triad so we can
basically recreate these triads and have
to worry about augmented because then
it's a memo line through the
diminishment so yeah let's go well we
had major seventh which consisted of we
have the root so that's the root and
then we had a major third a perfect
fifth and then we add a relatively we
add a major third and a major third has
four half steps so what we get is a
sorry major seventh kind of drew a blank
there for a second
that this is known as the major seventh
chord so I'm just drawing a dot to
represent the route because I don't feel
like right in the root out now to create
a minor seventh chord we just create a
minor triad perfect fifth and both have
the perfect fifth and then we have a
minor yeah I think that's right yes so
now we also have the major / minor so
I've the root then we have a major triad
major third perfect fifth and a minor
seventh we can have the half diminished
triad which is built off a diminished
triad which consists of a minor third
diminished fifth because it's half
diminished it's not fully diminished so
we get a minor seventh versus a fully
diminished which has a minor third
diminished fifth and a diminished
seventh so the relative intervals for
this one would be a minor third weight
from the root so here's the root a minor
third minor third minor third let me
show you that on a keyboard first off
how many half steps is in a minor third
for what about a diminished fifth would
be 6 i'm going to diminished 7th well a
major 7th has 11 minor 7th has 10
diminished 7th has nine so if we are on
see one two three four
so I had some minor should be three
wasn't thinking there one two three 'if
lat 123456 which gives us G flat then
back from see one two three four five
six seven eight nine so a wrong had
tried to trick you there because we have
to take the seventh of the scale which
is a be so it's actually be double sharp
be double sharp i'm an idiot be double
flat so there you go that is the
creation of 7th chords using absolute
measurements here we have the major 7th
minor 7th I think this one was major /
minor dahlman seventh then we had half
diminished and fully diminished forgot
about there so yeah that's that's all we
have to say about that and I'll see you
in the next video bye subscribe
