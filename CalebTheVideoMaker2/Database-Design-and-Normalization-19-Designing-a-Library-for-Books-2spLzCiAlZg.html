of our database we're going to follow
the forms I know I did some with the
first form and maybe a little with the
second form and so on that's just
because that's just to make it a little
more easier to see at first we had all
of these tables within each other as in
just one giant table and that is not
what we want because obviously this is a
little more structured so I kind of
skipped ahead in the third normal form
there but I still need to follow the
forms from the beginning you can also
see that I added some extra information
in the students this says top selling
car year of sales year of car and
manufactured what this is is basically
information for a year so like 2012 say
the top-selling car of that year and
then the year of that car and then also
the manufacturer in this car this is
obviously placed wrong with students I
am putting this here so I can go through
the normalization forms as if you had a
bad designed database like this well
what we did here kind of helped prevent
problems similar to this okay so now
that everything is a tonic like nothing
is more than one there is one still and
it's books down here you see author a
book can have more than one author and
an author connect and an author can
write more than one book so what you
need to do is when you make a new table
and we are going to open this in a new
window name this authors now the first
thing Oscar I do we always want ID and I
capitalize that this serves as the
primary key we're also going out of the
author name all the first name and
author
sweet you could just put first name last
name doesn't matter alright now if you
remember making a many-to-many
relationship you need what is called an
intermediary table this connects the two
tables from books and authors so we need
another table this will be called books
authors okay so now this has a book ID
and this has an author ID we are going
to make what's called a foreign key in
this table so we do because we want the
book ID and then we want the author ID
these are good both going to be type int
and and we're going to selecting both as
a primary key now you're wondering why
that is is because an author of a book
will never change so the connection of
the book and author will always be
together like that so down here under
foreign key you want to click this and
I'll just say book ID and this is the
table it will reference now obviously
the book ID is going to be tied to the
books table so you want to scroll down
here and click the books now it will
show the columns of the book authors
table you want to select which one will
be the foreign key mines book ID now it
will automatically tell you which which
column that it can use as the primary
key referenced by the foreign key and
it's book ID you now you want to go back
over here like another other one author
ID whoops and now this goes to authors
select call an author ID an author ID so
that'll connect this author ID over here
to this author idea
so these are actually both foreign keys
to this now you can see how it lights up
there it'll show how it's connected next
obvious thing is under books we can now
get rid of the author down you so I want
to edit this and just delete the author
okay so now you can see where it says
topic topic is many another many to many
relationship that is because a book can
have multiple topics and also a specific
topic can go to multiple books so we're
going to do
yes create a new table I know it's hard
work edit new and go topics also now if
you want it so a book can only have one
topic then you don't necessarily have to
do this that's up to you
so here books topic look ID this will be
a foreign key and then genre oh sorry
topic ID skipping ahead sometimes
primary key because they're connected
book ideas the foreign key books you
should be able to do this by now then
under column slide book ID that connects
this book ID with this book ID if you
hover over this you can see how it's
connected and you just want to do the
same thing to the topic ID
there's topics topics topics right there
topics whoopsies messed up okay
topics okay here's the problem what's
going on you gotta see this is says this
VAR char and then topics topic idea says
in these both need to be the same so
what I'm going to do is set that int now
when you set up the foreign key you
should be able to select it and then
select topic ie so let me explain a
little bit how this is going to work
you're going to have an entry into the
topics so let's say you want a new topic
whore
I said whore not hole okay so then the
topic ID would be one per se and then
over here you can have the book ID book
ID of seven which has a book name
awesome
tied with a topic ID of whore so awesome
is a horror book and that is basically
how it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
