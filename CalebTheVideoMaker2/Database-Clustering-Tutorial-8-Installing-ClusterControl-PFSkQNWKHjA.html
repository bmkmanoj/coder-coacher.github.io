in this video we are finally installing
cluster control I know this is taken so
long but now we have such a good
foundation that when we're working with
cluster control we actually know what
we're doing a little bit so let's go to
our cluster control virtual machine that
we set up in the previous videos and I
already have the guide up here teaching
you how to install it and I'm literally
just going to follow this guide so it's
nothing crazy the URL for this is you
can just go to the several nines website
slash Doc's slash getting started with
the - dot HTML if you want to follow
along and I'll try to put that URL down
in the description all right so let's
just type in these commands that it's
telling us to do there's the first one
done now
Shimada + ex install - CC that was easy
. / install - CC and this you can see
here it says as a root or sudo user so
what that means is we need to go back to
the beginning and type in sudo and then
press Enter now we need to type in our
password and this is going to give you a
lot of prompts with questions a lot of
these are really not that important I'm
going to point out the ones that are
most important but just do what you
think is right in this situation like do
you want to send Diagnostics data that's
totally up to you while this is working
let me just explain this little blue box
down here you can see it says cluster
control relies on a MySQL server as a
data repository blah blah blah blah blah
essentially what that means is cluster
control itself needs a database to store
data that the application uses so this
is different than the database you're
going to be using for your actual
database cluster essentially this is the
database that cluster control uses for
its own information so throughout this
installation if you don't already have
MySQL installed it's going to ask you a
bunch of questions about setting it up
and the kind of username and password
you want that's all fine just make sure
you write down any information and asks
for so that way if you need it in the
future you can get that it's also going
to ask you a bunch of questions about
like security and yada yada it's
recommended to do
this and well because I'm in a testing
environment I really don't care about
security but if you are practicing for a
production environment you probably want
to be a little bit more careful with the
security but one of the things that I
know it's going to ask is about
validating passwords and essentially
what that's going to do is make sure
your passwords are secure enough that
one in particular I'm going to say no to
because I use a super insecure password
for all this stuff so that way I don't
forget it but basically everything else
I'm going to say yes to that's all I'm
going to need from this guide so I'm
just going to X out of this and that
will allow me to put this in fullscreen
there we go you know I actually think I
like I like this a little bit better
Here I am shaping the thing and it's
asking me a question okay so this is
really important you can see that it
says detected more than one IP and
that's because in VirtualBox we gave it
to network cards the one we are wanting
to use is this ten seven one three four
one zero one but by default it's going
to use 1002 one five so we do want to
change this so make sure you put Y for
yes and then type in that new IP address
10.7 1.3 4.1 zero one all right so this
is installing it asks me some port
information with MySQL I'm just using
the default for everything this part
take note you got to remember your
passwords that's literally why I make
all my passwords password one of these
questions is reloading the privilege
tables I am going to put yes for that
you can read it says this will ensure
that all changes made so far will take
effect immediately
so that's obviously something we're
going to want to do so cluster control
has a MySQL user called come on got to
make sure you give it a password alright
it's done there is one line you want to
pay particular attention to and that is
this line right here open your web
browser to and then it gives you a link
you can actually hold ctrl and click
that that'll open up Firefox ok so this
is going to be the front end of your
several nines application and when you
open it it's going to have you create a
username and password or an email and
password I should say once you create
your account you're going to get to this
page and there's going to give you some
information and who cares about to
having sex out of that and this is the
home page so the very first thing you're
probably going to want to do is hold
ctrl and press D to bookmark it that way
you can always find it so there we go
guys we set up cluster control in the
next video we are going to actually be
setting up a cluster inside a cluster
control and that's going to be you know
be the best part of this series so I'll
see you then and if you've enjoyed these
videos please be sure to subscribe send
them to your friends and once again if
my audio is horrible I apologize I'm
running like three virtual machines
inside of my laptop that's already noisy
by default so it is not a whole lot I
can do about it in this situation so
yeah I'll see you all in the next video
peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
