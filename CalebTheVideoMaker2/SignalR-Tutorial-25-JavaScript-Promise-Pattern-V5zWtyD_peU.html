must be learning something hopefully
this video will be helpful for you guys
once again my name is Caleb from Caleb's
video maker Tube and just to kind of
give a reminder of where we left off we
were making this method and now we're
trying to get that data on the client
side we're essentially trying to get the
server date/time displayed on the
clients web page so this is what we got
so far but this is not enough we need to
convert it into the promised pattern so
to do that we say doc done don't fail
you can see that's the same thing I get
here and then for either one of those we
need to assign a function for it to be
ran when it succeeds I think this is
called a callback function it's the
function that's ran after we get the
data so what we need to do if it's done
we need to display the data on the page
very easy we already have that function
from the other video right here
whoa how do we how do we put the data in
there well there's a really interesting
way on how to get the data and this
function here can actually take a
parameter and we in his name or whatever
we want we'll just put data and then we
can write that data to the page so let's
give it a try let's run this and see
what happens
Oh sweetie it's working yeah all right
so what happens if it fails well let's
look literally nothing
so we need to do the same thing for
failing now we could just pass in an
error in here and just be like error
whatever well you can also do this other
thing where the the function will
actually take a parameter of the error
that is given automatically so we can
split give it a name whatever you want
and then you can display back to the
page so that's kind of how it works when
a method is ran if it's if you get the
data successfully you will get the data
if for any reason the connection between
the client and the server is interrupted
you will get an error message and you
can access it through the parameter of
the callback function of the fail method
it's lots of worries there yeah okay
let's see what this does refresh and you
see it's working
and that's cool and all but we still
need to think of how can we test this to
see if it fails well there is one way
that I have in mind essentially what I
think I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create a
button and every single time we press
that button I want the new time to be
displayed on the page and then what we
can do is we can shut the server off and
then press the button and there won't be
any connection to the server so we'll be
able to see the error when that happens
there's probably a super easier way to
do it but that's all I got for now so
that's what we'll be doing in the next
video so I'll be sure to see you guys
then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
