tutorial series in this video I wanted
to talk a little bit more about strings
and specifically some problems we're
going to come across when using them so
if we have a string that's pretty much
what a string is we can have it like
that or we could have it in single
quotes either way although what if we
need to store clothes within our string
such as let's think she's pretty well if
we put this within single quotes let's
just this is do it right now here's what
what happens
so pythons looking through this and it
sees okay opening quote and then it goes
on oh and then it sees another single
quote closing quote so it sees it as she
and then we have all this extra crap
that shouldn't be there stuff whatever
you want to call it well one solution
for this is to use double quotes on the
outside she's pretty
now it sees the opening and the closing
and it can pretty much ignore any single
quotes within it although what if we
have double quotes within it he said Wow
well now this is this is the opening
quote and then it goes on until it sees
another double quote boom now this this
is what Python sees as the entire string
and then we have all this extra stuff
that shouldn't be there so the solution
for this one is to use single quotes on
the outside and boom it works so now
let's try the ultimate example where we
have both he said wow she's pretty okay
oops like I said yeah that's really
alright so now we have double quote and
then it goes until the double quote
error so the only solution we might
tries to put single quotes but now the
same problem happens because within our
string we have a single quote in Python
sees the
as the closing quo so we're going to go
over some solutions to fix this the
first one is what's called I don't
really know I think it's called like a
multiple line quote so we can put three
single quotes as an opening hello and we
can go over multiple lines there and
then we can close it and press ENTER and
it returns back some weird results but
these are newline characters which we
talked about in a previous video so this
works pretty well we could try it we can
put it within a print and we can do the
same thing we can go oops
so yeah you get what I'm saying if we
type this up by itself like this print
and then we put the quotes hey and then
we press ENTER it's going to work
single quotes and then we can print that
and that way it'll get rid of the
newline characters so that is what's
known as a multiple string quote and
that's beneficial because that is
treated differently because then MySQL
looks for I'm sorry Oh
Python looks for three quotes in a row
so if your string has three quotes in a
row for some reason well then it's not
gonna work otherwise it will he said
Wow she's pretty and then we close it
with three single quotes so we have
opening three quotes I can't even if I
can get that my mouse is freaking out
and then we have the throat the closing
three quotes and within here these
double quotes are ignored as well as the
single quotes are ignored so that is how
we can get around that problem and
obviously we have this backslash which
is basically just because we're not
printing it if we use the print function
it should look fine
now I also wanted to say before we go on
that this trip will quote thing is
useful if we need to print stuff over
multiple lines for example if we want to
print hey dude and then we want to
literally put a space below this and
then print more we press ENTER to go to
the next line and we get an error so if
we need to print values over multiple
lines we can use three single quotes
press ENTER and then we can close those
when we want and then it's going to
print that hey with a single quote
floating alright and the only other way
to fix this problem is using what's
known we can we can escape things which
that is what we will talk about in the
next video so hopefully this is helpful
and I will see you guys in the next one
