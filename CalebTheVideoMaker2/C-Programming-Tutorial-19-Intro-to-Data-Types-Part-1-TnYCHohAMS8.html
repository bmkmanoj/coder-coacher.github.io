programming tutorial series this is
Caleb from Caleb's video maker 2 and in
this video we are going to talk about
data types now before we start talking
about the types of data let's first talk
about what data is well the best way to
discuss data is to imagine that we have
a variable that holds some data let's
say we have a variable called tacos and
it stores the value 5 the 5 is a piece
of data by the way an individual data is
called a data but I personally think
that work sounds dumb so I'm not going
to use it
5 is an example of data now the data
type tells the computer how to interpret
this data how does the computer
interpret this data right here and it
seems kind of odd like doesn't the
computer just know well actually not for
example when we're working with integer
division versus double division 5
divided by 2 equals to 5.0 divided by 2
equals 2.5 you can see that we get two
completely different results these are
not equal and the reason they are
different is because the data we are
working with has different data types in
each of these situations the data types
of each of these pieces of data are as
so v2 and the integer the 5 is integer B
2 is also an integer with the 5.0 is a
double so far you can see that there are
differences even in the numeric data
types so these are part of the numeric
data types the other one you should know
is called swamp but starting off knowing
int and double is very helpful the data
type of the data changes the results so
you can see that data types are very
very important when it comes to
programming super important our human
brains like to group things so to help
us out data types are often classified
and one of these classifications is
called primitive data types I don't
really like this word either but that's
a discussion for another day the
primitive data types are
to be the smallest data types and want
to say smallest I don't mean like size
what I mean is that they can't be broken
up into pieces you could say that they
are indivisible or what some people
would say a topic if that doesn't make a
whole lot of sense
consider primitive data types as the
building blocks these are like the Legos
that we can combine and piece together
to make more complex data types I just
use the word that you should know the
other type of data type is complex now a
perfect example of a complex data type
is a struct and we can define our own
strokes we are not going to get into the
details of how to makes trucks right now
because it's way down the road but it is
important to know that they exist a
struck is essentially using these
primitive data types to make something
more complex for example we can make a
struct for dates so then we can make a
variable like this you see that the
variable today is of type date or we
could have something like this you see
that the variable lol is of data type
coordinates these are not primitive they
are complex
we used the building blocks to create
them ourselves
we can even combine multiple Struck's to
make even bigger structures we just keep
building and building and building until
we have very complex data types or what
somebody would say data structures an
example of a more complex data structure
would be a linked list a linked list you
can think of as a chain of things where
these can be whatever you want them to
be so for example we can make a link to
list of coordinates so each one of these
would have an XY and this could be some
kind of route that you have to take to
get someone you can see that they're all
connected and you can see it just gets
more complex and more complex for now I
don't really want you to worry about the
complex data types what's important is
that you get down the primitive data
types there's a lot of data types that
are built in to see and structs are a
good example of something that's built
into C whereas the linked list you kind
of have to
build yourself well I want you to focus
on the stuff that is already included
and see and don't worry about this stuff
for right now once you got down the
numeric data types the arrays and even
some structs then you can start building
some more complex things like linked
lists which is the hardest word in the
world to say list that's all I got for
you guys in this video hopefully it was
helpful I will see you in the next one
peace also be sure to subscribe and
don't forget to download the notes if
you think that be helpful for you all I
ask is for your email you know I'm not
going to like spam you that often</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
