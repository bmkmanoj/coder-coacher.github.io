I'm the owner of Caleb's video maker 2
here on YouTube and Caleb curry comm
website and in this video we'll be
talking about operating systems it's
important to know about operating
systems if you are going to be doing
anything with technology pretty much
anything having to do with technology
you need to know about operating systems
so we're going to get into the basics of
operating systems this is designed for
beginners although I mean if you're
advanced that's fine
don't the run away or anything mainly
we're going to be starting with the
basics and understand to understand what
an operating system is so when you have
a computer you have the monitor where is
where you view your content then you
have the tower which has the hardware in
it so that's where you have your
processor your power supply your random
access memory your hard drives all that
stuff is within the tower and then you
also have software which is the actual
content within the computer so I want to
differentiate between the two terms
hardware and software hardware is within
the tower so within the computer let me
draw a little computer here power button
CD Drive and everything all of your
hardware is within this so things that
qualify for hardware would be the
processor or CPU the hard drive the rent
the memory the power supply the network
cards or anything else that is within
your Tower CD Drive anything like that
so that is hardware you also have
software so this stuff when you turn on
your computer you can open up software
also known as
either programs or applications so for
example web browsers so Firefox Google
Chrome Internet Explorer opera anything
like that
Safari these are all examples of
software as well as email clients video
games anything you open up on a computer
you open up a program a text file or you
always open it within a program so
notepad plus plus if you've used that
that's a program or an application this
is all considered software it's
programmed using programming language
such as C++ or Java and there's pretty
much a million programming language I -
you can use to build software but that
is all considered software so you have
software on your computer right and in
order for your software to work it has
to use your hardware so for example if
you have a video game you're going to
have to display graphics on the screen
and in a give sound so people can hear
the content within the game well that's
going to use your video card and I mean
it's going to use a lawyer processor and
all this stuff but I'm sorry guys my
phone's always gone so yeah you can use
your video card your sound card but it's
not supposed to be one design or
anything you can you use your sound card
so your software needs to communicate so
your software needs to communicate with
your hardware so let's say this box over
here this is software and this shape
here is hardware well when a software
needs something it goes to the hardware
and and uses the appropriate tool to do
that so that's just that's this very
basic well
that's cool and all but there's a
problem you see not all hardware is the
same on computer from computer to
computer so if you have two different
manufacturers let's say you have a
laptop from Dell and then you have a
laptop from Lenovo Lenovo I mean how to
pronounce that we're spell it well those
are two different manufacturers the
chances are their hardware is not going
to be exactly the same so the problem
comes up you're going to need an
application that can talk to both
computers and all the other computer
systems because people that are going to
use your application use a wide variety
of hardware so you have smartphones
tablets laptops computers different
types of sound cards video cards
processors hard drives all these
different things and in order for your
program to work you're going to have to
properly communicate back and forth so
let's say you have this computer this is
a computer here right and then you also
have this computer all right now these
these two have different contents within
so I guess I guess I could use two
different colors to illustrate this this
one has content within like hardware
that is this one has different content
within different hardware so they are
not the same computer now when we build
an application so we have this general
application over here let's say is a a
web browser now let's go emit a mailing
pro a video game let's go video game
right in order for this to communicate
with any computer well we would have to
have not one of these we would actually
have two different versions so a blue
one and a red one so this this program
in reality is actually two different
possibilities that this one
the blue one can communicate with this
one and the red one can communicate with
this one now you can all do this within
one program but that becomes a lot of
complexity because okay now we have this
computer well now there's something new
well I got to get this on a different
type of display or a smartphone or
something well that's where the problem
comes in and this is why we need an
operating system so an operating system
is pretty I'm going to close on one
marker Searson home drive oh no an
operating system it's pretty much an
intermediary between the software and
the hardware so if we have this software
over here and then we have this
operating system and then we have three
different types of hardware over here
well this software can communicate with
the operating system which then can
communicate to the different computers
so now the person who is developing the
app doesn't have to build it so it can
do all these things as take taking
information from the hardware and using
it for its advantage it has to all it
has to do is call on the operating
system to do that stuff for it then the
operating system does the appropriate
stuff and gives it back to the
application so that is pretty much the
process now the way things work together
if we have a an application so I'm going
to draw the application again you know
because I always erase stuff and then
redraw it for some reason so here's the
application and here is the operating
system so basically just zoomed in this
this means of communication this is
known as an interface so basically this
is a system of standards and this allows
the app
for the software to communicate with the
operating system so if these guys are
talking basically in the same
standardized language or whatever then
they can understand each other so there
they follow a set of standards to
communicate between between each other
so this is known as an interface and it
allows these two to communicate there is
also an interface between the operating
system and the hardware so these are
both examples of interfaces basically
when they communicate now there's also
another application
I mean interface so when you're using
your laptop you could say you
communicating with the application this
is also an interface so these these
three means of communication are all
known as an interface so with this
system all the application developer
needs to know is what rules the
operating system requires to communicate
with the hardware so just like this
interface here there's specific rules
that allow these two to communicate well
the operating system has specific rules
to transfer that to to the hardware so
this can allow the application developer
to program a certain way to ask the
operating system to do something with
the hardware so an operating system we
could be using Windows 8 for example
oopsies
well Windows 8 has a method to
communicate with the hardware and the
application within the code it needs to
tell the operating system to do that in
the certain rules and laws that the
operating system requires now to
illustrate this concept visually rather
than developing a professional
PowerPoint I just did some arts and
crafts so here we have two computers and
I've gave them different ledges to
represent that they are different so
this one has different hardware than
this one they are not exactly the same
they're from different manufacturers so
now I build this super-awesome
application right here so you can see
the application well if you look this is
going to work with this computer here
because they connect sorta I mean I am
kind of bad arts crafts but yes they do
connect now if I want to use this
application on this other computer
well you can see it doesn't work out so
well there's some gaps and things aren't
going to communicate properly well these
are two different manufacturers now the
probe the application developer is given
the responsibility to make it work for
both computers so they're going to have
to allow people to submit their hardware
settings and they're going to have to be
able to reprogram to where they can
communicate with multiple different
computers within the system and you're
basically going to get a modified
version of the application so this is
the same application which can now
communicate with this computer so as you
can see we can communicate with both of
the computers so that's good although
the problem is the application developer
had to develop an application that could
speak with computer one which is going
to take a lot of work without the
operating system and they're also going
to have to develop the same application
that can work with computer two not to
mention many other computer systems so
that is the problem with applications
without an operating system to allow
things to piece together easier so now
what I want to show you is we have an
operating system that can connect to the
computer which gives the application a
platform to run on so that not only we
basically just took all the extra stuff
within the application that allowed us
to communicate with the computer and we
assign that to the operating system
basically another piece in this process
so if we did this for this application
over here get rid of this extra stuff so
now we have an application we also have
an operating system so this operating
system is designed to communicate with
this computer which allows a platform
for the application to run on so now I
can run our computer systems
well why is this a good thing
well first off the operating system is
designed to communicate with multiple
forms of hardware so this can be the
same operating system so let's say Linux
for example this this Linux operating
system is designed to work with computer
one or it can work with computer two so
that's pretty much the operating systems
job it can do things such as request
memory or allow multiple applications to
run at the same time so when the
operating system is connected to the
hardware we have what's called a
platform for the application to run off
so now we can piece together our
computers and we have a successful
process here so for example this
platform is running a Linux operating
system
well Linux actually can understand
another application so these application
developers don't even have to worry
about communicating with the computer
all they have to do is worry about
communicating with this nice platform
with the operating system and we can
also run this on a different computer
for example so now all of that work is
sent to the operating system which makes
the application size
Moeller because if you remember for it
was like this big now it's only this big
so now the application is smaller and we
don't have to work extra to communicate
with the hardware so from what we know
so far we have the user the application
or the software then we have the
operating system and then we have the
hardware and I'm gonna give a better
market here so basically the operating
system allows the application to
communicate with the hardware more
easily correct well I wanted to get into
something known as abstraction so this
is basically making something extremely
complex and thinking of it in a simple
way so we think of it as operating
system we don't necessarily think oh the
operating system has tons of services
has to worry about inputs and outputs
read and write requests so if you save a
file it has to do something with it as
to communicate with all the different
Hardware pieces and blah blah blah and
so forth and so forth we just think of
it as the operating system and we throw
all of that work on the operating system
and we don't necessarily have to think
of the entire thing every single time we
think of it so that's kind of a hard to
understand so I got thought of an
illustration well here's a phone if you
know how to use a phone you can type on
it or call somebody for example well
inside of the phone there's hardware and
there's an operating system so just like
this is pretty much a miniature computer
and once you figure out how to use a
phone you can pick up a different phone
and probably do the same thing use it
like this so if someone has never used a
phone before hand them a phone may take
them a while to figure it out so
says in operating systems hardware
Symbian operating system so forth like
that but that's not always necessary to
understand because when you look at the
phone oh you just press button so you
don't have to worry about the hardware
within it and then once you figure that
out you can pick up different kinds of
phones so you can just pick up any kind
of phone talk on it hey hey what's up
and they all kind of work the same well
this is an idea of abstraction we're
taking an abstract concept such as the
entire phone sending the data to the
other person's phone magically well that
that's complex stuff so we use an
abstraction so where we don't have to
think about that all so earlier I showed
you like the setup we had the hardware
down here and then we had the operating
system and then we had the application
layer or the D software and then we had
the user and then between each one of
these we had interfaces which is
basically how they communicate interface
all right so this this is known as
layering so they ring and basically this
allows us to think of this in an
organized fashion
alright so let's say I wanted to develop
an application for a computer I wanted
it to be antivirus protection for
example that's just an example I could
all right well let's figure out how I
can do this I can develop new hardware
and then once I got that I can develop
an operating system and then I can
develop that application and by the way
I'm going to develop my own programming
languages that I want to use anybody
else's I can do all that by myself
or I could use what's known as layering
which allows us to look at each one of
these layers and I
think okay well hardware's taken care of
operating systems taken care of there's
some programming language of that guy I
could use I could use C for example and
then all I have to do is worry about the
application and how the application
communicates with the user and how it
communicates with the operating system
so that's an example of wedding where
we've looked at everything in a system
of layers so that way we don't have to
look at it in a confusing manner to
where you're not sure what's what rather
than just saying like computer you can
break a computer up into hardware
software operating system and the person
using it so that is the idea of layering
now to illustrate this very easily we
could I'm going to use all right so
let's say this is D Hardware all right
I'm going to try to fill us in real
quick and then this up here this is the
operating system right all right so now
the the interface between these two this
allows them to communicate so we can say
we have an interface right here which
overlaps a little bit which allows it to
take information from the hardware and
use and give it to the operating system
or vice versa so this is the interface
now you could say these are independent
this is because they are different boxes
they are black to represent that this
box doesn't know what's going on in this
box this box doesn't know what's going
on in this box the only way they
communicate is through the interface
tunnel here so that is to say they are
independent so when we are working with
applications
so let's way to say we have another box
here
and then we have an interface between
these two well now we can basically
change stuff within the application and
it's not going to affect these other two
layers we could change something within
the operating system and it's not
necessarily going to ruin these two
layers you can say they're independent
because you can alter them so for
example I can update my Windows 7
computer and give it new features or
whatever Microsoft downloads for me at
that specific time and then all my
application should still work and all my
Hardware still works the only thing that
may change is the interface so if
something doesn't work this interface
may might have been destroyed or not
working properly to allow them to
communicate but by changing this layer
since it's independent I could change it
and now I have a red box for example
well guess what all these box boxes are
still black and the interface is still
exist the only thing different now is my
operating system so that is to say these
boxes within the layer are independent
this system of layering is also useful
for computer repair and system design
because it allows us to figure out
what's wrong with the system
it can either be part of the hardware is
something wrong with the hardware do I
need to replace a processor which I mean
pulling up do I need to replace a hard
drive do I need to replace a video card
or as a part of the operating system is
something wrong with the system files do
I need to reinstall the operating system
or is something wrong with the
application I'm using is there a bug do
I need to download a software patch this
can help for that as well as system
design because we can break up these
specific groups which allows us to
weaken if we need to work on the
operating system we can ignore the
hardware for a minute we can ignore the
application layer and we can just
explode or enlarge
the the operating system so easy and we
can see all the different things that
the operating system has to do for the
specific application so the operating
system does quite a lot so within the
application the operation within the
operating system we have the user
interface so that is how we interact
with the computer whether if it's a
graphical user interface or you may see
GUI or if it's a text so it can be a
command-line interface but basically
this is how we communicate with the
operating system it so our visual are as
a user we can use an application which
then communicates to the operating
system through the user interface which
can then ask a man can affect the file
system which is the files on our
computer this this system allows us to
open up edit or save or delete any files
within our system so we can also have
device management so this is going to
communicate our peripherals which
peripheral is I'll get to that in a
second peripheral is something you
connect to a computer such as a printer
a monitor a mouse a keyboard and so
forth these are all known as peripherals
I don't have to spell it but I'll give a
shot pri pH something like that don't
take that for it I'm just just in case
you couldn't understand what I was
saying peripheral and then there's also
like we could have the process
management so this is going to allow us
to run multiple processes which
otherwise would be impossible without
the operating system so this I mean
unless what programming process manage
moments so this is going to process the
the processes and process the processes
and it's going to allow us to run
programs on our computer to have a
memory management which this is going to
allow certain programs to use memory so
if we have multiple programs it can
share the memory within the operating
system so this one gets a little and
then this one gets a little bit also
doesn't allow one application to
override another applications memory in
certain situations so we have memory
management we could also have
communication management which allows us
to communicate with other commute
computers so if both operating systems
have a means to communicate then that
can be done through the operating system
so these are just some examples of
things that are on the operating system
and if we didn't have an operating
system we would have to figure out how
to do that within the application
there's a couple problems with that
because obviously we'd have to change
which hardware we're talking and also it
would get a lot of redundant information
because if every single program had to
do this it would be a lot of extra
content for each program in order for to
run so the location of the operating
system in the layers so we have the user
the application the operating system and
the hardware well the application has to
go through the operating system in order
to get to the hardware through the
appropriate interfaces
so if we have something such as saving a
file or deleting a file we can store
that on the operating system and it's in
the perfect location because we use the
operating system to contact the hardware
Riley than having this kind of stuff
stored within the application it's great
to have it within the hardware so when
you have a program and you can go to
like file save well that's the user
interface so annoying
interface and this is going to do all
this stuff within the operating system
without necessarily telling us every
single thing it does and that's another
example of abstraction so just by
clicking save or something a lot of
stuff is going to be done a complex
system but all we had to do was click
one button by the user interface so
those are some more examples so there
are many types of operating systems many
of you have probably heard of so for
example we have the Mac operating system
this is an example of a proprietary
operating system basically all of the
Mac operating systems run on a Apple
computer and they are not open-source or
anything we also can have like for
example Linux which is said to be
open-source this is an example of an
open-source operating system which
displays its code publicly for people to
edit and improve then we have like the
Windows series so like Windows 95 or 98
or 2000 and Windows 8 and guys I don't
understand what why did they go from
Windows 2000 all the way down to Windows
7
that's like a downgrade of nineteen
thousand nine hundred ninety three so I
don't under I never understood that but
whatever Microsoft yeah those are just
examples Microsoft is sorta in the
middle as in you can run Windows
computer windows operating systems on
multiple manufacturers computers so for
example Dell novo or Compaq or any any
other computer brands Andy and so forth
so but it's not open source so that
those are some examples of operating
systems that's pretty much all I have to
say about operating systems I'm going to
do a quick review and so if you guys
don't want to watch the review that's
cool cool with that so thank you for
watching be sure to subscribe and I'll
see you soon but if you're going to stay
here's the review operating systems are
means to allow applications to
communicate to the hardware more easily
the operating systems has tons of
services which are basically miniature
programs I guess you can think of them
at you guys you can think of them as
that but basically services within the
applet within the operating system
include file systems management and so
forth which does certain things so when
we think of the operating system we
don't have to think of everything within
it we can just think of operating system
we don't have to think of the file
systems and the communication systems
and the memory allocation systems we can
just use what's called an abstraction to
make complex things very simple so the
operating system talks to the
application so for example an email
system and the operating system also
talks to the hardware using what's known
as an interface so these are here or
interfaces I can't write anymore and
that's what these are here interfaces
and then the application is used by the
user and you could say that's an
interface as well so the operating
system allows us to easily use the
hardware and you could say that the
operating system and the hardware
together
is what's known as a platform which
allows us or which allows app developers
to easily create content for computers
rather than having to worry about
specific hardware and so much other
garbage
so what we can do is we can think of a
layer within our layering system Lang
system just breaks it up into these
individual abstractions we can think of
these as unique and isolated boxes that
this box doesn't know what's going on in
this box this box doesn't know what's
going on in this box the only way they
communicate is through the interface so
that's that's pretty much that
and then so basically we can think of a
specific layer within our layering
system and we can enlarge that if we
wish and get rid of the abstraction and
think of the individual pieces within
that layer so let's say it's operating
system we can think about the filing
system or the memory system and so forth
like that but otherwise you don't have
to so that's something we can do with
that and there's an open source as well
as proprietary operating systems
what else did I talk about pretty sure
that's about it so I probably forgot
something but that's okay because you
can watch the entire video over again
awesome
so great thanks for watching if you want
to see some more stuff be sure to
subscribe to my youtube channel if you
have any questions please leave it in
the comments below please tell me if any
explanations are rough for what I need
to improve upon as well as how
appropriate I said this was a beginners
course if it was too difficult or too
easy let me know and I will try to get a
better rating system as I go so thank
you
