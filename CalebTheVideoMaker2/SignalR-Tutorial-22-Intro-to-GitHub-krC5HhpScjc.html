kind of going to be a continuation of
the last video I have a couple more
things I want to teach you guys about
git and that promise will be getting
back on track I'm not trying to distract
you guys this stuff just really
important to know so if you guys don't
already know about github it's a place
that you can store your repositories so
when you download get everything is on
your local machine right so there's no
central server for you to push your code
to when you make a commit it's just on
this machine but if you want to share
that code with other people you need a
centralized server to do that there's a
couple of different ways one of the ways
is using github so github you can store
open source projects for free or you can
pay a couple bucks for private
repositories I decided that I was gonna
put our code for this series on github
so you guys could access it from there
too so what you need to do if you want
to find the code is go to github.com
forward slash Caleb curry and then find
signal art tutorials that's the URL
right there now as you can see it will
basically say the files in the
repository and then the commit message
for those files you can see I made an
extra commit I deleted a space just for
fun so just so I can show you guys a
little bit of how this will benefit you
if you go to this page you can click
clone or download you can take this URL
and you can use the the fancy git
commands but that's out of the scope of
this video so I'm going to use source
tree once you're on source tree and
click clone slash new paste in that URL
pick a destination where you want that
file that repository to be give it a
bookmark title and click clone since I
already got on here obviously I'm gonna
skip that step now this allows you to
look at the source code go back in time
to different sections and everything
like that now one thing I want to point
out is there's this master here and then
there's this origin slash master
origin is a name for the central
repository on github so what that means
is
that master is my local copy of whatever
I'm working on so just to illustrate
this I will make a change I'm going to
add a line on here and then go back to
source tree and in the log and log slash
history there will be an uncommitted
changes here is where you can decide
what you want to commit into the
repository and what you want to keep so
over here you can see what changes I
made and obviously I really didn't make
any changes at all both these lines look
exactly the same but just for kicks I'm
going to commit this to the repository I
added that to the staging area and now
to make a commit you need to go to file
status and say whatever you want perfect
now I can commit that and what you'll
see is that there's this new
notification on the push which say and
basically our local changes are ahead of
the centralized server so you got master
in an Origin slash master so we can push
those to the centralized server to get
the centralized server up-to-date with
our local changes alright so I just
pushed and now if you go back to the web
browser to github do a refresh you can
see that the new changes are already
visible I added a blank line you can
just move along don't worry about that
that commit is not important so that's
all I got to say about git and github
for now I will be pushing new changes
here so that way you guys can always get
the newest versions of my code if
anything isn't working for any reason
check here and that will help you get
the the version that you need one last
thing before you go
if you're watching this in the future
and the repository is already completed
and you want to go back in time to where
I am now in this video series all you
have to do is is click on that commit
double click it it'll ask you if you
wanted to go into a detached head state
which is basically saying you're no
longer in the correct path of the
repository you're too far back you click
OK and then when you go to visual studio
it'll have those chain
there for you and you can look through
them follow along whatever you need to
do copy and paste you guys get the point
so hopefully this video is helpful
hopefully it'll help you keep up with
the code and yeah that's all I got to
say so I'll see you guys in the next
video thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
