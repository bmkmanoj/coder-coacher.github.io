fourth time recording this so I better
get it right so as a reminder my name is
Caleb from Caleb the video maker - we
just got done refactoring our signal our
code and now we're going to be adding
some new features so one thing I want to
talk about in this video
is what's known as method return types
so every single method has a return type
what's a return type well when you have
a method something that does something
it returns data the type of that data is
what's known as the return type so we
actually kind of have an example of this
here we have a method called announce
and the return type is void which
actually means nothing so we're actually
not returning anything but we could put
something else in here like int and
return an int so essentially if you
think of a method as this process where
you give it data it does something with
the data and then gives back data that
introduces the concept of returning data
because you can't give back data unless
you have a return what type of return
needs to be defined in c-sharp
that's because c-sharp is what's known
as a strongly typed language every
single piece of data has a type by the
way just to be technically correct there
was also a dynamic data type which kind
of breaks the rules which is how signal
are kind of works so if you look here if
you hover over this it says dynamic
that's the datatype of this so just kind
of giving you the exception to the rule
there before we dive into this I just
wanted to give you a friendly reminder
that I am still making commits to the
repository I'm not gonna show you guys
every single time I make a commit
because it's redundant but every time we
complete a section I'll be pushing it to
the repository so if you're following
along you'll want to do the same thing
and that'll just be easier for me having
these steps and also for you guys who
download the repository just may have
more common check points but that's
enough forget let's get back to actually
making the code so
yeah let's do that I have this idea of
what I want to do I want to create a
method that returns the date time of the
server so what is a date time it's the
combination of a date and a time and we
can get the current date time of the
server and send that to the client I
just think it'll be cool just to be able
to request from the server the current
date time there's a couple of different
ways we can do this here's one we could
create a method essentially and say
public void get server date time and
then within the method we could say
clients dot caller that is another thing
that is very important to know so up
here we say clients to all that
rebroadcast it to everybody but if you
just want to broadcast it to the person
who invoke this method then you can just
use the caller keyword so then you could
say the name of a method here that's on
the client side like display date/time
in order to do this we're going to have
to call this method from the client and
then create a method on the client side
that does something with the data but I
think there's an easier way to do this
and which one you prefer that's totally
up to you I'm gonna go over the other
way which is using a return type so
instead of doing this we can just delete
that and what we can do is we can return
the data type date/time now how do we
actually go about getting the current
date time it's very simple it's
date/time dot now now as a property of
the date/time class okay so we have an
error what is it
can you guess not all code paths return
a value so we are essentially just
saying date/time now but we're not doing
anything with that data what we need is
a return statement
so we just add return and now we have a
valid c-sharp method
and I'm just gonna format this a little
more c-sharp like how do we actually do
anything with this on the client-side
that's the question
what I want to do is after you connect I
want it to automatically display the
server time on the clients page
immediately so we're gonna do it
probably right here so after we're
connected so we do is we just you know
the normal my hub server dots get server
date/time please also remember these
standards of capitalization in c-sharp
versus JavaScript JavaScript we're using
camel casing c-sharp we're using pascal
casing so we got so far it's pretty good
but this is not enough to make it work
in fact we have to follow that promise
pattern that we used when we connected
so if you look at this we start a
connection and when that connection is
done we do something and if it fails we
do something that's the pattern that we
need to follow that's all we're going to
be doing in this video hopefully I was
helpful in the next video we'll be doing
the promise pattern and we'll make a
what do we want it to do if it's success
and what do we want it to do if it fails
so hopefully you guys will enjoy that
and I'll see you then thanks for
