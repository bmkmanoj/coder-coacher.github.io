gonna be teaching you how to dance and
part it by that I mean I'm gonna teach
you about strings so I believe this is
your eighth PHP tutorial very good very
good so let's get started so what's a
string a string is sort of like what it
sounds it's a string of characters
what's a character well that could be a
letter a number a punctuation mark
anything like that so hey that contains
three characters H E and Y all three of
these are a string we know it's a string
because I just put quotation marks on
each side so this right here is an
example of a string so this is what's
known as a data type and I don't really
know if there's a space here or not I
might there might be a space there but
yeah that's a data type so in the last
video when we assigned values to these
variables we were like you know I'm
saying we were all like oh let's assign
this back well this is this thing right
here this is a string so you're using
strings before even explained them holy
cow so yeah that's an example of a
string it says hey girl
with the space here that's an X so that
is another example of how we can use
strings all right now let's go in a
little little more detail when we define
these strings
say we're assigning a value to X it
could be could be
subscribe please
or it could be subscribe and you'd say
oh those are the same but if you look
closely one has double quotes one has
single quotes can you guys see that can
you guys can you see it can you hit I
think you can I think you can so those
are different I mean we're in this case
they're both going to produce the same
result
although double quotes and single quotes
are different and we will be getting
into the difference between them and
either the next video or a very soon
upcoming video so let's talk about why
having two different types of quotation
marks might be useful
what if our string says your conjunction
of you are well if you look here there
is a single quote so if we were quoting
this with the single quotes we would put
one here and here and then PHP is going
to look oh this is this this one right
here so we start a string we keep going
we keep going oh we stop the string
because that is how PHP views it it
closes on between the two types of the
two single quotation marks so now we
have you as a string and then we have
our E which it's not going to be
understood so there's going to be some
sort of error this is bad so to fix this
what we can do is use double quotes on
the outside so if our string is your we
can put two double quotes here now PHP
is going to see the first one and it's
going to look for another one so it'll
skip the single quote
find the second one and bam now we have
a complete string that was not messed up
and ruined our entire program the same
can work the other way so if you have oh
let's go
hey well we would have to enclose this
within quotes or it's not a proper
string so if we did it with double
quotes
well here's know this is going to cause
a problem because it's going to do the
same thing it did the first time you see
what I'm saying so now we can use the
opposite quotes which would be the
single quotes and I could close it here
so now the single quote goes all the way
to this one and close this string so
that's great how you can switch between
the two for what's needed now sometimes
that's not going to work out and you are
going to have to use one type of quote
so let's I mean if I want to show you
something useful you can do so if if R
says she said hey well we open the quote
let me close it with double quotes this
is going to cause a problem like I said
earlier but we can do something that's
called escaping and to do this we put a
backslash before the two other quotes so
now it looks kind of funny and that's
not how it's going to appear to the user
it's going to appear as oops
she said hey just like that so using the
escaping techniques tells PHP not to pay
attention
this one and this one that's why I put
that backslash there so that is another
very useful tool with strings now one
more thing I would mention this a little
bit in the last video although I think I
should have trusted a little bit more
here what goes within the quotes can be
letters numbers and certain types of
quotation so we could have hey we could
have 23 we could have a date we have a
January 31st 2014 and we could also have
we could have an empty string so you got
to pay attention to this this right here
it's data type is not date this data
type is string makes sense
hopefully it's it's contained within a
string this right here it's data type is
not a number it is again any strength
because it is enclosed within these
quotation marks in this situation this
is going to be evaluated as a string now
you can do some funky programming to
allow you to use different data types as
another data type so for example I could
use a number as a string and vice versa
and so forth so I'm just making sure you
understand that just because it has a
number in it does not make it a number
the same thing for the other way if it's
just this or this or this that is a
number that's not a string that's
because it is not quoted with an
quotation mark
that is how we signify a string if you
want to know if you want PHP to know
it's a string
what quotation marks on it if you want
it to think it's a number
don't put quotation marks on it another
thing yeah I mean that's actually all
that I had to say so yeah thank you for
watching and I will see you in the next
video be sure to subscribe and thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
