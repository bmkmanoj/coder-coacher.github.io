stored procedures and functions series
in this video were kind of doing a part
two to creating stored procedures to
begin we had to change what was known as
the delimiter that's what separates
statements in MySQL the default is a
semicolon to change that all we have to
do is say delimiter and then you just
say what you want the new delimiter to
be so we'll go and do forward slashes
and then eventually you're going to have
to change this back but before you do
that you okay before you do that you're
going to want to start your procedure so
to do that you use the create procedure
command and then you give it a name and
then you just put parentheses so this is
where later you will give it parameters
but for now we'll just keep it at that
and then you say begin that is how you
start the definition of a stored
procedure we have a stored procedure
with the name friends and it takes no
parameters and we can use the semicolon
within the definition because we use
this delimiter here that way the
semicolon can be passed to the server
rather than being interpreted by MySQL
the next part is what I mentioned in the
last video which is the end keyword
followed by your new delimiter
so basically we're passing the end
command and then we're ending that
statement finally we can change the
delimiter back to the semicolon perfect
you just made a sweet procedure that
there's absolutely nothing but this is
the shell of what your procedure is
going to be earlier when I drew that box
that represented a procedure that was
this so think of this as a giant box and
now we are exploring the innards of this
box object thing now where do you
actually put your code well I'm assuming
you guys can realize that the code goes
right here so you can put whatever the
heck you want right here and that's
what's going to run when you run this
procedure
so since we're having this procedure
called friends we'll just say like
everything from friends so let's just
say we have a friend stable and that's
what its gonna do kind of ran out of
room there but it's a good so this is a
procedure that is going to return
everything from the friends table
another thing I wanted to mention is
that this delimiter thing that's only
going to be applicable for some
situations for example if you're using
the MySQL command line client you're
going to need to use this but if you're
using something like PHP myadmin or this
SQL fiddle tool I've been using there is
a different way you need to tell it that
we're using a different delimiter and
we'll get into that when we're starting
to create some stored procedures and
it'll it'll make sense when the time
comes but just thought I thought I'd let
you guys know if you're typing this
stuff in in my own PHP myadmin for
example and you're getting errors that's
probably why now that you have this
procedure created how do you go about
actually using it it's very simple you
use the call command call friends I bet
you none will answer kidding this is
much simpler though than actually doing
whatever the procedure code is even
though our procedure was so simple and I
only had one line of code this is still
much shorter than writing out the code
yourself you can see this only uses
about two words and this uses for kind
of so if you're working with a team and
the team doesn't exactly have lots of
SQL experience and you want them to be
able to write SQL that's exactly what
you want all you got to do is create a
procedure and then they can just call it
and they don't have to worry about
writing out the code like this and that
is a perfect exit to introduce the next
video so I will see you guys then be
