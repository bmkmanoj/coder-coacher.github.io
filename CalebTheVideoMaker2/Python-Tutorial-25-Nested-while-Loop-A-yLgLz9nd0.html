to talk about nested while loops so just
like the if statement we can nest a
while loop so in the previous video I
don't still have the script but what we
did was we had an if statement and we
said something like if score is greater
than 100 or something there's less than
100 then we said something and then we
had a second if within this if and the
only way this one would be tested is if
this one ran is true will the wile
nested loop works kind of the same way
so here let me clear this out and we'll
create a while first let's create a
score and let's assign it our score is 0
and let's create money 10 now let's
create a while loop while score is less
than 10 sorry didn't mean to press ENTER
there print
Hey Dude your score is too low and then
we can have a second while within this
so while money is greater than two nine
greater let's go greater than or equal
to ten so that way we have their correct
numbers to make things more clear print
and your work my typing skills here you
need Momo neighs all right so now before
we execute this always always always
check to see if you're going to have an
infinite loop because that will
completely utterly destroy our program
see score is currently set to zero and
then we have it to where it's going to
print hey dude your scores too low and
it's basically just going to print that
over and over and over again because we
don't have anything to change that
so let's just for simplicity sake give
them a free point score will score plus
one and if you don't understand how this
works check out my video over the while
loop then we have a nested while within
our first while that means this one is
only going to be tested if this one test
as true so if score is less than ten it
will do all of this and then proceed to
the second while same for this we need
to have a
money is I would say money we will
subtract money so let's say money is
assign the value money minus one so now
the way this while loop works as score
goes up money is going to go down I'm
sure there's other ways we could do this
but this is just for illustration sake
of a nested while loop so let's see what
happens when we try this out hopefully I
didn't make any mistakes okay so let's
let's see here I says hey dude your
score is too low so the first time hey
dude your score is too low and then
score equals score or is assigned score
plus one so score is zero and then while
money is greater than or equal to ten
you need Moe monies and money minus one
so the first time through it tested it
and it said Oh your score is too low so
let's increase that one and then Oh your
money is greater than or equal to ten
let's subtract that to nine right here
that's what this line did now you don't
have to worry about this anymore because
it's no longer greater than or equal to
so now it stays at nine you see what I'm
saying and the other one continues to go
on until it is greater than ten so now
your score is going to be eleven I
believe so let's write our ten so let's
see Wow okay so if score okay so score
would have to be less than 10 so 10
would work perfectly fine so that's an
example of an if statement or a while a
nested while loop so we could do
something else such as if while is
greater than or equal to 10 you need
more monies and then we don't have to do
anything so it will just say it so
that's just another thing we could do
we're gonna have ifs within while loops
and that's just the basics I know this
example wasn't exactly super practical
but I just wanted to show you that it is
possible so in the next video we will be
talking about nested for-loops
