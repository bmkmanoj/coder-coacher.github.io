tutorial so in this video I wanted to
talk a little bit more about colors as
you can see you can type in color names
to change the colors of Conte and if you
don't really know where what I'm talking
about
you missed the last few videos go back
in the series watch a few videos back
starting at the CSS part video like 20 I
think and it'll make sense but this is
not really the best way to define colors
sometimes sometimes it's really cool to
use RGB values so what does RGB mean
well let me just type out some notes
here RGB stands for red green blue so
why what it like what does that even
mean well you can actually develop
recreate all of what the colors you
could possibly think of mixing these
three colors together so if you mix red
and green you get purple if you mix blue
and green you get yellow so you know
what I'm saying you just mix the colors
and you get certain colors so you can
get pretty much anything you like just
by mixing these colors together so to
declare a red green blue value you go
like this and then you put zero zero
zero zero zero zero and separate them
with commas so that is black so zero red
0 green zero blue you can also just put
one zero I think yep and in fact I just
now that I think about it you could just
delete the whole thing it'd still be
black so even if I'm doing it wrong it's
still going but anyways yeah let's go
20500 and you can see I don't know if
you can tell or not but the color
changes the slightest bit so if I go
fifty and see it turns a little bit more
red
what if I go 100 oh now it's definitely
starting look read the various highest
value is 255 so that is absolute red so
when we type in color equals red that's
the equivalent of saying color RG RGB
255 0 0 it's it's the same thing now you
may be wondering why would you use RGB
when you can just type in the names well
when you're working with projects to
develop websites you may have exact
color schemes so the color scheme may be
164 red 32 green and 48 blue and you
want to follow that exactly rather than
getting a cut anumber that is color that
as close as possible to that you can get
that exact color that will really make
the website look nice all right so the
values go up to 255 very lowest is 0 so
that means 0 equals black or nothing I
should say maybe nothing 205 equals 4 so
we're at 0 0 0 that means all black
because there's no red no green and no
blue we can crank up the blue 255 and I
get really bright blue if we add green
into that 255 we get a mix of green and
blue get like the cyan color I guess
then if you add the 255 on the red
surprise surprise it actually turns
white so white is every color mixed
together
that's about obviously wrong so black is
no colors mixed together
all right so that's the basis of red
green and blue values now when we go on
with we go back to that website we're at
that my reference would go to w3 schools
colors not HTML colors wrong CSS colors
CSS color names this is going to give us
sorry wrong page
CSS colors this will give us a color as
well as a hexadecimal color I mean a
hexadecimal which we'll get into that in
next video and the red green and blue
value all right so here are examples and
then it shows a huge different variety
of colors in this chart so you need to
find a similar color to something you
can find these colors like this one and
if it's just a little off you can modify
it a little bit these are an exid s imil
but i mean you can find the same charge
and charts in RGB if you just google
search it and so forth so that's one way
to tell color so so far we know how to
tell colors by the color name and an RGB
value and the next bit we will learn how
to understand hexadecimal what this is
actually a good skill for any type of
computer development not just for web
development because hexadecimals are
used in a lot so the next video is going
to be a little more mathematical and
technical and stuff but it won't be too
bad I'll guide you through it
so hopefully I was able to help you some
in this video and there the rest of this
series obviously just let me know what
you think in the comments be sure to
