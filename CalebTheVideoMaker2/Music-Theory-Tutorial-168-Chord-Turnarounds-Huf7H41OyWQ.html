video I will be talking about what's
known as a turnaround or a turn back
alright so and the last thing we talked
about Cadence's these are very similar
to Cadence's excuse me
so the difference is this is from
section to section a cadence will be
used to end a an entire song or if your
song has like three parts you may use it
to end each individual part but if we're
going from let's say the verse to the
verse to then um we want might do
something such as a turnaround these are
extremely popular in jazz just just
throwing that out there
alright so typically it's a it's a
pattern of courts chords on one and
three for like two measures usually four
chords and it will help transition from
Part A to Part B or something like that
so for example to add the extra tension
and allow the movement to be pushed
forward by resolving it will often use
chords that are not diatonic if you
remember diatonic means within the scale
so within a scale would be major minor
minor major major minor diminished so
that means a tonic is major second minor
thirds minor fourths major fifth is
major sixth is minor seventh is
diminished will often use these
chromatic chords such as a major second
so let's say we're in the key of G that
would be an A rather than an a minor so
it confuses people it doesn't sound
quite normal it doesn't always sound bad
it just doesn't sound does it sound
diatonic like normal chords which then
when it goes back to the typical stuff
it propels the song forward that's
basically how I turn around works
so let's say we're in the scale of G and
instead of playing a minor second we
could have a major second instead of
playing a diminished seventh we can play
a flat major seven so let's say we're
the scale of G we at g a b c d e F sharp
and G so the second would be a so they'd
have a rather than a minor seventh would
be F sharp so we flat it we get F
typically be diminished but now we have
F major where we would normally have F
sharp diminished so that's an example of
how you would alter these chords to give
us new chromatic embellished chords or
whatever you want to say to make things
fancy so here are some common
turnarounds and just to make make it
real let's use the key of G so we start
on the tonic and then we go to the
fourth which would be G a B C it's good
C now go to the third which would be C B
minor then we go to the second which
would be a minor so that's a common
chord turnaround another one would be G
to the sixth which would be D which
would be e minor to the second which
would be a minor to the fifth which
would be D another one for the third one
would be starting on the third which
which is weird we usually don't start on
the third that's why it confuses so we
have G a B so we start on B minor then
we go to the sixth major which would
give us G a B C D E E
go to the second which would be a minor
and then to the fifth which would be D
so that's another one and then the last
one we get G minor sixth g a b c d e so
i'd i've done it like multiple times i
keep forgetting
just for practice a minor than to the
flatted seventh of this one would be
this is a flatted yes flatted seventh so
that would be g and your shortcut
instead of going G a B but we can just
go back one so it'd be the note before G
which would be F so we would have F it's
originally F sharp diminished well now
we're going to have F sharp minor
because it's a lower case and then we
flat it so we get F minor so two F minor
back to the v which is d so here are
these two four examples of chord
turnarounds and how I figured them out
so yeah that's pretty much all I have to
say with turnarounds or turn backs
whatever you want to call them and next
video we'll be talking about something
new so please be sure to subscribe to my
channel means a lot and I follow might
follow my Twitter and Facebook if you
wish and I will see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
