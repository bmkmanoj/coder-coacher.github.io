requesting the information HTML is sent
to it they can view it edit it if they
want I mean it's not going to affect
your actual page but they can edit it on
their local machine but the PHP they
can't touch it's secret and it's only
available on the server so PHP PHP one
second all right
so PHP is a server-side scripting
language we also have Ruby on Rails
there's some others which I'm not going
to go into all of them you can use
Python and some of you can use a lot of
stuff for server-side scripting or
programming whatever you want to call it
so why is a server-side scripting
language good well obviously the person
who views your website can't get the
code so you can have more sensitive
information in there and also they can't
steal all of your code by copying it for
an example to HTML they can copy a lot
of times you can take a web page and you
can copy the HTML and you can create an
exact replica that's often how people
create fake websites such as rather than
typing in Caleb curry com you type in
Caleb CARICOM and it brings up to a page
that looks exactly the same and you sign
in and you put your credit card
information in for you're buying
something it doesn't really matter well
you weren't actually on the right
website but it looked the same and now
they have your information where they
can hack you with so they can do that
with HTML with server-side scripting
language they're not going to be able to
copy code and they're not going to have
access to the exact code
all right so uh what else well you can
connect to a database a database I guess
I can draw this too
a database is also on the server I'm
just gonna draw an arrow at that there's
no room it's also on the server and this
is where it can store specific
information such as user login
information account the amount of money
you have on an account they can have
transactions to transfer money from one
account so basically accounts and a lot
of information can be stored on a
database such as p.m. MySQL for example
and that can be stored on the date of
the on the server as well that's also a
server-side thing although the content
can be sent to the client using a PHP
script so for example
we have a scooter we have a users table
and we have the first user Caleb right
with PHP we could say take that name and
then we're going to echo it or print it
into HTML within a paragraph tag for
example and so forth and then that will
be sent to the client who then sees
Caleb as the username for example that's
just an example so you can access
database information with a PHP script
which can then send that to the client
as HTML and so forth so that's two main
uses that's those are the big uses for
PHP that's what we would be using a
fourth I'm sorry my nose itches so I'm
going to go through some examples of why
PHP well it's it's great with
integration with HTML so for example you
can you can echo or print that echo is a
command that sends stuff to the client
for them to view so anything with an
echo command becomes viewable by the
client so you can echo HTML so within
your PHP script you can send HTML that
was developed through PHP same thing
with HTML you can have PHP scripts
within the HTML which won't be visible
by the
a client so that's one thing another
thing to do is uh with great integration
you can build website templates so often
on a website you will have a consistent
top bar that says home full rung
questions and answers videos lessons and
so forth well that is often created in
HTML you know but then when you go to a
different page it still stays there well
if you are working with strictly HTML
and no PHP for example you would have to
program that on each page and then if
you want to create an update to the
title to the links bar you're going to
have to go through your entire website
and edit every single page so it has a
consistent top bar or a footer or
sidebar or anything like that all right
so with PHP you can create one file
named header dot PHP or whatever and
then a footer or sidebar usually you'll
have a header and a footer which often
includes a sidebar actually and then you
can include that file within every
single HTML page so you sort of get like
a a template so you could say just this
white board is the template and it
automatically comes with a bar at the
top as well as a search bar and so forth
and what and social links on the side
such as Facebook and so forth and a
footer right and then right here you
could say is the content well you can
create new pages you could say like page
one and then you can make a new page
page two by the way if you guys haven't
figured this out yet this is for like
absolute beginners so if you're pro PHP
website developer this video is not
going to be much use to you and I don't
need any comments saying why your
programming language is better and more
superior and all that crap
so yeah that's an example of something
to do you can create templates so then
when you update your website you can
change you can change one of these bars
to add another one and then it's going
to update on every single page within
your website so that's another use of
PHP another thing you can do is as I
mentioned earlier you can access
database information and with this you
can create registrations you can create
registration pages such as logins where
you can sign up for a website and then
you can log in and reach content that
was only accessible for your website for
example if I sign in to my Twitter
account all of my tweets are only
accessible like the like deleting them
and so forth and updating new that's
only accessible through my account to my
specific page or for YouTube</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
