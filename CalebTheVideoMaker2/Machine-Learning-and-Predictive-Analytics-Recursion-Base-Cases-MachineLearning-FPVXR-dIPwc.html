video part 2 this video we are going to
be talking about what's known as the
base case and you can have multiple base
cases but we're gonna start with one the
base case is essentially when the
recursion stops for good
so no more calling any other recursion
so let's visualize this we start with
the big call to the function which calls
a smaller call which small is a which is
small which calls a smaller call which
calls the smallest one possible this one
needs to then finish and go back up the
call stack and then finally go out of
the function so it's kind of weird
thinking about it like going down and
then back up what it is essential
because when you call a function that
previous location in code where you were
gets stored so think about this location
being stored and then this location
being stored and then this location
being stored well then you need to go
back and go to those previous locations
until you get back to the code that
called this echo to begin with so
wherever the echo function was called
and some data was passed in such as you
know we could say hey and let's say we
sent it in at a hundred and ten decibels
there's passed that data in right there
well this location wherever this code
was called we need to make sure we
return to that correct location okay
enough about the returns let's talk
about actually ending this recursion in
this situation it's an infinite
recursion because we're going to call
echo pass in originally we had 110 so
we're gonna pass in 100 that's going to
shout the message at a hundred decimals
then we're going to call echo with 90
and then echo with 80 70 60 50 40 30 20
10 and then 0 okay so what happens when
we hit zero shout message and we're
gonna pass in 0 so you're gonna shout it
with zero volume and then we're going
pasen message 0-10 or we're gonna pass
in negative 10 and then negative 20
negative 30 negative 40 and it's going
to just keep on going until the loudness
is infinitely small well actually you're
going to keep it running until you run
out of stack space because you have to
remember these locations and you're
going to get a stack overflow exception
so we need a condition to stop the
calling of a smaller version and that's
at the smallest piece so you can think
of the smallest volume that is allowed
so to do that we just need to add a line
about right here
that goes something like this if
loudness is less than one return and
that's going to trigger traversing back
up the call stack so if we take this
code and put it right here before the
shout it'll only get to this shout if
loudness is greater than zero that means
we can't have the issue where we're
calling shout with negative numbers and
we'll never get to this return echo
loudness minus ten because we already
have hit a return for that function call
so that is the base case now the id3
algorithm which is what we're going to
talk about next I promise you next video
id3 algorithm this is actually going to
have three base cases
so the id3 algorithm is much more
complex than this simple example here so
that is a perfect example of recursion
and base cases in the next video we're
going to move on to the id3 algorithm so
please be sure to check it out please oh
please do not forget to subscribe to
this channel it helps me out
tremendously thank you and just please
do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
