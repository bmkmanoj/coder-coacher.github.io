because we just finished those aggregate
functions and we get to move on to
something new so now we're going to be
talking about comparison functions I
know you're thinking yeah I'm thinking
that too but it's okay because we're
almost done with functions and these
ones are actually pretty cool basically
these will compare multiple values
either rows or given or given values
that you submit into the function so
some of these are greatest and least
here's two of them that's we capital but
here's um
what these will do is let's say you give
it a value 63 42 11 it's going to give
you either the greatest one or the least
one and it doesn't have to be in this or
you can be like 1163 so if you have a
list of values and you know which one's
the greatest you can submit it within a
greatest function and you can find
multiple uses for this but basically
it's just used to compare multiple
values you can also use this for string
value such if we have the string fat and
then we have the letter C it's going to
put this one first I think because C
becomes comes before sorry B comes
before C so we can use these four
strings and it just depends on the
letters within the string and how they
compare them here's a function what you
can do with this is you can put a bunch
of values in there or anything like that
and what it will do is it will return
the first non null value the reason for
this is if you need a spike let's for
example you need a specific amount of
data you don't want to have the null
values you can put them within this and
it will ignore this so if you need like
six and you put in six values it can get
rid of and you need if you need six
values you can use this to get rid of
all the extra
Knowle crap and so on so uh there's a
lot of uses for this well basically it's
going to give you back the non null
value that comes first and you can use
this multiple times
there's also another function in I think
I talked about this a little bit before
and like this so basically we can say if
a value is within this set so if it is
it'll return true if it's not gonna
return false that is very similar to the
comparison operator just in which we put
at the end of a select statement what
this will do is it will test a given
value within a function and if it is
null it will return zero my dogs never
stop barking if it's not an old it'll
return one for example I can test
something within this say is for bank
system we can say Caleb's money this is
just an example money versus ah that one
chick Delilah
you know chick you ate at that
restaurant Delilah all that money so
well this can do is I could say
Caleb's money is greater than Delilah's
money as a greater than sign which is a
comparison operator now are into
comparison functions now if it is true
better return one if it's false it
returns zero so this is the stupid
example but you can use this to compare
entries in your database or just data
that you need to compare yourself we can
actually write if no so IIF this is not
a comparison function this is a control
flow function as it is called this will
basically test things and do things
based on your the test results I will be
getting into some more of these in the
next videos but for this example it can
be like this we give it a value here and
if it's null
it'll do this so we can say like for its
greater than five and then here I can
say subscribe to my YouTube channel
YouTube
I don't know I said Channel
so I can say if if null for less than 4
is greater than 5 which will return 0
because that's false you have to
subscribe to my youtube channel
yes that's just a stupid example I'm
sorry yeah there's a couple more of
these I'll be speaking of in the next
video so if you like if statements and
garbage I will see you in the next video
so subscribe and I did it again
da da brought black line so yeah no more
hands please subscribe like this video
and I will see you in the next one my
name is Caleb and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
