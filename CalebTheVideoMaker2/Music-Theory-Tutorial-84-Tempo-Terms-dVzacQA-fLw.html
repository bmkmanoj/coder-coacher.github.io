video I think I'll talk about temple
there's words from different countries
like I don't know maybe they're Italian
I can't remember that describe how fast
the song is to play it to be played and
I'll be going over some of those in this
video
alright here's a couple of the terms for
the speeds
this here is beats per minute now this
would be forty to sixty beats per minute
this stands for slow and broad is what
this means it's pronounced Largo so our
first one I believe it's pronounced
Largo
they've been slow and broad at forty to
sixty beats per minute the next one I
think it's pronounced lento or like oh
shoot I went on I think it means slow at
61 to 66 some people will say 60 to 66
but since I think that one's 260 I think
this one should start sixty-one but I
don't know
the next one I think is Adagio which
means at ease at 66 276 and Dante is
walking speed at 77 to 108 beats per
minute I'm not trying to sound like a
reference but these are just terms you
should know and this just represents the
tabla metronome markings at the
beginning of the song such as quarter
note equals 108 which will be and Dante
at walking speed so yeah if you don't
know how fast people walk get a
metronome out set it for 77 to 108
somewhere between there and maybe it'll
be right so I'm gonna write the other
ones now here are some more we have
moderato which is 109 to 120 beats per
minute
I think this is pronounced and they grow
at 121 to 168 Bristow is 169 to 200 and
I think this is vivace or Vives I think
watching
I don't know should probably learn these
things shouldn't that 201 to 208 so
moderato Allegra presto vivace and here
are the tempo markings this one means
moderate speed I believe I'm not sure
where I get that though just not sure
where I get modder
moderate speed from moderato then we
have Allegro which is fast presto is
very fast vivace is fast and lively so
that's the definitions of these words
and you may see these at the tops of
songs to either allow a broader range of
tempos or to give the feel of the song
for example fat for example fast and
lively rather than just like a fast so
yeah I just dropped my marker for like
the fifth hundred time fifth hundred
fifth time five hundred so that's all I
have to say for this quick video in the
next video I'll be going over some more
cool terms and maybe something else I
have no clue anyways thanks for watching
and I'll see you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
