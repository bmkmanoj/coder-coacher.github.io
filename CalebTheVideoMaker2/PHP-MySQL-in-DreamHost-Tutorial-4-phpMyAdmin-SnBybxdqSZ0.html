maker to this series is about installing
PHP and MySQL in DreamHost
so where did we leave off well in the
last videos we created a database we set
up a domain and we learned about File
Transfer Protocol but we actually still
have to create a table for our database
so if we go to goodies MySQL databases
we can see that we have some stuff in
here already we have one database and
how do we actually go in here to you
know create stuff well we use a tool
called PHP my admin' which is a very
popular tool that is used to manage your
data inside of a database the very nice
tool so it's it's a good thing to learn
so to access that you click this link
right here PHP myadmin
now a couple of videos ago when we set
up this database I told you there was a
bunch of important stuff you need to
remember well this is where that stuff
comes in useful and it will come in
useful later too
so you need to put in your user name for
your database and your password and then
when you're ready click go so this is
PHP myadmin if you've never seen it
before
trust me it's not that confusing all you
got to do is click databases up here
this will show you the databases you
have already and we have this PHP MySQL
tutorial 1 which that is the database we
created in the other video and you can
see here we can create a table here by
naming it and giving it a number of
columns but I prefer to do everything
the old-fashioned way so we're going to
actually write some SQL commands here so
I'm going to type out the command and
then I'll explain it to you guys all
right so here's what we want we're going
to create a table named tutorials and
it's gonna have two columns one is the
ID and the other one is the title now
the ID is just an automatically
generated number that is just for the
databases use that's why it's labeled as
the primary key down here the title is
something we're going to put in so we
give that varchar' so that means we can
use anywhere from 0 to 100 characters to
give the tutorial a title
so let's see if it works let's click go
awesome it worked so how do we actually
input data into this table well let's
run another command we want to insert
into tutorials table into the title
column and we're going to put these as
four rows notice how we don't have to
put the primary key that's done
automatically so let's run this and see
if it works great it worked so how do we
know it worked besides that it said it
worked
you can run another SQL command and the
command is really simple select
everything from tutorials so here's our
data and we have the ID and the title
great so that's an introduction to PHP
myadmin
hopefully that was helpful for you guys
now that you have data in PHP myadmin we
can start working in PHP to try to get
that data displayed on a web page thanks
and I'll see you guys in the next video
welcome back to Caleb the video maker -
this is the series of installing MySQL
and PHP on DreamHost
so where are we exactly we are in FTP
through FileZilla and we're connected to
our website as you can see I'm actually
using the domain name PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
