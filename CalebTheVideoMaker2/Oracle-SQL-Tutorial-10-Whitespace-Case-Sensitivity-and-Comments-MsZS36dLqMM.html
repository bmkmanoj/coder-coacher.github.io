I'm going to be breaking down this
statement a little bit just to kind of
explain some of the rules when we write
queries so that way you guys can
intuitively know what to do with like
this capitalization and all of that
stuff so the first thing I wanted to
point out is white space so here's an
example of white space it's a space you
need to know that Oracle is not
whitespace sensitive what that means is
we can literally just sprinkle white
space basically wherever we want and
things are still going to work the way
we want so for example if I'm like hey
this looks stupid
let's put like 40 spaces here you're
welcome to do that and just to prove to
you that I'm not lying
let's run this thing and see how it
works and you can see outputs the same
exact thing now there's one gotcha to
this and that's when it comes to strings
so you see here we have a string of
hello world and anytime we have a string
we're surrounded by these single quotes
Oracle does care about whitespace so
right here I have a space if I have two
spaces here it's going to change the
response from Oracle let's run it and
you can see here it actually outputs an
extra space so spaces inside of strings
can change the output so you need to be
aware of that
the other thing that you need to know is
that you can't separate keywords so this
is a keyword right and you can put as
many spaces after it and before as you
like but you can't put spaces between it
or no longer remains a keyword and then
you're not going to be able to run your
script boom
error all right so let's put this all
back out was there are two other forms
of whitespace and that includes the tab
tab tab tab and also the newline so this
should still work yep works fine so I'm
gonna put that back now the next thing
you might have noticed when you first
looked at this is like what in the heck
is going on
with all this random capitalization like
how are you supposed to know what's
capital like this is capital but this
string here isn't capital what's going
on with that well this is a
convention and the convention is that
whenever we have a keyword we're going
to put that in all capital letters so
this is a keyword this is another
keyword this string here though that is
data that I put myself so it's not a
keyword we can keep that lowercase and
once again this is purely a convention
so that means I can actually change this
I could say select in lowercase run the
thing and guess what it works just the
same this rule actually still applies
when we're talking about objects we
create in our database for example
tables here we have a table dual we can
change the capitalization of this and it
should still work capitalize every other
letter because that makes me cool right
so now let's run this and prove to you
that it works it works so I guess this
brings up the question should you follow
the naming convention the answer is yes
literally almost everybody follows the
convention of capitalizing the keywords
and that's not just for Oracle database
but sequel server mysql and many other
database management systems so I highly
highly hi hun twister highly highly
highly recommend that you follow the
naming conventions this too has the
gacho with the string because the string
is basically whatever data we want it to
be so if I make this all caps when I
output it it's gonna be all caps so it
pays attention to that so you can see
down here it's outputted in all caps so
to show this a little bit better let's
write a more complex query that is going
to prove that when you have a string one
of them being uppercase in one being
lowercase they are not considered the
same thing so let's go down a line and
what we're going to do is we're going to
select a string and we'll just make it
say true and where are we gonna select
this from you guessed it we're gonna
select it from duals but now we're going
to add another keyword in here and
that's the where keyword and this is
where we can put some kind of
restriction or qualification on what the
data needs to meet and
to be returned so if you had a table
that had bills for example you could
return all of them that were greater
than $500 for example but in this
situation we're going to do something a
little bit different we're going to make
a string and we're going to put in here
caps and you can see the first letters
capital and then we're gonna see if
that's equal to caps same exact
capitalization same exact spelling so
this is a comparison keep that in mind
because in some programming languages
they will have two equal signs but here
we just want one there is not any kind
of assigning going on here if you guys
have practice with other programming
languages so what exactly is this entire
thing going to do it's going to return
the string true we're caps
equals caps and when is that all of the
time so this is literally just going to
output the string true but this brings
up another good question how can we run
just this section there's some there's
some things barking I'm gonna see if I
can shut them up I think I just made it
worse
so let's output this so to run just this
we can highlight it and then we can run
it now and you can see it returns true
and literally it just outputted this
string yes I'm just making a video but
now let's change one of these strings to
lowercase caps and now let's run the
thing and just just to make it clear I'm
gonna clear this out and then run it Wow
no rows selected it's broken huh yeah so
you guys get it so this is not the same
as this now another way rather than
having to highlight everything and then
clicking one of these buttons there's
something known as comments and comments
can be used to kind of tell the database
engine to ignore certain parts of our
code so right now I'm not using this
line so I can tell it hey ignore this
and the way you do that is with
- - signs you can see it changes colors
it's pretty yeah so now I don't have to
highlight this I can just press this
button and you can see it runs that's
one type of comment another type of
comment is known as a multi-line comment
and the way you do that is with a
forward slash asterisk asterisk forward
slash and then anything between these is
commented out so if I wanted to comment
out this entire section all I'd have to
do is throw inside one of these comments
so I could go like this and paste that
up here and then I could work on this
one over here so there now you guys
understand spacing capitalization and
comments I think that's enough for this
video let's move on and I think the next
thing we're going to do is start
creating a table so that's gonna be
pretty exciting so be there or be square
it also if you like these videos do me a
favor and subscribe and share them with
all of your friends thank you and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
