music theory tutorial and in the last
video I spoke of musical notation and in
this video I'm going to give you a
specific example of this so you're
probably like what's with all the C's
well these represent different C's on a
piano and or on any basically different
pitches of C so it's gonna be for guitar
trumpet violin keyboards Piccolo's
flutes clarinets to buzz xylophones okay
I'm not gonna name every single
instrument if I didn't say her
instrument that you play I'm very sorry
but yeah there's hundreds in anyways
this is called Helmholtz I don't even
know if that's pronounced right
Helmholtz pitch notation pitch notation
right here now basically this right here
this C with a little tick mark is middle
C so if you if you know about reading
music if we have a five line staff with
a treble clef this is C right here and
this is also C right here now this is
middle C so this this C right here
represents it higher see you with two
tick marks so yeah let's get into this a
little bit more and I will explain
what's going on okay all right so this
refers to middle C now middle C I don't
know I open that is also known as c4 see
it so now if we let me scroll down here
but we also have c3
we also have c2 we'll get into that soon
so now middle C also known as c4 C ready
it is represented with the C as a little
tick with a little tick mark apostrophe
above it now if we go up an octave to
the next C which vibrates twice as fast
we represent that as see with two tick
marks now we don't always do this in
music this is just an example in fact
how waltz pitch notation is not used
nearly as much as just writing it on a
staff which is five lined way to write
music and we'll get into that soon and
then the other way is to write like c4
or c5 they just represent different
pitches so this one represents the C
above middle C here's middle C that is C
with two tick marks if I go over that is
C with three tick marks now if you
notice these are little C's these are
big C's so capital C's if we go down
from middle C let me see we get c3
which is represented as a little see if
we go down even more we get big see
figure down one more time which that's
as far as our key bar key keyboard our
keyboard will go on here so these
represent different seas and this is
middle seat go up an octave we get this
one go up another octave we get this one
go down an octave this one this one this
one this one so forth so now we know
that's how that works
but what about if we use a different
letters such as B well let me draw a
little keyboard here okay here we have
our keyboard here is C there's the black
keys or the green keys in this case
here's C and here's B now let's say this
is middle C so we have C with an
apostrophe this B is before that
therefore it's only C without an
apostrophe and if we go up an octave so
we have three keys here and then we
start another octave here here we have
another seed and right beside it is a B
so now let's talk about this B well we
know this is C with an apostrophe
therefore this C has two apostrophes
this one's not quite to the C with two
apostrophes but it is within the range
of C with an apostrophe so this would be
represented as B with an apostrophe this
one would be represented I don't know
why I wrote C that's supposed to be a B
this one would be represented as B with
no apostrophe because we can't reach the
sea with an apostrophe it's not quite
there what this means
home waltz pitch notation is from C all
the way to B naught from A to G so if we
have it goes like this we're gonna have
C with an apostrophe all the way to be
with an apostrophe that's how it works
that's the range is for helmoltz pitch
notation in the next video I'll be
talking about scientific pitch notation
which is a more common but still very
this is still very important way of
notating our notes so thank you for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video thank you please subscribe like my
