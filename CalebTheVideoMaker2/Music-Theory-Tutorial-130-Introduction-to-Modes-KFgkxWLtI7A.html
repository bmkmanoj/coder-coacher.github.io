actually for real taking a break from
chord progression and we're taking a
break from the harmony and we're moving
on to some more ideas about scales and
the melody so if you don't remember
harmonies notes together melodies notes
following one after the other so we have
learned a couple examples of harmony and
then we have learned couple examples of
melody we want to have a chord
progression and we also went over scales
so now when we take a scale we have
patterns of whole steps half steps and
whole steps plus half steps and so forth
to get an X ascending or descending
notes on a staff on a keyboard on a
guitar on a piano which pretty much
keyboard on a trumpet whatever
instrument it is flute clarinet
saxophone tuba trumpet trombone sorry it
doesn't really matter as long as it has
notes and can change notes then this is
good so when we have a major scale we
have the patterns whole whole half whole
whole half whole whole half there's
seven steps amount of steps to create
the scale so c d e f g a b back to see
that's an example of a major scale now
i'm going to be going over something
called modes it's very similar to the
major scale and there's seven of them
because basically what a mode is is
taking a major scale and starting the
scale on a different scale degree so for
example and the c major scale or the key
of C we could go d e f g a b c d back to
d because with go back to where we start
so that is an example of a mode we could
also start on e e f g a b c d e now how
is this different from scales well when
we have an E major scale
we may have three sharps I think four
sharps all we really are is doing is
starting on a different scale degree now
because there's seven scale degrees 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 c d e f g a b c back to the
tonic we have seven different modes one
would be starting on c d e f g a b and
that's all but now note that we don't
always have to start on the c major
scale i just like to teach the c major
scale because there's no sharps and no
flats and it doesn't confuse people as
much although with these i'll be going
over scales with sharps and maybe with
flats so let's get started the first one
is known as i oniy yeah Ionian that's
the first mode that is starting that's
the same thing as a major scale so the
names are really weird but don't let
them freak you out ionian then we have
Dorian which is like starting on a
second scale degree Ridge GN I don't
know how to spell these let me check
this real quick so here is all seven of
them don't let the names freaky out we
got Ionian Dorian Phrygian Lydian
mixolydian Aeolian and law Korean this
is an scale of C major this would be
like starting on c d e f g a and then B
then we could go back to you I owning an
octave higher so that is the basis of
this and in the next upcoming videos I
will be going over these in detail to
where you can understand these more and
maybe try figuring ways we can apply
these and how they different and how
they are different than a major scale so
see you in the next video where we will
be talking about the Ionian mode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
