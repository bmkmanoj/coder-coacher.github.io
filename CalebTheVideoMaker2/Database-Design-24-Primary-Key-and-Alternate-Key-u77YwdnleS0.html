Caleb as you probably know because
you've been watching this entire series
so this video we're going to be picking
up from where we stopped last video
which we were talking about candidate
keys so this video we're going to be
talking about primary keys which is the
next step so what is a primary key well
in the last video we talked we defined
some possibilities for candidate keys
something we could use as the main key
it's a candidate because you have to
pick it to be our primary key so we have
a list of possibilities one of them was
a user name another was an email and
then if you don't have something simple
like this you could do something like
your full name which that would be like
first name last name middle name and
then plus an address which address have
probably broken up into like street city
you know all like all the parts of an
address and then possibly your birth
date for just dog so here are just
impossibilities for candidate keys so we
could have username email force name and
logo
well now once you have all your possible
candidate keys you want to pick one to
be your primary key so how do you do
that well once again you got to make
sure we look at the rules or suggestions
for keys this is specifically talking
about primary keys we want our primary
key of a unique never changing and never
normal so user name is never going to
change right so that's pretty good you
always need a user name when you sign up
for an account so it's never known and
it has to be unique because two people
can't have the same user name so this
would be a good primary key let's check
out email well it's you can make it
unique you can require people to only
have like you can prevent multiple
emails so when you create an account you
can only use an email that has not been
used that's an option so that's possible
never changing a well it depends depends
on if it if you use your email like a
user account use your name like you sign
in with your email and you have a
password too well then the chances are
you're not going to be able to change
although now you can probably update
your email and stuff so it's possible to
be never changing if you prevent people
from updating their main email so
possible possible and never know you can
require someone to have an email so
that's possible all three of these are
possible so this is a a possible looks
for - first name last name middle name
address date of birth well probably the
whole group as a whole will be unique
the chances of finding someone with your
same name living at the same place as
you with the same date of birth is
almost impossible so unique practically
yes but possible you can possibly have a
duplicate so possible never changing Oh
what people can get married so their
last name can change first name can even
change your middle name can even change
you can move you can't be born a
different date you can't be born again
like unless you become a Christian but
anyways never know well some people
might not have an address either that or
they might not have a middle name or
something like that so this is probably
not the best primary key so in this
example I'd probably go with the user
and then you define that as your primary
key and then you can use that to make
connections between tables so you have a
comment by a username that's the
connection that is a natural P and we'll
be talking about surrogate Keys in the
next video if you know anything about
that but basically you can use your
username as an ID rather like as a
primary key so you can
let's say this is my username this can
be the connection for all of my rows by
me so if I the table for comments Table
four users a tailor for sales well if I
buy something cable courage connection
if I post if I'm a user well connection
if I post a comment connection it all
kind of points back to the user table
because that's going to be the parent of
the relationship is so this could be a
primary key so that's a primary key now
this will also be indexed because
primary key is a source of is a type of
index so you can do select statements
really easily with that and everything
like that so that's going to be how you
connect most of your data
now the other Canada keys that we did
not choose they're known as alternate
keys an alternate key it works I mean
you can it can be it could be the
primary key but basically it's all the
candidate keys that were not selected as
the primary key you do not you're not
required to define all of your alternate
keys in your database in fact you don't
even need any alternate keys but you may
want to because oftentimes they will be
something you're doing searches for or
connecting tables or whatever it is
alternate keys might be useful so you
can create an index on the alternate key
so I could create an index on the emails
for example because I said that was a
possibility
well now that can that'll be an index
and it will probably be used because you
might want to do data by the emails like
selecting everyone by their email you
know what I mean maybe possibly
basically I you can you can do a select
and then you can choose the columns you
want to choose and then the table and
then you could say where and then you
could say like email has the value legit
awesome calm because you have an index
on that it's going to work better so if
you have a really good alternate key I
recommend you index it simply for a good
design and it will help your database
run faster but if you don't really want
a net index on it then don't do it
because that's just another thing your
database is going to have to maintain
it's going to have to update the index
as well as the book sort of how if I
have a book here and I change the
insides of the book holding the index
and the back is going to change to so
alternate keys you can set them as an
index if they are good and useful if you
will be searching for that kind of
information so that is introduction to
primary keys and alternate keys
you only have much else to say the next
video will probably be talking about
when you see people do things like user
ID which is a really common way for
people to define primary keys you'll
connect things by IEDs we talked about
that in the next video and when we
should do that and when we shouldn't do
that alright so thank you for watching
hopefully that was helpful and be sure
