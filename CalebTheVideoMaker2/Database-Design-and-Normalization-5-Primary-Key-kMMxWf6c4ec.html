keys I've already been over this a
little bit in the last few videos but
now I'm gonna make it stick in your
brain and go a little bit in more depth
go in a little bit more depth so there's
two types of keys we have primary and
then we have before the primary key is
something that'll keep each entry unique
all right so let's say the ID that would
be the primary key that is because it
always keeps it unique so primary key
number two you must always have an entry
and it's name so it can never be normal
must always so you can't have somebody
with a blank primary key I mean there's
no human with a primary key of a social
security number where that social
security number is nothing that makes
sense so I must always be unique and I
must always have an entry third one is
the value must never change
so never change
that is to keep singing
I mean you know see you know humans
walking around with a changing social
security number every day it's always
the same
it always has a number and it's always
unique that is a primary key right here
right this these are all for the primary
key all three of these must be unique
I'll always have an entry and it's never
changing that's all you gotta memorize
that's all you gotta learn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
