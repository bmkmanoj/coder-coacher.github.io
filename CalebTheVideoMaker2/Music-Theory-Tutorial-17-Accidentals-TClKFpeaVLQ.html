working for Caleb the video maker he's
pretty cool it's also me and case you
didn't know that and uh in this video
this is like your 17th or something I
don't even know what it is yeah I think
it's your 17th in this video I will be
talking about accidentals that's another
term you need to learn accidentals now I
haven't really taught too much about
reading music but I'm writing these out
because they're sort of a prerequisite
in ways not really now you've learned
two of these already from this series
one an accidental was a flat side which
looks like a B well there's actually a
more appropriate way to draw it's like
yeah that was horrible
it's like it's fancier but I can't do it
it's like a half of harvest so it's like
yeah close enough that's a flat sign and
then there's a sharp sign which is like
the pound sign or number sign on a
telephone yeah
so here's two that we learned this means
to lower the pitch a half step so let me
get open up a piano here you got a piano
Gazi so we have e then we want to flat
it becomes E flat
'if what but we also have sharp so if we
want to sharp something we raise it up
we have F we can raise it up to an F
sharp or if we have a D we raise it to a
D sharp so D sharp and E flat are the
same notes
those are said to be in harmonic you are
going to hear this term six gazillion
times in this series in harmonic that
means same note same sound I mean
different notes same sound silly d sharp
versus a flat different notes same set
and harmonic yes so now there's also
some other accidentals there is Jim
natural son close enough now that's a
natural sign what a natural sign is is
saying to take it back to its natural
state so if we have this note and so
either a sharp or a flat because it's on
two Black Keys which tell us to raise it
to a sharp or flat so if we have F now
if F sharp if we have a G now we have G
flat so if we have G flat and we will if
we want to take a G flat G flat and put
it into its natural state it takes it
back to a G G flat G G so the natural is
basically just getting rid of a flat or
sharp side C so now there's a two more
you should know one of these is a double
flat sign it looks like this
shuts me this this is really hard to
draw
ah who woulda guessed two flat signs so
this one's kind of weird if we have a
aji and we double flat it
that's one flat that's two flats so it
actually becomes an F but it's actually
called G double flat so those are said
to be an harmonic G double flat equals
sorta equals F they're not the same
thing but they're in our monic so let's
say equal sign equals G natural state G
flat G double flat also known as F now
there's one more but you can't guess
with this double sharp Oh bet you can't
guess how to draw it
no seriously this one's weird because
for some reason some musician so smart
decided to draw a little funky so it
looks like an X with like two little
Arrowhead arrowheads kind of like that
yeah
that's close enough to a double sharp so
if we have F double sharp it equals G F
f-sharp G F F sharp F double sharp F F
sharp F double sharp F F sharp Doh sharp
also known as G so f double sharp is in
harmonic - G certain notes such as B and
also these two are kind of special we
start on B and we make it sharp which
means to raise it ah there's no black
key so B sharp is actually the same
thing as C so B sharp is in harmonic to
see not be double sharp just be sharp so
be be double sharp would be sharp double
sharp so that's right so be double sharp
is equal to C sharp and the reason for
this is it's Oh just because there's no
black key doesn't mean we count
differently we still count one and so
forth so B 1 2 the same thing for e 1 2
e double sharp is equal to F sharp so if
we take this double sharp and replace it
with a sharp
it equals C cool it now see if we flip
this thing we have C equals I mean C
flat is the same thing as B because if
you remember B I mean flat is to drop it
a step half step I mean and we'll get
into that
where's B there's C now if we take C and
flat it means lowered there's no black
key so it goes straight to me
here are our five accidentals that we
need to know natural this is called
natural double flat double flat double
sharp flat and sharp now don't ever
write a double sharp as this you'll get
made fun of this is not double sharp
this is sharp sharp which is not double
sharp it's it's WTF no one knows what it
means
see you in the next week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
