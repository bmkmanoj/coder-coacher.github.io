quick review I'll actually be using my
notes here just to make sure I get the
main everything because I'm not gonna
try to memorize like ten videos of
content that's just crazy
why is alright but anyways first thing
we started with was super keys so super
key was just any number of columns that
make ensure uniqueness within a table so
we have super key which I still don't
know why that's only one word which just
confuses the heck outta me so someone
please explain that then we had a
candidate key know the difference
between a super key and Canada key is
that a candidate key is the least number
of columns used to enforce uniqueness
now you can all you can have multiple
candidate keys if you like a certain
group so that and that's the case you
have to pick one as your primary key the
primary key is the one you select as the
the main key for your table all the
other ones you can assign as alternate
keys which if that's the case they still
can be unique you could still have
enforced uniqueness upon those but
they're not uses the main key within
your table alright well then there's um
that's pretty much the all the ideas
with finding a primary key and then when
you reference that in another table you
have what's known as a foreign key
foreign keys reference a primary key is
a connection that's how you make
connections between tables you have a
user user table and then you have a as a
comments table well the comment is
posted by a user so you can reference
that user in that comments table and we
talked a lot about that
so I'm pretty sure you guys got that
pretty well now this is pretty much all
you got to worry about for primary keys
and foreign keys you just gotta worry
mainly about these two these ones are
less important about finding and
figuring out these two are essential I'm
so the must and these aren't
and they're important but really
defining a superkey is kind of pointless
when you know there's the candidate key
you don't have to say okay well all of
these define uniqueness that's one
that's one super key all of these define
uniqueness that's another super key Oh
finally we're down to this correct size
for a Canada key that's our candidate
key and then I'm check marking by the
way just so you know what that is and
then oh okay we got total of ten
candidate keys five super keys now let's
find a good primary key well this one
looks nice we'll use that one we'll set
the rest as alternate keys
that's just complexity that is
unnecessary when it's easier just to say
oh there's a candidate key it's already
the smallest that we need we'll use that
as their primary key and now let's see
if we have any other alternate keys oh
we don't have any good ones Oh too bad
it's fine who really cares oh we do have
some good ones oh yeah let's set those
as an index and make sure they're unique
and we'll use those for some searching
then later on that's an example of how
you would find a primary key you don't
have to make this manual labor for like
20 hours to figure out which primary key
to use all right then you reference that
primary key in another tables the
foreign key so that's why these two are
the most important forward and primary
those are the two you should focus on
the most immense okay the alternate
candidate super key and they're kind of
important but not as important all right
so let's take a look at primary four
that says tough let's clear this out for
a second
I Drive Merritt now there's some
categories dude I dust it and now it's
like who can breathe there's some
categories of keys that we can talk
about so the first one was surrogate and
natural so certainly a natural piece a
surrogate key is just a random number
that has no real world value or no real
world meaning just like an ID user ID
student ID college ID classroom ID a
store ID sale ID record ID song ID
picture ID whatever you want it to be I
don't really care as long as it's an
idea it's a surrogate key then yeah yeah
yeah I don't know what I just did there
but anyway it's natural something that's
already naturally in the database and
you just define it as your key now
typically when you want to use keys in
your database which you will because
it's your relational database you will
pick either surrogate or natural Keys
and you will use them throughout the
rest of the database you're not going to
switch from surrogate and natural you're
not gonna be like oh this one is a
natural key we'll use natural but this
one doesn't we'll make a surrogate
that's a bad design you should be able
to enforce uniqueness by the columns
that are already there and then you can
add a surrogate key if that's what you
want to do and if by any chance you
cannot possibly define uniqueness
without a surrogate key you're pretty
much required to use a surrogate key
well that situation should try to be
avoided but there's times when you
literally cannot find a natural key that
will be sufficient so you guys kind of
follow out of me surrogate Keys random
numbers natural Keys already in the
table both simple
speaking of simple we'll talk about the
simple P alright so we got simple
we got a composite and compound
okay so simple is basically a one column
key composite and compound are multiple
column keys we talked about those in the
previous video I believe oh yeah so
that's pretty much all the categories of
the keys the when you define your
primary or foreign Keys you're not gonna
have to specify if it's a surrogate
natural simple composite or compound
this is for our sake to design the best
way because it's for example do you want
to use composite keys or do you want to
use simple keys that's a good question
if you decide you want to use simple
keys which by the way sir gated naturals
kind of thing you do throughout your
entire database you can kind of switch
back and forth from simple and composite
for example you could have a users table
and we could have a up like a science
students table a class table and then we
could have a an enrollment table with
the students taking certain classes we
could use a compiler we could I guess we
could use a compound for this table and
then we could use simple for these
tables that's something you could do but
you should still use either surrogate or
natural just pick one and use it
throughout your database hopefully I'm
not talking too fast cuz I'm going
pretty quickly if I am just let me know
as I just need a comma couple inches
calm down a couple decibels just kind of
hyper okay no the other thing we talked
about is foreign keys and foreign key
constraints
well the main kind of foreign keys the
main kind of foreign key constraints
were on update and on delete these
protect our integrity of our database
you define these whenever you make a
table when you when you use the create
table statement or create or whatever
your relational database management
system does to create tables the chances
are you're going to say that you have
foreign key I'm just going to put XK for
short and then you have a constraint and
you can usually
name that constraint so you could be
like blah blah blah name it whatever and
then we could say on update or on delete
and the options were the ones I thought
you were do nothing or basically throw
an error or we could update the children
or we could basically get rid of the
value for the children so that would be
restrict cascade and Sentinel but your
relational database management system
might use something a little bit
different which is fine
yeah that's nuts about it oh yeah yeah
it's pretty much yeah cool cool all
right so yeah that's the summary of keys
so yeah when I was at UM enough stuff
compared to my other database design
video I had a video over primary keys
and a video over foreign keys boomed on
this one I had like 10 videos alright
see you guys in the next video where we
will be talking about something new
sweet see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
