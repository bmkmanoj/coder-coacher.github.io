game here it's not really a game but
it'd be cool if it was a game yeah I
think I'll make it a game so let's play
my new game I just a minute it's called
ad bar lines to the song so basically
this is in 4/4 time which if you don't
know what that means don't worry about
it we have any really talked about it
really basically all that says is
there's four beats in a measure so in a
quarter note is equal to 1 B so that
means we can have four quarter notes in
a measure
so basically bar lines are those things
they look like this they separate
measures I think it's one separate roll
separate I think that's I don't know
measures so let's figure this out this
is a quarter note oh yeah by the way a
quarter note is equal to one-fourth of a
measure this is a great way to figure
this out is by using fractions a half
note is worth two fourths of a measure
an eighth note is 1/8 another eighth
note is 1/8 now let's go measure by
measure what all note kind of give away
the yeah okay well it's totally not a
measure right there don't want to give
away any secrets
here's 1/16 mmm
note said I'll be 1/16 since there's
only one and they are sixteenth of a
measure there's an eighth rest which
takes up 1/8 there is a 32nd note 32nd
wrist a sixteenth rest so that takes up
a sixteenth and then we have a half rest
which takes up two fourths and from what
if it was a whole rest it would look
like this with the with the bar on top
like that versus that were the bars on
bottom so that's two fourths and then we
have a quarter note which is 1/4 and
then we have
well I guess one two three four five six
seven eight we'll take a shortcut
eight eight bits which are all eight one
eight that gives us a eight yes this
will give us um eight eight which will
give us a full measure so we
automatically know this is a measure
this way sorry we kind of cheat in that
one but that's okay now let's take a
look at the rest for whoa we're doing it
for one I think it's a wonder for 1/4
okay cool
so 2/4 plus 1/4 is equal to 3/4 1/8 plus
1/8 is equal to two eighths two eighths
is the equivalent of 1/4 because we can
just if we have two eighths we can
divide it by two by the top two divided
by 2 is 1 8 divided by 2 is 4 1/4 so
that would mean 3/4 plus 1/4 so if you
have failed pie I'm thinking of a pie
3/4 of it plus 1/4 of it will give us a
holes what you mean one of the bars ends
right here marker swapping time so here
is our first measure now we have 1/16
plus 1/8 another great way we can do
this
is find the least common multiple of the
denominator so this is 1/8 is the
equivalent of 216 2/4 is the equivalent
of 1/16 1/4 is the equipment of the four
sixties we can do is just add the top
eight plus 4 okay so 8 plus 4 is 12 so
this is 12 16 let me just cross this out
plus 1/16 becomes 13 and 16 plus 1/16
becomes 14 16 plus 2 sixteenths becomes
16 out of 16 that means this region Plus
this region is the next measure so
that's how you add bar lines to a song
or sheet music whatever you want to call
it now after a while you get kind of
used to it for example I'll
automatically know two of these is the
equivalent of one coordinate two
quarter-notes make a half note two half
notes make a whole note and a whole note
is one measure so that's an easy way to
do that same thing for this if we have
two sixteenth notes that means they're
equivalent of one eighth
because remember 1/8 can break into two
sixteenth notes or rest it doesn't have
to be notice so that means these are
both worth one eighth note plus another
eighth note would be two eighth notes
and remember to eighth notes or rests or
is the equivalent of a quarter note so
we can just basically get rid of this in
our brain and replace it with a
coordinate a quarter note plus a quarter
note is equal to half two halves equals
a whole so this is one whole measure now
this one's really easy just think two of
these create one quarter note so if we
do that for all of them there's four
quarter notes four quarters make a hole
that's pretty much all there is to it so
hopefully that helped clear some things
up and how to actually count these and I
don't know what I'm gonna do next but
it's gonna be awesome well what's new
right
so please click Subscribe and do some
other cool stuff so
yeah please let me know how you like
this series I think my threads gonna
explode I've been doing this for a while
but yeah see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
