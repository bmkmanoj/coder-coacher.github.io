Caleb the video maker Caleb curry calms
my website this video I'll be talking
about managing a business using
QuickBooks although um this can be
addressed for multiple different things
can having to do with business it's not
all about with books and quickbooks is
not the solution for every business I
want to make that clear because like I
don't use QuickBooks I don't I don't
find it necessary but for some of you
it's going to be extremely important and
that's just an example so if you don't
know what QuickBooks is basically it's a
business manager helps you manage your
payments your income your out yeah
basically all the aspects of a business
including your employees your customers
or clients taxes and all that junk so
the reason I want to talk about this is
I originally got a facebook message I'll
read you have a part of it so um it says
hey there I've been watching your videos
about MySQL databases and I was
wondering if you could give me some
guidance I'd like to create one to
manage all the members at our gym so
this person owns a gym or as a worker
there I don't really know so I don't
really know this person's position in
this company um the current system is a
mess paper files everywhere that
continually go missing no photo IDs and
it's really hard on those employees who
don't personally know these people I
haven't worked with mysql and PHP very
much but would it be possible to convert
our paper filing system to a digital
database using MySQL I wouldn't mind
paying for hosting from a company like
hostgator I know Hostgator already has
my SQL installed on their servers and
that would allow us to access members
info anywhere what would I have to do to
get this ball rolling I thought I should
ask you mr. tech whiz I'll stop it
because anyone else since I so basically
I have some experience with databases
and he thought it asked me before he
tries doing anything or a girl I'm not
sure
I'm not sure if it's a boy or girl but
then he goes on to say we constantly
have to search for members files to see
if their current on their membership
dues or even if they remember when they
sign in some people pay month-to-month
annually or they are on automatic
withdrawal honestly I wouldn't mind
going in and programming that database
one night to put the files in there
because I told them it would require
some work to do that tonight for
instance there are three of us
instructing a class of 15 to 30 kids
which is way too many wild kids for only
three instructors the problem is that
not all of these kids are up to date on
their membership dues so they shouldn't
be in there in the first place I got a
let's say about that one by the way
there are just so many people who use
our facility without paying it's not
fair to the employees or instructors the
membership management system really
needs an upgrade the most important
information is if people are up to date
on their membership dues so I guess my
main question is do you think mysql is
right for something like this all right
that is a big question all right so I'm
just gonna be talking about some of this
stuff yes you could do something could
make things easier with PHP and MySQL
but for this specific case I decided I
did not think that was the best solution
for lots of reasons this person told me
that they did not have any experience
with programming databases or PHP and to
program something complex enough to
manage all of that that's either going
to require a professional programmer or
a crap ton of time to learn how to do
that so yeah that was my main reason
basically I find there I find that there
is a better alternative and yes even as
a PHP MySQL teacher on youtube I am
saying there is a better alternative for
this case I think I do know the best
alternative which I decided was
QuickBooks that's qu IC K
be 00 KS and i'm sure there's like
multiple other ones out there or you can
find a pre-programmed mice PHP mysql
file system that you can manipulate to
design for your business but for as of
right now I think QuickBooks would be
your best option the thing is QuickBooks
there is a monthly fee I'm not sure how
much it cost hey let me look it up real
quick there's two types of QuickBooks
there is an online and then there is a
downloadable so there you go to
QuickBooks dot intu I Tecom just google
search it and then other products click
books or small businesses first thing
that comes up is QuickBooks products
online products so there's a 1295
version a 2695 month version and a 3995
per month version and there's also
desktop products which you download or
install there is a 250 version a 400
version and a one-thousand-dollar
version now I know this person did not
want to spend money but I think the
benefits outweigh the negatives because
they went on later to tell me the price
of their membership and simply by having
one person who doesn't pay by having
them pay that's almost enough to pay for
a month of QuickBooks so I think the
benefits would definitely outweigh the
negatives so um what was I gonna talk
about right the first thing I wrote a
couple things not much so there's people
who were getting stuff for free when
they shouldn't um he or she mentioned
that there are just so many people who
use our facility without paying and
honestly I think that is pretty bad
pretty sad too um it's definitely not
good thing for
business that's definitely what you need
to change and it's good that you
recognize that needs to be changed
because there is a lot of businesses
that were just so unorganized and they
don't get this kind of things fixed but
um when when people are getting in for
free then there's also people paying
that's not fair for the people pain and
it's not really fair for the people who
are getting in for free and just gonna
make a bunch of people super mad if
everyone finds out so like figure if
you're in this class they're talking
about and one of your neighbors says
that they don't even pay well that's
going to make that person pretty upset
because why would I want to pay 40 bucks
to go to a gym when this person just
walks in and doesn't pay anything so by
having people not pay there's a
potential that even more people are
going to try to not pay right and also
that is inflating prices so if you're
functioning does this simple numbers if
you were getting paid a thousand dollars
a month and you have bills of nine
hundred dollars a month which I'm sure
they're much higher than that and
there's 10 people not paying their bills
to work at the gym well then all the
people that consist of that one thousand
dollars are getting overpaid I mean art
hog getting overpaid their overpaying if
everyone paid you could lower the price
and still make a thousand dollars which
gives you plenty to provide for the gym
or you could keep the price is the same
and increase the income that you make so
yeah first things first figure out what
you need to do which in this case was
figuring out if people are up to date on
their membership dues so basically the
goal of this entire thing is to not
allow people to use the gym if they
haven't paid to use the gym and that's
okay it's nothing unethical about that
so um next thing I wrote was on anyone
can think of a business in detail what
actually managing one may be a lot
different so it's really simple to think
of a business concept and understand how
much to charge how much money to make
and this person did go into a lot of
detail about how much they charge um
methods they charge so I'm just I'll
give you an example here they have
annual membership and monthly membership
and that's a lot of lots a lot of stuff
to manage it's easy to think of okay
let's say annual membership is three
hundred and eighty dollars well that's
simple when you are writing it down to
plan your business but actually getting
it to all work together that's a lot
more harder so very few people actually
have the ability to manage a business
you'd be surprised so if you want an
organized business then you need to be
sure that you know how to manage if is
this very well because just thinking of
what you're going to do is not it's not
how it works I don't really have to
worry about too much because I'm a sole
proprietor so I own everything I don't I
don't have any employer employees so
yeah I don't really have to worry about
other people messing things up because
we're all human so we all make mistakes
the only person who doesn't make
mistakes Jesus and none of us are Jesus
so everything is able to mess up which
is important to know about got to
prepare for that so for me if I mess up
it's all on me and I don't have to yell
at anyone I don't have to fire anybody I
don't have to mess with coworkers who
are upset and the only person it mainly
affects is me and the people who are
watching my stuff which i would call my
customers or clients that's that's on
YouTube that is my youtube
watchers came up the video maker too but
uh when you are managing a business with
multiple people you've got to make sure
everyone is on the same page because if
this person this is probably one of the
biggest problems let's say these are
people it spends this person is helping
manage a business they're not the owner
this guy appears the owner but he's
putting the responsibility on these two
people for whatever task you may be to
manage the gym well if this person is
trying to run it one way this person is
trying to run in a different way well
then the end result is going to be a
disaster I mean as you can see here
there are files going at getting lost
all of the time and it's hard to it's
hard on the ploys to employees to keep
up with this so my solution to you would
be that you need more time and
organizing your junk for your business
like I'm not trying to be offensive or
rude but the way you explain what's
going on it sounds like your business is
extremely badly organized and that you
guys don't put enough time into the
business and I'm not saying that that
could be false you may put a lot of time
and i can tell that i can tell that
you're you're trying to manage business
better by asking me and also looking for
other solutions for file management and
that's continual improvement you don't
have to have a perfect business once you
start out but by showing initiative and
improving the business that that makes
you better than probably eighty percent
of all businesses in the world because
most of them all they want to do is get
as much money out of the customer and
they don't even care if they see them
again but that's not what you want
especially with the gym you want clients
you want people to return so you want to
make them happy and in order to do that
you want an organized system that is
easy for the customers
so you don't want to miss place any of
their files and you don't want to
overcharge certain people or not charge
certain people and you want to make sure
it's all correct as planned because
there's two parts to a business there's
planning it and then there's actually
doing it so you want doing it to match
the plan business so I'm figure out
separate the people of your business by
um how they're paying whether its annual
or if it's bump monthly or if it's a
one-time thing such as a class or
something once you do that you can use
QuickBooks which i'll be showing you
soon on the computer you can enter this
information within this database i guess
you can say and it's going to store that
and then what you can do is you can
print invoices and you can even have
reoccurring payments so like once a
month to you want that to charge that
person and this is going to keep it all
centralized because if you have part of
your business over here part of your
business over here part of your business
over here well they all have to
communicate with each other and by
trying to put them all together you're
gonna make things simple so buy
quickbooks you can keep all this managed
very simply but with this you can
categorize your incomes so let's say we
have I know this isn't it how your gym
actually works well you have gold silver
and bronze memberships this is always my
example so each one gets more features
so you can go to new places or use the
pool or the weight room which anyways um
you can break that up into income so you
can say okay three hundred eighty
dollars from bronze members this month
and a thousand dollars from silver
members this month gold four thousand
from gold membership so then you could
figure out okay gold membership is the
best way that we are making money and
then it'll help you tell when there's
overdue payments from employees or
clients which will help you manage your
business properly alright so I have a
couple more notes I want to say before i
show you quickbooks basically you can
have accounts and click books which are
groups you manage your money with so for
example you can have memberships account
so that means all your money goes into
the memberships account could also have
another account for uh classes so if you
have gold bronze and silver membership
or monthly or so on just given examples
you could also have an account for
classes so for a one-time fee you get
six classes of yoga for example and then
these all have categories and they're
all going to be income because different
categories range from expenses to income
and other stuff used within your
business so we're going to categorize
those as income then you have the
products so the products and services
are what your company offers with money
being put into an account so we could
have a product bronze membership all of
that product sales is going to go into
the membership money account you can
have a silver membership same thing all
the money from that is going to go in
the membership account you can set the
prices for these as well then you could
have yoga classes which is going to go
into the account classes so that's going
to keep where you're earning your money
from it's going to organize all your
sources of income so this is just
details that's going to help you run
your business um we could specify more
specific accounts if we wanted to better
analyze our sales so for example if we
had two bronze and one gold a sale at
bronze fifteen dollars a month gold
thirty dollars a month that's a total of
sixty dollars so that's going to put
sixty dollars into our memberships
account
but it doesn't specify thirty dollars
from bronze and thirty dollars from gold
so you may want more specific and then
we set up clients so we have our client
information which then we can use that
to build that person so that's all I
really need to say on this point camera
so i guess i'll show you quickbooks
alright everyone I'm just going to
google search quick books and it'll be
accounting software for small business
cookie here is the URL quickbooks dot I
n tu IT I don't know how to pronounce
that but I NT uit calm and then here you
can learn about the company and all that
good stuff but I'm just going to skip
right to the products and we're going to
go to QuickBooks for small business
alright and we're going to take a look
at the online products if you would like
you can look at the desktop products but
for this video we're going with the
online products what's cool about this
is it's all cloud-based so you can
access this pretty much anywhere which
in the original question I got that was
that that was one of the things that
this person wanted they wanted a
database and they wanted to be hosted so
they could access it anywhere well
that's what's pretty awesome about
quickbooks online alright so if you're
not sure what you want to use you can go
to this link right here quickbooks dot
int uit calm forward slash online
forward slash compare and that is going
to tell the features of each program
alright so each program does have a
30-day free trial if you would like to
give one a try although i'm pretty sure
that if you skip the free trial you'll
get a discount at least they offered me
that opportunity at the time but i mean
in the future i don't know if that's
what they'll be doing or what and i'm
not sure if these prices will stay the
same but for this situation we are going
to use essentials and
the reason we are going to do that is
let's see to set up invoices to
automatically bill on a recurring
schedule this is one of the reasons
we're selecting essentials because if
we're owning if we own a gym in this
case or pretty much any business
oftentimes we'll have some sort of
subscription rather than just a one-time
payment so like 20 bucks a month or a
hundred dollars for a year and so forth
well in order to make that a lot easier
for us we might want to be able to set
up invoices to automatically bill on a
reoccurring skip recurring schedule also
plus may be better for you you'll just
have to look at all these possible
options but I just clicked essentials so
yeah that's what we're going to do you
can click try it free from this page or
from here try it free for 30 days and
you can sign up for an account I already
have an account so I'm going to use that
all right here we go this is what the
quickbooks looks like so i'm going to
shrink this um so you can see the whole
screen whoops i did not do anything that
so this is everything that you will see
when you open your quicks QuickBooks
page and I was messing around with it
for a while so as you can see I've had a
dollar paid for the last 30 days and
then seven dollars that's supposed to be
paid and then zero dollars that should
have already been paid alright so as you
can see here if I enjoy it I can
subscribe now and get fifty percent off
of six months so that's an offer I'm
just gonna ignore that alright so
there's lots of stuff we can do I'm
going to take a look quick look at my
notes here first thing we talked about
was the accounts so under Caleb Curry's
company when you first open your
QuickBooks so offer to give you company
details and I already did that and I
barely put anything
but you can put your company's name and
all that and you can change this within
your settings and there's just a load of
stuff that you can put in here this it's
pretty amazing to thank oh this is only
30 bucks a month and stuff so I put a
lot of fake junk in here all right so
but yeah there's lots and lots and lots
of stuff that you can do here all right
so you can also there's more over here
but then once you finish that you can go
to your chart of accounts and if you
remember accounts our groups use to
manage your money so you can see there's
a lot here accounts receivable blah blah
blah blah blah blah and I have one here
membership and one was what was it I
remember well let's just make a new one
just to show you how to do that so the
category type since it's going to be the
memberships we are going to make that
income because that's money that we are
going to get and this would be sales of
product income or a service or fee
income it's kind of up to you and we're
going to name this monthly membership
this will store our money for gold
silver and bronze memberships and you
can also make it a sub-account of stuff
which would allow us to enter a parent
account and for example if we had
membership we could break that up into
gold silver and bronze but we're not
going to do anything for that right now
we can save this and then now we have a
new chart of accounts I mean we have new
account which was monthly membership
with the category income now go back up
here and we can look at products and
services now I already did some a little
bit here but just to show you we can
make a new one I could say this is
platinum
membership and we can describe this get
access to all features price that would
just be whatever you want to charge for
however long so I'm going 100 bucks a
month that could be hundred bucks a year
or whatever so that's going to we're
going to put that into an account like i
said earlier which would be monthly
membership so when we earn money from a
platinum membership sale someone buys a
platinum membership that money is going
to be put into the monthly membership
account to help us organize our money
all right so then we could we could
specify more detail for stuff but this
is pretty simple for now so the next
thing you could do is you could add your
employees or your vendors and all this
other junk on the side which there
really is a lot of stuff you can do this
but i'm going to set up some clients so
i have one on here already but i'm just
going to make a new one just to show you
what it's like alright so you can put
all this information this is awesome
because if you're running a business you
can store all this on the cloud and
backup your stuff and only use paper
storage methods when necessary so this
is going to keep all those papers you
kept 'miss placing it's going to keep it
all connected to this person's account
and make things super super super easy
to keep together so your note no longer
going to have to worry about losing
papers or if there is some sort of
emergency such as a fire well you
wouldn't want to have your file cabinets
destroy the all your members client
information so what you can do is store
all this online back it up in remote
locations and then if you want you can
have prints printed copies of all this
but that's up to you I probably wouldn't
because I think it'd be annoying so mr.
epic cheeseburger company
alright and then you can put a billing
address yo yo some city or town vm Yolo
state would be California I think that's
California zip code country the United
States and that's really awesome that
you can store all this stuff we can also
put other information within here but
for now that's all I'm going to leave
then we can make an email here I don't
know what that says and we could set up
a phone oops so you put all all of it
here so d once you click off it should
format it in the proper way and then say
if you have families because I know this
person mentioned all right if there's
enough people within a family each new
person is going to get a discount well
you can actually make sub clients of
other people so if there's literally a
parent this is a child of mr. Caleb
daiquiri we can build it with the parent
and so forth and really they're this
really does get advanced so I'm not
going to teach you everything in this
quick video I mean I'm already going for
11 minutes and going pretty slow so
that's all I'm going to do for now I'm
going to uncheck that so save okay now
this is saved and what we can do is up
here for I mean from over here the
transactions sales we can look at our
sales and what we can do is create a new
invoice and an invoice is basically you
can think of it as a bill it tells the
person that they need to pay for
something so what we can do is we can
choose a client such as mr. epic
cheeseburger it's going to automatically
put their email in and allow for online
payment which is super epic for this
person I was going to put their billing
address and everything automatically the
product and service we did that earlier
remember we made the Platinum membership
and it automatically gives the
description the quantity and
rate the rate is how much it costs the
quantity is how many we want of them
obviously we're only going to want one
platinum membership a rate of 100 oops
of one hundred dollars and if you wanted
you could add more products such as yoga
classes you can add lines too so what
else you can add a custom message and
you can type a summary of the
transaction to appear on the clients
next statement and then even you can
even drag and drop extra stuff onto this
invoice so this is what we have right
now but we were talking about
reoccurring invoices so what to do that
to do that you make make reoccurring
recurring gosh can't talk now this is
going to do it's going to charge on an
interval basis and may take some
practice get all this figured out but I
recommend giving giving it all a good
try so then on what day we can say the
first day or we could say the first
monday of every one month because we
wanted to be monthly starting on that
day and it can either end in a year or
after a certain day so we could say by
11 24 2014 so that is going to give them
an entire year or if you want to charge
annually you could make it yearly and
then you'd only have to make it one year
so whatever you want but that's got to
make sure that gives them access for an
entire year so we're going to go with
monthly and terms that is how much time
they have to pay it so net 30 gives them
a month fish and do one receipt that's
going to charge them automatically we
can also click these check marks up here
to make things even better so yeah this
is now our invoice template here and we
can add extra stuff and then we can save
that template so that's going to make
things pretty automatic and awesome and
I'm sure I can show you some other stuff
on here but I don't know
you can make employees if you wish to
manage your entire business with in
QuickBooks and there's also some
shortcuts up but cut cuts up here where
we can make new expenses estimates
invoices or check and more so we can
actually add employees and we can
actually start payroll so it
automatically pays to bank accounts and
we can connect this to a bank account to
wear can withdraw money and all this
fancy stuff so I'm not going to actually
fill all this stuff out but this is
pretty awesome so yeah that is all I
really wanted to show you about
QuickBooks for now I don't think there's
anything else that I really wanted to
say so I will go back to the real world
and give some final thoughts or exclude
lemon F explanations so I'll should you
see you in like two seconds alright so
yeah that's my answer to your
extensively long question I do think
QuickBooks would be able to help or any
other form of business management system
I don't think your problem is that you
need a place to store your files I think
overall your business seems unorganized
that I don't say that because I don't
want to offend you but from an out out
word look in to your business that I
don't know it seems that overall you
need organization in all areas not just
storing people's information and making
sure they pay their money but also
making sure that all your employees
follow the same just like I don't even
know what I'm trying to say making sure
all your employees know the policy for
file management or by file management is
mean storing people's information making
sure they pay their stuff and also
organizing by making sure you know what
members are charged because you
mentioned how when people come you're
not sure you always have to look up
their files and you can't find them
and it's a mess well with QuickBooks you
can look up their name really quickly
you can figure out what type of
membership they are or you can find some
alternative method to do that even
quicker so that way you can figure it
out I know you mentioned some of all
photo IDs that's possibility but that's
all I really have to say for that I
think it would definitely be a benefit
although there's one thing I do think it
would take more time than what you're
doing right now to manage your entire
business on QuickBooks because it's
another layer to the business but I
think in the end it would be a benefit I
think it'd take about a month to learn
it pretty good depth to where you
understand if it's what you need to do
and then by doing that you're going to
know how much it could help you or if
it's not what you need and if either way
it's going to help you but it may not
you may not end up using it but by doing
that in the future you could potentially
like let's say give an extra hour of
organization a day that's five hours a
week maybe and by doing that over the
course of a month it may it may seem
like even more work and even less
organization but over six months once
you start getting things together and
you're figuring it out you're putting
the extra time into organization well
then it's kind of kind of start to work
things out itself and you're not going
to have to put nearly as much time in
finding files and also that extra hour a
day may mean somebody who's not paying
starts paying and that's going to be
enough to accommodate that extra bill of
the hour of extra work if you're looking
at an hourly schedule okay like you make
ten bucks an hour or whatever then I
think in the long run you're going to
make more money than what you spend and
the time put into it is going to be
beneficial so um I don't know what I
don't know for some of you watching I
don't know your position within a
businesses whether if you're the owner
or if you're just working there and you
think it's a mess well you may want to
suggest QuickBooks or something of the
like just look up business management
software or anything for database
business management
but I do think some sort of employee
training and possibly employer training
would be great to let everyone know
including the bosses and the high up
people know exactly what they're doing
at the file system and follow this set
of roles to put people in make sure they
put the right information don't leave
stuff blank proper naming conventions
proper payment conventions and then that
way everyone's on the same page and one
person's not going to undo another
person's work causing both people to
work and get nothing done so yeah that's
pretty much all I really have to say
about QuickBooks but I do think some
form of employee training to integrate
this into your small business would be
extremely beneficial so yeah thank you
