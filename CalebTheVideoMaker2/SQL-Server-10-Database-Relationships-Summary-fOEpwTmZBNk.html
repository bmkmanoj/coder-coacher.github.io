the video maker - this video is going to
conclude our conversation on
relationships we've discussed three
relationships one-to-one one-to-many and
many-to-many these are the three types
of relationships you are going to come
across when we're starting to work with
data the important thing to know is how
to design each one of these we've talked
about these in detail in the last three
videos so the purpose of this video is
not to teach you how to do it but to
conclude it all and make sure you get
all of it in one video so if you don't
know what I'm talking about make sure
you go watch the previous three videos
the first one one-to-one there's two
ways you can design this the first is
the simplest all you got to do is put a
column inside of a table problem solved
the reason that is is if something
exclusively describes an entity you can
just use it as an attribute of the
entity so when we have an entity we have
all kinds of attributes about that
entity you can say that these attributes
have a one-to-one relationship with the
entity that's because they're exclusive
to that entity the example we gave was a
user a username is not repeated by
multiple people usually in the example
we gave it was not repeated that means
one entity can have one username and a
username is exclusive to one entity the
other way to store a one-to-one
relationship is actually in another
table with a column that references the
primary key of the parent table so we
had the user table and then we had a
picture's table and this was for a
profile picture and the picture was
exclusive to a user so if we had the
user with the ID of seven that pic would
reference that user the column that
stores that user ID would have to be
labeled unique that's required if we
want to maintain a one-to-one
relationship if you don't play unique
that's fine it's just now going to
become a one-to-many relationship
speaking of one-to-many relationships
here is how you design them you will
have a column in another table that
references the parent you're not going
to want to label it unique though like I
just said that would force it to be a
one-to-one
if we did that it would look like this
entity attribute but what we want is
entity to multiple entities but one of
these is exclusive to that parent entity
and the way we do that is by having a
foreign key think about it if we have a
foreign key column and you only have one
row to describe this entity for example
you can only give one value for that
foreign key which means this would be
the only parent for that child entity we
haven't discussed a whole lot on
parent-child relationships but
essentially when you have a foreign key
referencing a primary key that's what's
known as a parent-child relationship the
primary key would be the parent so
anytime you have a foreign key
referencing another column even if it's
not a primary key that foreign key is
the child of a parent-child relationship
and the column at references would be
the parent column that's why I don't if
we want to have a many-to-many
relationship we need three tables the
middle table is what's known as the
intermediary table and that is basically
the table that allows us to store a
many-to-many relationship in a database
the connection between these two tables
are both going to be one-to-many one to
many and the many side is going to be in
the middle so we could have users in
blogs and then inside of the
intermediary table we would have user
blocks perfect so that sums up how to
design each of the three relationships
now this brings up a question that I've
been having and I wanted to ask you and
see what you guys thought let's say you
have a user's table right and one of the
columns in here is first name and we
have two users inside of this table one
with the ID
and that might be one with the ID of
seven and one with the idea of let's
just say by chance both of their names
are Caleb oh is this a one-to-one
relationship or is it a one-to-many this
is a very good question and it's
important that you understand why I'm
asking this because you think about it
we have the name Caleb
and it's being used by two people that's
one way to think about it
and if you thought about it this way it
would be a one-to-many relationship the
other way to think about it is you have
two people and they just happen to have
the same name in this situation it would
be a one-to-one relationship and in
general when possible you need to go
this route
it seems slightly confusing because we
have the same thing twice you think it'd
be a one-to-many relationship but you
have to think about what a one-to-many
relationship is a name is used to
uniquely define a human being it just so
happens that some people's names repeat
therefore because the name system is not
designed as a one-to-many it would be a
one-to-one with some repeating data and
that's okay that that data is repeating
because there are two separate names
they just happen to be the same it's
kind of confusing enough but let's just
think about it if it was a one-to-many
relationship how would we store this
well we would actually need a names
table so we didn't have something like
first-name and inside of this table we
have IDs and values and then inside of
this table instead of having the
first-name we'd have the first name ID
and we would replace Caleb with 22 but
this is just a really bad design even
though it's connected all nice with
foreign keys it's just dumb because
we're only gonna have such a small
minimal amount of repeating data if we
have redundant data like this because
then think about it if someone comes and
joins our app and let's say their names
Amy they are going to have to create a
new row inside of the first-name table
because it doesn't exist and overall
this is just a really dumb design so if
you're looking at it and there's only
going to be occasional repeating data by
chance and the column itself is not
designed to be like a list of things you
can choose from then I would stick with
the one to one relationship design more
examples of things that would be
one-to-one would be a phone number even
if two people by chance had
same phone number maybe they share a
phone another example would be last name
and I'm sure there's a couple of others
you can also apply this to other kinds
of examples this is a user table example
but this could be applied to a common
table for example if we had a comments
table and we had two comments that just
happened to have the same exact comment
like great would that be a one-to-one
relationship I would vote yes that's
because the comment value or what the
comment says is not designed to be a
one-to-many it just so happens that they
have the same value so I know I kind of
went on a rabbit trail with all this but
this is some important stuff to think
through what are the proper ways to
store data that's an important thing to
ask yourself thank you guys for watching
