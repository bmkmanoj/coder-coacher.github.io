are going to be discussing a different
way you can make variables in MySQL and
these are still user defined variables
so they have the same scope as the way
we talked about in the last video and
I'll be getting into the reasons why
there's different ways to do it in just
a minute but the way this is going to
work is using a select statement so
first let me write the way we made a
variable in the last video and then I'll
compare it to the new way this was the
first way I taught you how to make a
variable in MySQL you use the set
keyword and then you give it a name and
programming this is known as an
identifier whenever you have an
identifier you can change it with
whatever you want so you don't have to
make this at passing you can make it at
whatever it doesn't matter as long as
you put an at symbol so my Askew all
knows it's a variable so that's the
identifier and then you use an
assignment operator and you assign the
value 66 so in this situation this is
the assignment operator and this can be
different than the comparison equals
operator which we'll be discussing in
just a minute so this is kind of like an
overloaded operator in this situation
we're using it to assign a value to a
variable but later we'll see how this
can also be used to compare things in a
comparison situation and that'll make
more sense once we go through that but
just be aware that for now finally we
give it the value 66 and use a semicolon
to tell MySQL this is the end of the
statement the new way to create a
variable is within a select statement
the very first thing you need to do is
replace set with select and then you use
the identifier just the same and then
you need to assign it a value and in
this situation the assignment operator
looks a little bit different you are
going to use a colon and then an equal
sign once you have that you can give it
the value you can also see here you can
use different data types with your
variables
so to summarize the only two differences
is this change in keyword from set to
select
and then this change in the assignment
operator to a : equals but what's the
main difference here well this one up
here this is just going to create the
variable but this one is going to
actually return that value of whatever
that variable is if you guys have
watched my other series you'll know that
select is what we use to get information
it's not always selecting something from
a database so if you know this you can
put a from statement and you can say
what table you want to get that data
from but you can also just put an
expression in there so an expression is
something that is evaluated to a value
an example is five plus five if we were
to do something like select five plus
five we are going to get back a result
table that says ten so normally when we
have a result table the column name is
up here instead it's going to be the
expression and then we'll get the result
under that so this is what this is going
to return so if you go to select five
plus five you're going to get this
result table a very similar thing
happens when we use the Select command
to create a variable when we run this
command it's going to take this it's
going to put it as the header of that
column in that result table and then the
result is going to be whatever the value
of the variable is so that's one of the
big differences between using the set
and the Select command to create
variables in the next video I'll be
explaining why we have to use this colon
Onix
can you drink your water when I'm not
making a video in the next video I will
be explaining why you have to use this
colon equals and that one we're actually
going to be getting on to computer and
using this pretty cool tool to run SQL
commands I think you guys are gonna like
it so we'll see you then be sure to
subscribe and yes but also yeah bye
go away I'm um I'm making a video come
at me I'm fine love you I didn't mean to
hurt you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
