are going to continue our discussion on
the char data type the previous two
videos kind of laid the foundation for
this data type and in this video I'm
going to be talking about conversion
between character data and integer data
so if you remember from the ASCII table
every single character has some integer
value the example that I am trying to
help you guys memorize is that 65 is the
integer value for capital a what I'm
going to show you in this video is that
what value is shown depends on how we
tell the computer to interpret the data
so to begin let's open up this char
program that we started in the previous
video this is what we have so far all we
are doing is taking in a value
specifically a character and storing it
in the my char variable then we are
printing out that character to show the
correlation between ASCII and integer
data I'm going to rename the variable
I'm not going to change it a whole lot
just completely to ASCII so I need to
change this all throughout my code I
think that I'll just make it a little
bit more clear as we go on in our code
this first section here all of this code
this is taking a character and
displaying it as a character but I want
to display it as an integer before I
dive in and do that I want to add a
prompt so the user knows what they're
supposed to input so I'm going to go up
here and add a line and say printf
please enter a character and I'm going
to group all of these together just like
this now how do we present a character
as an integer well it all has to do with
the format character or conversion
character same thing we are using
percent C here well you can actually
display this as an integer all you have
to do is change that to a percent I so
let's save this and I'll show you how
you can see I have an error I did not
spell the variable right so let's go
back in our code and make sure I add the
s in there
thank goodness for compiler errors right
we'll save that and now let's run it
please enter a character we'll put
capital a and an output 65 so there's
proof I wasn't lying to you a is
actually 65 it
want to try some other characters you
can do that for example you could try
six that value is 54 now what I want to
do is take an integer value and output
it as an ASCII character this will be
useful if you're ever creating an app to
convert between ASCII and integers or
the other way around so let's go in here
and we will create a new variable we'll
just call it integer and we are going to
ask the user for an integer now the
range we are going to use is 0 to 127 I
told you in the first ASCII video that
there are 128 different characters that
you can use but one of those characters
actually has the integer value of 0 so
the maximum is 127 not 128 the next
thing we are going to scan a value into
that variable and we are going to scan
this as an integer so you can use
percent D or percent I we are going to
store that value into integer now we
need to print it but we want to print it
using the percent see conversion
character which is 4 character printing
then we need to pass in the variable as
an argument just say integer right there
all right let's save this make sure it
works please enter a character a please
enter an integer between 0 and 127 let's
go with 65 and it outputs a now the
input and output is kind of crappy so
let's go clean that up I'll add a new
line here and a colon in a space there
now let's run this thing and your
character a 65 please enter an integer
between 0 and 127 let's go at 94 now I
want to talk about doing math with
characters I know it sounds kind of odd
but because every character has an
integer value behind it we can actually
use them to do math so let's go back
into our code and down here let's add to
our code
we'll make a variable that is going to
store the value of when we add two
characters and we are going to add a and
let's
a cab character which is represented as
a backslash T now let's print this I am
going to print what is being added so we
could say a which has the value 65 plus
the tab character which actually is the
ASCII value 11 and this is where we
render it percent see and then to keep
the formula consistent we're going to
put the character followed by the
integer value so in parentheses we're
going to render the same variable as an
integer and then we will put a new line
so this is a little confusing just the
way it's written out so look through it
make sure you understand what's going on
now we need to pass in the value and we
do that by putting the maths the
variable in here twice that's because
the first one goes to the C the second
one goes to the D now there is something
wrong with this code and I actually want
to run it to see if you guys can
understand what's going on so let's save
it compile and run okay so the output a
which is 65 Plus this huge space 11
equals J which is 74 the problem is that
the tab character is actually getting
rendered it is literally putting a tab
sort of how we can use a backslash n to
put a new line so let's go back in our
code and figure out how to fix this if
you literally want to put backslash T
and not render it as a tab character all
you have to do is put two backslashes
this is called escaping something so
what we are doing is escaping this
backslash and saying yo this backslash
is not being used to format our data all
we want to do is present this backslash
as a normal character now when we save
it and run it we should get what we
expected
a 65 plus T 11 equals J 74 and P I meant
tab so yeah guys that is how to work
with ASCII integers and addition with
all of that so thank you guys for
watching if you've enjoyed this video
please click subscribe and let me know
if you learned anything that was
particularly useful for anything some of
this kind of seems like oh what would we
ever really need this for and you might
be right but I'm sure there is some
situation where you're going to be
thankful that you understand the direct
correlation between ascii and integers
so thanks guys
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
