second JavaScript tutorial going to go
through a real quick PowerPoint again
and then we're going to start
programming in JavaScript or scripting
or whatever you want to call it so first
to start you show a foundation in HTML
which stands for hypertext markup
language I did a little series over that
we're going to be getting into a little
bit more than what I taught but if you
want to learn about that you can check
that out or research it online or you
can just copy what I write if you don't
feel like learning about it that's fine
too so the reason I say you should have
foundation in this is because a lot of
web development languages interact with
each other including all of these so
I've talked about a lot of these and to
continually reteach HTML in every single
series would get super annoying so I did
a series of HTML and that's all for now
so all right we will be using the html5
doctype if you don't know what that is
that's okay basically this goes at the
very beginning of your HTML document
this allows browsers to know we're using
html5 and it'll put it in standards mode
rather than quirks mode I think that's
how it's pronounced if you don't know
much about that that's okay basically
this will tell the web browser to use
html5 features and not use old browsers
if you don't view the web page in an old
browsers technique or whatever so
hopefully that hopefully that makes
sense basically if you want your website
to be in newer browsers standards then
put this html5 doctype at the beginning
of your HTML document so this is what
our entire HTML page is going to look
like we have this doctype at the top
like we talked about then we set the
HTML language we have an HTML tag and we
set the language by typing that and we
have the head and then within the head
we have a meta tag with character set
utf-8 title and we can enter a title
here basically anything you want then we
link to a stylesheet which we're not
really going to do that much
yet but if you need to link to a
stylesheet this is what it would look
like and then we end the head and then
we have the body our HTML goes here to
announce to the web browser that we're
going to have JavaScript in our code we
enclose all of our JavaScript code
within script tags so this is what
script tags look like you've probably
seen those somewhere maybe I don't know
maybe not well there's two options
inline javascript which basically we
just put the code within the HTML and
that's all and then we also have
external javascript which we actually
link to a different javascript file and
the HTML brings that into that specific
page and uses that source code again in
a reference to the original file so
basically it gets just put it gets put
into the file we're referencing it from
so we tell where we want to get the
JavaScript file and then that's all so
this will reference another JavaScript
file to be used within our web page all
right so we can have multiple script
tags within our HTML if we need
JavaScript at different points in our
web page although that usually don't do
that and when you do you can't use
inline and external at the same time so
if you look here I have a script and
we're referencing to an external
javascript file in the jaw j/s folder
named script javascript ojs and then we
have JavaScript code within the script
tags well that's two types of JavaScript
referencing or tight or coding and we
don't want that this is called this is
not going to work out right so there's
two types of paths when we're
referencing files for JavaScript we have
absolute paths and relative paths
absolute is an exact path from the root
of your website so if I'm on Caleb curry
com forward slash blogs ford slash
javascript ford slash cool script number
one dot JS that's an exact path
the route this is the route of my
website Caleb Cree calm or just forward
slash there's also relative paths this
will find the file in relation to the
file you're including it in so if I'm
working on Caleb curry calm forward
slash blocks I can include a JavaScript
file relatively by just putting forward
slash JavaScript cool script one is
basically javis hTML is going to know
that this is basically a continuation of
right here and this is how it's going to
connect it relatively but you don't have
to type in the entire Caleb curry
columns blah blah blah so forth so we do
not have to include Caleb currycomb
forward slash blocks if I change this
and I'm and I'm on a set of blogs and
more videos well we might not have this
javascript file within this relative
path I spelled videos wrong but that's
okay as well as this and we may change
our domain name - Dawson com
well now this is going to work because
it's a relative path basically it looks
relative to this but if we had an
absolute path we'd have to change this
entire source because it would no longer
be Caleb curry comm it would be awesome
com so let's try this in JavaScript
first let's download notepad plus plus
and download it at this website or
Google search it over here on the side
click download scroll down here notepad
plus plus installer and it'll start
downloading I already have it downloaded
and installed but basically you get the
point I'm going to cancel this and I am
going to open notepad plus plus so this
is what notepad plus plus looks like
you'll get something like a changelog
pop-up basically we're just going to
file new and X out of the changelog so
now we're on new file we're going to
file save and we're going to put on the
desktop this is going to be index.html
yes so now we have an index page on our
desktop and if we click it it opens in a
web browser if it doesn't you're going
to have to open with and so I mean not
open you have to open with not share
with and just select a web browser so as
you can see there's nothing really on
here that's because we haven't done
anything with the HTML so we can really
quickly create an HTML document I guess
we could say doctype HTML I'm going to
have a script within here I can put my
inline JavaScript so I could say
something like save it file save or just
ctrl s which is what I pressed then open
the web browser refresh f5 and you can
see us as hey so that's an example of
inline JavaScript
well external javascript that works like
this we could create a new file folder
and say Jess then within here say Nate
we can create it save this within that
folder let me find it and then we can
name it script j/s so now I have a
JavaScript file within this JavaScript
folder we can reference this within our
index page by within the script tag
saying source equals and then to
quotation marks Jess Ford / script
jeaious
and then we need to write some code
obviously so document right and then we
can open this in a web browser by
clicking launch in chrome and okay you
can see here's a problem it doesn't work
right exactly like we wanted to - that's
because we have to actually use the
index page since that is where we are
referencing it from so if i refresh this
you can see it stays the same and i can
change our javascript page and then if i
update it you can see it changes make
sure you save it each time and so forth
so that's all i have to say in this
video and i'll see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
