talking some more about storage engines
so basically all I have right here is a
simple database called subscribe and
yeah that's a subliminal message well
anyways what you need to do is create a
table so let's just do that real quick
remember to create table and we're going
to make a table to store messages for
like a map site or something and then in
parenthesis this is where we put the
columns so we're going to always have an
ID lowercase the ID that's what I do
anyways and then this is going to be
type int because I figure there'll be a
lot of messages and then this is going
to be auto increment and also not null
and then you put a comma for the next
line the next line will be name oh no no
sorry no name message message yeah just
message I guess and that'll be a bar
char and if actually let's change this
up a bit make this a text because it
could be a big message and varchars not
always the best friend so this will be
text and then it will be none'll and
then the last thing we have a primary
key and the primary key is message ID so
that is basic of maybe making a basic
table now when you define the engine
just like if you remember we did
character set and then we set utf-8 and
then we said Col a utf-8 underscore
Unicode and taste insensitive well
before you define the character set you
would define the storage engine so to do
this you say engine is equal to and then
you say what engine you want
and for this I may want to search my
messages for specific things and also
some broader things so I may not know
exactly how many characters or where
characters will be located so I would
like to use a full text search option
and to do that if you remember you need
my I Sam engine so my I Sam
so if I click go from here Oh No well we
need some commas here
I always forget those all right so I
forgot a comma here oh man that's
embarrassing
so if you click go you saw that green
bar pop up and we see we have a table of
your messages let's go look at it and
you can see it all kind of looks the
same you don't really it doesn't say
what kind of table it is so the next
thing we're going to do is I'm going to
show you how to tell what kind of engine
a table is set through the SQL box what
you want to type in here is show table
status click go sweet so as you can see
we have a table messages an engine is my
I Sam so I'm going to make another table
and I'll show you what it would look
like so as you can see here this is my
new table I'm all crap oh shoot alright
let me try this again without clicking
clear here is my table and it's going to
be friends if you remember I made a
table or a few videos ago for my friends
so if I click go you can see this is not
the same engine type as the last one and
it made a table friends so now to the
SQL box we can say
click go show table status and you'll
see these two have two different types
of engines this is how you view your
engine types so now that we have this
you may think man I wish this was my
eyes Sam but no it's not but I'm going
to show you how to fix that what you
want to do within the SQL all you have
to do is an alter command because we're
altering the table so we're altering the
table or setting a message message ah I
was friends wasn't it yeah I think it
was friends and then what we're going to
do is say engine is equal to my eye Sam
simple as that what we do now is show
table status and click go you can see
they are now both my eye Sam so that is
how you change the engine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
