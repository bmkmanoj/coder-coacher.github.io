this is the series of installing MySQL
and PHP on DreamHost so where are we
exactly we are in FTP through FileZilla
and were connected to our website as you
can see I'm actually using the domain
name PHP MySQL tutorial dot Dream
hosters com
and you can see I'm connected to the
website and we're actually going to
create a PHP script that is going to
connect to our database so we already
have index dot PHP but there's nothing
really in it so let's go ahead and edit
it I actually already have it open so
I'm just gonna slide over here this is
it that's all we got well we're actually
going to clear this out and I'm gonna
teach you a little bit about PHP but do
keep in mind that this is not a PHP
tutorial series by any means the very
first thing you're going to want to do
is run a function and that function is
called MySQL of MySQL I underscore
connect and then open parenthesis this
thing is going to have four arguments
the first one is the host the second one
is the user this third one is the
password and then the fourth one is the
name of the database so where do we get
that information well that is the same
information that we used when we created
our database so I actually took a
snapshot of it let me scroll over here
here is all of my information although
if you need to find yours you can go
into the panel go to goodies MySQL
databases then you can find most of your
information here you can find your
database name the user and the host name
and then I put the password in here as
the description so that way I didn't
have to remember it so all we got to do
is put those in exactly perfect don't
mess anything up I'm just going to place
where they go so that way I don't forget
any and then I'm gonna go back and fill
them in the first one I'm always going
to do is the host because that's the one
that determines whether we can connect
at all so comparing to this we just
probably can just copy this paste that
in there and then the next one is the
username which is right here third one
is the password which is right here and
finally the fourth one we need the
database name now all we have to do is
go back to our website and I'm gonna
show you guys the classic mistake so all
we got to do is go to domains manage
domains and then we can visit our
website and it says hello well what the
crap I updated that file but nothing
happened that's because we have to
remember to go through FileZilla first
there we go
upload it let it finish well done now go
back to the website do refresh and you
can see the page is blank so that could
be good or that could be bad if it's
blank because of a good reason that
means nothing bad happened and it's
working if it's blank for a bad reason
it means you have errors turned off and
it just doesn't show you anything even
if there is something broken so let's
let's say that we have an incorrect
website and we just put wrong website
right here save it upload it and refresh
you can see we're getting errors now
let's compare these errors to the ones
with the username and password and I'm
going to mess up the username here go
back refresh oh got uploaded
all right access denied for user PHP
MySQL tutorial now this is a little more
helpful to me because I know that I was
actually able to make a connection to
the host I just have the wrong username
password or database so that makes
debugging a little bit easier for me so
what you can get from this is that if
your error looks like this then the
first thing you need to do is fix your
host not your username your password or
your database if you go in here and
you're like crap my usernames not right
you're wasting your time because you're
not even making a connection to the
thing at all so it doesn't matter
whether your username or password is
right it's kind of like imagine trying
to sign in to YouTube but you're
actually not on YouTube it would make
more sense to go to YouTube before you
try correcting your username and
password I think you guys understand
what I'm saying so let's fix that upload
it and refresh no errors so that means
we are officially connected to the
database now if you guys are getting
some errors you can post them in the
comments and if I know the answer I'll
reply or if you guys have a similar
error and you're able to help others you
can reply to people who have common
issues below and that way we can help
each other out but just make sure that
you look over this very carefully that
you got every single thing absolutely
perfect on here and also I wanted to
point out this is not the same user and
password that you use for FTP if I go
back to FileZilla you can see I have
kalcker to with a password and I'm
connecting to the website it's not the
same in fact though even the host isn't
the same on here there's no MySQL but
here it's MySQL dot PHP SQL tutorial
doctoring posters com
so the host and the user and the
and then the additional database they're
all different so don't get them confused
with File Transfer Protocol there are
two separate things that's basically all
I have to say in this video now that we
have a connection to the database in the
next video we're going to actually
display some information on the page
from our database so that one's gonna be
fun because we're actually gonna finally
do some real coding and making our first
app I guess you could say so thanks guys
be sure to subscribe and I'll see you in
the next video what are we iterating
over we're iterating over each row and
what is it we want to access within the
row we want to access the column or if
you want to name it a little more
specifically you could say the field
because that is an individual value for
a column and then within here we could
echo the field let's save it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
