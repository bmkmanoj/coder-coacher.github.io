about adding intervals for music theory
now we talked about this a little bit in
the last video and I'm probably taught
horribly because I don't know I'm sick
and that's my excuse but anyways adding
intervals is really not that hard
let me just give you an example and
explain it with that if we have 1/3 plus
1/3 plus 1/4 well you may say 3 plus 3
plus 4 but that's going to give you the
wrong answer because if you remember an
interval counts the one you start on so
we can't count the same one twice for
this so how to figure there's an
equation for it there's three intervals
right now we figure how many there are
and subtract one so there's three so we
get two all right
now we add these together four plus
three plus three four five six seven
eight nine ten and then we subtract two
that will give us eight okay
it means it's an octave let's try it one
two three now we have a third one two
three and then another fourth one oops
one two three four so from here to here
so that's a good way to figure it out if
you don't want to worry about the
equation let me give you a funky one
okay I go hit third plus 1/4 plus 1/5
plus a second plus a unison plus an
octave right now you're probably closer
you get so many
okay count that but uh what we do is we
have a third sweet
now if you're noticed we count the same
thing twice for this one which means we
can't count on 1/4 let's just okay we
have a be seen that's a third now fourth
c d e f now fifth f f ABC if g i knew
that a b c now a second CD a unison d
and then an eighth d e f g a b c d one
two three four five six seven
cool so you start here now look we're
counting the same c twice and that's
going to throw off our interval because
we can't count the same note twice so we
cross it out they have F all we're
counting same F twice twice we cross it
out we are counting the same C twice we
crossed one of them out we're counting
the same D twice cross it out oh well
we're counting the same D twice cross
that one out too it's kind of weird but
uh that's how it works because we can't
count the same D twice which gives us 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
18 18 this isn't 18th preacher Keanu so
the sort of the equation for this would
have been figure out how many intervals
are 1 2 3 4 5 6 there's 6 minus 1 5
right
and then we add them together 3 plus 4 4
5 6 7 plus 5
eight nine ten eleven twelve plus two
thirteen fourteen plus 115 plus a 12 and
23 minus five would be 18 boom
so now I'm sure you are an interval
adding expert thanks to me
I know hold your applause so yeah in the
next video we're going to be talking
about something less boring
hopefully probably not so yeah subscribe
and I'll see you then bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
