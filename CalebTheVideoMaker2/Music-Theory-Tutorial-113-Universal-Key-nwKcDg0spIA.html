I'll be talking about something I've
already talked about a little bit but I
don't think I've ever actually said what
it was called just probably bad mistake
of mine but oh well right so yeah this
is known as universal key you may also
hear this referred to as the universal
scale now what this is is replacing the
notes within a scale or the key
signature with Roman numerals or numbers
so we have done this before such as when
we went over chord progression we had
the first chord the second chord the
third chord fourth chord 5th chord 6
scored and 7th chord this was major
minor minor major major minor diminished
now what this the point of this is is so
you can transpose from pd key and the
concepts still stay the same so for
example if I tell somebody playing music
to go from AC over to a G well that's
going up a fifth SI e well in there at
sound of music here 45 in front I see we
can go one two three four five up to
this line which is AG please one two
three four five so rather than saying go
from C to G I can say go from the first
note up to the 5th note of that scale
makes sense so this is basically the
same thing as the scale degree whoopsies
so now if we are in the scale of let's
go a major well we have we have e well
first we can make every single note in
the musical alphabet so e f g a b c d
and i don't have this scale mole on the
circle of fifths it goes c g
d EI e on the circle of fists we talked
about that so this is to find out the
sharps and flats basically just sharps
here 10 sharps flats it's not that one
this one has one F harp d s to F sharp
and C sharp a has three F sharp C sharp
and G sharp then II will have F sharp C
sharp G sharp d sharp so that's the
scale that's that's one way we can
figure this out f sharp C sharp G sharp
and D sure another way is just follow
the whole step half step pattern so we
could have e f g a b c d and the pattern
is whole whole half full whole e f g a
whole half so e to f that's not a whole
step because there's no there's no black
key between E&amp;amp;F so we have to go another
step to F sharp whole step from F sharp
is G so G sharp Oh have a half step from
G sharp to a that's right so that's half
step a to be it have to be like that's
right because there's black key between
a and B that's a whole step BC is not a
whole step because there's no black key
between B and C so that's a not have to
be to c sharp and then c sharp to D this
would have to be d sharp d sharp to e is
a half step so I just recreated scale
another took way longer than it had to
be but anyways now I can say this is the
first second third fourth fifth
sep scale degree or basically the degree
of the universal key degree is what how
far into the scale so this is the first
note now when I'm composing music or
cords or anything rather than saying e.g
ABC all these letters I can say the
numbers so I could go one two three 3 2
4 and then ford five and then five to
one so what would this be in this case
if ve to G sharp to a to the fifth which
is B to the first route / tonic two
three that would be so yeah now what if
we are in the key of C and we have the
same pattern well we have c d e f g a vc
that's the scale of C I think you should
know that by now well we have the first
which is see the third which is e the
fourth F fifth G and then the tonic or
the root C so now this pattern let me
erase the list craft appeared
stays consistent with the scale rather
than rather than figuring out the
letters by that you can just say the
first to the third to the fourth to the
fifth to the first now in any scale such
as a major this is what would be played
and if you're in see this is what would
be played hopefully that makes sense
that is the basis of the universal key
and we will be building off of this as
we go and I know it's kind of off topic
from what we've been learning but I just
thought I'd address this so yeah that's
all I have for this video see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
