video maker - this video is your second
video in your database clustering theory
this video we are going to be talking
about terminology so we need to make
sure we are on the same page because I'm
going to be throwing words out and
you're like oh this is a database node
and you know I'll be thinking obviously
it's a node of a cluster and you're
going to be like snowed Jas and we're
not going to be on the same page so
let's make sure we just build the
foundation nice and so I know you guys
just want to go in there and start
building clusters and configuring stuff
but slow down okay so let me give you a
little story about how it all got
started
several 9s came up to me and was like
yell bro we need some videos of a
database clustering and I was like oh
thank you I could do that and then
reality came in slightly in the face and
then I realized you know I don't really
know that much about database clustering
but I know enough to know that I can
learn the material and that was enough
for me and that gave me the benefit
because I'm coming into this still
fairly new and all these little
confusing terms that you know the
database pros are like obviously this is
what this means like everyone knows that
and I'm sitting there like yeah I have
no idea what you're talking about
well I'm able to take it a little slower
make sure I really define these basic
terms so by the end of this video it's
probably already half way over because
I've been blabbering this whole time you
are going to have the foundation needed
to start working with building and
managing your database clusters now
unfortunately this is a series on
technology and you know technology can
never just be simple so even with these
terms there are disagreements amongst
fellow database clusters so I'm going to
give you the terms that I believe are
the most widely accepted and most
appropriate terms but if for any reason
you disagree that's totally okay feel
free to unsubscribe leave a comment
saying how I wasted your life and move
on but if you're a beginner I'm going to
give you the definitions
are going to help you the most in your
database career so let's get started no
more wasting time the very first thing
is database cluster now we kind of
talked about this in the previous video
the cluster is basically just you know a
group of computers working to build the
data layer of your application so rather
than just having one computer you know
you can connect this in this like
illuminati confirmed shape and these are
all going to be what's called the
database cluster now a database cluster
is a big thing so inside of a database
cluster we have other terms so for
example one of these terms are going to
here is no now I mentioned these are
computers right well a more proper term
would be node and a node is just an
instance of a database so for example an
instance of MySQL you download MySQL you
install it you have the thing running in
the background you have an instance of a
database now if you put that little
instance of a database inside of a
bigger collection of these nodes you
could say that it is a node of a
database cluster so the reason I'm
making this kind of distinction is
because I mentioned that these are
computers but they're not technically
technically having to be computers for
example you can have one node on a
computer and then you can actually have
another node on the same computer so
basically you're running two instances
of a database on one computer this can
come up if you're talking about like
shared hosting where there's multiple
database instances on one computer but
if you don't really care about all the
details you can just think of each piece
as something running that database in
most circumstances you're going to have
one node per computer so you have a
computer over here and that is going to
be
and that will connect to other computers
which serve also as one node the next
term we are going to discuss is topology
now topology is the study of tops of
things on a spike if it's totally not
the topology describes the
infrastructure in the structure of your
database cluster so there's different
ways you can set up your database
cluster and you know the fancy word for
that is topology so there's two main
topologies we have what's known as
master master and master slave within
these topologies you're going to have
different types of nodes so for example
you can either have a master node or you
can have you guessed it haha
slave node now what is the primary
difference between a master node and a
slave node so the master node is kind of
like the boss node the master node you
can write to it and you can read from it
the slave node on the other hand the
only thing you can do with the slave
node is read from so the slave node
actually just copies its data from the
master so this way I'm describing it is
kind of the typical explanation for a
master slave topology for a master
master topology you basically just
replace this slave node with a master
node and what that means is you can
write and read from all of the nodes
let's compare these two topologies so
this is the master slave topology and
the way this works is you write data to
the master and then that data gets
transmitted to the slaves the master
master you can write to any of these
things so you can write to this one and
that data will be propagated to the
other masters or you can write to this
one and it will propagate to the other
answers or you can write to this one and
it'll propagate to the other masters so
you can see this gets a little bit
complex and some people will even tree a
master master topology as a master slave
topology
so now it's getting really confusing
because you have a master master
topology but you're treating it as a
master slave so in that situation you
kind of pick one of these masters to be
like the master master so let's say this
is the master master this is the one
we're going to read and write from and
then these are the ones you're going to
read from but they still have the
ability to write in case that situation
does come up okay so this is a little
complex and don't worry about getting
that all right now that'll kind of piece
together as time goes on that's all I
really got for this video I know it was
short there's only a couple terms but
just to review overall you have a
database cluster that cluster has one of
two topologies master master or master
slave those decide what kind of nodes
you have either a master node which has
read and write or a slave node which is
just read a node itself is just an
instance of a database you can have
multiple nodes on one computer if you
want but most of the time you're going
to have one node per computer that is
your introduction to database clustering
terminology and as always please be sure
to subscribe that really really helps my
channel out as always please click like
and you know follow me on Twitter I
don't know why I said it like that but
do it also share these videos with a
friend that would really help me out and
I would just I'd be really thankful so
thank you guys and I'll see you in the
next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
