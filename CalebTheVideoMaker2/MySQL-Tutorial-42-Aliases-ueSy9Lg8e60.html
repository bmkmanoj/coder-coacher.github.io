speaking of what is called an alias I'll
spell that out for you and this is
basically a nickname for something so if
you remember in the last video we had a
function concat and then in parentheses
I put my first name calling the last
name which you don't really need to come
in there but that's what I did so yeah
and when you use that in a query such as
select concat first name last name when
the table shows up at the bottom
displaying what the results are it's
going to have a column for your new okay
the first name last name and it will say
concat first name last name which isn't
a very good column name so what you can
use is an alias and basically it's just
a nickname like if you don't know what
that is
it's something you can call it so I
could say concat first name comma plus
last name write in parentheses and then
I could say as yes name and what this
will do is it will actually rename it to
name so when we have the table this
table right here that a race I redraw it
the column name will now be named as
because it has an alias and this can be
used for lots of things let's say we use
another function date format which
basically just formats the date so you
can have the year the month the seconds
in whatever order you really want
basically and it doesn't look nice
saying date format bla bla bla bla
so we can do is use that function and
then say time or as date as day or
anything we want we can just rename it
to whatever we want using an alias and
it's just simple said by saying pass and
then whatever you want to call it so I
can actually do this for anything like
that I'm selecting so if I'm selecting
we have a table and it's for employees
let's say for a business and I employ
people and every single person has an
employee ID
yeah Bianca versus an employee so every
single employee has one of these and
when I retrieve it in my table I don't
want it to say employee ID because I
wanted to say I mean I don't want to say
this I wanted to split it to say
employee identification number or
something what I can do is say select
the ID you can say ass and then say and
right here and say oh whatever we want
right so now when we get that return
table
it won't say e ID here it will say
employee ID whatever you put here it's
going to go there so that's an example
of an alias and uh
I'll be showing some more about this in
the upcoming videos because these can
actually simplify joins because it's
less naming and basically when you use
an alias you're making a nickname so
when you have huge queries you can sort
make sort of make shortcuts and your
naming and I'll be showing you that I
know this video is kind of short but
that's all I have to say about aliases
and yeah so try it out for yourself say
select something as it's remain it -
whatever you want but make sure there's
no space is there it'll give you some
error right so yeah you can also use it
after functions to make things look
nicer in the next video I'll actually be
showing uses of the alias with columns
and also joints trust me makes the thing
that's a lot easier all on PHP my admin
in the next video so check it out yo see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
