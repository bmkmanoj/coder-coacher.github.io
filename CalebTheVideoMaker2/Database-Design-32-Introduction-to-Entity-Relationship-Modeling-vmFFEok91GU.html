database design series I just wanted to
share with you real quick you guys
literally used like all my chalk it's
crazy so if there's any chalk companies
out there and you're looking for
sponsorship I will hook you up
I will tell I'll like I will advertise
your product every video I'll be like
wow look how smooth that chalk is get
some of your chalk or you guys could
just like you know send me a couple of
thousand dollars I can buy like a
lifetime supply of chalk right pretty
awesome but either way we're going to
get into something new in this video and
this is going to be cold okay so there's
a couple different names for this so
basically it's just a standard it's a
standard for drawing databases and the
couple terms you might hear or acronyms
I guess EE
our model er D or ER model or just
database design whichever ones easiest
basically these are some terms used to
refer to a method used to draw out your
entire database structure these videos
have been drawn tables and lines and
drama chalk drawing tables and lines and
stuff and all kinds of cool things like
that but actually I haven't officially
designed any database so what we're
going to do and now that we've learned
most of the concepts the only thing we
haven't really covered is normal forms
which we'll be getting into those but
anyways and I'll make them easy don't
worry
so what we're going to do is we're going
to learn the standard for drawing these
databases we're going to practice with
that and then we're going to learn the
normal forms and then we're going to
design databases it's a lot of stuff but
we're going to do it so we're going to
be getting into these standards I'm
drawing databases and obviously the
standards kind of rough I mean there's
there's not a specific way you have to
do everything because that's annoying
and dumb so what we're going to do is
we're going to be drawing pretty simple
things and I'll just be kind of
illustrating kind of how that works in
this video so what this means is
enhanced entity relationship
model enhance relationship diagram
enhanced relationship model yeah I think
that's what they stand for I don't think
it's answer relation man stands for a
relationship which error is a difference
as you should probably know by now a
relation is a table a relationship is a
connection between two tables yeah so
anyways oh yeah so we're going to be
talking about these designing techniques
I'll probably just call them like er D
or ER e ER or who knows but yeah the way
you do it is you define your database
structure so anything that is DDL pretty
much data definition language part of
SQL we talked about that a long time ago
we're not going to define the actual
values for example if we have a table
for users we're not going to put in a
row Oh Caleb curry with the password of
sweet pie is delicious 24 and the email
of yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah dot-com
and the telephone number of 100 you wish
or anything like that we're not going to
put anything like that in there we're
just gonna put the columns username
password email telephone 3d that is so
cool Wow okay anyways let's get started
so to draw a table a database table you
just draw a square it's like super easy
okay Wow who would've thought and so
easy right and obviously doing this on a
chalkboard is not very convenient
because for one you're limited in space
and for to most of you guys don't have
chalkboards and for three I don't know a
third reason but most of this is
actually done on a computer and we will
be doing that hopefully soon so stick
with these concepts we'll be getting
into on the computer design for whatever
reasons and obviously as I make new
videos in the future that's what I'll be
doing so for now we'll learn the
concepts and you can download
entity-relationship design programs such
as MySQL workbench
I made it other ones like Verta bellow
or something I remember
Skol and a couple others which you can
design for any relational database
management system on that one so go
check out my other videos or my playlist
I think it's under reviews or something
but I don't know look up database design
on my channel see what I got you can
also just look up EER or erd
relationship or design and you can get
all kinds of apps and programs to help
you design your databases and then some
of them have what's known as engineering
so you could forward engineer your
database design and it will basically
just program your database for you and
it's super easy yeah but I'm getting way
off topic so let's get back on topic
okay so here's how we draw a table what
we do is we give it a table name so you
put the table name either right here and
then a complete column like that or just
right above it so we'll just put it up
above it right now so this is a user
table and what we can do with in here is
we put the columns this way vertically
when we write them horizontally but we
list them this way we're not putting
them across here because if we put them
across here we would assume that we're
going to have row value like Caleb
password and is awesome email is legit
or cool and then the password I already
set password but we're not doing that
we're just going to put the columns so
the first column we could have is user
ID because we're just going to use a
surrogate primary key in this example so
I'm going to user ID now when you get
into it you can also put other things
like data types in here and any other
restrictions you have such as not null
if you wanted but for now and for most
of the design for design concepts I'm
not going to do that because I'm going
to be writing the same thing over and
over again and you kind of only do that
when you're finalizing your database so
you can kind of worry about the data
types later on but for now we're just
going to get the columns figure that out
good we'll go from there so user ID
username
that's a password and so forth
hopefully you guys can read that from it
up and then what we do if we want to
create another table guess what we do oh
we just draw another box right and we
connect these with lines and we can
those there's certain ways to draw lines
that represent different little
relationships like that's one way to do
it or we could have like yeah I mean you
get the point
oh I found a nice big piece of chalk
cool all right so that's how you do that
now that's pretty much all the basics of
entity relationship diagram drawing just
remember we put these in here the
columns and what we can also do if we
wanted we could put indexes down here
maybe put like index types and then we
could also draw our relationship types
with different lines and we can draw our
foreign keys by either putting them down
here or doing some other kind of thing
now there's also other conventions you
might hear heard of or reviews like UML
and other design techniques and I'm not
saying those are bad I'm just saying
this one super easy for beginners and
for experts so yeah now that's all I got
to say in this video so be sure to
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video where we'll be starting some
awesome coolness so yeah see you there
yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
