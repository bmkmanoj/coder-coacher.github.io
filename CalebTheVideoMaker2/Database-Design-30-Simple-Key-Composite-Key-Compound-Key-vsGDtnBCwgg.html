talking about simple and composite and
compound keys these are categories of
keys so like when you define a database
you can say alright this is a primary
key or you can say it's foreign key but
you don't have to say oh this is a
natural simple primary key like those
are just categories you want to define
that within our database so these these
terms that we're learning are more for
design sake so you know the best design
for your database but you don't actually
have to define it right like for example
this piece of chalk right here you can
define this as a white piece of chalk
now what kind of white piece of chalk is
it well it's X brand or whatever you
don't have to define that when you're
telling someone oh here's a piece of
chalk that was the worst example ever
moving on all right simple and composite
okay so simple means that the key
consists of one called composite means
it consists of two or more columns this
is most common with natural keys because
natural keys can be a combination of
multiple columns where as a surrogate
key is just a random number one call so
surrogate keys are simple composite keys
are multiple columns so for example we
could have a first name Plus last name
plus email this could be an example of a
composite key because this whole group
as a whole is the primary key so we
could have Jim Jake and legit
or awesome at whatever blah blah blah
and then we kind of know there's another
one with the same exact name Jim Jake
and we could have a different email
these two are still separate they're
unique because the combination of the
three are unique Jim and Jake repeat but
the email is different so these as a
whole or different values for primary
keys so that's an example of a composite
primary key the reason is is because it
consists of 3 columns 1 2 3 this is an
example of a composite key a composite
natural key to be specific because we're
just we're using things that are already
naturally being stored within our
database now let's think of a simple key
as natural oil username would be a good
one because the net user name can be
something that can be used by itself as
a key it's simple because it's only one
column pretty simple I know huh all
right so I want to talk about another
term you might run into
and that is compound okay now I want to
clarify that some people and some
relational database management systems
don't clarify the difference between
these two composite and compound terms
and they just use them interchangeably
as meaning a key with multiple columns
some people go a step farther and break
these up into two separate terms so
we're going to be defining both of the
terms but you might see them used
interchangeably so don't be so super
technical about the details and don't be
like correcting people oh hold up that
ain't a composite key that's a compound
key the because most people are just
gonna look at you like you're an idiot
and not really care alright so anyways
moving on a compound key is basically
when it's a call it's a key that has
multiple columns and they're all keys
themselves so this is a the most common
example of this is for intermediary
tables something about like this if we
have a table used to store information
about videos we could say it's a video
table we could also have another table
over here
we could have a user table actually here
let's let's do it this way we're going
to have a comment state okay and then
within this comments table we could have
a column of what video they're
commenting on you see well this is a
many-to-many relationship right so this
this uh might not work out well with
database design because one user can
comment on multiple videos and then a
one video can have comments from
multiple people so the best way to do
this rather than having two separate
tables like this we would create video
table and then we'd have an intermediary
table and this would be
video comments or user comments you see
what I'm saying so we get a connection
between the user as you video to create
an immediate table and it's split up
with two keys so we have the user ID and
then the video ID and then we could have
another column for the message or the
date or whatever else well you can see
if you don't know what I'm talking about
go see my videos that we're designing
many to many relationships but otherwise
if you do know I'm talking about moving
on you can see that the entire key
itself every user and video ID
combination has to be unique that might
up that might be a bad example because a
user could comment on the same video
more than once so this is probably not
the best example oh let me think of a
good one but anyways this would be an
example of a we could add another column
in here to make a unique we could have
the date and the message so the message
has to be unique and the user ID has to
be unique and the video ID has to be
unique that'd be a composite a compound
a compound key let me say for example
real quick so a good example of this
would be for college we can have a user
we could have a student student table
and we could have a class table right so
this table holds information about the
student this information table builds
information about the class now how do
we show enrollment should we make
columns for every student here no
because it's a many-to-many relationship
that means we need an intermediary table
between the two so this is a good
example
sorry about my bad example in the last
one but that's a good example the
composite key because the two columns
themselves wouldn't be enough so we'd
have to add another one which is not a
key in itself but for this one we could
have a column we'll name the table
student classes
or just student class whatever you want
to call it student classes and within
here we could have the IDs student ID
and class ID now this combination
between student ID and class ID must be
unique so let's say we have the value 7
+ 4 7 &amp;amp; 6 7 &amp;amp; 7 that would work but if
we had something like 7 &amp;amp; 4 again we'd
get an error because that's already in
there and that's not going to work out
so well so the combination has to be
unique and these are also both foreign
keys which point to another table so
both of them are keys and the primary
key is compounded because we have the
student ID and the class ID as one giant
ID or one giant key I should say because
the combination has to be unique we can
repeat 7 on this side and we can repeat
like 6 on this side but we can't repeat
the combination of 7 &amp;amp; 6 they have to be
unique as a whole so composite keys
that's when you have at least one is a
is not a key in itself for compound they
all have to be keys so for the composite
let's look back at the the example we
gave in the last one with the videos the
video comments let's say this is the
intermediary table blown up just so we
can see it real big this is the user ID
and then we have the video ID
well this isn't sufficient to make
uniqueness because a user could comment
on the same video more than once if
you're applying the comments or
something like that so we need another
column we could add the timestamp or we
can just say the time column and this is
going to keep a unique time because you
can't comment on the same video at
exactly the same time twice right so
that would ensure uniqueness so we can
ensure these three as a whole are unique
that's an example of composite key
because at least one column is not a key
in itself this is a key because it
points to a user's table this is a key
because it points to a videos table this
is not a key because it's just a column
for that intermediary table so that
those are the three terms I want to talk
about in this video one other thing I
want to talk about real quick I'm not
going to say what the best technique is
for this I'm just going to say what some
people do with an intermediary table
some people will give it a surrogate key
on top of the compound key so for
example with the college keep switching
back and forth between examples I'm
probably confusing you they might add
something such as enrollment ID and then
we have the student ID and then we have
the class ID these are both foreign keys
and then I'll use this enrollment ID as
a distant surrogate key for this table
although it's not a requirement for
certain relational database management
systems some relational database
management systems or frameworks or
something are not going to be able to
work well with a composite or compound
keys so you might need to have a simple
key which in that case you could still
have the idea of a compound key this
group right here the student in the
class
I'm going to have that indexed or
whatever you want or you can just
enforce uniqueness with that but then
you can use an enrollment ID so you can
have like seven and then you can have
student six in the class four and then
you've got eight with the student 4 in
class 12 and then you can nine with the
student 16 in class four and then we
could have ten with a student sixteen in
class 12 and so forth that's just an
example of what some people do I'm
leaving that up to you and we'll just
see what I do up in this other series up
in the future parts of the series so
yeah hope that was useful be sure to
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
