this video we are going to be talking
about some of the technologies that are
being advertised and some of the
different tools behind this whole
machine learning movement the very first
thing that I want to define is Big Data
so this is you know a big word about
there right this this is like if you put
hashtag Big Data in your Twitter man
you're gonna go viral I mean this is
like so big okay so what is Big Data
essentially Big Data is getting all of
your data into one location so you can
run queries and analytics on your data
so this is the equivalent to the data
set that I've been using in the previous
videos so big data is getting all of
your data into one location whether it
came from a database you know if that's
a database by the way or it came from
some spreadsheets or I don't know other
places all this data gets combined into
one thing and we can run analytics on it
now so when you're dealing with big data
you're often going to be using something
like a data warehouse I actually haven't
talked about data warehouses on this
YouTube channel yet I don't think so
that's pretty cool we're gonna learn
something new here today a data
warehouse is sort of like a database but
it's designed for analytical processing
so there's two real types of processing
when we're talking about databases or
data processing one is transactional and
the other is analytical a transactional
data store would be efficient and good
for a system such as a web store where
you're buying things and selling things
that's because we're going to be having
a lot of little inserts and updates and
deletes whereas an analytical system
that is more designed for the Select
statement and it would not be optimal
for a web store so these are kind of two
different types of systems out there
the data warehouse is good for
analytical processing so oftentimes you
will have a database powering a website
for example and that's going to be
optimized for transactional and then
we're going to extract that data and put
it into a data warehouse where it's
optimized for analytical and that's
where we're going to using that's what
we're going to be using processing to
run analytics on that data some data
systems have both of these combined and
that's kind of cool I'm not really going
to get into that a whole lot but
essentially for this series you just
need to know that we're going to get all
of our data into one location where is
optimized for analytical processing now
this process taking data from let's say
we have a transactional database taking
it and putting it into an analytical
database such as a data warehouse or
just a database optimized for analytics
this is known as the ETL process so this
is short for extract transform and load
so if you think of each one of these
pieces here they all have data and
they're not all of the right format for
this data warehouse so we're going to
extract that data we're gonna transform
it into the right format and then we're
going to load it into the data warehouse
so once again that was extract transform
load yeah pretty cool there are a lot of
other cool technologies out there that
might be useful for you
for example there's something called
Hadoop now I'm pretty sure it's
pronounced Hadoop with the emphasis on
the ha I'm not positive but I have quite
the history of mispronouncing things so
I actually looked this one up and I'm
convinced but some people say Hadoop or
Hadoop doesn't really matter so Hadoop
is a storage system allowing you to
store all different kinds of data
formats and running analytics on that
this is less of a database and more of a
file system so you'll definitely want to
more about that as I need to as well so
maybe we won't get into that someday but
for now just know that if you want to
skip the ETL process you may want to
look into something like Hadoop there
are a lot of extensions or versions of
Hadoop that are optimized for machine
learning where you can bypass that ETL
process and work with various different
formats another thing that's pretty cool
is called database Federation this is a
trick it's a trick okay so it's like
when you talk to one database but you're
really talking to multiple databases so
you have one interface that's going to
communicate with multiple databases so
it simulates having all of the data in
one location and you can write a query
as if you're talking to one database but
the data is going to come from multiple
databases
once again this is called Federation
alright so that is this kind of an
overview of the different technologies
that you might run into when you're
talking about machine learning I also
gave you a brief introduction of what
each one was and how they worked so
hopefully that will help you in future
projects or if you just hear these words
out there and you're not really sure
what they are now you have a brief
understanding so thank you guys and I'll
see you in the next video it's gonna be
a fun one so catch you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
