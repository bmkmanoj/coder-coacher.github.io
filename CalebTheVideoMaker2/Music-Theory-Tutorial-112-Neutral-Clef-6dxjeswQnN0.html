believe this will be the last cleft
video at least for a long time I don't
know if I have anything else planned for
it so this is over what's called neutral
cliff hopefully I suppose right so what
this clef is it's basically the same
concept five lines but the cleft looks
like almost like a box and it's
basically saying these lines don't have
a specific pitch that's not G that's not
a that's not anything it's whatever you
want it to be so that's why it's
indefinite pitch the reason is
percussion is a bad choice of wording is
because it's not always for percussion
or maybe for something else and there's
a lot of percussion instruments that are
pitched so to say that it's a percussion
it's precautionary Russian instruments
use it so we're going to go with name
neutral cliff so here's what it
essentially is so you've got the five
lines of a staff 45 alright you may see
it as two little lines here or more
typically you'll see as a box like this
get this out of here and this is to say
that it does not have a specific pitch
for each line this will often time be
used for percussion instruments focus so
we may have
I had or symbol so we can have that we
can still have four four time which I
think goes on this side I think yeah
yeah so we still have the time signature
we just don't have specific pitches we
can assign this one to snare drum or to
claw phase or two I can't think of any
other instruments that's sad i got to
its truths so that is the basis of
neutral clef now you may see what's
called a key at the bottom of the music
let me erase all this crap which will
say what line or what nope or symbol
applies to what instrument for example
you may see X well how do you know what
X is you can have this little box down
at the bottom of the music that will
have an X and say it's high hat but
often time you will just see right above
it and I'll say I happen or even
sometimes you have the step clap claps
both staff and along the side it'll say
I had snare bass and so forth so you
know what is assigned to which line or
space now there's some advantages and
disadvantages to this and I'm sure you
can figure them out because sometimes
the typical way to notate things changes
and you're not sure what because the
author of the music or the composer is
not clear enough to say what line is
supposed to be what or how something is
to be played for example if you have
three notes in a row and then you have
then you have an X well if you're on
snare drum you may play a rim shot or
oops if you're on another instrument you
may play something else you may think
as a rim click you may think of it as a
symbol you may think of it as a side of
the drum shell click you may think I'm
saying most precaution stuff because
it's usually known as a percussion cloth
so how exactly do you know unless
there's something that says RS and then
in the key it says RS and says rim shot
to say what that means or SS for stick
shot or RC for rim click or SC for stick
click or ss4 dollars and on so there's a
whole bunch of confusion that can be
built off of this problem with the
stupid indefinite pitch clip and there's
no common there's common ways do things
but it's not exact and it varies from
person person now another thing you'll
see especially with percussion
instruments is staffs with less than
five lines you'll often see three lines
for example because you don't need all
that extra space for one instrument that
plays on the same pitch every single
time see what I'm saying now I also want
to clarify something just because this
says indefinite pitch does not mean that
certain instruments do not have pitch
for example a snare drum drum of these
bad boys um I got the snares here I got
some sticks playing it see what I'm
saying this is considered an anon
pitched instrument but it does have a
specific pitch when you hit it it may
vibrate at a g-sharp the thing is the
pitch is not determinable easily by ear
it's more of an importance to match
other snare drummers so this one's G
sharp this one should be G sharp too so
these ones sound together in tune
although if you have a band playing a
horn
and it's a plan a AG it's not going to
really make a difference whether this is
a G sharp and F sharp and a sharp it's
considered indefinite because it does
not have to match everything to sound
nicely but some percussion instruments
such as the temporary drawing these bad
boys does have specific pitches this one
would be say G sharp and that is
important to know because if it's out of
tune it'll sound weird and it needs to
match what's else going on although this
is not something you typically change
the tuning commonly because there's a
pedal here you'll change it either once
at the beginning of the song or between
certain pieces of the song but you're
not going to hit it and then tune it to
a different note like be play that one
and turn into a see it's not like a
instrument where you change the pitch
after every single note that's why
there's multiple ones of them to play
different pitches so that is the basis
of percussion cliff AK and definite
cliff pitch club and also known as was
that first word I used neutral club so I
forgot that for a minute so that's all I
have to say for this video in the next
video we'll be going over something even
awesomer no more clefts for now yeah so
see then see it I already said see if by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
