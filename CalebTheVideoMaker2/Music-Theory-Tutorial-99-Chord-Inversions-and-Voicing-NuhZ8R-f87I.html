everything's going good I wanted to say
in the last video I said we were going
to talk about articulation but I changed
my mind I'm now going to be talking
about chord inversions and voicing so
when we have a chord such as the C chord
it consists of the see the E and the G
that is the way it is played now the
first note is called the root it's what
we call call the note and I may say call
it the tonic at times because it is the
tonic of a scale for example so the
first note is the root it's the name of
this chord c e and g the root is what
chord is called so in a G chord G B and
D the root is G it's the one we start on
now
if we take the G now let's go back to C
chords so we have the C which is the
root then we have E and G if let's say
we alter flop them so they're cge higher
E that's called a different voicing
sounds different here I'm still playing
a C and E and a G and the C's still in
the room so that is called a different
voicing of the C major chord now what
happens if I move the C around in
relation to the G and the e this is
called a chord inversion got a magnet
magnet and then a little mini magnet
right here where you go if this works
out good so can you see if three magnets
this one is different than the other so
let's say this is C alright so we're on
let's say we're on a staff this is C
this is e this is G got it makes sense
now we can mess with these twist them up
and plant them mix them whatever now
that becomes a different chord inversion
so
so here's e here's G what if we take the
both of these and put them in the base
now we have what's called first
inversion this Barkers day completely
who woulda known maybe that's why I'm
not using markers for this one first see
it can you see it close enough
all right so now let's put it back how
it was see E and G what if I take the G
and put it in the base now I have second
inversion makes sense so think of it
like this if if I put it both of them in
the base so I have ceg like this we have
first inversion I'm moving back and take
this to put in the base it's second
version think of we have this note and
then we have the first note after the
the root and then we have the second
note after the root that's how I think
of it so if we're putting the first note
in the base this now the first notes in
the base this is first inversion if we
put the second note in the base we get
second inversion so here is a sequel if
we take the E and the G and place them
in the base let's move it up on C G then
we put him in the base first inversion
typically we going upwards so ceg and
then put these two at the base first
inversion now if we move to e scoot it
up one second inversion so here we are
see eg take the C now the Eng are in the
base take the e that's the first
inversion place up here second inversion
normal so that is how it works
now hopefully you can see all of those
keys and that's all I really have to say
about chord inversions I think showing
you the inversions makes a little more
sense when you see it visually rather
than with my stupid little magnets here
so all you really have to think about is
if you have a C chord and then you take
the C and then scoot it up to the other
side then that's first inversion so now
- we're back here and then if you take
those two scoot them up scoot with the e
up there that's the second inversion and
then you take the G place it up there -
it becomes normally yeah so that's all
you really have to learn for inversions
for now anyways and then there's also
one called
third inversion and that's for seventh
chords or basically anything with extra
more than three notes so uh that's the
same thing as taking the seventh and
moving it to the base
