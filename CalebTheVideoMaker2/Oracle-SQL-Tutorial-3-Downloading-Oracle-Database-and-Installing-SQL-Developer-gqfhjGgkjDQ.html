basically an introduction to Oracle
database how we can install it and how
we can connect to the database so if
you've never done any database
configuration or setting up it can get
pretty confusing at times but I'm gonna
try to break it down so it's simple so
first you'll need to get on a web
browser which is Google Chrome and we're
going to go to Oracle and just go to
Oracle com
and then what you can do at the top you
see downloads hover over that and find
there's you see there's two options here
Oracle database Oracle database 11g
Express Edition so the way it works on
here is they have a primary Edition that
they sell that's 12c and then they have
an Express Edition
that's 11g so it's one number back which
means that it doesn't have all of the
features as the 12 which would be the
the most recent one but it's Express
which means it's a smaller file size
it's for smaller applications smaller
purposes but best of all it is free so
this is the one we're going to be using
now when you get to this page there's a
few things you're going to have to do
you're going to have to click accept
license agreement and by that I mean you
have to read the entire thing oh it's
such a good read I read it like every
night alright then what you're going to
do is have to figure out which operating
system you will be using this server on
let's click this and you'll have to
probably sign in as you can see it's
downloading for me but that's because
I'm already signed in so you can see
it's right here
Oracle x-- e x-- e stands for Express
Edition which is the edition that we
downloaded so this is a zipped folder as
you can see in the little pop-up open it
and I'll just click extract extract all
files and my downloads are fine that's a
fine place to do it
downloads and this is gonna create a new
folder with that name alright here we
are so we can click this and then
there's this setup.exe click that if a
pop up pops up click yes
alright boom there we go is ready to
install so let's just get rid of some of
this other junk so it's not so cluttered
I'll probably need that later I'll leave
that open then click Next
make sure you read all that next looks
good next we're going to make a password
this is going to be kind of like the
administrator password so it's like the
main account that account name is
actually known as system C as you can
see here system something simple if you
want to follow along you can put that
where you can I use whatever you like
install all right now it's um you know
creating and starting service oh wow
that was fast ok ok just finished so and
click finish on that now after this you
might be wondering how do I run the
thing well let me show you go to the
Start menu and click all programs you
can look for something gold or find
Oracle database 11g Express Edition when
you click that it's going to open up a
bunch of different options sorry I'm
eating an apple
the first thing you're going to want to
click is start database you're going to
get this little command prompt thing ok
great and you can just lower that and go
back to the same place and you're going
to click run SQL command line if you're
beginner you might not know what SQL
means let me explain SQL stands for
structured query language it's basically
the standard language we use to
communicate with databases it's kind of
like how we tell people to do something
in English well we tell the database to
do something in SQL so yeah that's but
that's pretty simple now this is where
we actually use the database and I know
it doesn't look real pretty but I'll
teach you a cool solution in just a
minute to to make it more friendly all
right one more thing if you go to all
programs click this again you can click
get started that's going to bring up a
web page right then you can see says
127.0.0.1 that's a loopback address
which it's basically on your home a home
computer
this is 8080 that's the port if you have
something such as Skype running or xampp
oh that's that might cause issues and
this might not work out right so if
that's the case you'll need to disable
those now this is where you can do some
extra configuring of your database but
we're not going to get into super much
details with all this right now so we'll
worry about that later I just wanted to
show you that all right then one other
thing if you go back click this you can
click get help and then you can click
read documentation this is where you get
the official documentation for the
database and it'll talk about everything
you really need to know so there's all
kinds of information here you can search
and so forth so if you needed help
installing you could click right here
and that's basically it now we can sign
in to our account we created by saying
connect and then ask for a username and
it's going to be system the password
whatever you put in mine was pass and it
doesn't show up and press enter this is
connected now you can start doing
commands that are part of the SQL
language but we'll get into that later
because I just want to show you how to
set everything up in this video so let's
move on to one other thing I wanted to
show you guys go to Oracle com
I think it's Stockholm and then go to
downloads and SQL developer and then if
you don't have the JDK which stands for
Java development kit you are going to
want to download that
with the JDK so I'm on windows 64-bit
and I'll need the JDK so I'm going to
download that and I already have it
downloaded so I'm going to actually
cancel that so you run it and once again
you have to extract it that's fine
alright it just finished so you want to
open this and they're gonna find SQL
developer exe and yeah
all right so would you like to import
preferences from a previous son no
that's if you have a previous edition of
this and you want to import data from
that one well then go right ahead but I
don't know why you'd be watching this
tutorial if you already know what you're
doing so okay so this is the main page
No all right this is the main page right
now I suggest before you start anything
go to tools preferences and then
database and then worksheet these are
just a ton of settings this is just one
that I think is useful grid in
checkerboard or zebra pattern that makes
every other line of code a little darker
background so it's really easy to follow
lines across rather than just being
white text black text on a white
background I mean now we can put a
default path for scripts if we want so
we can browse and I'll just put mine in
a My Documents create a new folder and
just name it whatever you want
that's okay alright so now we need to
connect to a database by the way the
thing we're running right now is to make
the database a little more user friendly
than just this so that's what the
purpose of this is so we need to connect
to a database by pressing that little
plus just click it and this will come up
you can name it whatever you want
user name hmm that would be system
password pass localhost 1 5 2 1 X e
looks good and then you can click
connect all right now we have it you can
see it right there and if you give it
just a minute it will open so we
officially are we've completed our task
of setting up the server and connecting
it with Oracle SQL Developer and that
gives us the ability to start running
queries on this database which is
basically running commands and doing
more things I wanted to teach us early
on in the series so those of you guys
who like to tinker around with things
you can start getting used to the
layouts and the buttons and typing
things out on your own rather than just
writing it out on paper if I teach you
know what I mean and I'll be going back
and forth from the chalkboard to this
and we'll be learning both concepts and
practical code so thank you guys and be
