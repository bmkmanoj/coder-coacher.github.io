video we will be learning about major
scales major scales are really cool
actually I like major scales I hope you
can read that writing it's kind of its
kind of bro dark hard to see but yeah
major scales I didn't get some good
markers all these are kind of lame and I
keep switching back and forth but
anyways a major scale consists of
patterns of whole and half steps and
basically it's a happy sounding scale
I'll play one for you that's the C major
scale here's AG major scale well that's
an example of major scales that sound
Pleasant and here's the pattern and
these music is based off of scales so
for example in the g major scale there
is an F sharp so when I play an F it
will naturally sound out of place unless
I play F sharp
rather than F because the spacing
between the notes stays consistent
starting on what know you start on from
the know you started on so I know that's
a lot to take in at first but the
distance always stays the same no matter
what note you start on that's why it's
called a major scale it sounds Pleasant
and most music is built off of major
scale so the pattern is okay this is the
pattern of steps to make a major scale
so if we're starting on C we have a
keyboard and here's C
Sosa's the one before the two Black Keys
I probably told you should have told you
that like a hundred seat videos ago so
on
here's see now whole step from see as
deep whole step from D is the reason
that is because a whole step whole step
consists of two half steps one two I'm
sorry kid to let me use a different
color for this so you can see one gosh
dangit
I stink it drawing one two now from D to
e 1 2 now it's a half step from E to F
12.2 now we're on to a whole step again
1 to F G whole step from G 1 2 bad be a
whole step from a 1 to B and then a half
step from be C 1 so I know it's like ok
so it's just the white keys so if I can
just start on C and play the white keys
it should sound for fun yes it should
but when we move up the scale it doesn't
sound up the piano it doesn't sound the
same what if I start on D it doesn't
sound the same it doesn't sound quite
fulfilling on the happiness level so
that's why we have to keep this pattern
the same so let's say we're starting on
G it's time see that's the first C it's
not plugged in sorry so we're starting
on G we're gonna take a whole step from
G that's two half steps one two G a then
a whole step 1 to B half step 1
whole step 1 2 whole step 1 2 whole step
now 1 2 we have an F sharp in there so
from whole step we have one more half
step there so if we were to play a G
major scale we need to put in that F
sharp in order for it to sound proper
makes sense
I don't know if you could see that or
not now all music is built off of these
scales so I can play something in the
scale of C or I can play something in
the scale of D or G or really any scale
I want as long as I can cyst to this
pattern so when I play a note in a G
scale it should be an F sharp non F
unless I play out of the scale when we
play all of the notes within the scale
this is said to be diatonic diatonic but
when I play a note that's not in the
scale such as an f-sharp in AC major
scale it's said to be chromatic the
people at work to play an F sharp and a
G Major scale its diatonic because it's
part of the major scale but if I play it
an F its chromatic because it's not in
the major scale that's for a song you
know so we don't always have
play in the scale we can go out of the
scale and that's okay so what do you
remember the pattern of full steps and
half steps for a major scale I sure do
oh you read that I doubt it
Oh blue suite whole whole half oh that
is the pattern you need to memorize this
so if we were to start on D rather than
C which we tried once on the Winkies it
didn't sound quite right let's start on
D a whole step from D is e whole hole
which means F sharp cuz a whole half
step half step so Oh full half whole
whole whoa laughs so the D sharp not D
sharp D the D major scale actually has
two sharps in it
sweet so we can actually start this on
any note it doesn't have to be a white
key so I can say I can have a D sharp
major scale I don't know it but it's
cold full path
Oh oops sorry so cool cool so I'm not
very good at it as you can tell not a
very good piano player either but that's
alright it's only do it for fun so this
is the pattern for a major scale and
that's all I need to say for this video
so subscribe and I'll see you in my next
video thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
