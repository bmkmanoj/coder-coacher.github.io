the other ones except I'm going to be
talking about the update command and I
decided to do this one on a chalkboard
and I'll explain this in a reason I mean
Alex I'll explain this but don't freak
out
all right so the video after this I
actually recorded before this one and in
that video I deleted my database I mean
my table and I'm just way too lazy to
create another one so I'm gonna be
teaching you it on a chalkboard and I
know that's kind of weird because like
you're like it's sort of like watching
me and the future because like the video
after this is gonna be so I'm like the
future me of like next the next video
oh and imagine it's like say you watch
this like a year from now and then
you're watching like the future of me in
the past Standex planas alright so
basically this how it works yeah let me
erase this crap right so and also I want
you to tell me whether you like the
computer or the chalkboard because I'm
up for either one this one takes way
longer but I like these videos better so
just let me know I don't mind doing the
other videos either it's just just
whatever you guys want and I'll think
about it
so basically you say the type of command
you want update so the next thing you
want to do is say like update what table
and if you remember my table was members
so so from here you can say what you
want to change so let's say I spelled my
name wrong and I want to change that to
Caleb so
name and then single quotes Caleb like
that
so that's pretty cool and but there's a
big problem with this and I'll explain
the cinnamon so what you want to do
let's say we have this table and then we
have name as a column and what this is
going to do we're going to update the
members table which is this table right
here and then we're going to set the
name to Caleb
so all these rows the name is going to
be Caleb Caleb Caleb and it's going to
affect every single row which you do not
want that well I mean unless you really
specifically need that the chances are
you're not going to need this so that's
not the best idea
so what to fix this basically you tell
it something to change it by so you do
that with a we're close hopefully you
remember these we're oops and we can say
where ID is equal to 7 so the ID 7 would
change or you it can basically choose
with anything so if let's say you
accidentally spelled Caleb say wolf like
this
then what you can do is say update
members set the name to Caleb where name
is equal to sale and then that's going
to find which one has this name
hopefully there's not more than one so
this one that's Salem it's going to
cross it out and put Caleb well this
this can kind of be bad because what if
somebody has a name Salem so I always
recommend doing it by the primary key
because that always be unique because a
primary key is unique never changing and
always has a value so that's what I
would do so I would say update members
or whatever your table name is so this
is the table name so this is members and
you set the name so the column
this would go right here so these are
columns so the name column and we're
going to make it equal to cable in
single quotes or double quotes whatever
so we're going to set it to Caleb right
here and we're name or ID is equal to
seven so the primary key let's say this
one has a primary key of seven and we're
going to change his name to Caleb that's
that's what it would basically do so
this one six won't change this will stay
the same and this one which this one
will change so hopefully that clears
things up and that's basically the basis
of an update command and you can do some
more broad things so just look it up on
Google and see me in the next video it's
gonna be sweet and please tell me if you
prefer the chalkboard cuz I really
or the computer screen cuz I don't mind
doing both so let me know and oh I mean
I'll probably do both either way but
I'll see what you guys like and I'll do
more of that and focus on that so yeah
peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
