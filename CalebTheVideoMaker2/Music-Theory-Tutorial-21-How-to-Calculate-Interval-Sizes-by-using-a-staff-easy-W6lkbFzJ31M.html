21st music theory tutorial I believe um
last video I talked about interval size
using scale degrees and this videos
gonna be something similar but it'll be
a lot more effective I guess you could
say then that is to measure interval
size using a staff five lines you know
the drill one two three four five so
let's say we're using treble clef which
makes this AG cool it now I want to
measure the interval size from AG and
notice how these are both vertical with
each other that means they're played
hard
they're harmonic rather than like this
which is melodic just just a refresher
to terms you should know so he okay from
G to D well we count G a B C D 5 so this
is known as a fifth so let's take a look
at this when we can do this is count the
lines and spaces
well this one's on this line so one we
have a space here - we have a line here
three space here before and then the
line that the D is on is five so what
can do is just count lines and spaces so
if we're going from this note to this
note one two three four five six seven
eight nine
that's a ninth which we'll get into that
later and remember we always have to
count the one we're starting on and the
would or ending up and is improper so
you do it like this so we have a note
here
we can't go one two three we have to go
one two three four five six seven
we have to count one week ending on and
the one we're starting to get the proper
interval size so this is basically just
counting the lines and spaces that's all
I really have to say about that so the
next video will be talking about
something awesome
what a surprise
