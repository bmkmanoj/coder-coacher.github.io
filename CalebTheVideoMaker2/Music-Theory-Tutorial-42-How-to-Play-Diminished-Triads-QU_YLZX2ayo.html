to review one thing real quick and by
the way welcome back to your next music
theory series we can represent a major
triad as 135 this being the root this
being the third and this being the fifth
we can represent a minor by 1 3 flat 5
you may see it like that just so you
know all right now that we've got that
out of the way you move on do what is
called let's go with diminished chords
all right so diminished if you remember
the interval it takes a minor or perfect
and lowers it one half step well guess
what there's no perfect chords so we
only have to worry about the minor
chords so minor chord consisted of a
root a minor third a minor third
followed by a major third so we take the
majors lower them a half step so boom
this becomes minor third basically we're
just taking the fifth of the scale or
whatever you want to call it and we're
lowering it a half step now this is the
way to make a my diminished chord
another way to think of this is if we
have the keyboard and let's say this is
the one note this is the second oh this
is the third note to make a minor we
lower this a half step and to make it
diminished we lower both of them half
step so hopefully that makes sense I'll
show you a keyboard and second major you
can't hear it the volumes bargain ah we
shrink this down one or a lower half
step becomes minor lower this one down a
half step with it comes diminished very
disturbing sound i think but i like it
so that is the formation of a diminished
chord so now we know four of them I mean
three of them sorry we a major which
equals the root
followed by a major third followed by a
minor third then we have minor which
equals the root which is where you start
followed by minor third which has three
half steps followed by a major third
just four half steps then we have a
diminished which has the route followed
by a minor third followed by a minor
third right cool so let me go show you
some of these chords on the piano
prepare your ears all right I think my
batteries are going to die which is like
totally lame but whatever let's go over
this here we have a um can you see my
thumb alright turn this on here C major
chord C minor chord we took the middle
note which has four half steps 1234
makes it a major 3rd law and a half step
becomes a minor third now from here to
here becomes a major one two three four
that's where how we get the formation of
a minor chord now if we take this and
lowered half step it becomes a
diminished chord here doesn't sound very
good but not horrible I like it so dee
dee diminished well here's D major
here's d minor here's d diminished
diminished so that is the basis of
forming a diminished chord let's try F
sharp diminished one two three one two
three minor would be and the major would
be so all you really have to know is no
the major or one of them and figure out
how to get the rest for example I know
this is the e major C major or oh dang i
think i'm blocking this sorry guys
here's the email or minor chord in
diminished chord very simple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
