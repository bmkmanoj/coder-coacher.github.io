key I went over this a little bit and I
don't think I explained it very good the
foreign key is a reference to another
key in another table let's say you have
a user account system every user should
have an ID I already went over that when
I was talking about primary keys every
table should have a primary key to keep
things unique so the ID would be the
primary key because it would never
change it would never be empty and it
keeps everything unique so now if you're
making a forum and you have a post it's
a post table posts that's horrible sorry
you gotta know you have to make sure
that the who submitted it is tied to the
username so basically it's in sadeghi my
bad
you have who post it so a poster and
then we have
title and then body I don't know if you
can read that or not but let's hope say
the poster and instead of that you would
but you would put a foreign key to this
ID now you're probably thinking why well
let's say there's a user and he posted
bad stuff and he got banned well then
you could go back and make a command
delete any posts with the poster with
the ID of seven seven three that is what
connects everything now what happens if
you didn't follow thy rule and you
delete at this poster this ID just
change that to ID you make it so much
easier need to have a post ID to do so
we'd have the user ID that's not the
first time so have the user ID now let's
say this user gets deleted of 773 he
gets banned permanently forever because
he's a bad boy now there's a post over
here by somebody who doesn't exist let's
see if you make a foreign key connection
you can avoid that improper design now
when this gets deleted so will this
either that or it'll be moved to a new
location saying like deleted users or
post that or unsigned anything and that
it is what a foreign key is
not that's still kind of rough I promise
you in these next videos it will be in
your brain I mean I'm gonna go over so
much you'll feel like this will be
beginning stuff I mean it'll come
naturally you won't even have to think
about it so I think I thank you guys for
watching this video and be sure to see
the next one
it's gonna be sweet so yeah catch you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
