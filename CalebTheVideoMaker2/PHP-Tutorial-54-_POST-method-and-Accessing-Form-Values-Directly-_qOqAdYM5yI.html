your 53rd PHP tutorial not 100% sure on
that but basically in this video I want
to talk a little bit more about better
form creation and basically I'm teaching
a bunch of different ways that you can
create forms and it just depends on the
application of which way you're going to
one to use alright so in the last video
what we did is we talked about forms and
we'd take the requests a super global
array to get the value from the HTML
form we would test if it's set using an
if statement if it's set we assign it to
a shorthand variable if it's not set we
gave an error message well I'm going to
be going over a different way alright so
the first thing I wanted to talk about
is um the super global array in the last
video we use this and there's nothing
really wrong with this request with this
super global array but for this video
now we're going to be using the post
array so mainly there's three three
arrays you'll use when getting data from
forms right there's the request which
includes the post you get and also
includes cookie I think so these you can
get data from all these so that means
this is a less precise super global
array in our HTML form we used the post
method as our well I mean as our HTML so
we have this
this is what we had within our HTML form
and this method is post that's very
specific so we can specifically use the
post array to make things more secure
and give a better programming technique
or whatever you want to say so yeah
that's that basically will be using
posts for these forms occasionally we'll
use get usually you'll use get when you
are requesting information and you use
post when you are posting information
such as the reform so that's just a
general idea of how to know the
difference between those two but so now
that you know how the request works post
works in almost exactly the same way so
we will be using that for our new script
which we'll be making in the next video
next thing I want to talk about is in
our last video we'd have an if statement
and we would test the value of a
variable here and then we had another if
statement and then we tested a value of
a different variable here these were
both required fields what that means is
if the user didn't put them in then an
error was given so sometimes you'll have
forms that are not fully a hundred
percent required so let's say you make a
you page and you ask for your username
and then a name and then a nickname well
that nickname may be optional and if no
one puts it in they'll just use the real
name so that's an example of a non
required field well because these were
both required this is actually kind of
redundant and what we can do is we can
actually test both of them within one if
statement so we could have the name and
the password for example
we can test that and then if they both
evaluate us true we can execute this bar
of code hopefully that makes sense so
that's what we will be adding next we're
going to combine all those if statements
so we're only using one large if
statement and it sometimes it helps to
break things out as single if statements
for beginners so they understand how it
works and then once you get better you
can combine certain things within an if
statement to improve your code another
thing we did is once we tested if the
value if the variable had a Val I'm
sorry once we tested if the array had a
value such as this this is an example
this points to the main HTML text box
with the name name hopefully that makes
sense the name name so if it was an
email they would have the name email or
whatever you want to name it really well
another thing is that what we did with
this is we took this value and we
assigned it so let's say let's say that
this value is cable right
we took this value and we assign it to a
new variable name and there's nothing
wrong with this method but in our next
script I'm going to be telling you how
to use these values directly without
having to assign them to another
variable and that's pretty much what
we're going to do so in order to do the
fact we just echo them out as such
here is an example of how we would echo
one of them out and this works perfectly
fine although there is some problems
with this one of these problems is that
when we put this within quotes so we say
hello comma and then we want the name to
be posted there for some reason this
will cause an error with PHP so what you
need to do is because it's an
associative array we have to put curly
braces on the inside and outside of this
ref so what when you're within quotes
you'll have to have curly braces when
you don't have quotes so you're just
echoing this specifically then you do
not need curly braces so that's pretty
much all we will be testing so in the
end it's going to look like this
if and then within this huge parentheses
we're going to test all of our values
within our bar of code we're going to
echo all of our values so that's exactly
what it's going to look like so
basically we're condensing that whole
script in the last video into one script
or one if statement with one bar of code
to be executed so that is pretty much
how it works and then you can have an
else statement down here which will say
Oh something something is wrong with all
of the code so like go try and fill out
the form again and it on there is a
couple downsides to this is you won't be
able to specifically say oh you forgot
to fill out your name oh you forgot to
fill out the email without adding a lot
of extra code the reason for this is
this is tested as either true or false
if it's false
well that means either the name can be
missing or the username can be missing
or the email can be missing and you
don't necessarily know so when you're
went on the else statement that's to say
it's false you can't say
oh go fill out your email because that
user may have filled out their email and
messed up by not filling out their name
for example so that's what we're going
to do in the next video which will be an
on-screen video so that's pretty much
how it works hopefully that's helpful
and if it is please be sure to like this
video and subscribe thank you and I'll
see you in the next video yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
