from Caleb the video maker - Caleb
currycomb this video will be your
introduction to database design we're
pretty much going to cover a lot of a
lot of everything so this is going to be
great series if you're just starting out
or if you want to get a broad overview
of everything then yeah stick with this
if you want to know more about the
series check out my introduction
otherwise let's get rolling so database
design before we talk about database
design let's first talk about a database
because we can't design a database if we
don't know what a database is that
doesn't make sense so what is a database
well that's a really good question I'm
glad you asked well I can actually tell
you what a database is and that's what
this video is about so a database is
something that stores data all right
another vague term data and I want you
to guys I want all of you to think about
data very broadly don't think too
specific
think of data as anything we can store
in a database or anything we can write
down anything that has a value can be
anything data can be the list of every
single customer of your store since 1995
or it can be a list of every single
transaction in a online shopping center
or it can be a list of every user in
their user name or it could be a list of
every single weather event since 1927
can be pretty much anything it doesn't
have to do with specific people data is
so broad so database is obviously broad
too because a database stores data so
yeah I just think of it like this here
we have a database a basis where we
store data pretty simple all right so
now that's pretty vague and I'm not sure
if that was very helpful so now let's
break it down to where we see it from a
technical standpoint everything in
world not everything but almost
everything is ran from a back-end
database it's what stores all of our
information so for example I like to use
websites for examples because they're
very clear and they're very easy to
understand the concept of this when you
go to a website and you sign up you you
give them a username you give them a
password and you give them an email all
of that when you sign in the next time
it allows you to sign well how did that
website remember what your username
email and password was that's because
all of this information that you put in
when you registered all of these values
are given to a database so here you can
say is our database sorry for my
craptastic and rating but don't don't
even worry about it this is what's said
to be the front end this is said to be
the back end that's because we don't
necessarily see what's going on back
here we can put in our email or username
and our password and it can get stored
in this database that way when we come
back again and we log in we give them a
username and a password it takes that
value it checks it with the database to
allow you to get into the account that
is a perfect example of a database so a
database can store that information but
it's not limited to only registration
you can use this to store all of your
records of sales in a store and also for
that just goes on don't think of it as a
limited thing because there's so many
things you can do with the database so
many things next question you may be
asking is how does it differ from like a
spreadsheet for example so a spreadsheet
basically if you don't really know much
about spreadsheets it's basically where
you have columns and then we have rows
and we can store information about like
we can enter the values for each call
spreadsheets are good if that's what you
need if you're a very small company
excuse me but if you want to get to any
plek city where you can like imagine if
we wanted to select let's say this was a
spreadsheet for all of my employees I
own a huge business with 100 employees
and I want to select every single
employee who has missed less than three
days and have been an employee for at
least three years and I want to give
them a $100 bonus well that's something
if I had a spreadsheet I have to
manually go through that check every
single value that's not gonna work
because out times money in business but
anyways with a database we can run
queries to get those kind of values to
figure out which employees have been a
member a employee for three years and
I've only missed three days or or less
so that's how a difference from a
spreadsheet basically what you can do
with it if you have a spreadsheet with
ten employees or like I'm sorry with ten
values and that's like you can figure
out all of your information in a couple
of seconds well then you might not need
a database that's up to you the other
thing is with with spreadsheets it's
it's a it's either like all data or no
data let's say I just this stored every
single detail about every single
employee that I had and all I wanted was
their name and their address well we
can't really do that easily with the
spreadsheet unless we take all those
columns and like copy and paste and all
this extra garbage or find some
algorithm to do things fancy leak if you
know what you're doing you can probably
do it but with a database we can
selectively choose which columns so we
can say only these two columns do we
want returned and we can ignore the rest
on top of that we can allow different
users to access different information
back to the website example we have
users page and then we had a database
one here you put your user name email
and password that's stored on a database
but that's not necessarily the only
thing that's stored on a database a user
might only get to access that but a
database administrator might get to
access
when they registered the transactions
they've made on your shopping website or
what they've watched what what they
viewed the comments they've made how
often they visit the webpage it's pretty
much limitless to what you want to do
with the database so we can see that two
different users this person only gets to
view some things at the database this
person can only can view pretty much
anything with the spreadsheet it's kind
of all or nothing do you have access to
the spreadsheet yes I did well here it
is if you don't have access well then
too bad you don't get any of it so that
that's awesome that's a security feature
as well because you don't want this
person to get all of the hidden
information that's stored within this
database so hopefully that makes things
pretty darn clear the next video I'll
kind of be talking about how data is
stored in a database because I did I was
going to get into that in this video but
I kind of ran out of time but for the
sake of just your understanding if you
decide not to watch the second video
which you will watch the second video
fright relations that's a term where we
get the term relational database so this
series is for what's known as a
relational database that is a specific
kind of database and that's going to be
most of the relation that's going to be
most of the databases that you work with
if you're working with database design
so in the next video we will be getting
into what relational means and why it's
useful why is why is it a good database
system why do we need a relational
database that's what we will be talking
about so thank you guys for watching and
be sure to subscribe and click like on
this video and I will see you guys in
the next one peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
