Python tutorial series hopefully you're
learning a whole lot of cool things in
this video we're actually going to be
talking about something completely new
we're going to be talking about defining
our own functions so what is a function
here let me write that out so you can
see it if I can even spell it which I
can't function
that's about correctly by the way a
function is basically a big block of
code that we're going to reuse
throughout our program rather than
having to retype it and then retyping it
again and then retyping it and then
retyping it we can just create the
function and then we can call that
function when we need that big block of
code so we don't have to retype the
whole thing now you might not know how
that works practically so let's just do
it and we'll see kind of how it works so
in order to define our own function we
use the keyword def because we're
defining a function then we give it a
name so let's just say let's just say
we'll name it
five just because you'll see why in a
second and then what we do is we say we
put these old parentheses and put a
colon so just like in an if statement or
a while loop when we when we create it
we have to put the colon to prepare us
for the next block of code but for now
let's just say here what we're going to
do is within this parentheses we have to
use what's known as a parameter which is
a temporary variable
it holds values that are given when we
define a when we call the function later
in our program so right now we're
defining the function and we have to
give it these variables so let's just
call the variable num for number and
just make it known that sounds better
all right so now we can do the next part
of our function which is called the body
what actually happens in this function
and we'll just make it simple we'll just
print like always and what we're going
to do is we're just going to print num
plus 5 okay so we just defined a
function
so the three main parts are the name the
parameters and then everything that it
does is known as the body oops I didn't
mean to put that period yeah I don't
know if that works out alright there we
go so now we have a function called five
and it takes one variable and whatever
that whatever that value we give it is
it takes it and it adds five to it so
let's try it out in order to call it all
we have to do is we just type the name
and within parenthesis we give it a
value such as five and you see it took
five added five to it and gave us ten so
it actually just repeated this this much
code for us and I know it's kind of
silly because it's such a small amount
of code it's kind of unnecessary
it'd be easier just to go five plus five
but you can make things more complex so
let's try it again with a string so
let's let's create a new function we'll
say and we'll just say copy okay and
then we'll give the oopsies we'll finish
structuring this and within here we can
have another variable we don't have to
use quotes or anything because variables
do not have quotes values have quotes so
for here we can just say yo it doesn't
really matter to be honest as long as
you can remember it I mean when you're
actually programming you should give it
a descriptive value but for this it's
completely fine so now what we can do is
we can print we can print and then we
can print the value yo times 50 so it's
going to print whatever we give it 50
times so let's try it copy and we're
going to print Roger that
and you can see it printed it 50 times
and it looks kind of like that Roger but
that's because it goes Roger that and
then there's no space and it repeats so
that's that's an example of another
function now let's try to make it a bit
more
practical let's try to let's create
another one here
we'll go deaf we'll call it concat
alright what concatenation is in
programming is it takes multiple words
and adds them together so let's let's
make it come cat four names so we take a
first name and we take a last name okay
give it a colon and now from here we
could say print and we say first name
plus last name sorry didn't put a comma
there
so basically when we define the
parameters we separate them with commas
and we learned previously and when we
talked about printing we can print
multiple things using a plus so we're
printing the first name and then we're
putting onto that the last name so let's
try this out and want to quote these
because they're string values and it
printed them both together now let's
improve this and make it put a space
right here so let's just take this back
down I'm sorry not this let's take the
actual definition down here and what
we're going to do is we're going to
print a space within quotes and then put
another plus so now it's going to take
the first name add to that at space and
then it's going to add to that a last
name so let's try it out
and you can see it concatenated those
names to where it took one of value and
another value and put them together with
a space now let's try something even
cooler let's create variables let's go
first and we'll give it the value Caleb
last we'll give it the value Carrie okay
and now when we use the same concat
instead of using these values we can use
variables so we could say first last and
it will generate the name with a space
between them so that's just another cool
thing we can do let's create one final
function let's make this one a little
more complex what I wanted to do is I
want it to take a number and increase it
by a certain percentage and let's say we
can we can define both the number and
the percentage we want to increase it by
so let's let's define it first and we're
just going to name it percent and it's
gonna take two variables x and y that'll
work fine now for this what we need to
do is we need to print and within here
it can get a little complicated but
basically we print X which is the number
we start out with but we want to
multiply that by a percentage so if we
put let's say 10 for the X that's the
number we start with and we want to
multiply that by 20 percent well how can
we turn the number 20 into a number we
can multiply by to make a percent well
we can first divide it by 100 to bring
it down to point 20 and then we can add
1 to it to make it 1 point 20 then when
we take 10 times one point 20 we get
basically 10 plus 20 percent and if you
are not good at math just ignore that
and follow along alright so what we need
to do is we need to take x times y
/ 100 plus 1 but please remember the
order of operations the order in which
these are going to basically be executed
if we did it now it would do these ones
first and then it would do the division
and then it would do the addition we
don't want it that way we want it this
way so first we're going to box the
complete y side and then we're going to
box the division first so when when a
python goes through this it starts on
the inside and works its way out so
first it divides Y by 100 then it adds
one to it and then it multiplies that
value by X let's try this out so we want
we want to find a percent of 10 and then
the percent we want it to increase by as
let's say 10 okay and it gives us 11
which is correct we can also try
different numbers so we could say 10 and
we want to multiply that by 100 percent
it should give us 20 so that's an
awesome way basically we just created a
we could essentially be a tip calculator
if you go to a store and you I mean if
you go to a restaurant and a chart they
charge you 40 bucks okay and you want to
be generous and you want to give them 25
percent well it's going to tell you oh
you need to pay $50 and I know you can
do that very easily with a calculator
but once you get into bigger functions
you're not going to have to repeat all
this garbage over and over again and
like it can go on for lines and lines
you can just call the function and it
will give us back a result so let's say
we had some kind of algorithm to figure
out a like let's say Y was some kind of
algorithm to figure out a new number
like let's say you're playing in game
right and if you if you received a
certain level you got a you've got bonus
points and the bonus points weren't
necessary
10% or 20% but it was like Oh your
current level times 10% plus 50 - your
health point loss and so forth well all
of that can be created within a function
and then when you get this bonus point
you could just be like bonus points and
then call it boom done you're done so
that's that's pretty much introduction
to creating functions hopefully that was
helpful
I'll please guys leave a comment and
tell me if I explained that absolutely
horribly because this is a kind of new
teaching for me because I usually talk
about using functions rather than
defining functions so if that was if I
completely slaughtered that let me know
and if you actually learned something
please let me know guys thank you for
sticking through and I will see you guys
