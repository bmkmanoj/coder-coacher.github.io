are going to discuss recursion that's
because the id3 algorithm we're going to
talk about really soon is a recursive
algorithm and it's really hard to just
jump into recursive algorithms without
refreshing your brain or learning what
recursion is for the first time either
one whether you're a recursion expert or
you've never seen recursion I would
highly recommend you watch this video
just to get your mind back into the
thought of recursion so what is
recursion plus simply recursion is a
function that calls itself it's really
super weird when you first start
learning about it but essentially let's
say you call a function on some set of
data
what recursion is going to do is call
the same function on a smaller set of
the data so you pass in this entire
piece and you want it to do something
with this entire thing of data what's
going to happen is it's actually going
to call the same function with a smaller
piece of data and then that smaller
version is going to call a smaller
version and a smaller version and a
smaller version and a smaller version
and a smaller version until you get to
the smallest version and then you're
going to go back up and finish the big
one so that probably just made it super
confusing so I'm just going to go
through a very simple example and it
probably has like no practical use in
the real world so well maybe he and
maybe so we'll go through it and we'll
see we'll see if I like it or not before
I dive into the example recursion is
very popular with trees so if you think
of having a tree that branches a bunch
of times we may not know how many times
it branches so you can think of calling
a function on the whole tree which then
calls the same function on a smaller
piece of the tree which then calls it on
a smaller piece of the tree which would
then be the smallest piece and then it's
going to go back up which you'll see
what I mean by that in a second and
finish out the function so you can use
recursion to visit all nodes in a tree
without knowing how many nodes there are
and that's one really cool thing you can
do with recursion because once you
finish this node it'll go to this one
then it's gonna go to this one and then
this group here this one and then this
one and then this one and then finally
this one okay that's enough drawing
let's go to another example that's
really practical by practical I mean not
really that practical so we're gonna
make an echo function so a function is
just a piece of code you can use as many
times as you want by calling that
function using its name so you define it
first using you know some syntax will
just use pseudocode which just kind of
make it up as you go and what this is
going to do is it's going to take a
message and shout it out and then
decrease the volume a certain amount and
then shout it out again and then
decrease the volume shout it out so you
can think of it as an echo echo okay so
we take in some message I don't really
care about the datatypes or anything is
we'll just you know we'll just go with a
Python kind of syntax here so we've
taken a message and then we take in a
loudness then what this is going to do
is it's going to shout which we'll just
assume that's defined somewhere and
that's going to take the message and
pass it in the labas pretty simple and
then it's going to do the same thing
it's going to echo and it's going to
pass in the message and then loudness
minus some amount this is a simple
example of recursion because what we do
is we pass in a big message which shouts
the message out pretend it's a game or
something and your characters yelling
it's gonna shout it out and then it's
gonna call the same message with a
smaller volume and then the same message
with a smaller volume than a smaller
volume and a smaller volume until
there's no volume left and that is how
recursion works but there's a couple
little gotchas I need to mention okay so
we don't want to run into a situation
where we have an infinite recursion
and that's just when a function calls
itself an infinite number of times so
there's some things you always got to
remember to do and that is use a return
so the return is going to exit out of a
function it's kind of weird how you do
this but imagine you have echo and this
is going to return a smaller version of
echo which is going to return a smaller
version of echo that's going to be very
important when you get into more complex
recursion to make sure the call stack is
correct the other thing is you need
what's known as a base case and actually
that is the topic of the next video just
so I can have a whole video to go and as
much depth as I like so hopefully that
was not too rough if you're new to
recursion I know it sounds like super
weird and crazy and it is but it works
just try it out it essentially allows
you to do loops where you don't know
when it ends but you don't actually want
to use recursion for loops some people
used to do that and some people still do
but it's really just round upon unless
you have to do it that way so some
languages for example you might not have
a loop structure like like something
like while true some languages may not
have a structure like this so you may
implement the same thing using recursion
so thank you guys that's all I got for
this video please be sure to subscribe
and I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
