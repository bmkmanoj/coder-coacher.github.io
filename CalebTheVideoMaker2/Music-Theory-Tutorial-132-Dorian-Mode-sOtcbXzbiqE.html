be talking about the Dorian mode the
Dorian mode consists of a whole half
whole whole whole half whole so this is
the pattern for the Dorian mode now if
we were in the key of C we have no
sharps and flats that means they're all
natural notes the only one that will
work is the Dorian mode of D D ye f g a
b c and back to d now let me show you
this on the keyboard here we got old
half pull pull pull half that's exactly
pattern i have given you here now all
this really is is starting on the next
scale degree of the c major scale which
was CD second would be d so that in
order for us to hatch all natural notes
we start on D as you can tell there's no
sharps and flats with in this mode
that's because we're starting on D we
don't have to start on D but in order
for all of the notes to be what I have
said before diatonic in order for the
notes to be diatonic which means within
the key signature within the scale we
must start on D so yeah let's try a
different one let's create a staff and
we're going to be in the key of G which
means we have an f-sharp so not only
does this apply to the C major scale
starting on D it applies to any scale so
all we're really doing is starting on
the second scale degree well in the G
Major scale we have G
II wait g a b d e and so forth the
second is the a so if we start on a
which could be right here this is the
only way we can have all natural notes
by following the pattern so what was the
pattern again we had whole half whole
whole whole half oh so you go a b c d e
f g and this would be F sharp so let's
do this on a piano and see if this
applies CS piano here try and get bit
all right is I'm going to work so let me
just cover this we have a a whole step b
half step c whole step d whole step e
whole step f sharp half step G whole
step a so in order for this to be within
the key signature of g we must start on
the second scale degree of g which would
be a G a so this is the Dorian mode
basically starting on the second scale
degree and that's all I have to say
about the Dorian mode for now by the way
the Dorian mode is very similar to the
natural minor scale for example the
natural minor scale takes the major
scale lowers the third the sixth and
seventh I think one two three six seven
so one two three four five six seven so
what we did was take the c major scale
lower this note lower this note lower
this note to create into Dorian mode we
raise the sixth note so we actually have
a natural if we work to do it in the key
of a minor all natural notes we would
sharp so I sharp the sixth and the scale
so I had F sharp which applies to the G
Major scale because this is the G Major
scale
so if you remember when we were just
just a second ago writing on the staff
here's how the supplies you take the
minor scale and you can sharp six node
that's another way to think of it but
it's up to you how you want to think
about it so in the next video we will be
talking about the Phrygian mode yes see
you then
