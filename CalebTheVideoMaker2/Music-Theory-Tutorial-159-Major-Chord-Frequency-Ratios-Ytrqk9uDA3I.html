going to be talking about chord
frequencies so basically in the last
video I talked about consonance and
dissonance consonants is when sounds
vibrate - almost together
- where they like every four times or
five times they are on the same path and
that sounds Pleasant but when we switch
things up and make it so they're just
offset for a long period of time then we
get dissonance so behind me I have the
frequency ratios between notes of a
major minor diminished and 7th chords so
let's take a look here is the Triads
major minor diminished you can see major
which is typically considered the most
pleasant sounding has the lowest
frequency ratio so for example see eg
this is going to vibrate four times for
every five times this vibrates this will
vibrate five times for every this time
this thing vibrates six times so minor
it's it's high but it's still low if
that makes any sense so it's really not
that bad sounding it's just not quite as
pleasant sounding well but diminished on
the other hand it's so high
that's why diminished chords typically
sound really hmm just not fulfilling on
the font you couldn't and ending a song
with a diminished chord typically
doesn't sound that great now seventh
chords this is one of the most dissonant
ones of these three that is why will
often use the dominant seventh chord
this is referring to the dominant
seventh to bring back to the to the root
so for example g7 and with this ratio so
easily pulls back to the C with this
rate ratio ratio so that is why we often
do that rather than using a major
seventh because it doesn't add that
extra tension
we want we don't want sometimes we don't
want too much tension though cuz then it
can sound bad Mitch
major seventh I mean minor seventh it's
pretty high not too high the major
seventh is the lowest of the three so
this kind of explains things higher
ratio worse sound of that I mean it's
not like a rule I mean because for one
the term good can be different from
person to person for example you may
like the sound of minor chords I do you
may like the sound of diminished chords
so the term good isn't really a good
choice to use but that's what I use may
be fulfilling or complete we often want
to end on the root because there's less
dissonance that is all I really have to
say I found these really cool pictures
but I can't find them now it'll show the
it'll show like a sine wave and then
I'll show another sine wave of a
conflicting note and show how often they
overlap so be like and then from here it
keep going and then it break off again
but you can see it does overlap at some
point which means it doesn't sound
horrible
so yeah I think I've been practicing my
sine waves pretty well see that line up
for just part of a second and yeah
that's all I got to say so see you in my
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
