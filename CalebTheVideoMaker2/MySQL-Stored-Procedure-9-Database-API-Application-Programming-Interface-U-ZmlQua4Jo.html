off in the last video we were comparing
calling a procedure to just typing the
code that was within the procedures and
we came to the solution that just
calling the procedure was a whole lot
easier but there is an extra layer of
why this is way super cooler than just
doing this and that has to do with
security and now please do keep in mind
this is an introduction course so we're
not going to dive deep into security and
user roles right now at least but this
is important to know from the start so
I'm going to briefly explain it and then
if you find that this material is useful
you can take the extra step research it
and figure out what you need to do in
your situation this might just be a good
starting point so this video is going to
be about api's api is an acronym that is
thrown around way too much in
programming but it's very important so
I'd recommend learning it if you don't
already it stands for application
programming interface so what in the
world is an application programming
interface well let's first talk about
interfaces and you could describe
interfaces in like 50 different ways but
let's just kind of think of a couple of
them so here we have this beautiful city
we don't just want strangers walking in
looking around and stuff we want to
build up this crazy wall that only lets
certain people in this is such an awful
drawing Plus this isn't even applicable
today most of the time any new people
come in and just pretend this is in 3d
space so it's like all the way around
the city so people are coming in they're
like hey bro I have cool things like
weapons and I want to take over your
village and you're like nah bro
I didn't going to happen so this wall is
a separator from the city and the only
way to communicate with the city is
through this wall so if you're actually
a good guy and you're bringing in some
transports and with some goods and stuff
you can get in to see
but if you're a bad guy you can't it's
kind of it's an awful example of an
interface meaning that you interact with
the city through the wall you know what
this this example is awful let me give a
different one all right so you have a
car right because that's what cars look
like and in here you have like an engine
another junk but how do you drive this
car there's only like two or three
things you need to worry about and
that's the steering wheel or the beach
ball the gas pedal on the brake a seat
belts and a couple other things that's
about it these tools act as an interface
between you and the car the only way you
interact with this engine is through the
interface of the steering wheel the gas
and all that stuff and now that I gave
you - useless examples let's talk about
programming and programming it works the
same way so you can have this legit
tight awesome application right and over
here there's people I know like hey we
want to use your application but we're
probably gonna break it well in this
situation and API would be useful and
what it does is it allows you to allow
people to do certain things and it
allows you to prevent people from doing
certain things so the only way they can
communicate with your application is
from certain endpoints that you allow
them to so since this application is so
legit let's not even draw it as a square
let's draw it as like some crazy shape
right this is kind of like an interface
layer and the only way these people can
talk to your application is using these
certain points that you allow them to
use to communicate with your application
and this is like very basic explanation
and the way you apply an API in
different situations is gonna be
different but you can think of it as
this extra layer that you
on to your software that allows people
to communicate with certain parts of
your application couple examples of
interfaces and programming are operating
systems operating systems are a layer
between your hardware and your software
the job of the operating system is to
act as an interface between these two
filling the gaps so the operating system
can meet the needs of both the hardware
and the software without the operating
system you would have to program
directly onto the computer hardware
which we don't want to do that because
then if you have different hardware
you're gonna have to make a whole
different application another example or
applications that work with the database
you can think of a database over here
and then you have the application that
you use and then here is you you don't
get access to the database the only way
you can get access to the database is to
type on your application thing so
whatever the application is whether it
be an accounting application or whatever
you are very limited in what you can do
you can't be like lol delete database
because the people who made the database
don't want you to do that well in the -
ql context procedures are an api over
your database so here we have the
database and then here we have
procedures here we have programmers here
we have the software they develop and
here we have the users so by adding this
extra layer procedures you are creating
an interface between the programmer and
the database and that's good for two
reasons one it simplifies what the
person needs to know about programming
and database languages and two it's a
security measure because if you have
multiple programmers you can allow
certain ones to access certain different
procedures so that way they can't just
be like yeah I quit and by the way I
deleted your database so yeah you guys
get the idea and you can think
of procedures as an extra chain in this
link to the users and it just allows for
easier application development in some
situations if you got like SQL pros
having an extra person just to create
procedures might just be a big waste of
money in time it really depends on what
you're doing the security of what you're
doing and everything else now there's
one thing you need to know that when
you're giving these people user
permissions you have to do some
definition within the procedure so you
can say this person is allowed to use
this procedure if you want to know more
about that just go on google and search
SQL Security invoker and that's
something you can add into your
procedure definitions by just putting
one of these people's user names for
example and you can find that in the
MySQL Doc's another thing if you're
looking for the term that describes
simplifying things by creating an
interface it's known as an abstraction
operating systems for example are an
abstraction over the hardware layer of
computers that way we don't need to know
every single thing about the hardware
same thing for databases this layer of
procedures is an abstraction over the
database preventing us from having to
know every single thing about the
database to write our commands so yeah
guys that was a pretty awful video over
application programming interfaces and
those who actually create them probably
you're laughing at me right now but
that's all I got for you guys for now so
hopefully that was useful and I will see
you guys in the next video thanks for
