will be speaking about 7th chord
progression so a seventh is basically a
triad with an added seventh on top of it
so they're all major or minor thirds
separated apart from each other so what
does this mean let's create a scale and
I'll show you what I mean and remember
we're turning these into chords because
it's chord progression so let's use the
D major scale d e F sharp G a B C sharp
now if you don't know how to do that see
your circle of fifths or see my other
videos swatch the whole series learn a
lot and I'll get lots of use so anyways
we're going to start on on d which here
is d now to create a seventh chord we
add a third on top a third on top and
then another third on top that is a
seventh chord so we're going to do that
for every single scale degree
so this would be d e f g a b and finally
see so that is our 7th chord progression
and we add a key signature of D major so
we sharp the F and we sharp the sea
that's the sea not to be that's why it's
important you never mess those up you
just confuse people so that is on the
seat so that means which notes are going
to be affected by this key signature
well this one will this one will this
one will this one will this one will in
this one will so those are the ones that
will be affected now what's the next
step all we have to do is figure out
what kind of 7th chords these are well d
oh and also since this is up here on the
f we also have to affect these ones down
here so this one will be affected and
this will be affected don't forget about
that like I did so this is D F sharp a
and C sharp well I know d sharp well I
know we've gone through this a bunch but
I'm going to show it again dog I want to
do this for every single one though from
maybe I don't know so we're on d deep F
sharp is a major 3rd a is a minor third
which makes it a full dark hat that
would create a major triad plus up to um
c sharp one two three four so we have a
major third post a minor third plus a
major third this qualifies this as this
qualifies this as a major 7th chord
so in case you don't remember your major
7th chords go back and see my other
video because it takes a while to teach
them all so that's the major 7th chord
what about the next one e g b and d EG b
and d well egb is an E minor chord triad
i should say plus so we're on B and then
we go to d 1 2 3 so this is major plus a
minor plus a minor which qualifies this
as a minor 7th chord now the next one f
sharp and C sharp e F sharp and C sharp
II see that real quick f sharp one two
three four wait sorry 1 2 3 which is a 1
2 3 4 which is C sharp see you sorry
let's t-shirt caching 1 2 3 so I screw
something up no that was minor major
minor which qualifies this is a minor
7th sorry for my mistakes there next one
this is actually a major 7th and the
reason for this is we go G B D which
creates a a major triad then d 2 um II
not be rushing it d to f sharp is the
formation if you remember for a major
triad and d this gap this jump right
here is a major 3rd so I know this is a
major triad because we have a major
chord plus a major 3rd so this is a
major 7th try it and if you want to
figure that out it's just major 3rd plus
a minor 3rd plus a major third now for
the next one we're going to smell this
one out
a c-sharp e.g egg 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 which
yeah wait let me 1 2 3 4 C sharp so we
have there 1 2 3 e we have there and
then g 1 2 3 then so now we have major
minor minor which qualifies this as a
dominant 7th chord we can represent that
with just a seven run out of room here
now the next one is a minor 7th because
we have B D and then ah F sharp I don't
like you forgetting these bdnf sharp
which qualifies this as a B minor triad
f sharp to a whereas fer tripped up to
one two three so we have minor major
minor qualifies it as a minor seventh
lastly we have C sharp E G and B so
let's give this one a try some be
interesting so C sharp which askah from
the sea signature the key signature one
two three one which we haven't either 1
2 3g there 1 2 3 4 so we have a minor
third minor third and a major 3rd so
this qualifies this as a half diminished
made half diminished 7th we represent
that as
we can represented with a seventh we
write dim 7 with a Celsius oh I don't
know what that sign is called right
there with a slash through it to
represent half so that is the chord
progression for a D major scale on the
7th chords although this sticks through
for every single major scale so if we
start on C do this real quickly we are
going to get marker cover go we're going
to get c d e f g a b now we're going to
get a major 7th minor 7th minor 7th now
this one we're going to need a major 7th
this we're going to get a dominant 7th
hey we're going to get a minor 7th be
we're going to get a diminished 7th a
finished so this will be the chord
progression for any major scale and that
is important because which 7th do we
typically use we typically use a
dominant seventh or the fifth scale
degree so that is why we go from C and
oftentimes will travel to a g7 which
wants to pull us back to AC so G sevens
often lead to sees if we were in the
scale of D let's figure out what would
be the equivalent well the fifth is a
dominant 7 so you have d e F sharp G a B
C so 1 2 3 4 5 a dominant 7th a a 7
wants to pull back to ad make sense
hopefully it does so that is basics of
7th chord progression and in the next
video we'll be going over something
similar I not sure what yet
oh well anyways I'll see you soon thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
