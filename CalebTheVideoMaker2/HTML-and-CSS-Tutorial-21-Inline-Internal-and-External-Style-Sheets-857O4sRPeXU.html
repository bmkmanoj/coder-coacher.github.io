drink real quick and I'm not even going
to restart so now we're going to learn
about these three types of styling
external internal and inline that's what
in light on let's get up now when we're
styling sometimes it's convenient to do
a quick style like this although if
we're going to do that for every single
piece of information on our entire
website it gets pretty crazy so what we
can do is we can take whole this and
actually put it within the head of the
article right so I'm not sure if it goes
before the title or after the title I
don't think it matters I put it after so
what we can do with this is we can say
style give a style tag and we're going
to end a style tag just like this note
then here we can put CSS styling you
don't really know how to do this yet but
that's what we'll be getting into in the
next video so just follow along pretend
you know what I'm typing in what I
should be doing and so forth you can
even correct me if you want you probably
are actually you've probably been
correcting me this entire time but it's
okay now I still will not a weird way
like okay that was kind of weird anyway
so let's go so I can be like padding G
equals 30 pixels now it's going to poof
it up BAM got more say background color
equals red it's going to weird so now we
have this alright now this black text is
kind of hard to read so I'm going to
make it a different color I could say
how can I do that I could say yeah
paragraph I could say color equals white
so now we can really see that now what's
with the second red box here well let's
let's try and figure that out we got
first
OOP see what I do there we have a
paragraph and then we have a second
paragraph one we should be ending the
pair
so refresh there we go that looks a lot
better now so that's an example of
styling things so we could have a
unordered list I'm going to get out of
the head real quick and this is going to
be a shopping list I need I need some
music
dinosaur done Schuyler thoughts all
right and then music we also need some
laser popcorn send a pie refresh I got
my little shopping list here you can add
a little h3 title shopping list oh right
now you can see the shopping list is
really close to the white right there it
looks kind of crappy so we can do is up
in our style sheet we can add something
for a shopping list we can go h3 within
here we can make padding which gives it
extra spacing 2010 pixels refresh the
page and that looks a lot better all
right awesome so what can we do with
this well we can let's think what we can
do is take this shopping list on h3 then
we had a li list items
li we can give it some HTC yes we can go
text Dec cool oh sorry ignore this
text declaration and then we could set
this to either over line I think line
through or underlined so I'm going to go
line through see what it does and see it
crossed out my shop in this because I
got them what so that's one thing we can
do and that's just in basic HTML so
here's in line where we put it right
beside the stuff we just style equals
and then we put our content or I can
bring it up in the head by putting a
style tag there's one more way we can do
this though and that is with a external
style sheet so if we get rid of all this
crap all right we still we we add a link
we're still in the head of the file and
then we have rel I'm just going to type
out the spots real quick type each with
alright so here is basic link to a style
sheet so we have a style sheet type B I
think text port slash CSS href is where
the style sheet is located so I could
say style
I've got style style for a while not CSS
alright so now it's going to take a
style while you see it still has some
style so what's up with that that's
because they have inline right here so
if we get rid of that extra inline
garbage it's going to bring it back to
how it was originally so now let's see
what see what it has to say for itself
after looks crappy oh that's boring
so if we had a style in a different file
it'd probably work but only for a while
so I'm going to create a new file
uh yes I can't think of any other
rhyming words so we're going to save
this as stop Oh CSS now we can put the
same stuff in here so P padding equals
20 pixels and I'll be explaining this
stuff in upcoming videos don't worry out
dunk don't freak out 300 pixels boom now
it's all funky put oh so that's just the
difference between inline internal and
external stylesheets inline puts it
right within the tag internal puts it in
the head
external puts it in the ad but links to
a different file that you can use to
style your pages
I recommend external and that's probably
what I'll be using for most if not all
of the rest of the series so if I need
inline I'll probably use it but I doubt
I will so I shall see you in the next
video sorry excuse me
subscribe to my youtube channel right
sorry about that
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
