want to talk about dye tones and try
tones so what are dye tones and try
tones well if you remember we have what
are called whole steps and half steps
you see that up there hopefully whole
steps and half steps now this is
basically the equivalent of moving two
keys on a piano or two pitch steps C 2 D
would be to pitch dips so anyways a
whole step is it another way of saying a
tone and a half step is the same way of
saying a semitone we have what is called
a Titan which basically consists of two
whole steps so a diatone has four hop
steps then we also have a tritone which
is the same as three whole steps so you
may hear the term tritone often and
basically it consists of three whole
step intervals basically it consists of
three whole step intervals so we can go
C to D and then we can go D to e and
finally we can go E to F sharp so the
entire interval is C to F sharp how many
half steps is it well 6 and this can
call six half steps can qualify this as
either an Augmented fourth or a
diminished fifth so which is it
well we let's see how many notes recover
one two three four so this is an
Augmented fourth if you don't understand
that just think a normal forth as five
half steps if we have six it becomes an
Augmented fourth so I'm gonna get into
what's called proper track tones
we have an Augmented fourth versus a
diminished fifth they both consist of
six half steps don't understand that go
see my intervals video basically an
Augmented fourth is originally five half
steps for a perfect fourth and then we
add one to make it sixth diminish on
seven I mean perfect fifth has seven we
subtract one and get six so they both
have six half steps let's try the
interval F to be well we can break this
up into F - G G to a and then a to b see
these are consider three whole steps or
tones which qualifies this as a Trenton
so that is an example of a augmented and
Augmented fourth because we went from F
would be one G a B so we're only
covering four staff lines F G a B one
two three four
now let's try a different one now let's
try different ones such as B - f so when
we talked about flipping the interval at
f - B we flipped that it's originally
Augmented fourth becomes a diminished
fifth B - f and when we create this we
get B is C C - D D to E and then eat it
so we have semi tempo I guess we could
say half step half step whole step whole
step half step so this still is six half
steps because this is 2 - 1 1 these are
all add up to 6
so is it a tritone well yeah but it's
it's said to be an improper tritone
because we can't break it up into 3
whole steps or tones so yes when you're
talking about tried tones if someone's
talking about a proper tried tune
they're talking
landed forth if they're talking about
improper tratan they're talking about
diminished fifth suite now when we're
talking about Dai Tunes some scales will
not have more than a die tone for an
interval so no more than four half steps
between notes and people will say this
scale is diatonic well I wanted to
mention this even though it's not that
important this is not the same thing as
the scale we talked about earlier a
diatonic scale consisting of two notes
diatonic scale consisting of nothing
more than a die tone these are two
different things
and you'll hear both words possibly so
make sure you know which one they're
talking about either a diatonic scale
consisting of only two notes or a
diatonic scale consisting of intervals
no larger than a die tune so that's all
I have to say about Triton's and dot
tones in this video and the next video
where we get into something else so see
you then
