like now you might be like shocked at
first trust me it's not that bad here we
start at C 1/5 from C goes to G 5th from
G goes to D - a - E that look at the
bottom one be F sharp C sure we already
learned this if we go flat it goes this
direction same concept so this is
basically just what I showed you except
it's in a circle now to represent it how
it goes on so it just I don't know why
it's in a circle to be honest I just
made that up
so we can see C has zero in the key
signature G has one focus focus focus
there we go auto focus is Tang it still
doesn't work
alright D has two a has three he has
four V has five and then it goes down to
F sharp focus and then finally we have
AC sharp I know you can't really see
this because it's so blurry same thing
for the flat we have F B flat E flat a
flat D flat C flat I mean G flaps are
and then C flat now when you're looking
for a specific key signature such as for
let's say there's four flats in the key
signature take a look at the circle of
fifths a flat has four and the key
signature if you can see that which
means we're playing in the key of a flat
major which is cooled now that we know
what key were playing in we know what
scale to use and the reason
for this is the distance between the
notes stays the same although we just
scooted it up or scooted it down to a
flat this will allow the song to be in a
higher or lower pitch and it's cool
because we just learnt now that we need
to flat the following notes we need a
flat a a B D and E which is the first
remember starts with because b e which
is good way to remember that so that's
pretty cool alright so I think that's
about all for the circle of fifths for
now but I do recommend you learn to this
learn into the study into this I don't
know what word is but whatever it is
figured out memorize the circle of
fifths i memorize most of it I still
have some struggles struggles figuring
things out but basically I memorized
that it goes C c/g da EB F sharp it goes
this direction F I think is B flat E
flat a flat D flat G flat and then
finally C flat and if you don't can't
memorize this boy have to remember is it
alternates between these two notes so we
go from C to G well what comes after C D
what comes after G hey
what comes after D e comes after a B so
forth same thing for this it just goes
the opposite direction we have F so see
what comes before C just remember these
all have flats B flat comes before F E
what comes before B and what comes
before E D what comes before a G comes
before D C it's kind of like this cool
little pattern thing you just got a fake
out it takes lots of practice and I know
this is probably like the longest most
boring it's possible video entire world
but if you watch this whole thing
congratulations you now understand how
music can be boring is sometimes it's
not always exciting all the most the
time it's pretty fun plus once you get
the hang of this
it really helps things out for example
if I need to raise my song from a
c-major up to a D major I now know that
I need to sharp the C and the F I think
yes and if I want to raise it up to a G
then I need to raise the F to F sharp
and so forth so that's the circle of
fifths thank you for watching hopefully
I helped clear some things up without
confusing the heck out of you probably
not
cuz I'm stupid but anyways thank you for
watching be sure to subscribe and I will
see you in the next video where we're
going over some more stuff and thank you
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
