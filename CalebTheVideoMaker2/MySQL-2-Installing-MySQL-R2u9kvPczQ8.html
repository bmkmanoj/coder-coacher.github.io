cable the video maker - I'm Caleb and in
this video we are going to be
downloading and installing MySQL
database so we go to the MySQL comm
website and click downloads now there's
a couple different things you're going
to want to download the first is the
actual database and if you scroll down
here you can find MySQL community
Edition and that's the free version
we're going to start with so what we are
going to want is the community server
now if you need in-depth information on
how to install this you can click the
installation instructions right here or
you can just follow my video now you're
going to want to scroll down and install
one of these so either ones fine I'm
just gonna go with the first one and
it's gonna look like you have to log in
or sign up but actually you can just
click this no thing start my download
click that yes make sure you read this
delicious novel it's very awesome so
intense now I'm going to go custom on
this one under this one I'm going to add
the server itself and we're going to go
with a 64-bit one and then under
applications I'm going to go with MySQL
workbench there's a bunch of other stuff
you might want to download if you're not
really sure you can just install the
full package for example if you want to
work with C++ or net you might want to
install some of these things but
honestly this is all I'm going to need
if you're unsure I would go back and
click the full installation but I'm
trying to save as much space as possible
so let's go with this for now execute
alright next next
alright this stuff's important what kind
of machine are you going to be using I'm
going with development tcp/ip port
number this is important if you have
something running on this port you can
have conflicts that's probably good
click advanced if we really want but def
that sounds scary
so let's not next now we need to set a
password now this is for what's known as
the root account it's kind of like the
super
admin administrator so if this is a
production environment you want to make
sure you have a very secure password and
you can actually create user accounts
that are allowed to do other certain
things now obviously this situation I'm
going to go at the root account because
why not this is my machine and this is
just for learning so let's go with root
now it starts talking about services and
services are applications that run in
the background when your computer is
running you can find those by going to
your Start menu and typing in services
here is a huge list of services that are
running on my machine this is talking
about configuring MySQL as a service so
I'm going to have it to where I'm
running MySQL as a service and it's
going to start up automatically when I
turn my computer on come on Claire this
one's fine here so let's click Next now
this page talks about all these extra
features you can enable by checking this
box I decided I'm going to check that
and now we are finally ready to finish
this whole process now I'm going to
check private networks and uncheck
public networks and there we go we have
MySQL installed now how do we actually
use this well if you go to your Start
menu and go to all apps you can scroll
down to the MS and find MySQL and inside
of here we are going to have MySQL
workbench and the command line client
will be talking about MySQL workbench in
upcoming videos but just for fun let's
start with the command line client now
when this pops up it's going to ask for
your root user account password and I'm
just going to type mine in and now we
can start writing our sequel commands so
I'm just going to start with select five
times five and if you press ENTER it'll
keep going down to the next line that's
because you have to put what's known as
a delimiter which in this case is a
semicolon there you go we just wrote our
first select statement so that's that
guys hopefully that was enough
information to keep your brain working
for the next few minutes we'll be
continuing and we'll finally start
learning about different SQL commands if
you liked this video please be sure to

continue on to the next video thanks
guys see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
