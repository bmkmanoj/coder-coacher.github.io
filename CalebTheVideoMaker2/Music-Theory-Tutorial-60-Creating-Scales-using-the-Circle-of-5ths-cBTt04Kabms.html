demonstration of the circle of fifths
let's say I need to know how to create
an E flat major scale
well the flats typically go this way and
the sharps typically go this way so
we're going to look over here go down to
F then to B and what's below B if I can
get this to work then we have E flat
down here and we can see there's three
flat signs ones on the a of the e ones
on the B ones on the a B EA and bead so
that means when we're creating a scale
for a flat major hey guys what's up this
video I'm going to be telling you about
recreating scales using the circle of
fifths and I figured I was going to move
on from the circle of fifths but I
decide to use it some more for some
stuff so let me get a picture of it up
on my tablet we're going to eath whoops
be flat then we take follow those BA so
a flat is one of them
B basically follow the scale up to the
staff because this is this is e so we no
no we SH flat be eaten day
he's flattened F well we know this is a
so he's flattened the egg what else we
find
we flattened the beat B's right here we
also flattened this one because this is
also an E so now we have recreated the E
flat major scale using the circle of
fifths now if you remember the circle of
fifths had three flats this one has four
you might be wondering why that's
because these are both the pitch of E
flat so we're only using one E flat
we're just recreating on a different
line
that's why even though it talks it
points these on here this ear ight here
also represents this a down here when
we're fighting it it's all East not just
a specific one so this has three
flattened pitches and we just figure
that out using the circle of fifths
which is cool so if we need it and
another scale we could just oh I need to
figure out how to make an B scale a boom
there we got it it tells us what notes
we need to flatten
I mean sharpen and bam we can just
recreate it very simple I like it so
I'll see you next video
thanks for watching see
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
