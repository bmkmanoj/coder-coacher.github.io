32nd PHP tutorial in the last video we
talked about creating indexed and
associative arrays and in this video I
want to talk about the array function so
if it's helpful please be sure to
subscribe so in the last video we
created a race like this we would first
make the variable and then we would
create a bar brackets and then we will
assign it a value either single or
double quoting so we would make it like
this and now Caleb has the value Caleb
obviously with the index 0 well there's
an easier way to do this and we could do
that let's let's create a new array
let's go with cool things all right and
now we just assign it the value of array
so this is a function what it's going to
do is it's going to create an array it's
gonna take this value within these
parentheses create an array and then
it's going to assign that array we're
assigning that array to the variable
cool things so with an array we just
start cool things I'm just gonna make
the parentheses first to make things
simple okay let's think of some cool
things bubble wraps pretty awesome
lasers gravity cannon okay so now we
have an array cool since we can echo out
one of these values
like this and see now we need to
announce what key we want to echo out so
we can say one for example which is
going to echo out the second thing
lasers or we could go pretty much
anything either at 0 1 2 3 or 4 so let's
try 4 should print out anti-gravity a to
Buchanan all right cool now what if we
wanted to create an associative array
the way associative array works is it
will tie a string to a value rather than
an index of 0 0 through however many
numbers to a value let's try creating a
indexed array with this technique so
let's create food and we're going to
create an array now just for easier
reading we're going to open this up I'm
going to type this out and then I'll
explain it
okay so now that I typed this out let me
explain what's going on sure I did
everything right all right seems to be
good
here is the associative King so
breakfast points which is why I make
this arrow using an equal sign and a
greater than sign points to the value of
cereal the key launch points to steak
dinner points to human flesh hmm snack
points to a cereal again yes I eat a lot
of cereal so now this is an associative
array and also we don't need all this
extra whitespace if you don't feel like
using it this should work just the same
so let's try refreshing it and you can
see it still works alright so let's try
acting echoing out one of these well it
works pretty similar and we're going to
echo out this refresh the page and add
it on seriously so I'm pretty sure I
mentioned this in the last video but if
you want to quote it well this is going
to cause an error boom you see so what
we do we just put these within curly
braces because it's an associative array
so let's try now all right and also
probably up if I had mind closing these
okay well so now hey bro let's go nom
nom nom want some cereal that is how to
create a race using the array function
and I do believe that it's all I have to
say so now I'm going to move on
multi-dimensional arrays I'm gonna do
that in this video so let's do it let's
create another food category and it's
going to be an array now we are going to
make the two keys for going to make a
sandwich and that's go I guess sandwich
and that is going to also be an array
and then we're going to make a let's go
serial and is also going to be an array
so this is what we get all right that's
your first page everything seems to be
good okay now as you can see it's an
array and this is an associative array
because we're assigning the string
sandwich and giving it a value of an
array we're taking the value cereal and
we're giving it the value of an array so
within these array let's make an index
array what makes a sandwich bread does
meat does and cool and now what makes
cereal
well obviously cereal oftentimes
consists of cereal usually I get some
milk up and then less you're lactose
intolerant Anna so now it is an array of
enlace of an array is an array of a race
so now let's try echoing out one of
these values well first we echo out food
and then within square brackets we put
the associative array I'm sorry
cereal
and then within another group of square
brackets we can make the indexed array
so let's go with one which should list
milk so let let me explain what's going
on here we have food which right here
which then after food we go to cereal
and then after spewed we go to the index
one so this is 0 this is 1 all right so
let's try this save it in refresher page
and yes it refresh out is milk so we did
do that right another thing I want to
add is sorry one of my videos is
finished if you want to start an array
with a different number we can just say
1 equals or make an arrow and now number
one is cereal notice two banana is 3 so
let's try that number 3 banana alright
so that's all over there say in this
video and if you liked it be sure to
