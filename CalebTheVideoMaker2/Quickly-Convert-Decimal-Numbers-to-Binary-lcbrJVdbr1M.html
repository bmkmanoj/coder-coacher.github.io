video maker and in this video I'm going
to be talking to you telling you how to
easily convert decimals like this into
binary
alright so this is just a follow the
step pattern so you don't really need to
understand anything but if you want to I
created a super in-depth 45-minute video
over decimals in binary so be sure to
check that out so the first thing that
you do basically you're just gonna
follow this pattern you're going to need
a calculator unless you can do
everything in your head like me alright
so basically you just take the number
you have and you multiply it Kappa you
multiply it by 2 so 0.78 1 2 5 multiply
that by 2 says what we have yeah right
there and equals or whatever and then
you get 1.5625 now we're going to
continue to do this process but every
time we look at this first number to the
left of the decimal in this case and
we're going to append that or add that
to our binary numbers so we start with
0.1 and then we can get rid of that
we're going to work with this right here
once we have just as decimal we can take
that and once again multiply that by 2
that's a pattern we're going to follow
each time so we take point 5 6 2 5
multiply that by 2 and here's what we
get one one one point one two five there
we go
okay 1 0.125 all right so once again we
take this one add it to our binary and
then just get rid of it and then what we
do is we take point 1 2 5 multiply that
by 2 we get 0.25 so we take the 0 put it
down to the bottom so even if it's not a
1 we still have to put that 0 there
basically that's saying it it didn't
reach 1 that time so we don't have
enough therefore we add
a zero so just take that zero move it
down to the bar or move to your binary
and then take point 25 multiply that by
two again zero point five once again
take that zero move it to the bottom
bolt then you can get rid of it and then
once you have point five that's that's
the answer that you would want to get
you will take that anything that's going
to evenly multiply into one in the end
is what you want to get so you multiply
that by two and you will get one point
zero take that one move it down to the
bottom and then get rid of it now
obviously we have zero and if you
multiply 0 by 2 you're going to have
zero so this is as far as you can go and
this is our final answer and we can talk
a little bit more about that how long
we've three minutes so that's the
process you can do it for more complex
things in some cases you're not going to
get an answer that quickly if you have
it really like if you had 78 126 7 well
that's going to be a much longer example
obviously the farther you go in your
binary the farther you go right the more
precise your answer but in some cases
you will never reach an end
for example 0.1 well it'll just keep
repeating and you'll have this pattern
of like 0 see I don't remember batter
but I think it's zero and I'll keep
going and keep going and keep going and
you'll never reach an end so there is at
some point you'll need to either stop or
figure out a pattern that keeps
repeating some some will just keep going
forever and you'll get tired but that is
how you do that if you want to look at
this fraction wise this first number is
1/2 the second number is 1/4
this is 1/8 we don't have it one
sixteenth and 1/32 so here are our total
fractions that we have if you want to do
the math add these fractions up we could
look at 1/2 that's
same thing as 0.5 1/4 is point 25 and
then 1/32 what is that 1/32 and you get
Oh point 0 3 1 2 5 now when you add that
up when you add all these up so point 0
3 1 2 5 plus point 25 plus point 5 you
get who would he get 7 8 1 2 5 which
that was the original number we started
with before I screwed up so yeah that is
how to easily convert from decimal
decimal fractions or whatever basically
when you have a decimal number you want
to convert it to binary that is how you
do it everything right of the decimal is
considered to be fractions rather than
whole numbers multiples of 2 its
division of two 1/2 1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32 so
yeah if that was useful be sure to
subscribe and I will check you guys out
in the next I'm not gonna check you out
this weird did it mean that I'm gonna
check out and then you guys can
subscribe to my youtube channel yeah
that's right hit myself in the head</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
