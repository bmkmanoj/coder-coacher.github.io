talking about the Ionian mode now
surprisingly enough we actually know the
Ionian mode from our previous videos we
just didn't know it was called this
because it's usually not call this it's
called the major scale so the Ionian
mode is a pattern of holes and half
steps whole whole half whole whole whole
half so let's try this starting on C and
I'm going to use a keyboard to show this
visually so I don't have to do it all in
her head and overthink things ouran see
when we cross the black key across a
black key that's a whole step we don't
cross a black key it's a half step whole
step whole step half step whole step
whole step whole step half step so if
you didn't notice they were all the
white keys so they're all natural piece
how do we represent natural keys with a
little natural sign but if there's no
sign at all it's does it's a thought to
be natural so I don't have to write C
natural d natural and everything we just
write c d e f g a b in the back to see
so this is the Ionian mode of C simple
enough let's try the Ionian mode of F
major we have the first thing always
when we're creating these modes is we
can just go from the first letter we
start on up every single letter of the
alphabet back to re end so we have f
g a b c d e and f and then we can follow
these whole step half step patterns to
know what accidentals we need to add Oh
pull half so we have an accidental well
which one is it on we go whole whole
half so this is going to be B flat full
whole whole half back so the only note
that has an accidental and the ionian of
F is B flat so if someone told you to
create the Ionian mode starting on F
this is what you would give them this is
whole whole half whole laughs by the way
if you haven't noticed yet you can
represent whole steps with a little loop
half steps with a little spike so let's
this was also by the way the first scale
on the circle of fifths to the left on
the flat side because CG da but on this
side it goes f so the first one on the
left is the F so if you haven't noticed
already the Ionian is basically another
way to say the major scale nothing too
major well it actually is major but
that's besides the point so in the next
video I'll be talking about the Dorian
mode and i will see you that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
