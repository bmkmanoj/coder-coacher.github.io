something and that's not necessarily
important to know if you just want to
create PHP programs but this will help
you understand exactly what PHP is doing
behind the scenes when you're creating
your scripts or webpages or whatever it
still has to do with the and and or
logical operators I want to know I want
to talk to you about something known as
short-circuit evaluation or I don't even
know the technical name but a
short-circuit this is what PHP does to
make the program run faster and to get
faster results basically let's say we
have a and if and then within these
parentheses we have some sort of test it
doesn't really matter what it is like if
variable is greater than this number or
whatever it doesn't really matter and
this test here and actually let's just
this is go all out and make three tests
so now we have three tests here okay now
in order for an an to work they all have
to be true true true true and then this
code will be executed between these
curly brackets does that make sense
better better makes sense so a
short-circuit
well if in order for this to work they
all have to be true that means if one of
them is false then it's not going to run
this code here so if PHP is going
through and says oh if okay let's say
this one's true good but this one is
false well we already know they all have
to be true in order for this code to
work so even without even testing this
one here we still know this is not going
to work so PHP will actually skip over
that one and just start programming
after the if or start running after
if executing whatever you want to call
it so that's a short circuit it didn't
go through the effort of trying every
single possibility because what if it
was like let's say there was a hundred
possibilities 100 tests and there was an
and between every single one so they all
had to be true the first one was false
the rest of the 99 were all true it
wouldn't make sense for PHP to test the
first one and then test every single one
after that just to know okay well one
the first one's false so we're not going
to run the code so that's what a
short-circuit does it's the same for an
or statement so like for an or we're
gonna have here's a test or this one and
one of these has to be true makes sense
so if this one's true well then we
already know this whole thing is going
to be evaluated as true even though we
never even looked at this one this
couldn't this one could be true it's
still true or this one could be false
and it'd still be true does that make
sense basically it's going to take a
shortcut to skip over unnecessary
testing to make your program faster
that's pretty much all that
short-circuiting is about so yeah that's
it
a short video but hopefully it was
helpful in the next video we'll be
getting into something a little new but
still similar which isn't really new now
I'm confused but anyways thank you for
watching be sure to subscribe and I'll
see you in the next video be sure to
subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
