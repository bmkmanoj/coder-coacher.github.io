you've ever wondered why a perfect
interval can't become minor I'm going to
explain now this is called flipping the
interval it's a process you need to know
about flipping the ball sounds fancy but
it's really nothing too big
basically what we're doing is so if we
have a staff and let's say we have an e
to a G flipping the interval is taking
one of the notes and raising it or
lowering it an octave so if I take this
E and move it up to here because the
rumor FAC e my raised it in octave you
see so now we don't have the e on the
bottom we have the e on the top that's
called flipping it because iswhat like I
flipped cm say it's like C so let's take
a look at it
E - what was originally deep I mean the
original e - d let's take a look at the
interval G sorry well we know it's 1/3
because it covers three spots one two
three sound weird 3 how many half steps
1 1 2 3 so we know it's a minor 3rd now
let's try it from G to e 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9
oh it's a I my steps 1 2 3 4 5 it's a
major 6th so we can see that the minor
became major so
we can see that if we same thing if we
take a major and swap it flip it it
becomes a minor so major becomes minor
now let's try it with it perfect so
let's let's get a perfect fifth all
right we write it out first here's the
staff three four five we're going to go
from C to G now we're going to take the
C and move it up here that makes sense
hopefully that makes sense so we're
taesik aliy taking these notes and we're
going to move this and instead we're
going to play AC five I mean let's get
over to your sofa here so instead of
this we're going to go so we just
swamped them if that doesn't make any
sense now uh we took this C and screwed
it up here it was a fifth and it was
perfect because there was seven half
steps a perfect fifth makes sense but
now if we take the G and count to see we
got one two three four five all right
there's five half steps and what's the
interval size G a B C that's four
perfect fourth has how many has steps
five so I perfect stays perfect it
becomes it perfect
now there's only two other interval
sizes we have which were augmented and
diminished now I'm just going to tell
you if you can try it out for yourself
if you take it augmented interval and
you take the bottom one flop it up to
the top so let's say we have low C and
an interval that's an Augmented one I
don't know any from that and then we
flop it so like a geesh yeah so C to G
sharp and then swap it it's going to be
G sharp to C and it'll be diminished so
I hope that one works augmented becomes
diminished and vice-versa so perfect
becomes perfect major becomes minor
minor becomes major augmented becomes
diminished diminished becomes augmented
let's try that so C to G sharp sorry
that's that's a perfect fifth seven half
steps now has eight half steps so let's
try
that's an Augmented fifth let's try G
sharp Universal G sharp to C it's one
two three four and what's the scale size
1/4 1 2 3 4 so the interval size is 1/4
with 1 2 3 4
sorry 1 2 3 4 5 the interval size is 1/4
with 1 2 3 4 half steps so as you can
say see that perfect fourth should have
5 so it's actually a diminished forth so
augmented becomes diminished and
diminished becomes augmented when you
just swatch swap the swatch swap the
places of them or basically move the
bottom one up above an octave so from C
4 to C 5 for example now as for the
interval size there's a little trick we
can take the original size let's say
here's a staff we have e2g that's a
third we can take that number and
subtract it from nine nine minus three
equals six that's not a G that's a six
so the new interval size will become a
major sixth e to G is a minor third
thirty minus front minus three
subtracted from nine is a sixth
therefore it becomes a major because
minor turns into major so the answer is
a major six so the reason perfect are
perfect is because when you flip them
they stay perfect you can't flip them
into something else they'll always be
perfect when you flip them and if they
become something else you're doing it
wrong we have an Augmented fourth well
if we subtract four from nine we get
nine minus four oh shoot b5 so Augmented
Augmented fourth becomes a diminished
fifth hopefully that makes sense and
that's all you need to know about
flipping the interval whoa but you
always want to know how to do that see
ya see you in the next video
is
