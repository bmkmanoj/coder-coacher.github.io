series or if you just stop and buy and
check this video out what's up my name
is Caleb and I'm teaching you HTML and
CSS so yeah let's work on the border
stuff you know
you know man I said is what we got we
got this little comment section which
pretty crappy but that's okay no one
cares well well we have border style we
also learned some other border content
what we're going to in a second anyways
we have border color which we can use to
change content so I'm going to make this
some weird color here yellow I don't
like it
to rc8 well that's better so now we have
this comments and we can give it a color
and we also have border width so this is
going to make the border really fat or
really thin whatever you want to say so
pinkish red border is now three pixels
big well now it's 10 pixels big and now
now it's a hundred mixes big well oh you
think it's funny well now the house
embarrasses me oh yeah oh yeah ten dolls
all right I'm gonna go back to ten all
right so I mean that's a little fat for
me I mean not nothing anything gets fat
things well all right okay now I just
sound rude all right well anyways border
with ten pixels but you can also do the
whole border left with five pixels just
know whichever one you do first is going
to override it so this one's going to if
this gives it five pixels this one will
sign it ten and override it they don't
add or subtract or anything but
whichever one comes last is the one
that's going to be the one that gets the
final display so we got water left width
order right quicks order top wit that's
not top I guess I did a some pixels
pixels and the border bottom so that's
everything with five as the width so we
can change these individually so I'm
going to get rid of the left width and
make it zero pixels and order top with
zero pixels I'll talk with sorry wall
power right width zero pixels so now
this is what we get on the div so we get
this interesting look here and now we
can actually go down to the paragraph
thing and we can unhide these and
instead of make giving them a zero
pixels border we could just give them
this border left scopes left style
hidden and right style hidden it does
the same exact thing so we can do this
and it should look if it looks exactly
the same awesome
and down here we are going to bring back
these border left styles by giving them
a solid the border right style of this
solid so now we have these comments and
the only problem is is it looks too
close to these letters which you can fix
yes although we are not going to get
into that quite yet but we will be
getting into that in a future video so
stick with us and I'm going to get a
drink will click
all right so want to go over one more
thing real quick we can do something
pretty sweet if you ask me I'm gonna get
rid of this right here we could do a
border quick and then we can put
something like this and you're probably
thinking why did you put four of them
well what this does is it actually goes
in a square left I'm sorry I don't know
the order yeah I think it's top right
bottom left and we can assign different
pixels to these so top right bought left
so we can get rid of the right and left
by doing this or we can individually
alter these like it 10 20 30 40 let's
see what it looks like oh that looks
really cool actually make some trippy
stuff on here all right so yeah I'm
gonna bring this all back so you can do
that as well as with other things such
as border color you can go a red green
blue yellow and it's not working awkward
what am i doing very simple I forgot to
accidentally click on one sec commas
here when commas do not be long between
the words so now we're going to get this
super cool border here oh that's pretty
awesome let's get us some extra pixels
let's give it 15 to this one 5 fresh
this bad boy now let's let's make a
really cool
oh that's awesome let's let's uh all
right I want the left side and the right
side to both be green so how can I do
this well just like we can have four
here if we do the same thing but with
three here's how it works
the first number the first color mean is
going to go to the top the last color is
going to go to the bottom but the middle
color is going to go to the left and
right so now look at it both the left
and the right sides are green now we can
also do the same thing with two colors
so what does that mean that means that
the top and bottom are red and the ball
the right and left are green so that
that's for you colored following people
this is red this is green so I'm going
to change that to blue click alright
sweet it's pretty awesome so we can
actually do some cool shading effects
here so like let's try with RGB values
of course because they're awesome two
five five two five five mm it's going to
be I don't even know if house work would
work or not all right yeah so we got
like white so we don't really want white
so we're going to get lower these down
to like 150 255
whoops zero that's going to get that
cool green
zero to five 150 and then we can alter
one just a little bit by giving some
extra black such as lower the numbers by
twenty or so I think that should work
hopefully and then we get this darker
green on the side both might clash I'm
not really good with colors I can't even
match my own like pants but if we were
to do some sort of grey like trying to
create here that's kind of grey let's
just discuss 222-2222
so now I have this greyish blue whatever
I don't really know and then we could
make one of them darker by lowering the
numbers so like 180 200 and 200 whoops
now I got this cool effect where the top
and bottom are a little darker can
barely even notice well if you look it
is apparent we can lower the numbers up
even more 160 180 and 180 so now now
it's very obvious we get some really
cool outlines for our comments and you
can just mess around that do you figure
out something that looks cool to design
pretty much whatever you want so just
like this works with the width it also
works with colors and same thing for if
you take out like two of these or
whatever so yeah it's kind of all this
stuff comes together to where you can
fully understand CSS so I kind of went
into a lot of depth here hopefully
didn't bore you to death but I'm going
to stop talking now thank you for
