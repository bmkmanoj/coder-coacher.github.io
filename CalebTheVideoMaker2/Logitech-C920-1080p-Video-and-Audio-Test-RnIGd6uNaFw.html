the 1080 oh my hairs all messed up well
that's weird
anyways this is the 1080p test and what
I learned from the last video is I don't
think the microphone quality is the
greatest so if if you do use this camera
you may want to look into getting
another type of microphone this one's
not the greatest either but I'm just
saying the microphone is a webcam
quality microphone in my opinion so if I
make videos I doubt I'll use it but if
you guys think it's good let me know and
I'll reconsider it or look into more so
some more options this is the 1080
version so that means it's larger file
size but it's also more detailed and
honestly I was pretty satisfied with the
720 version so I don't I don't see the
necessity to go to 1080 unless it's a
lot better and I guess that's what we're
going to find out once again you still
have all the same settings you can zoom
in not nearly as much obviously the
amount you can zoom in is much more
limited and you still have some of the
other options you can turn off right
sound or left sound you can do that with
720 - but that's going to make it mono
and just take audio from like the left
microphone rather than both of them I
mean still go to the autofocus and turn
that off and you can manual focus it and
I guess I can do a focusing test with
1080 I'll try not to focus on my finger
but rather the quarter and see if it'll
do that's amazing let's see you can't
get it it's having some struggles
focusing try the other side here
mainly my fingers getting in the way so
this obviously it can focus on it pretty
pretty good so you can see that it does
focus good but obviously when I was
holding the quarter it's quite harder to
focus because it's it's smaller and
oftentimes my finger gets right in the
way and confuses it so yeah that's the
auto focusing not so well with the
quarter but still it still works if you
play around with it enough so yeah
that's pretty much all you can still go
to the advanced settings and change all
that stuff if you want so yeah thank you
for watching and hopefully I'll be able
to use this webcam for some content I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
