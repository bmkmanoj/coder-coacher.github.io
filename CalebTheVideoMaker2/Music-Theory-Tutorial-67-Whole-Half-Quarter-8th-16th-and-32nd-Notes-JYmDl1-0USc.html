you more notes so now we're actually
getting into not the pitch part of music
theory but the time and the way notes
are written and such which is actually
fun I like this part so it's going to be
a lot of fun so far we know we can
represent notes like that which is
called a whole note it takes up one
measure in four-four time all this is a
four-four time just saying but that's
that's what now we can actually have
what's called half notes which look like
this these will take up half a measure
given two beats this will be given four
beats one two three two two three these
will be given half of a measure or two
beats one two three four 1234 1234 122
so forth now we've also seen coordinates
which look like this or well we can
actually fit four of them in a measure
so I'm actually going to draw for one
and you may see him like this with the
stem down sweet so we can actually break
up quarter notes if I broke to score a
note up into it become what we call
eighth notes which have a flag on them
just like that so this one could be
broken up into two and we can also when
the stem goes up on these it looks a
little bit different it goes like this
it looks almost like that which is I
can't really draw it that well but it's
like a stem and then like a little loop
thing yeah just just look it up actually
all of it for you here are our different
types of notes here is what the stems
look like when they are going downwards
that's probably why I'm such an idiot
what am i doing
right alright so this guy when the stem
is going down it looks a little
different like this and then this kind
of scoops up like that it's kind of
awkward to draw but that's what it looks
like here's a professional image you can
see right here there upwards here there
whoops here they are downwards now
eighth notes can be broken up into what
they call sixteenth notes which 16 of
those fit into measure which have two
flags or four like this they have to
loop things like that so 16 of those now
guess what 16th notes can be broken up
into what they call 32nd notes which
look like this they're the monsters
three of them or like this with the ball
at the top one two three here are 16
notes you won't see 32nd notes very
often but they do happen I've seen them
at playdom so need to be familiarized
yourself with all of these basically
each one of these will be broken down
into the next step this breaks into two
of these one of these breaks into
tivities one of these breaks into these
when these breaks into two of these one
of these bricks into to these that's
basically with music we don't have to
count big numbers we have to count
fractions which can stink but it's it's
not that bad for example I can have a
quarter note which takes up one fourth
and then I can have that that's not
according I'm sorry that's coordinate
which both take up one eighth well if we
have both these together it actually
equals two eighths which is the
equivalent of one fourth one fourth plus
one fourth equals two fourths
so we are taking up two fourths of a
measure currently with these notes so
that's just very basics and we'll be
getting in more to that so be sure to
subscribe and I will see you in the next
