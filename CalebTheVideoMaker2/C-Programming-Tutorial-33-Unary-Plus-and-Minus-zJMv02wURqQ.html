going to be talking about the unary plus
and the unary minus operator now before
you close out of this video hold up okay
these are different than the binary
arithmetic operators we talked about in
the previous video yes there was a plus
and minus and those operators but these
ones are not the same thing so to
illustrate this we are going to create a
new file
alright so to illustrate my point for
this video we are going to need two
variables to start with and then we are
going to do some calculations with those
variables the datatype for these are
going to be integers the first one is
going to be int money and we'll set that
equal to 25 the next will be a bill and
we'll set that equal to 15 so I Bill is
just an expense so after we pay the bill
we should have ten dollars left you
could just as well use double for your
data types well I'm going to be using
int in this case because I think working
with inches a little bit simply what we
want to do though is calculate the total
after we pay our bill so we are going to
make that int total and we're going to
set that equal to money - bill so this
is essentially 25 - 15 and that's going
to equal 10 but what if we change this a
little bit you know I like to mess with
stuff you know I like to mess things up
and you know what when I get bills I go
to the bill company and I'm like yo
you're going to pay me this money right
so if I got a bill for 70 bucks I
basically just got paid 70 bucks so if
you have no idea what I'm talking about
just follow along right I ain't paying
no bill so I am going to make this a
negative bill now what we have is no
longer 25 -15 we have 25 minus negative
15 which if you're any good at math you
should know that that is the same thing
as 25 plus 15 I know this is a pretty
dumb example but I can only think of so
many examples so you just have to deal
with it so let's print this just to make
sure that everything is working as
expected
and the output is 40 just like I like it
ain't no I'm going to give me no bills
let's go back in our code because I
actually I need to repent I apologize
this is not really how I go in and pay
my bills in fact I think it's an
honorable act to pay your bills because
you are the one who has acquired the
bill but for illustration sake let's
just go with this one thing I need to
make crystal clear to you though is that
when you do this you are not changing
the bill the bill itself stays the same
so what I mean is that if we go in here
and we add another printf statement you
could put them together but sometimes
it's clear just have to and what we want
to print now is the bill let's print it
you can see that the value is still 15
not negative 15 what this shows us is
that operators do not always change the
value of the variable sometimes they do
but not in this case arithmetic
operators don't change the value either
for example if I did something like X
plus y after this addition is done x and
y still have the same exact value as we
get into some more advanced operators
there are some that do change the value
of the variables and once we get to
those that'll make a little bit more
sense all you need to know now is that
these operators are changing the
expression so if we go back in our code
we are changing this expression right
here the value of the variables kind of
just get plugged in like I said the
value of money is 25 we're subtracting
negative bill bill itself is 15 so yeah
guys that is how you use the unary minus
operator but what about the unary plus
operator well it's kind of useless to
begin with I'm not really going to talk
about it it's kind of like an math if
you did something like 25 plus positive
15 the positive there is redundant it's
just assumed
it works the same way in C there are
some uses for the unary plus operator
but they are beyond the scope of the
series if you want to learn more about
them I would encourage you to look them
up specifically the unary plus operator
that will help you expand your knowledge
and understanding of C programming so
that's all I got for you in this video
thanks for watching and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
