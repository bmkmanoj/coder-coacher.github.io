Adobe Audition tutorial my name is Caleb
and in this video I will be speaking of
a bunch of cool stuff and we will be
getting into recording but first I want
to talk about the file system with this
I saw him in my part my hard drive and
then I'm in my users folder Caleb that's
my name and then I have all my folders
you see so I'm gonna open the music
folder and reveal an explorer so open
this and I'm going to create a folder
here so new folder I'm gonna name it
audition now we want to create a file
new audio file or ctrl shift and as you
can see so ctrl shift and then we can
click we're mono and stereo and 5.1 I'll
explain these in a bit so for now let's
just click OK
and I want to show you when we record we
can see my voice waves or whatever you
wanna call them appear up on the screen
so we can stop it and then what I can do
is click playback we can see my voice
see there's two of me now that's pretty
cool now the way microphones work is um
mine has two inputs a left input and a
right input so if I have headphones in
one side we'll hear this this up here
and the other side will hear what's this
down here so there's a left output and a
right output so if I just want to hear
the left side or the right side I can
turn the left one off and click play we
can see now it's just playing the right
side so if I put it back to you can turn
them back on now this is called stereo
there is also five point one which is
five speakers and a subwoofer which is
basically surround sound now the other
option is Llano so if I create a new
file and select mono it's going to just
have one and it's going to combine the
left and right so Oh
if you click record you can see that it
only has one output so when I play it if
you click record is going to it's going
to play the left inside the same the
left and right side that is now normally
vocals are recorded in mono because when
you're
let's say for a song or something you
don't want more vocals on one side than
the other but for some instances you may
want that so what you can do is when you
create it just select mono and that's
that's what you will want to record
vocals in and for other stuff you may
want to use stereo for example I can
record in stereo and then I can export
the single individual mono tracks for
each side so if I select stereo and
click OK and then I record a lot of love
that was my song I just created this is
untitled five if I right click it and
extract channels to Mono files it's
going to create a left channel and the
right channel which are basically just
the sides as you can see my right
channels a little bit more stronger than
my left channel this is why mono is not
always great because my right side will
have louder vocals so if you you can
export just one side of it like that
what I can also do is open the original
file with both sides right click and
click convert sample type or Shift key
then from here I can the channels I can
convert this to mono and this will
convert it into one mono sound so if I
play it record it's going Oh
piece of crap it's going to play equally
on the left and right side of a speaker
set if you have two speakers or if you
are wearing ear plugs which is what I am
doing currently so at the beginning of
this there was like a little me talking
chord record I don't want that in there
so I'm gonna right click and click cut
and now get rid of that actually I'm
gonna get rid of more of this so now
when I play it by pressing this button
or space this is what I have and now
what I want to do is I want to save this
so I can click file save or ctrl s safe
now what am I going to name this
now the dog will wave or wave with its a
wave format I like to pronounce a wave
because it sounds funny this is the
encoding so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to select wave format because that
is a good format and the location I'm
going to change that to my musical music
and then I had audition so here's where
I'm going to save this and then save
here and click OK so now if we open that
folder over here in the media browser
and if you can't find it you can just
open the window and select it from here
Media Browser click it we can see this
is here so we have saved this audio file
right here and if we if we click it you
can see down here is an autoplay button
so I can turn this off or turn it on so
if I click it it'll automatically play
but if I select this and click play that
then I have if I double click it it's
not going to do anything unless I click
play so that's some basics of recording
and in the next video I'll actually be
teaching you a little bit more about
this and also some some other cool stuff
so catch you there and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
