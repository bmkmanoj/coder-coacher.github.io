starting to talk about joins and I know
I've already talked about this a little
bit but I'm going to give you a bit of a
review and hopefully teach you a little
bit more so basically a join is when you
need to create like an imaginary table
basically like uh let's say you have two
tables one over here one over here you
need some info from this and need some
info from this info from this and you
combine them together into one table so
I know that's a little confusing but
it's not that bad so there's two types
of joins one is called an inner join and
one's called an outer join and you don't
really need to worry about that yet but
I'm going to try and explain them a bit
let me draw a few things and it'll make
things a lot more clear so the way you
would design a database is you need to
normalize it and when you normalize it
you're creating extra tables to store
your information in an organized manner
without redundant or useless information
or basically a bunch of repeats of the
same stuff and then you get false stuff
basically you need to organize it and
the reason for this is to save up space
for one because you have less
information to store and it's also
easier to understand what's going on and
how things are organized when there's
not five thousand rows of the same
information when you design a database
you create these extra tables so you may
rather than having all of let's say have
a shop rather than having all the
customers and all the orders combined
into one table you'll separate that out
into two tables so it's organized and
there these are all this is a relational
database system so these all connect in
a certain way through foreign keys and
primary keys so here we have this table
this is going to be customers so people
who are customers of your store and then
every single time somebody buys
something you create an order in an
order so like order number 732 was by
Caleb the customer Caleb curry and he
bought a new bike so that would be an
example of an order so customers orders
customers orders orders no customers
orders I confuse you know I'm just
getting customers orders so now now we
have that figured out there's a foreign
key of a customer so who bought this
stuff the customer ID is a foreign key
over to this table this does not have a
foreign key to this table so basically
this will have a customer ID but this
will not have an order ID because
customer caleb is not really related to
the stuff i bought i know you may think
thats related but what's what's up
buying a pair of shoes have to do with
my address my phone number it doesn't
really have anything to do with any of
it so on this this over here you can say
the person who bought new shoes in a new
bike was Caleb curry that's why I points
this way but it does not point this way
so that's how you explain that now when
you need to retrieve data it can be a
little confusing how things are working
out cuz up let's say you someone comes
into your store and they're like I want
a history of everything I've ever bought
in this store right now the way this is
connected you do not store the name of
the people who bought it you store the
ID so you have an ID an ID and these are
the same number so let's say 7 because I
always use that example number and I
need to drink give me SEC the person
comes in and they're like I need a
history of everything I've ever bought
well how do you tell which person they
are or who they are and say what's your
customer ID and they're like what so
that's not going to work you say what's
your name and they're like oh my name is
Caleb curry then you go to your
customers table and you say select all
the customers where their name is Caleb
curry and you'll get maybe two alright
because let's just say there's two
people with named Caleb curry so I have
this one and then we have this one so
then what do you do now you say oh
what's your phone number and phone
numbers I'm not going to tell you but
anyways and then okay well it's not this
one so
this guy right here might be it must be
you okay look curry yeah you get two
points so that's that's Caleb curry and
then when you find that it'll tell you
the ID so Caleb curry has an ID of let's
say 38 now after you figure that out you
go to your spa orders and you say give
me all of the orders where the customer
ID which is a foreign key back to here
so that ie points back to here this way
give me all of them that have an order
ID of 38 so we have au order number 703
was bought by customer 38 the ID of 38
and he bought a new house for his dog
right so that is how that works now this
is a little complicated you can see
there's a whole bunch of steps and once
you're confusing this well what you can
do is you can actually simple simplify
all this down into one query using a
joint so what does this mean basically
what you're doing is you're saying give
me all the orders where the customer ID
they're going to has the name of Caleb
so customer ID of 38 points back to this
table then um rather than saying the
customer idea of 38 you can say the
person with the name Caleb so we can say
customer Caleb so all that's really
happening is you're taking the order and
rather than using like the ID 38 we're
going back to this table and figuring
out who it is it's Caleb and we're going
to take that and store it in the search
of the query to make things look more
pleasant when you retrieve the
information so basically now let me
erase all this
we have a table and then another table
we're going to have their order ID
customer ID and then what they both
simple originally we're going to have
order ID 382 was bought by customer ID
38 and he bought a house but now as you
can see this is all from this table
because it stores all this what we can
do is replace this with customer name
and get it from this table over here and
retrieve as Caleb so basically this is
doing everything you wanted it to do
all in one step by using a join which I
haven't actually taught you how to do a
join yet but that's what I'm going to be
teaching you in the upcoming videos so
hopefully that cleared things up I know
I probably just like totally confused
you but don't worry it'll make more
sense and watch my next video and we'll
clear everything up thank you see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
