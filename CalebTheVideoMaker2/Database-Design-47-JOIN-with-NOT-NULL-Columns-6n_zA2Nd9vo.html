continue on the join discussion we've
been doing in these last couple videos
so be sure to check those out well I've
been talking a little bit about not no
columns basically columns that aren't
allowed to have no value and that can
cause some confusion when it comes to
joins because you might get results you
don't expect and I'm just going to be
explaining that just a tiny bit more
this video will be quick so if you're
onner you understand it a gorilla and
skip it if that's what you wish all
right so I'm gonna be going over an
example of a user comment system so
basically you're gonna have a table with
the users and then you're gonna have
something such as a comment table and
you might have a table such as video or
blog or whatever you're commenting on
but that's out of the illustration for
now don't worry about that well in this
example we have some columns that are
labeled not null and what this means is
that you're not allowed to have them to
where there's no value in that row for
that column so for example if in comment
we had comment ID and then we had user
ID and we gave it a column
characteristic of not null well what is
that going to do that's going to
basically say that every single row
within this common table has to have a
user ID associated with that comment and
that would be the person who posted in
that comment now the user on the other
hand doesn't have to post a comment
it's a one-to-many relationship and the
user does not have to post a comment but
a comment has to be owned by a user
that's important oh so there's three
real possible options of joins that we
can do on this table the first is an
inner join I'm gonna put these in caps
cuz it's probably better to do that now
the inner join does not matter which one
is left or right because it's going to
take the middle of both of them so the
positioning of your tables within your
query of the Select statement does not
really matter all that matters is that
you're using the inner join what does
the inner join going to give you and the
inner join will give
you all of the users who have comments
that's because if a user doesn't have a
comment it's not going to be his ID
won't be in the comment table and he'll
be left out if there's a comment that
doesn't have a user well then it would
be left out too but that's not the case
cuz it's not little all right the other
option is a left outer join and I'm
gonna go into place places in a second
left outer join and then we could put
the comment on the left so if you need
help position if you need help thinking
about that in your head
switch these two tables around but I'm
not gonna do that because that's part of
the illustration already we're good
alright
the other option well actually let's
talk about what that's gonna do first
left outer join is going to give you all
of the comments and then give you the
Associated users who have posted those
comments so every single comment will be
included so the return result will be
all comments and associated users okay
now think about this though these things
are actually going to give you the same
exact thing that's because if you do an
inner join it's going to give you all
the users who have comments okay so it's
going to take you all of the users who
have a comment and put it in there and
then it's going to take all the comments
that have a user and put it in there you
hear that all the comments that have a
user all the comments that have a user
so these are going to give you the same
result so just understand that the third
option is to flip the left join the
tables that is so got a left outer join
with the user table and left okay now
what is this gonna do it's gonna give
you all of the users and the associated
comments from those users now let's talk
about so we're gonna have it it's either
uh it either includes them all or
exclude some of them so basically if it
includes all of the users I'm gonna
label it with a star if it only includes
some users I'm going to label it with an
X same for the comments all the comments
is going to be a star some of the
comments is gonna be next
so users who have comments well only
some users are going to post comments so
that's gonna be X on the user end but
all of the users who have comments
that's going to include all of the
comments because all of the comments are
labeled is not null so every user posts
a comment has a row within the comment
table so it's gonna return them all so
it's gonna return them all on the user
end that's a star now left outer join
with the comments on left returns all
comments and associated users all
comments so all on the comments side
it's gonna return them all but the users
not all of them just part of them now
left outer join is going to return all
users and associated comments so the
first one is some users all comments the
second one is some users all comments
the third one is all users and all
comments this that's what you kind of
need to do when you're trying to plan
out which join you need to use go
through all the possibilities with that
join in this right amount so you see
that these two are actually the same
this one is just a tiny bit different
and that includes all of the users so
you may be wondering well which of these
two should you use well to be honest it
doesn't really matter if if you wanted
to return all of the comments don't
worry about whether it's not null or not
just use a left outer join with the
comments on the left and then you're
guaranteed to have that you don't have
to worry about whether it's not all or
not so that's what I would do if
you only want the users and the comments
included and you don't want to include
any comments that don't have a user
which is never gonna happen then you do
a inner join so what you do is you just
think and pretend all the comment all
the columns are knowable or they don't
have to have a value and then you plan
your joins around that and it can still
work the same way if that's what you'd
like to do otherwise you can just plan
out like this and realize you can use
either one of these and it's gonna work
out fine for what you want to do so yeah
okay I guess this video was a little
longer than I thought and it was a kind
of complex and confusing so I apologize
if it was a little too pointless sir
this was counterproductive but in the
next video we will be discussing
something new so thank you guys for
watching please be sure to subscribe and
I'll catch you in the next video
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
