video maker - and this is your
introduction to MongoDB now MongoDB is a
non structured database and essentially
what that means is the data is not
constricted to the shape of a table and
I'm going to go over all of that and
this video is it's going to be an
introduction on what structured versus
non structured means and also how to use
MongoDB so we'll actually have some
stuff on the computer MongoDB is
becoming extremely popular because of
its speed ease of use and scalability I
also wanted to share with you some tools
that can make your MongoDB experience a
lot easier that tool that I want to
share with you is called cluster control
and it is a database management system
that allows you to easily scale setup
and work with MongoDB that software
system is made by a company several
nines which has decided to sponsor this
video which is sweet so if you guys want
to support my channel go look at their
stuff cluster control and several nines
and give it a try with MongoDB so here
on Caleb the video maker - I have done
hundreds of videos on databases but
nearly almost every single one has been
on structured databases another name for
them is relational database and when we
are talking to a relational database we
use what's known as SQL for structured
query language notice the s4 structures
but when we're talking about a non
structured database these are often
classified as no SQL meaning not only
SQL if you've had any experience with
databases you may have heard of MySQL VB
to Oracle sequel server those are all
fundamentally different when it comes to
the way you structure your data now some
of those databases do support non
structured data but MongoDB is designed
for non structured data but if we had to
summarize it you can think of relational
databases as structuring data in tables
so a table just has a series of columns
which define the structure of our data
so if we have a table we might have
three columns for example we could have
a user table and we can have a first
name a last name and a
email and every single row or entry into
this table has to follow this structure
so we could have one in here like this
and that's great and all but this can be
an issue if for some reason we want to
add an extra column but only for certain
rows when we're talking about a value
for a certain column we often call that
a field so if we want to add a field to
this row for example a birthday you can
see that it doesn't quite fit this table
structure and it would only really make
sense if we added a column and now the
row follows the table structure
structured databases aren't necessarily
bad they're a great thing in fact non
structured data you should consider it
as an addition to your structured data
consider it to be augmenting your
development experience but the problem
is structuring data can sometimes be
hard if we don't have a continual
structure of what the data looks like
and even if the data is always the same
structure database design can be very
challenging so I have a series here on
YouTube database design and the sole
purpose of this series is to teach you
guys how to structure tables and connect
tables inside of a relational database
well a lot of this concept goes away
when we're talking about non structured
data now not all database design is
going out the window there's still stuff
you have to consider and you can still
have relationships between data but
things become a lot easier when you no
longer have to worry about whether your
data is going to fit perfectly inside of
a table instead we have these things
called collections so a collection
correlates to what a structured table is
but it's a little different so we can
put what we call documents in this
collection so a document is just one
entry inside what would be a table but
it's actually a collection so for
example we could take this whole thing
and throw that in a document
and put that inside of a user's
collections that works perfectly but we
can actually make another document with
different data or slightly different
structured data and we can also put that
inside of that collection it's not
restricted just to documents that fit
that specific format when we are working
with these documents the way we
represent data is a little bit different
actually it's completely different but
once you get used to it it's not that
bad I'm going to clear some of this off
so I can write down how to represent
data but in a document rather than in a
table this is the same exact table that
was down here I just screwed it up and
now I have a little bit more room and
everything's just a little bit cleaner
we can see that we have one row if we
wanted to add another row we could just
right below it there is our second row
and you can see it follows the exact
same structure as the first row now if
we weren't working with a structured
database and we are working with a non
structured database such as MongoDB and
we didn't have this table structure how
do we go about representing this data
well that is where the document comes in
as I mentioned earlier so the document
is the same thing as the row but a
little bit different because it doesn't
have to follow the same structure as the
table columns and inside of this
document you're going to have key value
pairs where the key is the field or
attribute and the value is whatever that
value is so for example the key for here
is first-name the value is Caleb so what
we would do is type out first name colon
and then inside a close Caleb so what
we're going to do is just have a field
and a value for every single column if
you want to call it that until we run
out of data for this specific instance
of the user so if this is a user table
this might be inside of a user
collection now all of these fields are
going to go inside of these little curly
braces and once we have all that we have
one document and that can go inside of
the collection these documents are
dynamic though because they don't follow
a structure that means I can add any
field here that I want and give it a
value we could add this one to the
collection too and that's not going to
break anything because the collection
doesn't have a strict formula of what
the data has to look like what we have
so far here is just a very simple
document they can actually get pretty
complex don't worry about all of the
complexity right now because the
important thing is to understand what
non structured data looks like how to
put that in a database and how to get
that data back out so that is the goal
of this video I'm going to take
something that looks similar to this put
it inside of a collection and then get
that data back out by selecting it or
querying that collection and trying to
get this document now that you got the
introduction to non structured data I
want to teach you how to install MongoDB
and start working with a database so by
the end of this video hopefully you've
got the very basics of how to work with
MongoDB the very first thing I want to
show you guys is how to download MongoDB
super simple just go to the Google's
search MongoDB and find the link for the
most recent version then click try it
now
then click community server scroll down
and download once you've got that
downloaded you can extract that wherever
you want and you'll get a folder that
looks like this the folder that
interests me most is this bin folder and
there's two specific files Mongo D and
Mongo now Mongo D is the actual server
and then Mongo is how we talk to that
server and we'll see how to use both of
those in just a moment but first I want
you to go to the root directory now you
can do that by clicking this go up here
and going to folder and then just typing
a forward slash now inside of here we
need to create a folder
the reason I'm making you do all this is
because the database actually has a
prerequisite folder that needs to be
created so in here right-click and click
new folder and then we'll just name that
data go in that folder and actually
create another folder inside and we will
name this DB all right so we got the
folders we need we can now go back to
the original files now we are ready to
start working with these files so
right-click Mongo D and click open and
you can see that it says waiting for
connection yada yada yada
that means it's running the next thing
we need to do is open Mongo alright this
is actually what we're going to be using
so I'm going to make this a lot bigger
alright so we got everything we need set
up for the rest of this video so we are
ready to start working with MongoDB so
to begin let's clear the screen using
CLS that way we just have a clean
working area now the way Mongo works is
pretty interesting if you try to work
with something that doesn't yet exist
Mongo will actually create it for you to
give you an example if we try to work
with a database that doesn't exist it
will just create it let's try it we can
say something like use and then you know
give it a good quality database name and
it says switch to DB subscribed but I
mean who knows this subscribe even
exists it just makes it for us it works
the same way with collections which if
you remember collections are what store
all of our documents or our what would
be the equivalent of rows and the
collection would be the table so we can
just start working with a collection as
if it exists and Mongo will create it
for us that means we can just skip
creating a collection and start talking
about inserting data into that
collection it's kind of weird because I
feel like I'm skipping like you know big
substantial parts but it works so let's
insert some data into our imaginary
collection right now the way you do that
is by typing DB dot and then you put the
collection name so we can name it
whatever we want let's say users for
example
and then we can use a function and there
are a couple different functions but the
one I'm going to use is called insert
one and then you put parentheses now
inside of these parentheses is where you
put your data now just so you guys know
it's basically impossible to type inside
of a terminal so I'm actually going to
delete this and type it in a text editor
and then copy it and paste it over so
I'm just going to use my high quality
IDE here so let's do that again
DB users dot insert one and now let's
put some data in here the very first
thing you always want to start with are
the curly braces your document gets
encapsulated inside of curly braces now
we can start naming the fields so name
and then we'll give it a value and let's
give it another field and we can extend
this as much as we want and in fact you
can even do more complex things for
example you can put arrays in here so to
make an array you use square brackets
and then all of your data is in here
like this so you can see Aimee is
actually an editor and a manager now
this is interesting because this is
valid inside a MongoDB but if we were
working with structured data this would
be kind of interesting I'm not sure if
it would work some databases have some
types of data types that allow you to
give multiple values such as a set but
not all databases support sets and
sometimes it's frowned upon and you
should actually take this data extract
it into its own table and make a
relationship so you can see that the
complexity of relational databases is
much more when you're working with non
structured relational databases or no
sequel databases you can just kind of
nest things inside of your document so
let's take all this and go over to the
terminal and paste alright now it
returns something to us and it says it
has an object ID so this is the
equivalent of what would be a primary
key but we didn't have to set that up it
did that all for us and that is how you
uniquely identify this document so let's
talk about querying our data so querying
our data is asking the database to give
us our data back to us in a relational
system you would use a select state
but it's a little bit different with
MongoDB so I'm going to go back over to
the notes and type out how to do that
first you say DB and then you say the
collection name just like the previous
command and then you use the function
find this here is the equivalent of
select star from users inside of a
relational system essentially it's going
to return all of the documents inside of
the users collection so we'll copy this
come over here and paste it and there
you go and you can see it actually
includes the ID with this and it added
that for us but now you know that it's
actually there inside of the document
now if we had more data inside of our
collection it would return all of that
data so for example if I put another
insert statement and this time just to
show you guys something cool that you
can actually add your own fields which
is really cool thing about non
structured data then we'll get that data
back out and see that it's different so
let's go in here and add an email okay
so we gave that field to this person and
also you know I'm just going to change
this up just a little bit so you can
kind of see the difference yeah give her
a different name and you know change
your age all right let's insert this all
right now let's query our data and you
can see a returned both of them and one
of them has an email what the other one
does not now you can actually do more
complex things like you know you might
not just want to select everything
especially if you have millions of
documents so we can actually specify
some rules of what kind of data we want
to return so let's go back over to our
notes if we were doing this in a
relational system it would be known as a
where clause so you'd say like hey give
me everything where the email is Amy I'd
email comm with non structured data it
works a little different but same
concept so it's going to look like this
DB users don't find inside of these
parentheses is where we can be more
specific of the data we want to return
so for example we could say hey we want
the person's name to be Amy and anybody
who does not have the name
me we don't care about right now so
let's copy that go over here and paste
it and you can see it just returned the
person with the name Amy you can
definitely do more complex things if you
really want to for example you could say
oh I want to get anybody with the age
less than 50 for example but I'm not
going to get into all those details
because I just wanted to give you guys a
rough introduction and lastly before I
go I wanted to briefly show you the
cluster control tool that I was talking
about that's available on several 9s
comm this tool kind of breaks up
databases into four steps deploy manage
monitor and scale and the tool is
designed to help you do all four of
these things seamlessly but the cool
part is is that you can actually
integrate with other databases including
MySQL and Postgres give cluster control
a try and let me know how you guys like
it that's all I got for the introduction
and now back to the real world so I can
give you the conclusion to close this
video I wanted to remind you guys that
non structured data is not meant to be a
replacement for structured data at least
not yet
but it is important to know that the way
the world works with data is changing so
if you're not getting on board with this
non structured data and at least
understanding it within a couple years
you could be severely behind I think
it's really important to understand non
structured data because the flexibility
of it is great if your business needs or
the way your data looks in the future
changes you don't have to go back and
change all of your infrastructure which
can be extremely time-consuming and
expensive so if you're into programming
I would highly recommend given MongoDB a
try try writing an app to connect to a
MongoDB then try writing an app to
connect to a MongoDB database and if
you're more on the business side where
you're trying to run a technology
company at least know the basics of
MongoDB so if the situation comes up
where you think hmm nah unstructured
data would be useful you actually you
understand what that means and you can
apply that then so thank you guys for
watching I know I didn't get in a whole
lot but hopefully now you're a little
bit more prepared for the world of non
structured data if you would like to see
more and learn more
I think a video series would be more fit
for that so if you would like that
please leave a comment below and I'll
see what we can do so thanks guys please
be sure to subscribe and I'll see you in
