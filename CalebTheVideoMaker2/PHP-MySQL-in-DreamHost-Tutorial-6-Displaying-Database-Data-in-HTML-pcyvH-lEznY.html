up PHP and MySQL and dreamhost tutorial
series I'm Caleb from cable videomaker -
and I just I just think we should just
dive right in so from the last video we
officially connected to the database
without any errors but we still have
nothing on the page to show for it
what's the point in doing all that work
if you have nothing to show for it so
what we want to do is we want to take
the database content and display it on
the page and that can be useful for so
many things a lot of web pages are used
for what's known as crud create read
update and delete so essentially we are
doing one of those four things in this
video series we are going to read that
data from the database and if you don't
really understand all of that that's
okay you don't need to have a full
understanding to follow this little
video essentially we're just taking the
database and echoing it on the screen
very simple so let's go to our code and
the very first thing we need to do is
put a semicolon to end that statement
that will allow us to add more to our
script now we need to reference this
connection but how do we go about doing
that because up here we are just
connecting and then putting a semicolon
and that's it well the way we do this is
we assign this whole thing to a variable
and you declare variables in PHP with a
dollar sign and then the name so we're
just going to call this - oops
MySQL I and we are going to set that
equal to or assign this this value so
basically whatever this evaluates to we
are assigning it to this variable so
essentially whenever we need to talk to
the database we can reference this
variable so now we can execute a query
on our database by referencing this
variable MySQL I then we need to access
a function inside of this variable and
if you don't know functions and all that
good stuff it doesn't really matter
essentially we need to make this little
arrow thing and we need to say query and
this is a function that's going to take
some more pram
the parameters that at once is the query
itself so as if we were writing in PHP
myadmin
SQL window you just put the same query
that you want to put right here so in
the previous videos I did select
everything from tutorials I'm going to
use that same command here when you try
writing this out you might do something
like this but you will find that this is
going to cause you errors because the
query itself actually has to be in
quotes so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to surround this with double
quotes then end up with a semicolon and
then what we need to do is we need to
take the result of this whole thing and
assign it to a new variable so if we go
up a line we can create a variable call
it result and set it equal to this whole
statement so now the result of this
query is going to be stored in this
variable called result now to display
stuff on the screen we use the echo
command but if you try this you'll find
that it's not going to work the way we
want I'll show you here let's save it
and then I will go to FileZilla upload
refresh oh man could not be converted to
string so rather than going through a
process to convert this to a string
we're just going to do something even
cooler so let's let's just get rid of
this line for now we're going to use
what's known as a for each loop within
here we are going to give the loop
something we can iterate over that means
we can go through one step at a time so
we can actually pass the result into
this for each loop and then we say as
and then we name every single item in
that result set so if you know if you
guys don't have programming experience
this might be a little bit much but just
follow along it'll make sense as we go
along so we want to reference every
single item in this result set well this
result set is going to return I think
four rows so the thing is we want a name
or
the Rose so we can name it ro so
essentially we are going to iterate
through this table and we can reference
the row using this name so let's try it
now let's echo out this row and see what
happens
save yes
refresh okay you can see we get the
result arrey arrey arrey arrey you're
probably wondering why well the reason
is because we're taking the rose and
trying to echo them all out at once
so PHP sees that as an array and it just
echoes array so what we need to do is we
actually need to iterate over every
single column inside of that array so we
need to nest another for each loop
inside of this for each loop so now what
are we iterating over we're iterating
over each row and what is it we want to
access within the row we want to access
the column or if you want to name it a
little more specifically you could say
the field because that is an individual
value for a column and then within here
we could echo the field let's save it
yes refresh okay we got something we got
array one joining dreamhost
array two creating our database array
three filezilla
array for PHP myadmin so obviously this
is not exactly what we were looking for
so we need to fix this up a little bit
the first thing I don't think we need
this echo statement here because all it
does is say array it's it's useless so
I'm gonna get rid of that at least now
all we'll have is the ID and then the
name of the article so we're getting
closer so the next thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to put a space after the
field so the way you do that is with a
dot and then
inside of quotes put a space now let's
upload it and see what it looks like
great we're getting closer the next
thing I want to do is on every single
line I only want one row so I want this
to be on a separate line so how do we do
that let's go back and it's actually
pretty easy after every single row we
want to make a new line so all we got to
do is say echo and we can actually put
HTML inside of here so we could say
break
crate that looks so much better so that
is essentially what we were going for
but there is still a couple of things
that you could do to improve this next
what we can do is put everything inside
of a paragraph we want to do that with
each row because we want each row to be
a paragraph not each field so what we do
is here echo quotes we're gonna open a
paragraph tag in that statement and then
down here we're going to echo the
closing tag we're no longer going to
need this break statement because
paragraphs by default break down to the
next line so it's kind of unneeded it
would just give extra space so I saved
it let's see what it does
great it's actually looking pretty darn
good that has the basics of displaying
data in a webpage and you can see if you
actually either inspect this and view
the source or just inspect it you can
see how this actually does create HTML
we have HTML head head body paragraphs
head body so that is it guys hopefully
that was a lot of help if you guys have
any questions at all leave a comment and
keep watching this playlist because if
there's anything simple I can do I will
make another video I'm probably gonna
cancel this hosting so I try to do it
within the next month once once that's
over I'm not gonna have access to this
website any longer so if you guys have
any suggestions or anything just leave a
comment and thank you guys please be
sure to subscribe and I will see you
guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
