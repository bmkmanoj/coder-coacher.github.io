be over the first normal form which is
the first step in database normalization
this normal form deals with data being
atomic or atomicity right so let's begin
let's first look at three examples where
there are problems and then I'm going to
explain a solution if we take a look at
this first example we have a user ID
first name last name email and address I
have some values in here but those
aren't really important in this example
the main thing you need to pay attention
to is the address because an address if
you think about it actually consists of
a street address state country and so
forth so this column is not atomic we're
asking for multiple things within one
column so that is the problem in this
example the solution for this one would
be to break it up into multiple columns
you know a state and so forth that way
we don't have a bunch of things within
one column as an individual value this
example you can see we have one row with
a user ID first name last name and email
but if you look closely we have two
emails these emails were entered
together as one individual value so you
can think of maybe on a website we'll
ask you for your email imagine putting
one email in and then putting your
second email in in the same box and
clicking submit
well it's entered into the database as a
single value maybe with the comma or
something but it still entered in as the
email for this user so two values within
one which is not atomic in this example
the actual value is given for the email
our atomic because there are only one
email but we put two entries within our
database so now we have this in here
twice this in here twice and this in
here twice and the primary keys should
never be in there twice the only time
you can see the primary key in there
twice is if it's a reference as a
foreign key because the foreign key can
be put in there multiple times but the
primary key of five should only be in
there one time
so we have all that duplicate data now
what if this cable curry goes and gets a
name change because that's such a dumb
name right now I'm just kidding because
that's that's my name and I actually
like that name but anyways if he gets a
name change and he updates his
information what if only this one's
updated so now we have conflicting data
and see that's the problem with data
integrity we need to make sure that
doesn't happen so in this example to
call them is the problem in this example
the values for the row is the problem
and in this example the values for the
row is the problem so these basically
have the same problem how do we figure
out the solution let's take over let's
take a look over here and as you can see
there is no solution so yeah guys thanks
for watching I'm just kidding let's
let's do this the best solution for this
problem is to have a user table and I'm
going to write the columns that are
within this user table so we would have
a user ID then we are going to have a
first name we're going to have a last
name if you wanted the address in there
you could have street address state
country up all that other good stuff
then we're also going to have an email
table so the solution is to break off
the problem column you can see in this
example the email is the thing causing
the problem the address that we had
earlier that's fixable if it's a problem
in the column we could just break that
up into multiple column so we would have
to make a new table for that but since
this one even though the column is
correct it's the values within it that's
causing the problem we would need to
create a new table for that so that's
why we have this email table and now
within here we're going to have an email
ID and then we're going to have a email
which is going to be at the actual email
address which in this case will be these
and then we're going to have a user ID
now this is going to be a foreign key
that references this user ID the primary
key of the user table now if we wanted
to put two individual emails we could
have rows within this email table let's
let's spread out the email table and see
what it might look like here's what the
email table might look like we would
have an email id which is just randomly
generated number for each email 608 is
fun and then the email that's going to
be the actual address of the email so we
could have this I'll try to make it just
as bad as handwriting perfect then the
user ID of who owns that which in this
case would have been 5 because 5 was the
ID that was used for this user this
would be your first row then we could
have another row and it'd be a new email
so they'd have a new email ID and be a
different email we would use this one
this time and I'm going to make that
beautiful handwriting you guys love
there we go and then the user ID for
that would also be 5 now this repeating
value is okay this this repeat right
here this is okay because this is a
foreign key and multiple emails are
allowed in this situation this email ID
this is not not okay to repeat because
each individual number should be a
separate email because this is the
primary key of the email table now when
we look back at the user table we don't
have any repeating data because we're
only going to have a user ID such as
five first-name Caleb and the last name
curry and there's no need to make a
repeating row because we have all the
information we need without having any
pro
so if we change the name we would just
update this keep the same ID change this
to whatever we name our name ourselves
or whatever the person names themselves
so there you go everybody
that's first normal form and I'll see
you in the next video where we will be
discussing second normal form piece up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
