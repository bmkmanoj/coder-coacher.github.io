going to give you some more reasons as
to why signal R is something you should
use and don't worry we'll be getting
more into the whole different
technologies like WebSockets and all
that stuff in the next video but for now
I want to give a clean foundation as to
why signal R is legit the very first
thing I got for this video
is that the back end is programmed in
dot nipt so c-sharp visual basic
probably f-sharp all those kinds of
things are dotnet and why dotnet well
that's because dotnet is one of the
coolest frameworks in the world right
with dotnet you get all kinds of extra
functionality that's easily built-in and
you don't always have to know the deep
memory allocation garbage you just it
just works right so we are going to be
building our back-end and c-sharp which
is an object-oriented programming
language that's built on the dotnet
framework the next reason I got for you
guys is that signal R has a bunch of
cool functionalities that we can add to
our web applications for example the
idea of groups so with signal are you
can make basically a broadcasting system
where we have some kind of data up in
the server and we want to broadcast that
to all of the clients but in addition to
that we can make groups so we could have
multiple different feeds I guess you
could say and certain people can
subscribe to whichever ones they want
you've probably seen this in any kind of
chat room kind of thing if you open a
chat room about c-sharp you only get the
feed of c-sharp you understand so that
would kind of be like hey this is a chat
room if you join it you're part of that
feed and you can be part of multiple
feeds or groups and it'll work fine so
that's one of the great reasons the last
reason I got for you guys is its
scalability scalability refers to the
applications ability to get bigger serve
more people more clients well signal are
works great even if there's a lot of
clients connected
in an open connection I mean if you
think about an open connection that's a
connection that has to be maintained by
the server so if you have a hundred
thousand people on your website well
that's a hundred thousand open
connections and that can that can be a
lot on the server but because signal R
has very good scalability it's easy to
implement multi server situations and
you could easily have a million users at
one time without a problem you just have
to have the hardware to back it up so
that's the final reason I got as to why
you should use signal org and if you
disagree with me the get out I don't
even care it's my video series man but
if if you don't you can try just
WebSockets yeah but I recommend signal
are okay bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
