wanted to talk about harmonizing the
minor scale and I'm only going to talk
about it for a few minutes I don't want
to over do this because I'm very close
to talking about chord progression a
little too much so I'm not going to talk
about this for a couple hours like I
usually do alright so basically the
minor scale takes the third the sixth
and the seventh and flats did note so if
we have a major scale c d e f g a b vexy
this would take the e
make an E flat it's lowering a half-step
taking the a lowering a half-step and
the B and lowering a half-step that's
because these are the 3rd 1 2 3
the 6th 1 2 3 4 5 6 and the 7th 7th so
from here to harmonize these we just
take thirds from the root using the
notes within the scale so c e g but it's
actually E flat because we are in the
minor scale C E flat and G now the notes
for a deist d chord is D F and a so we
have D F a flat notice anything odd
about this is a diminished chord so now
from E flat we have E G and B so you
have eg B flat F F a flat and C G B G B
flat and D now a we take a C and E flat
C basically we're just skipping every
other note within the scale see e g DF D
G B and so forth then for B we have B D
and F and then we have C E flat and G
so sometimes I didn't say the
accidentals but let's point these out
I'm going to organize these by the type
of cord they are so we have the minor
chords because we're in the minor scale
we start with a minor chord so this one
right here is a minor chord and this is
the first chord which always lines up
with the fourth and fifth which would be
these two so these two are going to be
minor chords and the other ones this is
a major chord and these are major chords
and also this is a minor chord too it's
just an octave higher than this one so
minor major the minor minor major major
minor we just had one more which is
diminished so what chords are these if
we label these we would have the C minor
this would be D diminished this would be
e flat major this would be F minor this
would be G minor this one would be a
flat major and then this one would be B
flat major finally we have C minor again
which goes back to there so that is
harmonizing the minor scale</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
