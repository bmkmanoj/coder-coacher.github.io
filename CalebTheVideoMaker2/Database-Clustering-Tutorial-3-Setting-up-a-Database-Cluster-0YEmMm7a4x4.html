database cluster rings this video we are
going
I have way too much energy for midnight
this video we are going to be talking
about how you actually go about setting
up a database cluster so I'm going to
give you all the prerequisite knowledge
except the stuff that's coming in the
next video which is going to be our last
on chalkboard video but this video is
going to be good so stick with it so
unfortunately setting up a database
cluster is not that easy I mean it's not
like the hardest thing in the world it
just takes some time and some brain
scratching and there's some tools out
there that are going to make your life a
whole lot easier one reason it takes so
long to setup is not everyone has bunch
of database servers just lying around to
set up in a cluster so we gotta work
around that we're actually going to be
using virtual machines and we're going
to be installing our nodes and we're
going to be connecting all those
machines into this giant cluster because
we're going to be using virtual machines
you guys don't got to go buy a bunch of
computers and it's going to be
completely free yeah you're welcome
let's first talk about our
infrastructure infrastructure machine in
this case for our database management
system consider this your control panel
the reason we are installing this
database management system on a computer
by itself is for this reason if we draw
out these two nodes and let's say this
is the control panel and for some reason
this database node has a problem and we
lose access to it well now not only did
we lose access to that node but also our
control panel which gives us access to
this node so it would be better if
instead you know we had another node
down here which was the control panel
for both of these and that way if this
node goes down well now we still have
access to this node and our control
panel so the software we are going to be
using is cluster control
and this is going to automate a lot of
the process for us so actually setting
up the cluster is pretty easy it's more
the infrastructure issue with having set
up virtual machines and all that stuff
that's a little bit more complicated but
the bright side is the learning
experience right so we're going to have
essentially in a database management
system or closer control on a computer
by itself and then we're going to have
two nodes generally you'll have an odd
number of nodes but for simplicity I
don't really feel like setting up three
well one doesn't really make sense we're
going to go to and these are actually
going to be Linux virtual machines and
part of Linux is SSH and this allows
computers to talk with one another we're
going to be setting up SSH on these
machines that way cluster control can
communicate with them so I will go
through how to set up all that with SSH
so you guys don't have anything to worry
about
I am sure you guys know my teaching
style I try to focus on the fundamentals
so the information you learn transfers
over to other technologies so I'm going
to try to make this series as general as
possible but that being said we do need
to decide on some different technologies
for example I decided all we're going to
use cluster control you might be able to
do it some other way
but that's what we decided that being
said my goal is to teach you the
principles behind database clustering so
you can pick up other software if you
need in the future
some other decisions we are going to
have to make is the type of database and
also the database clustering technology
of choice a couple more decisions that
Gulf song a couple more decisions we are
going to have to make is the database of
choice and also the database clustering
technology of choice which is not
cluster control cluster control is a
tool that applies that technology
automatically so we are going to be
using a master master topology called
Galera if you were hoping to use a
different technology don't feel like the
series is going to be a waste because
Galera is a very small piece in this my
goal is to teach you the information
needed to help you know database
clustering
Galera although Galera is a great tool
so that's all I really got for this
video hopefully that was helpful when
you guys understand how I'm going with
the series don't freak out if oh you're
not using Galera or oh we don't use that
cluster control at work that's not what
this series is about so please stick
with this series hope you guys enjoy it
as always please please please please
subscribe not that I'm begging or
anything but I'm trying to grow this
channel and I can't do it without your
guys's support so I thank you for all
the support you guys always give me and
please let me comment let me know what
you thought and I will see you in the
next video see you then
peace Oh almost forgot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
