the treble clef now I'm going to be
talking about what's called the bass
clef now the treble clef assigns okay
that'll work a G - right here
some middle C c4 or C with a tick
vibrating at 261 point something every
second is down here right that is called
what it's called a ledger line that's
led G they are you are out of them but
it doesn't matter ah so a bass clef is
going to do the same thing except it's
going to it's going to assign a middle C
up here so basically this reaches a
lower region on the keyboard any pitch
really let me show you on this magical
piece of paper electronic things I don't
even know so if we have up here we have
let's see it can you see it C for middle
C now down here if we put middle C here
the treble clef is going to be these
notes s unpleasant
bass cleff is going to reach these notes
because it's a lower pitch and not all
instruments play really high such as
piano you'll have the chords down here
typically and the the melody on a higher
pitched region it looks like this
now it points to the f it assigns F to
this line right here here's middle C
here's F so now we noticed if you may
have noticed it's not the same notes so
the dot points to the F if we move this
up or down it a bit move F and it'd be a
different clauses base clef
it's called base because base represents
the lower notes a bass drum be like yo
I'm saying so yeah I totally just got
distracted here
yeah this is base clef and assigns F to
right here so now we know we have the
treble clef v which looks like this and
we have the base clef which looks like
this now typically this one will be at
the bottom and this one we have the top
but it's okay so middle C for this one
is down here and then we'll see for this
one is up here so it represents a
different region of notes and pitches so
in the next video we're going to be
putting these together to create
something cool and I'll be talking and
teaching you some cool stuff so now all
you need to know trouble clef bass clef
ledger line is this thingy and clef is a
way to assign a pitch to a specific
liner space and then the two types we
learn were based in trouble which were
which are called
test tessa churros that they got a
little but I'll get into that right now
later uh see ya that's all you need to
know for now subscribe and read these
cool things the rhythm on board right
here if you can subscribe thank you
