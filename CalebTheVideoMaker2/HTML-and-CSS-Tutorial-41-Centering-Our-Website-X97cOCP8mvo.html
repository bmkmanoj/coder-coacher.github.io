videos that were padding and margin you
may think they're very similar they are
very similar but they're also very
different they both both push things
away a given amount of pixels or EMS or
whatever you want to use although they
both push in different directions so I'm
just going to use this as a notepad
padding pushes away inward margin pushes
away outward so padding is used by a box
something that contains something such
as a div or a paragraph a div content
can contain a lot of content or a
paragraph can contain text by padding it
we push that content inward and
occasionally the box is only so big so
by pushing that content inward it has to
make itself bigger for example if I
create padding on here I already have
padding setting here but I'm going to
override it
padding 50 pixels you can see that they
get bigger because the only way they can
push all that content in 50 pixels is to
extend 50 pixels but for a div you see
it's not always like that I can say
padding 50 pixels it'll change a little
bit but you can see we don't have to
increase the size of the did it still
stays the same we can increase that to
60 the only content will change is the
only content that will change is these
stuff within it and I saw it move down
here to do so it does change a bit but
if we did it something like 400 pixels
now it's completely screwed up so that's
what I mean by padding so I'm gonna get
rid of this and margin pushes outward so
I could say margin 30 pixels that means
this paragraph doesn't want anything 30
pixels with anything beside it for 30
pixels which it really isn't that much
for a paragraph because paragraphs
automatically by default have some
padding that's why we separate things by
paragraphs so they're not all
together so we can give it a margin of
70 which would be a lot more obvious and
you can see now they're very separated
and they're not close together well I
want to show you something cool you can
see our website goes to the corner let
me zoom out or if we had a big screen
and sometimes we don't want that so I
wanted to show you guys something cool
you can do with margin and that's the
center a web page sort of like I did
here I just so I'm going to show you how
to do that we can add a margin to our
div which contains all of our content
and we can use a shorthand so just like
we did before we have ten pics ten pics
and what that does is it puts a margin
ten pics on the top and ten pics on the
bottom and then this one over here puts
ten pixels on the left and the right so
we can actually change let's put this to
zero we can actually change this instead
of ten pixels we can put Auto and then
we can run it and we can see our website
is now centered in the middle of the
page which looks very nice well I think
it doesn't look super great but it's a
work in progress so I'm just kind of
using this to illustrate how it's done
so that's what we can do with that and I
don't really have much else to say in
this video just know that margin is used
to push things away the way this works
is this pushes this way the same amount
that this pushes this way so they're
both pushing in opposite directions and
when that happens it goes push to the
center so that is how them zero picks
auto works if we added pixels here it
would just push us away from the top as
well as from the bottom so that's pretty
much all in the next video we'll be
talking about something new so I hope to
see you then thank you and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
