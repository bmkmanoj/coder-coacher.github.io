Caleb the video maker - this video is
going to be talking about strongly typed
and loosely typed programming languages
and I'm going to say how C kind of ties
in with all this so C is what's known as
a strongly typed language what strongly
typed means it couldn't destroy well it
strongly typed means is that every piece
of data has a specific type you can
think of strongly as strict so C is
strict in the sense that when we declare
variables we have to say what type they
are and once we say what they are
they're always going to be that type the
variable is
we can take the value and we can cast
that value so for example you can do
something like this which will change
the v which is an integer to a double
but the actual variable X will always be
an integer to illustrate my point let's
imagine that the only data type we have
are strings so a string is a sequence of
characters such as hello and no longer
do we have data types like integers and
double and all that good stuff in this
situation we would have to represent a
number like this now what if we said hey
let's add 5 plus 5
should this be interpreted as Oh
obviously that's going to be 10 or
should it be interpreted as 5 5 the
combination of 2 strings like this right
here is known as concatenation for a fun
fact you can see kind of how ridiculous
this is like why would we always use
strings well I was showing that to
illustrate what it would be like if we
didn't have various data types a
strongly typed language prevents
confusion like this because of data
types now the opposite of a strongly
typed language is called a loosely typed
language now a loosely typed language
doesn't onyx boy what hey boy hey boy
now a loosely typed language doesn't go
so far as to only have one
kind of like everything is strings but
they're not quite as strict so rather
than having integers and floats and
doubles and signed and unsigned and
longs and all that stuff it'll just have
like number so the data types are much
more vague so to illustrate the
difference between a strongly typed
language and a loosely typed language
let's consider an example 1/3 and see
this is going to equal 0 that's because
these are both integers in a loosely
typed language that's probably not going
to happen
the result would probably be 0.33 3 and
so forth you can see that C is much more
strict in that you have to be very
specific and what you want to do with
your types this has the obvious downside
of weird results like this but there are
a lot of plus sides if you know what
you're doing there is less chance for
unexpected results this concept
altogether is kind of hard to grasp when
you're first starting so I have a
beautiful illustration that will show
this perfectly there is a popular
programming language known as JavaScript
JavaScript is one of the most popular
loosely typed languages the way
javascript considers types is very
interesting in fact it has its own names
that a lot of people call it it's called
duck typing and don't worry I'm not
going to give a tutorial series on
JavaScript right now but I'm doing this
to illustrate the difference between
loosely typed and strongly typed
languages this kind of stuff is
important to know so why in the world is
it called duck typing well the
philosophy goes it looks like a duck if
it talks like a duck it's a duck the
first benefit of this is that a lot of
different types can be treated the same
because you can treat everything like a
duck but there's a downside and that not
everything is going to qualify as a duck
in whatever sense that means whether it
be being a number or certain type of
number whack-whack whack-whack example a
here is a classic duck surely this is a
duck obviously here you can see this
and resembles a duck and looks like it
talks like a duck - so hmm must be a
duck and lastly this one obviously
that's a duck and clearly it's quacking
self must be a duck right I hope this
example goes to show what duck typing is
and see this problems not going to
happen if something is a duck we know
it's a duck in JavaScript we can even
have functions expecting a duck so it's
like yeah they're going to pass in a
duck and this language is so loose you
could pass in a potato and it's not
going to care so you have to do all
these extra steps to make sure you're
getting what you're expecting when it
comes to types you can't always be sure
the type is in the right form we could
have the form in a duck the Mona Lisa or
an alien well I mean a duck and a duck
right in C these would all probably be
different data types but it's not easy
to convert between the three because of
this we need typecasting typecasting is
used to convert between data types this
is how I feel a lot of people approach
finding a mate in life a girl will say
something like oh he looks like a nice
guy he says nice things to me therefore
he's a nice guy
until you figure out he's an alien come
to eat your life so when it comes to
finding your love do not be loosely
typed simple as that so yeah guys that's
all I got for this video hopefully the
illustration helped you clear this out
in your brain and the upcoming videos
we'll be talking a little bit more about
datatypes and typecasting and we'll be
getting into more depth with that so if
you like this video and the series
please click like subscribe and I will
see you in the next video thanks for
watching guys I really appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
