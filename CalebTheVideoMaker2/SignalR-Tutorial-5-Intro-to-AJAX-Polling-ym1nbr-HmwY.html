where we finally jump into the meat of
this course now in this video we're
going to be discussing what's known as
ajax ajax stands for asynchronous
JavaScript and XML and I ain't even
going to try to write that out so just
look it up if you need to know the
spelling what does that mean
well Ajax is a technique to make a
request to the server and the server is
going to respond but it's all
asynchronous meaning the purse the
client can still use the web application
while this request is happening in the
responses brought back but it's only one
way so that means you can only make a
request to the server and the server
gives a response it can't be the other
way around and that the server has new
information and sends that to the client
as needed that would be two-way
communication Ajax doesn't work that way
let's go over an example of how Ajax can
make your web experience super legit
alright so you're filling out this super
long form you're signing up for a
website or whatever you free stuff and
you have to fill out all this junk right
and you're filling it out and it's
giving you Corrections right and it's
like oh your username has to be five to
ten characters or whatever
what client-side validation does is it
will basically give you suggestions on
how to format all your data before you
can click Submit and it's usually done
in JavaScript well the thing is people
can disable their JavaScript just by
going to their web browser settings so
client-side validation is never enough
to make a form perfect you always need
server-side validation server-side
validation is when the data is actually
sent to the server and it's checked and
if it's okay it's put into a database or
the person gets access to the website or
whatever that's server-side now what
Ajax can do is can actually give you
server-side validation without
a page refresh and that is magical some
people aren't going to see why it's
magical but because HTTP is a stateless
protocol we're all used to havin to
click something waiting for the response
from the server and then continuing well
with Ajax is not working that way any
longer now once you leave a form element
such as an input box it can use an ajax
request to send the data so like let's
say we have this form here and here's
all the data it gets sent to the server
the server validates it and then sends
it back to the web application the web
application did not have to perform a
refresh it just looks like client-side
validation you as soon as you leave the
box behind the scenes there's an ajax
request to the server and it updates and
says you have to have whatever yeah you
know that is one of the magical uses of
ajax and this also allows you to do more
things for example if you want to check
if a username is already created you
can't do that with client-side
validation unless you send a list of
every single username that's ever been
created and you don't want to do that
with ajax the server-side validation
could check that and send that data back
and it would look just like client-side
validation that's the magic of ajax
hopefully you guys see the power that
ajax isn't just good for form validation
it can also be used to check for new
data for example in an email program the
website might use an ajax request every
two minutes to check if there's any new
emails that might be a little easier
than having an open persistent
connection but it might not be it just
depend now keep in mind ajax does not
create persistent connections the
connection does not stay open we're not
creating the tunnel between the client
and the server we're just simulating
that it looks like there's an open
connection but there really isn't this
is a way to simulate a persistent or an
open connection
on top of that it's only one way if the
client doesn't request anything there's
not going to be any updates the server
cannot do a push it can't push data to
the client that's all I got for you guys
now so I'll see you in the next video
and we'll be discussing I forget but
it's gonna be cool see it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
