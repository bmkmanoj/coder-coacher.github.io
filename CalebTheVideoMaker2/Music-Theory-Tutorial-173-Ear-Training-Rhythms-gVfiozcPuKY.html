going to be talking about your training
for rhythms so this is different than
all the other stuff we've been talking
about because now you have to listen to
the duration of notes rather than the
pitch of notes so now that we're
worrying about duration we have to
really worry about the time signature as
other otherwise things aren't going to
line up so figure out the time signature
is it for four or is it 34 or what
that's very important and once you find
a repeating pattern in the rhythm
section it's very easy to figure out the
time signature so once you got that i
recommend figuring out the rhythms for
the percussion and also the melody be
sure to write them down so you have them
and the very next step is to figure out
if they're mathematically correct so
that's that's a little bit different of
a term I mean concept here so basically
you can't have more notes in a measure
than the measure allows so if your
rhythm is a dotted quarter and then an
eighth note then we got three quarter
notes and then I dotted quarter and an
eighth note and then three quarter notes
and repeat and repeat and repeat well
you can figure out that it repeats right
here so here is the section well let's
say where we pick the time signature as
44 well here's one and a half so 1.5
here's five as that takes up one and a
half beats that takes up five I mean
point five sorry if this is confusing
you go see my rhythm videos and come
back very simple topics this gives one
this gives one and this gives one well
these three right here are three three
and these right here or to you add them
together and we get 5 so 5 quarter notes
in a measure that's not going to work
because we put four four time so that is
a hint that we're in the wrong time
signature so that is how you can figure
out the time signature in a more
in-depth way so this is going to tell us
that we're
and 44 but we are actually in 54
obviously because the bottom note tells
us we're in quarter nuts we have five
them that's a good sign if you're really
having trouble figuring out the time
signature it may be in a pattern of
let's say six eight it may not have that
triplet feel I mean it may not have
triplet triplet on the one triplet two
triplet 1 triplet 2 triplet 1 triplet 2
triplet it may just have court dotted
quarter notes and you may think it's in
24 time I mean you never know because if
there's only two notes per measure it
could be 12 12 or can be 1 triplet 2
triplet 1 triplet 2 triplet 1 triplet 2
triplet so if you're still having
troubles it may be that it's in a
different style of time signature it
could be asymmetric it could be compound
with this is compound this asymmetric
would be like 7-8 time and this is a
just normal time I guess that would be
24 time so yeah that is the idea
figuring out the rhythm section by ear
and that's allowed to say for this video
so i will see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
