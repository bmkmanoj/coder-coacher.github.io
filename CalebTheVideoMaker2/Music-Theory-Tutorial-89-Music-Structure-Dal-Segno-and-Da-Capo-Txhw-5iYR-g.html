reading music as a whole rather than
reading specific notes so when we have a
piece of music there's some terms we
should know about certain segments and
so forth so that's what we'll be getting
into today well the very first example I
want to show you is what's called DC
elfine a DC stands for the capo I
believe that's how you pronounce it but
not a 1 percent sure but how this works
is the way we read the music so let's
say we have the music here's the bar
lines so measure one measure to measure
3 measure for keep going and then we
reach this word that says DC I'll fini
this means go to the beginning and then
keep playing until we reach a word that
says fini so this is very close but the
DC means go to the beginning stop at
fini this is what this is telling you so
here's a picture of something with DC
I'll feed it word you start here play it
go all the way to the end once we get
here go to the beginning keep playing
keep going stop at the Fein a boom
you're done so that's an example of one
of these and the next one is DC al coda
another one we need to know about is DC
al coda the way this works is you're
reading your music you reach the end go
back to the beginning play it again
then somewhere along the music you'll
see what is called a coda sign it looks
like an oval with a T through it I think
when you get to this you will find
another one farther down in the music so
you're reading along you hit the
co.design the second time around and
then you continue from the other
co.design it's sort of like a portal so
here's here's your revision your music
playing boom boom continue so let's
start from scratch reading your music la
la la la la
you reach the end of the music go back
to the beginning reading your music blah
blah blah blah blah la la la la hit a
co-designed now we can find a coda sign
here which means you start here or we
can find a coda sign somewhere else like
such as a separate segment and we finish
here oh we're playing we reach the end
go back to the beginning go until we hit
the co.design and then it takes us over
here
play this final piece so that is that is
an example of DC al Kota here we have a
third one d es al Feeny D s stands for
tau cygna whoopsies so for this we have
to learn a new sign it's a confusing one
but it's not so bad it looks I think it
looks like a fancy s that's not how you
draw this like this sorta almost then it
has a line through it like this and two
dots so this is the segno and this will
help us when we're reading music so
let's give an example of this what this
means is you play till the end and when
you get to the end it will say let's say
this is the end over here d s al Feeny
this means go to the signal signal sorry
so I go back we see this fancy looking s
thing with the line through it and two
dots I'll show you a picture of it later
so it makes more sense and then this
means go keep playing until you reach
the word Feeny that's the whole process
once you reached Feeny there should be a
double bar which means to end the song
so let's let's try one let's make a
little song here with our little pin
here so we're playing la la la la it's
so beautiful keep playing keep playing
keep playing keep playing oh we hit
something that says d s AO feeding and
somewhere along this song we crossed
something called the same
no it looks like not like that like this
now we reach this oh no where do we go
well we just jump back up to here
without playing so we we just continue
playing we don't play anything on this
line so whoa we're back up to here keep
playing
somewhere along the line we're going to
see the word fini somewhere when we
played it the first time we cross this
we cross this though across the femaie
whoa
well I'll reach the end jump up here
start fighting plan from here till you
reach the fidei we're done boom that is
example D s alpha we play the song until
we reach two Gs I'll FINA we start at
the beginning
oops whoa
here's it let's say this is where we're
starting let me just make it smaller so
we can actually see it well we play the
whole thing reach the end then we go
back to the signa which i think is right
yes right there then once we reach this
we keep playing until he reached fini
right there so that is how you properly
play ad s al fini and by the way if you
can't see that that is what you can see
that that is what the signal looks like
here's a sec no cool pretty cool banner
so yeah that is DSL Feeny we have one
more to go over which would be cool so
yeah this one is D s al coda this one is
probably the most advanced of them all D
s al coda
so now we have two signs we need to
worry about the co.design looks like
that and the segno like that now when
we're reading music here is how ideas al
coda works readin readin reading and we
reached something that says yes oh good
just like for the DSL Feeny now we go
back to
the signal which just like that DC DSL
Feeny so go back to a little s looking
thing
slashed into dots now we keep reading
and remember how coda works we look for
something that says to the coda or coda
so reading and then we see something
that says to the code or code very good
coda so now that we see that we know we
need to go somewhere else we jump down
here to the co.design and continue the
song from there until we reached the end
hopefully that all makes sense it's a
little more of a process you may need to
practice that a while and here's a
picture of it about this finales website
the music making program so we start
here we're going we're going we're going
we're going and we see D s o coda which
means we go back until we reach the the
FINA
oh why did I call it a female signal and
then we keep playing until we reach the
to coda then we reach the code from here
when we reach the to co.design we jump
don't play we jump to here and continue
playing so it's all all of these are
played in a non-stop motion when I say
don't play I mean don't when we get to
the coda
we just jump here and continue playing
we don't play any of this stuff here so
if we're playing issue da da da
it should be a consistent plane not
interrupted by these the only thing is
where we're reading so if we have
quarter notes the whole song we reach to
DSL coda and then there's four more
Burton notes this should sound just
because he reached adidas al coda does
not mean we stop playing does not mean
we changed the tempo and less marked or
if there's rest then we don't play but
then otherwise we should be continuing
playing so we're playing till we reach
this gap here continue playing
from that spot don't play anything to
get up there hopefully I don't make
sense that is the basics mode excellence
that's pretty advanced actually but
that's pretty much all you'll need to
know for reading complex music pieces so
in the next video I'll be going over a
couple more things related to this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
