going to continue our discussion on data
types so if you don't know what that is
go check out the previous video and if
you did watch the previous video let's
dive right in
one classification of data types that
you guys are gonna need to know about
are arrays now later in this series I'm
going to have a video dedicated to
arrays and a couple videos with working
with arrays and all that good stuff
but now I want to give you an
introduction because I know you guys are
gonna run across a race and I don't want
you have to wait to like video of 758 to
know what an array is an array allows
you to store more than one thing inside
of like a group of whatever this thing
is so for example we can have an int or
a you can name it whatever you want and
an array is signified with these square
brackets and inside of here we put some
number so we could put you know like 10
and essentially what this is going to do
is give us a group of things okay I
can't I ran out of space there but each
one of these can hold an individual
values ball fit them all this entire
thing is great and it might make more
sense if we put nets on it great you
could also have a raise of different
data types for example you can have a
character array and this would look
something like this
where each one of these is an individual
character and this entire thing is born
now there is another data type that
every programmer needs to know about and
that is the string all a string is is a
double quoted sequence of characters
I'll just give you an example it makes
way more sense this is a string each one
of these is a character 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 10 11 characters so this is a string
with 11 characters and you can literally
think of characters being strung
together in a sequence well how exactly
is this string thing stored in C
programming well it's actually stored
inside of a character array which makes
sense because
you think about it we just have a
sequence of characters kind of like down
here we could have you know I space L I
ke
and so forth so if we made it variable
to store something like I like cats it
needs to be a character array but this
string is a kind of string that has to
be terminated and I'm just gonna scratch
the surface of this because we're gonna
devote tons of videos to strings later I
promise but at the very end of the
string you have to put something called
a null character which looks like
backslash 0 this is how we write the
null character in reality the null
character is the absence of everything
because that's what null means and ull
but to tell C we want to put the null
character we would put a backslash 0 and
this is interpreted as one character
just like we have the newline character
backslash n that is one character that
goes down to the next line because of
this the array actually has to be one
character longer than what you would
expect so we end up with something like
this where this is the string and now
I'm gonna split the characters we end up
with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 we have
an array with 12 elements everything
inside of an array is called the arrays
elements we'll get into strings and
arrays more in the future just
introducing it to you guys so you have a
rough idea there is another term you
guys ought to know and that term is
constant Clair what what do you want
Claire now there's kind of two
definitions of constants one is where
you kind of make a variable but it's
like a variable that can't ever change
and you probably know of those from like
science class one oh you change this but
this remains constant that's kind of one
definition of constant
there's also another definition which is
just a value so if we declare a variable
the number of caps I have this here is a
constant think of a constant as
something you can write down usually
it's pretty clear but let's go over some
examples of different ways you can write
similar constant
for example you could have this you can
have this and you could have this these
are three different types of constants
that are all very similar but the data
type for these are all different the
first is a character because of the
single quotes the next is an integer
because there's no quotes and then the
third is a string because of the double
quotes generally you don't have to worry
a whole lot about the datatypes of
constants I'm just trying to give you
some extra detail for example in this
situation this is interpreted as an int
but let me give you another example
let's say we do something like float
cats equals 98.5 well this brings up an
interesting point because this constant
here is actually a double data type we
don't really have to worry a whole lot
about that because we're assigning it to
a float so we get the expected value of
cats being a float data type that has
the value of 98.5 but sometimes you want
to be very very specific and that might
come up sometime in the road down the
future if that does come up there are
certain things you can do to be very
specific on the datatype of a constant
if you want to be specific and say this
is a float you can do things such as
adding an F to it now this is a float
constant I'm getting into a little bit
more detail than you need for right now
but that's fine if this is something you
guys need to know more about go research
it read some books on it or ask some
question or ask me some questions but
for now I think I covered the topic good
enough for now so thanks guys be sure to
subscribe and I'll see you in the next
