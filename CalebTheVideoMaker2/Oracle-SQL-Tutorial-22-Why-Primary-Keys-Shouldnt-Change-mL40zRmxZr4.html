Caleb's video maker - and we're going to
be learning something new today we were
going to be learning why primary keys
should never change so with the database
structure we've been using we've had a
user table that has a user name column
that is referenced by other tables but
it's important that nobody updates their
username why is this
that's essentially what I'm going to try
to answer in this video first off what
does happen if you have a username
column and someone references that as a
foreign key and you try to update your
user name well it's simple Oracle just
throws an error and doesn't let you
update it not a problem and nothing
breaks nothing explodes it just doesn't
run the problem in this though is that
now you can't change your username ah
this really depends on what your
application does what its purpose is but
maybe not changing your username is a
good thing some applications allow you
to change your username others don't but
if you're referencing that username as a
foreign key you want to design your app
to where you cannot update your username
because it will cause errors for those
who appreciate a visual this is what it
would look like we have a username
column that references the username
column of the users table now we have a
user who tries to change their name now
some database systems have something
called on update and then we could say
cascade and this works very similar to
the on delete essentially if the person
updates their username the username in
this table is also going to update
unfortunately Oracle does not have this
so there's not a real super easy way to
do something like this in Oracle that's
why I'm stressing it so much that if you
do this you need to make it to where the
username does not change but just to
tickle our brains a little bit let's
imagine Oracle does not care and doesn't
throw any errors let's figure out what
would happen so in the project's table I
actually name this wrong here the table
that references the user
name is the Creator table the name
actually doesn't matter it doesn't have
to match the column so it's not a big
deal but let's say we have a creator and
his name is um seeker 7 and that
obviously has to match a user in the
users table but then seeker 7 is all
like you know what this name stupid I'm
gonna change it and he changes his name
to see car 7 but this one doesn't update
now we have the issue that we have a
project created by some mysterious user
who doesn't exist because there is no
such thing as a seeker 7 inside of the
users table even worse there might be
another guy who realizes the seeker 7 is
the creator of this group or this
project and then he updates his user
name to seeker 7 and now he has admin
rights to do whatever he wants in this
project see the problem there that's why
a lot of people lean on the side of
using surrogate primary keys and only
referencing those with foreign keys so
if we wanted to do that all we would
need to do is have a user ID and instead
of having a creator we'd have a creator
ID and instead of having a user name
here we just have a number and then the
seeker 7 was the ID of 7 he can update
his name to see car 7 what his ID still
stays the same and his connection isn't
broken anymore that is something we can
do in Oracle and this is no longer in
our imaginary world where Oracle doesn't
care this actually does work that's why
you often see something like creator ID
you referencing another column in
another table as a rule primary keys
should never change so don't make a
primary key that's going to change the
user name if you can change it it would
not be a good primary key the user ID is
perfect because it's just a arbitrary
number that
the database picks it doesn't have any
real-world meaning so primary Keys never
change now I'm going to ask you a
question is it appropriate for foreign
keys to change I'll give you a second
the answer is yes why though well in
this situation we reference the user 7
if we were to change this let's say to 8
the only thing now is it no longer
points to this person it points to
someone else so this is actually a good
thing because it allows us to change
things in our child table so for example
if this person wanted to give off the
project to someone else he might assign
some other guy as the creator and then
he could delete his account or whatever
you know it's really flexible on how
this applies but yes it is appropriate
for foreign keys to change but if it's
talking about one person or one entity
then it should never change so let's go
back to 7 for example in this situation
as long as we're talking about this
person this should never change the only
time this should change is if we change
the entity we're talking about
so from what I've said it seems like
it's always the best idea to have
foreign keys that reference an ID but
there's also a lot of downsides if we
have a projects user table which just
lists all the users in specific projects
it might look something like this
the way we would get this data is
something simple like select everything
asterisk from and then put the table
name which in this case would be like
project users for example this is super
easy to get this data but if we get rid
of the foreign keys that are nice and
easy to read and replace them with IDs
this is going to say something like 5 5
12
III seventy two eighty three and we're
no longer going to have this that means
we're gonna have to do is join these
with the other tables and say where do
these go then we're gonna have to create
a really complex select that has joints
so that's the biggest consequence in my
eyes so the question is which one do you
choose choose wisely my friend the
ultimate decision is up to you but
please choose wisely thanks guys please
