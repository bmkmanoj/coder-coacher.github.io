Python tutorial series this video will
talk a little bit about variable scope
so what is variable scope basically it's
where you can use a variable so let's
just kind of show this we create a
variable score and we'll give it the
value 50 and we can use that variable
because we can print it and in the last
video we talked about functions well we
could create a function let's just name
it game which by the way you just lost
the game
oh but anyways we don't necessarily have
to give it a parameter what we can do is
we can just do things like we can print
variables that are outside of the
function so now when I say game it's
going to print out the value of score so
we can use this function within our I'm
sorry we can use this variable within
our function although it doesn't work
the same way around if we create a
function and then we define a variable
let's say epoch and give it the value 25
and then we outside of that we say print
epoch you say it gives us an error
that's because this print does not have
access to this variable value only the
function has access to it so keep in
mind that any variable defined within a
function stays within that function but
any variable defined outside of the
function can be used throughout the
program even within functions so that
has that's important when it comes to
priority of variables let's say we have
score and has devalued 25 and then we
define a function and within this
function we give score the value 15
right and then what we do is we print
score and then we did we a call game and
the only thing game does is print score
what what do you think it's going to
print 15 or 25 well it's actually going
to print 15 because this one has a
higher priority over the outside code so
the outside code can be used within the
phone
the inside code can't be used with on
the outside of the function and it has a
higher priority because it's a farther
indented within our blocks of code
essentially so now if we call game I'm
sorry I'll we have to print that out and
then we so we first let's print score
and then let's call game you can see it
prints 15 so just keep in mind when you
are working with variables be very clear
on the names and be careful defining
functions with defining variables within
functions and so forth just so that you
don't get any errors or any mistakes
thinking that oh this should print out
25 because score has the value of 25 as
we defined it up here but basically just
keep that in mind when you're using
functions it might be useful to use
variable names that are not already
being used outside of the function so we
could have probably used a different
word here we could have used we could
have just used game and then now when we
print out when we call game it's going
to give us sorry I guess we'd have to
change that to okay now it's going to
give us off 15 so that's just something
you can do to help clear up confusion
within your program so hopefully that
was helpful and be sure to stick around
