we will be practicing with some
intervals so it's gonna be real fun I
have a real fun I mean probably not that
much fun but it's not always about the
fun basically we're going to work from a
staff and figure out interval sizes and
qualities because this is most likely
how you will do it so we are in treble
clef which gives this pitch right here
edgy so that's G which means great every
good boy deserves fudge and SACD
face right so now I want to find the
interval between here and here so this
is every good boy deserves fudge
this isn't e this is D sweet so now we
know from E to D that means we have E we
can count the lines 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so we
know it's a 7th or what we could have
done any zoom in some so you can see
better or what we what we could have
done is uh counted scale degrees so e f
g a b c d 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so either way
it's a 7th another way to figure this
out is e to e is an octave so e to D
which is one less than an octave must be
7 because there's 8 in an office and 8
minus 1 equals 7 that's a quick way to
do that so what kind of 7th is it well e
to D that means we must count the half
steps within it to figure out what
interval size it is let me open up my
piano so we can figure this out okay now
II to D well we know e to e is an octave
so two half-steps
less than an octave cuz that's one
that's two so that's 12 and that must
mean that's 11 that's 10 now we know
this scale degree even does interval
size I keep saying scale degree it's
sighs this is a seventh with ten half
steps well we know that a normal seventh
would be major because if you remember
the Seven Sorrows major or minor but we
go from major and figured out from there
a major seventh has eleven half steps
let me give you an example of that C to
B is a major seventh with eleven half
steps now if we have minus subtract one
from a major will again minor so this is
a minor seventh and read from it
represent it lowercase and seven minor
seventh good let's do another one erase
this crap with this tiny puny eraser all
right C so here's our five lines now I
want to show you a cool trick one first
I want to show you when you have two
notes beside each other and that are one
pitch apart so here and then in the
space above it you actually kind of
offset it a little bit so it actually
looks like this
but they're still played in unison sorry
about that my battery died but as I was
trying to say was when you have two
notes beside each other that are only a
space apart you kind of offset them like
that they're played together and they're
connected but if we were to put them
above each other they would overlap and
you want to be able to tell what they
are
Brad like what kind of notes are which
we'll get into that later but anyways
let's say we want to find an interval
that is from let's say F that's on this
sorry F to see that's my C either
I'm off on to c-sharp oh you see that
mistake I just did
oh these don't go here they go here
c-sharp so f - C sharp well F F G a B C
there's five it's a fifth you can also
count the lines it's faces one two three
four five with how many half steps f - C
well C sharp that is so here's F one two
three four five six seven eight
so we know that a perfect fifth has
seven so if it was perfect
it would have seven it has eight so it's
I mean it's augmented one that's how you
can my problem entity means a raise so
it's actually eight or an Augmented
eight I'm Farley minted eight and ba5 is
how you would write that and I went to
fifth now let's try figuring out
intervals worth waivers from get like
okay we're going to find an Augmented
augmented sixth from D augmented sixth
from D so it creates staff one two three
four five I happen to know that DS right
here that way we want to start up here
because then there's too many ledger
lines and well not too many but get the
point so an augmented sixth well half
steps in a major sixth let me think
well there's seven and five there's nine
and six so a major sixth has nine so an
augmented sixth must have 10 but that
does matter if first we find the
interval size one two three four five
six we know it's going to be a B so we
can figure that out because d e f g
be that's six we count though when we
start on or we can count lines and
spaces we're on this space below the
first line so space line space line
space line six so now we figure out the
half steps ten so we started dee dee is
right here one two three four five six
seven eight nine oh there's a problem
because there's to be ten so it's a be
sharp now let's take a look at this be
sharp so see right so I'm just going to
erase this and put it as a seat
uh-oh I can't do that that's breaking
the rules because then it's not a sixth
it's a seventh so what I'm actually
going to do is write B sharp even though
it is actually a play it as a C it's a
augmented sixth also known as a B sharp
so that's some good practice and that's
all we're going to do for this video but
I do want to say when you're counting
from line to line it's a third so if
there's no year two here it's a third if
it's a if it's space to space it's a
third and that's because one two three
it's just easier to remember so if I'm
here and I'm going here it's a third and
if you're on like let's say if you're
out of line and you're going to a line
line the line it's odd but if you're
going to a space it's even same for if
you're all on a space and go to a space
it's odd and if you're going to a line
it's even for example from this line to
this space it's going to be even one two
three four five six seven eight
that's an octave right so that's all I
have to say for this video and I'll see
you in the next one thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
