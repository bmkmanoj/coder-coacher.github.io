of time if I sound weird my allergies
are going crazy and I thought it would
help if I drank a couple drops of
peppermint essential oil so now my face
is on fire and it's just going downhill
from here so please bear with me in this
video we are going to be talking about
typecasting Oh how they breed Oh
so to begin we are going to create a new
program to solve some more math you know
and this one's going to be a little less
serious because serious math can be
pretty boring sometimes so let's you
know let's start a new file them eggs
dot see we will include a standard input
and output and then we are going to open
our main function
and then return 0 now what exactly are
we trying to accomplish here let's say
we are writing a program for a chicken
company and this company wants software
that tells them how many dozens of eggs
they produce in a day so each night a
guy enters in how many eggs they've
gotten and then the output is how many
dozen that is yeah it's pretty simple
all you got to do is take the number and
divide it by 12 but I'm going to
illustrate some cool points in this
video so for those of you who don't know
a dozen this is a unit that is 12 so if
you have a dozen chicken eggs you have
12 eggs so we're going to need a
variable to store the number of eggs we
will just say int eggs we'll declare
that and now we're going to get the
value from the user percent I and then
we're going to need the address of
operator because we're changing the
value of the variable now we need to
also get a prompt to the user so they
know what to do so up here we could say
printf and say something like the number
of eggs for the day and now we can go
down here and I just like to space my
code out a little bit so it's a little
easier to read
we need a new variable to store how many
dozens of eggs there are so we're going
to use the double data type because you
know we could have a half-dozen or a two
third dozen so we always want to use a
double data type when we're going to
have decimals
or fractions we'll just call this dozen
and we'll make it equal to eggs divided
by 12 and then finally we want to print
how many dozen eggs they have and we're
going to want to use the percent s
conversion character because this is a
double data type which is part of the
floating-point data types which we'll
learn about those soon as I said so I'll
shut up now dozen eggs and then we'll
end it with a newline character now the
variable we're going to pass in to the
percent f is dozen now let's run this
program and see if everything works as
expected so we'll save it in close and
GCC eggs dot C a dot out the number of
eggs for the day let's say we're not
having a very good day and we only
produce 24 eggs the output is two dozen
eggs which is correct so it seems to be
working right not quite there's actually
a serious problem in our program and
that is the main topic of this video
that I want to talk about let's try it
with a different number of eggs let's
run it again this time you know where
you can have in a slower day than last
time and we only produce 18 eggs oh we
have one dozen eggs huh that that's not
right what the heck the problem here has
to do with data type arithmetic let's go
back in our code and try to fix this
little bug which if I haven't mentioned
it yet bugs that is when something is
wrong with your program so we need to
squash this bug then okay let's figure
it out where do we get the number one
well we can kind of go down to about
where that value is coming from it's
probably coming from around here because
that's where the value is calculated the
problem behind the incorrect output is
that we are taking an integer eggs from
up here see here that it's an integer
and we are dividing it by an integer C
we'll assume that when we are dividing
an integer by an integer that we want
the output to be an integer this means
even though we put in
value 18 we don't get the value we were
expecting because if you think about it
18 divided by 12 I think that equals one
and a half and because we are using
integers this 1.5 will actually become
1.0 the reason it has the point zero
zero zero zero zero after it is because
we're actually storing it into a double
so if wanted to be a little bit more
correct 1.5 becomes an integer so it
becomes 1 and then we store the 1 into a
double data type so we get 1.0 hello
yeah I know it's kind of confusing it's
kind of dumb when you first start and
it'll probably annoy the heck out of you
but eventually you'll figure it out you
understand that hey if we are dividing
two integers by each other the result is
going to be an integer
even if mathematically it should have
some fractional part in the decimal so
how do we fix this well whenever we have
a double inside of arithmetic then the
result will be a double so we could add
a point zero to the 12 now we are saying
hey we're working with an integer and a
double that means we want the result to
be a double the final result then would
be one point five this is one way of
doing it but it's not always going to
work you're not always going to be able
to just go in here and add a point zero
to whatever we're working with for
example we might not be hard coding the
value in here in that situation we are
going to need something else and that
thing is called typecasting as I
mentioned in the very beginning of this
video
typecasting is when we changed the
datatype of some value this is the more
sophisticated way to get the correct
output so to do typecasting it's very
simple all we have to do is say what
data type we want the value to be inside
of parenthesis inside of the expression
so I gotta get rid of that comment so
let's say we want to convert eggs to a
double simple as that which way you
prefer is up to you but to summarize you
can either put the data type in
parentheses before the variable or you
could add a zero to a specific constant
I am going to go with the typecasting
way now
you have to be careful with typecasting
you always want to make sure you are
casting what you think you are casting
so for example what if I did something
like this and I threw both of these
inside a parenthesis now what's going to
happen is we're going to do the mass and
then convert it to a double another way
to think about it is that the double
here only affects the first thing to the
right of it when we didn't have the
parenthesis it just changed eggs it
didn't change 12 as well the end result
here is still going to be incorrect
because we're using integer division and
the result will be 1 if we pass in
something like 16 even though it should
be 1.5 but once we have one in here we
then convert the one to a double and we
get 1.0 so you can see how if you're not
careful you might be trying to cast
something but you're not casting it the
correct way so in this situation we need
to get rid of these parentheses and just
cast the eggs to a double now let's save
this and make sure the result is as we
expected make sure you recompile every
time you change anything number of eggs
for the day 18 and you have one and a
half dozen eggs awesome so thanks guys
