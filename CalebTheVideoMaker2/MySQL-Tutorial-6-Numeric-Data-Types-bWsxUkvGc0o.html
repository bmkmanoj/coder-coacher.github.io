will be talking about numbers in this
video and that's true but the more
proper term is numeric so numeric data
types and I'll be going over these for
third couple more but you can go see my
other videos if you really care about
them because I don't well basically
there's two words you need to know first
and that is signed and unsigned I'll
just write that out real quick right -
you know signed and unsigned now what
this means is it differentiates between
positive and negative numbers if you
have a signed int which stands for
integer it allows for negative numbers
so like negative 12 negative 16 which
just means less than 0 so if you have
three cats and you lose those cats you
have zero cats but if you lose three
more you have negative three cats which
makes no sense but whatever so unsigned
does not allow for negative values which
means you can only have three cats one
cat five cats zero cats without being
unsigned integer now down to these three
decimal float and double these are for
decimals and I know this one says
decimal but they all have decimals and a
decimal is just numbers after a decimal
point so like you have one and a half
cats 1.5 cats which is also impossible
maybe I'm not but um then we'll be going
over these and then there's boolean
boolean is really simple it's just two
options true and false
so basically zero is false
one is true and anything else zero is
false and everything else is true which
is used to differentiate between true
and false and we'll get into that more
so that's all you need to know about
boolean
as simple as that so now we'll be going
over hint and just like text there's
multiple versions of int and we'll be
going over to all of them now here are
all of the int data types there are five
of them and if you remember when I said
it's signed and unsigned this will
actually affect their values so if you
need a store number such as 63 you can
store it in a tiny hint which allows
from negative 128 up to 127 but if
that's for a signed value if you want an
unsigned value then it allow up to 255
which is it more so if you if you needed
to store 178 you can either use small
int which is a bigger one well it's
bigger than tiny or you can use tiny
unsigned here are the unsigned values
for these and these are just estimates
because after 65,000 I just think 16
million because it's way easy to
remember and you can look up the actual
number if you feel like it begging on
the other hand is this like huge it's
like 20 numbers and it's like 18
something I don't know about that big ah
but that's other numbers here so when
you need to store a smaller number you
should use one up here and when you can
get store a larger number store one down
here it just depends you should always
use the one that's smallest that will
store what you need so as up for
unsigned and signed if you don't need
negative numbers you should always use
unsigned it just makes sense
5 you sign up for a website and each
person gets an ID and it goes up each
new member then let's say we expect 2000
numbers then small n will work because
it allows up to 65535 but um when you go
past that you're going to have to have
medium int which is like 16 million now
if you think you're going to get more
than that then you should just use int
but don't use one that's too small if
you're thinking you might have 60,000
maybe 70,000 don't go with small int
because it only lasts 465 go for medium
it
you always want to be able to store
everything you need but you want the
smallest one that'll store it so you
don't need a big int for like a phone
number that doesn't even make sense
all right now we're going to be going
over float and double but before I go on
there's one more thing I want to say
about int n stands for integer and
integers do not allow for decimals so
these are real numbers which would be
let's just say that's a number so one
one point two but if you cut that to an
integer it would become 11 well this one
so the difference between an integer in
a real number is uh the real numbers law
for decimals and integers do not alright
so if we're float this isn't a decimal
number accurate to about seven decimal
places which just means so we have six
point one so they could probably keep
that accurately but if you put an eight
or one over here it might misconfigure
some of these digits past here double on
the other hand we'll go up to fifteen
thirteen fourteen fifteen and start
messing up about there so that's all you
need to need this is a double precision
number if you know what that means and
then a float single precision so uh flow
is not as accurate to higher decimal
places and then the last point is
decimal
decimal stores a double as a string so
let's say have six hundred fifty three
point seven rather than having that it
will store it as a string keeping the
exact value so I'm going to let you in
on a little secret
if you need exact precision use a
decimal because the other ones will mess
up sometimes this will be exact so um
that's all you need to know ah yeah so
if you need exact use decimal and if you
need about use a float or double alright
that's all I have to say about numeric
data types in the next video I'll be
talking about dates better coming back
for that I'm going to go eat some food
and then I'll be right back to finish
this so see you later subscribe and
comment and tell me what you think oh
and also like my video thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
