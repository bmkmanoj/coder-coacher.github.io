database design series this video I
wanted to talk a little bit more about
foreign keys and a characteristic known
as not null all right so this this
keyword here might vary from relational
database to relational database but it's
probably something similar to this not
know which we learn about know when we
talk about this over here it's basically
saying you the database will not accept
someone not answering that column for
example so if it's not null you have to
give that call on the value every single
row so the rows are each individual
entry within the table if you have the
column characteristic of not null for
every row it's going to be required that
it has a value so think of like a fax
number does everyone have a fax machine
no most people don't so if I said is not
null and I didn't give it a fax number
then it would throw an error and cause
problems that's that's an example of how
non-dual works now this is important
when it comes to foreign peace because
it has to do with what's known as a
cardinality which we'll talk about that
when we start designing databases a
little more but it's basically whether
or not a relationship is required so
this is going to dictate what kind of
values we can put within our table back
to the fax machine if we have it to
where it's not null that means every
single value I mean every single row has
to have a value that also means that if
someone doesn't have a value they might
not be able to put any information in
this table so by putting this
restriction you are eliminating all rows
that aren't going to have a value you're
preventing them from happening you see
what I mean yeah
so if the case is where you do want
people who don't have fax machine
numbers to be able to enter data into
your table well then you would not want
to use not null as a characteristic
because that's going to prevent them
from doing that now this is important
when it comes to foreign keys because if
we require a relationship we said it as
not null and that means every foreign
key value for that column every single
row is going to have to have a
relationship for that so one of the
biggest differences between primary keys
and foreign keys is that primary keys
are required all of the time never
changing never Noll right drop my chalk
dang ah hi well foreign keys are a
little different because we can have
them to where they're not required they
can be empty because sometimes that
relationship is not there or they could
update like we could we could have a new
relationship in this table which we want
we don't we want to eliminate as much
possible updates as possible but
sometimes that's required and that's why
we use foreign keys to keep things
connected so when things are updated
they update across the platform now we
don't want the primary key values to
change but we could have the foreign key
references change for example let's say
we have a table over here alright and
we'll just have it will be will have to
be carbs ok or whoops I x2 the car right
and we have two rows we have a car was
the idea of six in a car with the idea
with the ID of ten right and we have
this guy over here we have a table for
him we'll just make it the user table
and let's say for some reason we wanted
to make a connection of what car he
owned
well he might currently own six right
and we don't ever want the value of six
to change and still be talking about the
same car let's say this car is this one
over here
this is some flames right and this one
over here
I got a legit car all right so these are
two separate cars ten talks about this
car six talks about this car we don't
ever want it to happen to where this
number gets updated eight or we change
the primary key and it's still referring
to the same exact car because then we
have a changing primary key well at
foreign keys it can change in the sense
that oh I no longer own this car now I
own this car so we didn't have any
primary keys updated but the foreign
keys which would be this connection
right here did update all right so that
kind of is a little bit of a difference
between primary keys and foreign keys
primary key values should never change
foreign key values can change because
references change hopefully I didn't
just lose my train of thought thing I
think I'm going but kind of hitting a
blank here for a sec okay so let me just
illustrate this in a college right one
of the important things between these
tables that have a primary key and a
foreign key connection to that primary
key is that they have to be of the same
data type which is the type of data
whether it be int or a character or date
and basically it has to have all the
same characteristics like the collation
or the character set or the um storage
engine now the only thing that can vary
is the not normal characteristic because
if we have the primary key over here
well we know that the primary key is
never know so we always have not know
for the primary key I'll just put an N
for short the foreign key on the other
hand it's not always required to have a
connection for example in that previous
example we had the person the user table
and had this guy over here
we have this car table of the cars that
the the user owned right you could have
one car well he might not currently own
a car therefore we don't have a
connection to this table
therefore this connection is optional or
not required yeah that doesn't even look
like English but close enough so let's
think of a another example if we have a
college well we might be an early in the
semester where every single class before
people have registered every single
class doesn't have an instructor yet and
we're still trying to find an instructor
although we know that's the class that
we want to have so that means we have an
instructors table we'll have the
instructors over here and we have a
class table the class table is going to
have a four key pointing to the
instructor for the instructor of that
class unless the case of a many-to-many
where multiple instructors can teach
multiple classes then we would need an
intermediary table but that is not the
case here I need to learn more about
that check my relationships video but
for now we would have a a class ID and
an instructor ID right and then over
here we have an instructor rating this
it says I NS instructor close enough
right now this is going to be a
reference to this over here now what
kind of values is just going to accept
let's give some examples let's say we
have here's a row we have the class ID
seven the instructor IDE 83 and we'll
add a call and we'll make it out of the
name of the class we have a call minutes
math right and then we can have another
value within here I think I'm off screen
now then we can have instructor over
here his name his ID could be seven
and his name could be Jake right so this
class ID is seven let me change it
something I get confusing let's like
this 16 all right so this class ID is 7
and it's by an instructor 8 which we
don't actually have over here yet so
that means we either have another row or
we have an error which because we never
want that to happen so let's say we have
another class got any room okay we have
another class over here and it's it's
numbers 8 and it's taught by cable right
so now we have an instance of a class
we got the class ID 7 the instructor ID
8 and the name meth so the instructor ID
points to this log of this instructor
over here this is the parent I'm sorry
this is the parent this is the child
because this is a foreign key reference
to the pen so that means this
relationship is a foreign key now with
the not null thing if we made it to
where it's not no if we added the
characteristic not no well that means
this Row is going to have to have a
value for the instructor ID that means
every single value for instructor ID is
required what does that get rid of that
means it's impossible to put a class in
this table that does not have an
instructor ID that could cause a problem
if you have a class created but you
don't have an instructor yet or if the
instructor drops out and you have to
find a new one so this one might be a
bad time Hugh's not null if we got rid
of that well now we could have a class
with a primary key but no foreign key
connection now we have a class with the
idea 7 its meth and the the current
teacher we don't have one
we still have this guy over here he's
not teaching that class but he's still
in the system
Jake's still in the system the class is
still in the system that is a good
example so for this one not an old might
not be the best idea
other examples having none'll would be a
good idea because it forces that
relationship to be there you only think
of another quick example real quick
quick example real quick if we had two
two entities we had a card for a credit
card company so we had the card and then
we had the person holding the card so
the person who bought the car is getting
the card from the bank and he's using it
to buy their groceries and their gas and
they're breaking up thousands of dollars
in debt well that person would have
relationship with this card because he's
the card holder that's the card now if
if we had a table for this we'd probably
have a card table and we'd have a person
ID which would reference the person
table right if we set this to not null
that means every single value or every
single row within this card table is
going to require a card owner if we had
if we got rid of this that means we
could have cards in here that were
outdated that don't currently have an
owner because there's no connection we
broke that owner or new cards that
haven't been gave it given out yet so if
you want to stable to just be four cards
that currently have an owner so we can
have it own cards well then we could
have a not null column with the same
data type as person ID now every single
value is going to have a person ID does
that make sense so that's kind of the
introduction of not knowing how that
works with foreign keys and how
sometimes you will want them to be not
on one other times you want them to be
knowable or not required so yeah that is
some good stuff right there so we should
study all that and under
and all of that because it's really
important if you have any questions
leave me a comment and I will try to get
back to you thank you and see you guys
