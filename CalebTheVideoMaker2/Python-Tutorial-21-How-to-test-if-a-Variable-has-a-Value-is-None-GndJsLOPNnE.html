tutorial series this video I wanted to
go a little bit different off topic but
it's still related because when we use
if statements and all these loops and
all the stuff that we're going to be
getting into an upcoming videos
sometimes it is important to know
whether or not a variable has a value
for example what if we created a
variable but it didn't have a value yet
and we wanted to do stuff with this
value well we don't want to do anything
with the with the variable if it doesn't
have a value yet so we might want to put
a halt on our program and tell our user
to either insert some data to up to give
us a value for the variable or you might
want to do something else
so how do we first create a variable
that doesn't have a value well in order
to give a variable a value we use like
legit variable and then we give an
assignment operator and then we say the
value right well this creates a variable
legit variable that's the name of it and
it has a value of 15 well what if we
didn't want it to have a value what
would we do would we just say like let's
try to make one without a variable let's
say cats are not as cool as sharks and
they just press Enter because we don't
want to sign anything you see that we
get an error well this is uh this is
this cannot be confusing to you guys who
have not been programming before but
what we need to do is we need to assign
it a empty and empty variable value so
basically if we want the variable to not
have a value we assign it none what none
is is basically says that the variable
does not have a value none in itself is
not a value so it's not like an empty
value because it's not a value it's
basically it has not received a value
yet it's empty you may also hear this
and differently
which is as nor alright so in order to
do that we could say man we can assign
it none now please keep in mind that the
first letter is uppercase C if we don't
do that you can see that it does not
highlight as a keyword so we need to be
sure that that is uppercase now when we
print pizza man it gives us the value
none another thing for you to keep in
mind is that none is not a string where
it has the value none C that would be
this that is different than none let's
try this though and then let's print
that out you can see it looks the same
but this is a value this is not a value
we can manipulate this value we can't
manipulate none the same way as we would
with this so keep in mind that none does
not have quotes and it's also different
than a zero here are something else we
could do this is different than non two
because this is a number value that has
the value zero it's still a value so
when we print this out we still we get
zero all right so how can we like why is
this practical well we might need to
define a variable that we're not sure
what the valuable what the value is
going to be yet it might be defined
later within our program or it might be
defined by a user of our program they
might insert a value that gets assigned
to a already created variable or you
might see this with like for example
database connections we might make a
variable for database connections and
we'll assign it none so basically we
don't it doesn't have a value yet
and then once the connection to the
database is completed we'll give it the
value true or whatever it is so that way
we defined the database connection
variable at the beginning but it doesn't
necessarily have any it doesn't have a
value until we give it a value later so
within an if statement we could say
there's a couple ways we could test to
see if a variable has a value one way is
please give us a value for pizza mom
let's try this one and you can see
nothing happens because currently pizza
man is set to zero so let's update that
let's change pizza man to none and
remember no quotes now when we run this
again you can see it says please give us
a value for pizza man
it does not currently have a value
another weekend way we can do this is we
can say we can replace the is equal to
with is so this is another way we can
test this and it does the same thing so
what we might want to do is we could say
like hmm we'll make a variable
connection and we'll make it none okay
and then we say if connection is none
we can say error try again later so
basically this is going to we could then
make more code to halt the program to
stop the program but for now this will
work so now if there's no connection
then it gives us an error or what we
could do is we could add an else
statement connection 6x successful all
right and then what we can do is we
could well this will still do the same
thing because connection is still set to
none but we'll update that whoops let me
do that so now let's take connection and
we'll set it to true and then we'll take
this code and pray run it again and it
says connection successful so that is
this a couple of examples of how we can
have empty variables within Python so in
the next video we'll be getting into
some more programming techniques so be
sure to stick around and subscribe thank
