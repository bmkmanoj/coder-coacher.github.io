sequel data types all right and if you
don't know what that is it's good and if
you don't know what my sequel is that's
also okay my sequel is a relational
database management system it allows you
to store information in a database and
basically when you want to store
something in a database my seep will
want to know what it's storing is it a
number is it a word is it binary so
there's a whole bunch of data types and
I will be going over these in this
series all right here are the four types
of data types
now numeric that would be any type of
number like 60 7.3 date/time and this is
pretty simple with just a date and time
or time string that is any like word or
anything in quotes so like pizza that's
that's a string you can also have
numbers as strings so you could have in
here 638 but this is still type string
not numeric and then there's I think
this is spatty well I don't even know
how to pronounce that but uh we're not
going to be going over these in this
tutorial for one you need to use my
sequel functions and I will not actually
be using my sequel in this I'll just be
teaching about the datatypes so scared
of these and you can find us online if
you want I've never used them so I'll
teach them here are all the string data
types now these are for storing text and
also these but these convert to binary
and they do not have a character set and
I'll get into that don't worry if you
don't know what's going on now these are
this will be like new and set if you
picking options so to be like four
options and you get a pick one for a new
and then for set you'd be able to pick
more than one and I'll be going to stone
you and how do you know eyes
to say all that so first we'll be going
over char and March are these Stanford
characters so characters and variable
characters now what that means what the
difference between these two is how it
is stored so we put an entry into a
database and let's say it is eight
letters one two three four five six
seven okay it's seven more all right now
we're using the char data type now when
we enter a four-letter word such as
these will be entered as spaces so when
you enter it they'll be put the spaces
will be enter stored in these three
spots and then when you retrieve it
it'll take the spaces off and it'll be
given to its fit so the varchar' on the
other hand will actually if you leave
these blank it'll actually cut these
short and store it as four letters
rather than seven now what does this
mean that means that char needs more
space on your system because it's
storing extra three spots now it's just
stated
I said char will retain spaces so why
would it do this basically its first
it's recommended to use it for when
things are a set amount of no spaces so
let's say mmm zip code so five letters
of code let's make one one one one
that's five basically it should always
be five and if it's for somebody type
something in wrong and you know
something's messed up so should it'll
always store as five which is more
effective and faster storing exact
lengths characters rather than varchar'
which varies here's the stats I guess
you could say char better performance
varchar' better sighs so when do you use
what and I said a little bit about this
basically when something's a set amount
of care
characters such as a social security
number phone number I would you want to
use char but when something varies such
as a name a username and email you want
to use varchar' the max amount you can
store in a char is 255 characters versus
varchar' 6500 535 whoops 9 65535 if you
enter let's say a varchar' for four
right that's four spots and the word you
enter is fake
that fits fine but what if it's in of
our char three you can see that this is
too long so what it does is it will cut
off anything on the end so now you'll
have fat rather than fake</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
