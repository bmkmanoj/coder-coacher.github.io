over what's called articulation oh and
check out my new marker look how nice
the tip looks it's incredible
never had a new one of these before oh
it's so easy to see our tick you now
articulation is a way to tell you how to
play a certain note or type of style in
the music so we can you know we have
five lines staff of five line staff we
may have a note and you may see a dot
above it or you may see a one of these
alligator mouth things or you may see
something like that
or you may see something well you get
the point so it's a ways to alter the
music and tell somebody how to play
something now this may be consider
articulation we went over the tie and we
also went over the slur I believe in
previous videos difference between this
is you may see a note like this oh dude
look how nice this marker looks with a
little scoop thing or you may see it
upward just dry matter and something
like this now this would be what's
called a tie so it's telling you to play
the note for one beat and then hold it
out for another beat so in total you
have two beats now the difference
between a tie and a slur is the second
note will be a different pitch so it may
look something like oh that would well
you play this note hold it for a beat
and then you play this no the order for
a beat so we still have two beats but
they're just separate notes so that's a
tie and slur and now I'm going to write
out some other ones and then we'll talk
about those here are some other signs
you may see in music now what these mean
well it's depends for one I just clarify
I am NOT
instrument nor am i a pianist barely a
guitarist so I'm a percussionist we
don't see these things as often although
we have seen we do see this very quite
frequently in some times this and this
but it's it's different than a wind
instrument so I'm gonna try and explain
these hopefully I don't get them
incorrect cuz yeah but anyways this one
is known as staccato it's a note with a
little dot above it now this means to
play the note box quickly quickly I
don't know what that this means to play
the note quickly and so I just feel like
end it so just basically barely play
play quickly and mmm what's the word I'm
looking for
distinctly so play it as in one note
very quickly and it that's staccato you
may see staccatissimo
I think occasionally maybe it's probably
wrong just saying that looks like this
with a little almost like an arrowhead
above it this is basically the same
thing but faster so just like very
quickly ended that's staccato then we
have Mercado which that's like uh looks
like this above a note please get this
right Marcato
I think that's right that is to play a
note loudly and short so it's like this
plus loudness so you're playing it
louder and shorter I think this one's
tenuto or it's probably not even
pronounced writing this is to play a
note as long as the value that's given
for play as long as you can so if we
have an upcoming note hold it absolutely
as long as possible
before you switch to note but don't sort
because it's not a slur if they wanted
it to be a slur they would have drew the
two notes and connected them see I'm
saying so it's still a distinct note
just hold it for as long as possible and
the last one is an accent mark which
means to play the know louder so think
of it this this one right here is like
combining this and this so it's loud and
short you may see sforzando which is
basically like an accent it's a really
loud note so yeah you may see that also
as SF whereas that system acts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
