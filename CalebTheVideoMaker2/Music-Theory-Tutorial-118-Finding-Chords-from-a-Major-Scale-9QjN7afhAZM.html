about getting major chords from scales
so if we have AC major scale we know
that there's no accidentals black or
white keys sharps or flats na c major
scale so we just have the basic notes
CDE or natural notes c d e f g a b back
to see now if we wanted to take the
notes out of the scale remember we had a
major 3rd and a perfect fifth well
that's conveniently enough these three
notes right so it's basically every
other note of a c-major scale so if we
were to do the same thing for G major we
have actually let's do different one
yeah let's go D major we have D F sharp
G Friday sorry D F sharp G a B and C
sharp back to deep so here take the
first note the third note because this
is a major third always the intervals
doesn't change just because we changed
scales and then we take the a so a major
D would be D F sharp and a that is how
you can get ad major chord from the
scale so if you know your scales getting
the corpse is pretty easy so let's do
the same thing for a minor scale so the
way a minor scale works is you take the
third note 6 note and the 7th note and
lower them a half step c d e f g a b and
then C so we get third note v6 note why
I'm writing sharp signs I'm an idiot be
flat a flat and B flat so here is our
creation now we take the same notes we
had in the last one ceng because those
are the notes needed for a si core and
now we have a C minor chord
because we got it from the C minor scale
this is the natural minor scale and if
you don't remember that you can go back
to my other video / natural minor and
check that out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
