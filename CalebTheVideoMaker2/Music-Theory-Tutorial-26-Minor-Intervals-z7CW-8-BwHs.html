video we talked about major imperfect
intervals and we're going to expand upon
that so it makes a little bit more sense
so let's review we had all of the
possible interval sizes one through
eight
not including compound intervals I'm
going to represent perfect intervals
with a capital P major intervals with a
capital N and that that's not the only
not only do I do that but that is common
major intervals are represent a major I
mean the capital n perfect with capital
P all right so here are all of our
interval sizes and uh notice how it goes
perfect major major perfect perfect
major major perfect and I've said that
forty million times they're all in there
both capital and here are our step sizes
well there's actually something really
cool we can do with the major intervals
that we're going to learn about so
here's an example of a major interval
that right there was a major third with
four half steps
it was c2e now what if I want to create
a new sound here the difference
one sounds duh-duh once kind of sat well
that's actually called a minor so if we
take these major intervals and -
subtract one half-step wiggins what's
called minor so that's represented with
a lowercase n we can't do that with
perfect it creates something different
for example here is a perfect second
here is if we take one 1/2 step away it
doesn't give the same effect as
which is a minor minor is kind of sad
whereas it's kind of unpleasant you know
it's not very sad just see yeah we can
subtract one of these so monitor as we
can see instead of two we would have one
instead of four we would have three
instead of four it's this going to this
is going to nine
it would have eight instead of 11
it would have 10 you see so now we can
create major minor and perfect tables
that's like three kinds of intervals
okay here I have an actual keyboard
because it's easier to see for one and
it's not so difficult to play so let's
take a look at this here are our letters
flat keys and here are our intervals
interval sizes and qualities so a major
third has four half steps sir start
let's see one two three cool but a minor
has three one two three can you hear the
difference one sounds almost not it's
like there's not that resolved feeling
for example
that's a lot of emotion I feel like a
woman oh man that was a burn that was a
burn I'm sorry we also see that
different interval sizes can create
different sounds such as a major seventh
doesn't sound as major for example
there's a lot of tension there because
these vibrates the way these two vibrate
create an interaction that's not as
pleasant as plus there are farther
distance apart for example if I place
two seize this vibrates twice as fast
now if I lower this down it's not going
twice as fast so it doesn't quite
interlock through interlock right
whereas the other one would be like one
state one two okay this is gonna go
twice every time this goes once one two
three four you know I'm saying but if I
put a B in there it's like doesn't sound
good so that's some basics for major
minors that's the basics of minor pretty
much everything and you know about
minoring for now so in the next video
we'll be talking about something even
cooler all right these escape cooler and
cooler don't they so yeah subscribe to
