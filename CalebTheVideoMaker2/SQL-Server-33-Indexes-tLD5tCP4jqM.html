we're gonna be talking about indexes
yeah
now we've briefly talked about indexes
in this sequel server tutorial series
but in the upcoming videos we are going
to be creating these indexes so I
thought it'd be appropriate to you know
go a little bit more in depth with these
things called it's been a little while
since I've made a video so it might take
me a couple seconds to get back in the
rhythm of things also I apologize ahead
of time if I throw up because I've been
sick for like a long time but that's
enough about throw up because no one
really wants to talk about that show
let's get on to indexes what is an index
well in databases and indexes when we
tell the database we are going to use
this column or a group of columns for a
bunch of stuff it improves the speed of
our database essentially what I'm saying
is that we create a column index now the
sequel server knows how to treat that
certain column because we labeled an
index it improves the speed of our
select statements and also joins which
are part of select statements so
literally the easiest way to think of an
index is to think of a book which has an
index so an index is something usually
in the back that you can look at and
it'll tell you where they talked about
certain topics of course the one book I
grabbed does not have an index anyways
pretend that the back of this book has
an index and what that index does is it
lists different topics that the book
talks about and where to find those
topics in the book it works similarly in
databases because we can define a column
as an index and then that database knows
how to grab that data quicker now there
are two types of indexes when we are
working with sequel server and those two
index types are clustered and
non-clustered I'm going to give you a
rough overview of what both of these are
that way you are prepared to make legit
indexes on your database the essential
difference between these two is how the
data in the index is structured the
first one we are going to talk about is
clustered now I don't know about you
guys but back when I was a young lad we
had these things called phone books and
what these things
do is they list phone numbers of you
know all the people in your local town
or your city now the way these phone
books are organized is that when you
look someone up all of the information
about them is right there so let's say
the phonebook is organized by a name you
could say that the name is a clustered
index in that phone book
so in databases clustered indexes
determine the way the table is actually
laid out to better think this through
let's go through a simple table to see
this here is the table and we have an ID
column and a name very simple table it
doesn't really matter if it's useful for
anything the thing you're going to
notice here is that these are ordered by
an ID so in this situation we probably
put a clustered index on the ID column
the names on the other hand they are in
no particular order that's because they
don't have an index so if you were to
tell the database yo give me the dude
with the ID of 3 well it's easy all you
got to do is go down to the ID of 3 boom
right there
but if you say something like yo give me
the person with the name mark well now
the database is going to have to go and
scan through every single row to try to
find mark so you can see that it can be
much more time-consuming when the things
are in some logical order the database
can find that data much quicker now
moving on to a non-clustered index it
works very similar and that it organizes
the data like this but the actual data
that's associated with it is stored
somewhere else so it kind of just tells
you how to find the data the best
illustration for that is using an index
in the back of a book so let's say I
look up something like joins in a
database development book it'll say
joins page
4080 2 it points you to where the data
that you're looking for really is so
let's say we wanted to order the first
name we could put a non-clustered index
on this data and the end result would be
something like this you can see that
these are a procedural order now and if
there is any other information
associated with this row for example it
last name since this data is an order
the database can find the data much
quicker so you could say yo give me the
person with the last name of mark boom
right there then it is easier for the
database to find the data relating to
mark and there you go there's Mark Smith
so another way to think about it is that
the non-clustered indexes organizes the
data but does it separately than the way
the table is actually structured the
table is actually structured by ID here
but the database does some additional
work of keeping some kind of system of
ordering for the names then the database
can use that system to find the data
related to that name or whatever the
index is on now index has worked the
best when you're grabbing the data that
is indexed so what that means is that if
you have some kind of index and you are
selecting data it'll probably be faster
if you just select the columns that are
part of that index but that doesn't mean
you have to do it that way
and generally indexes can help with a
lot of things so if you're running into
the problem where your queries are slow
you'll probably want to look into adding
indexes and in fact you should probably
design your database to have indexes to
begin with so what do you want to index
I know this video is kind of running
long so I'll try to keep it simple
essentially you want to index anything
you're going to commonly use for a
select and also joins which we will
discuss joins in more detail as time
goes on so this generally includes the
primary key which by the way anything
labeled primary key is going to be a
clustered index by default so you
usually do not have to worry about the
primary key the next thing you'll want
to consider is any foreign keys if
you're using joins and you're joining
foreign keys to primary Keys you'll
probably want to make a non-clustered
index on those foreign keys lastly the
third type of thing you're going to want
to index is any other columns you are
continually selecting so if you have
some website that continually selects
the same data and over and over and over
again you might want to consider adding
an index on there and seeing if it
improves the speed any the last thing
you guys need to know is that you can
only have one clustered index only one
and why does that make sense it makes
sense because
this determines the table structure you
can't have the table structured in one
order and also in a different order
only one index can determine the order
you can have as many non-clustered
indexes as you want I mean there's a
limit but in general the number of
non-clustered indexes is not a concern
the only concern you might want to have
is that the more indexes you have the
slower the database becomes that's
because anytime you update data or
insert data it's got to update it in all
of the indexes so for example let's say
mark changes his name to mark what they
see well now this has to be updated and
all of the indexes referencing that
column so there's a good balance and
obviously this is a lot of information
for one video so we can't cover it all
but this is a pretty good overview and
in the next videos will be creating
indexes in sequel server so thanks guys
