wanted to talk about two very very
extremely common things when working
with PHP like seriously this is like the
best part about PHP like for real like
I'm not even kidding all right all right
include and required these are both
functions and they are like legit like
I'm not even kidding all right so what
these allow you to do is include another
file within your file so let me let me
draw you a little picture to make this
very crystal clear all right let's say
you have a file here I'm just gonna draw
a weird-shaped and then you have a web
page right and then you have another web
page right and then you have a third
file here well technically four files
all right what you can do is basically
include another file within another file
so it's pretty much like you're taking
that code and putting it within the file
you're including it in code so let me
give you an example most common use for
this is with headers and footers so when
you go to a web site very common they'll
either have a sidebar or a top bar that
you can hover over and they'll have
options and if you click it it'll go to
a new page and it's still there at the
top with the same picture or whatever
well if you do not have this you would
have to take that code copy it and paste
it on every single page within your
website but with these functions you can
take that one single page and you can
oops you can put it on any web page you
like
so let's say this is header
well now header is being included within
these web pages we could also have the
file Fleur and they can also include
within these web pages so now we have
what looks to the user like one web page
but within the code it's actually taking
the code from this page and from this
page and putting them together to create
one page now another thing that's great
about this is if you decide to go
through some design changes for example
it will add a new feature to your bar at
the top whatever you want to call it
well you can change this let's just say
you change it the color of something
well now it's going to update on every
single page within the website so now
you don't have to go and change every
single website so oftentimes things that
are consistent throughout your entire
web page they are going to be included
within your content so you could say
that the content the content oftentimes
includes stuff that can change or is
consistent because if you have two
things exactly the same on two web pages
it's kind of redundant to have to code
it twice when you could just point them
both to another file so yeah these are
like super awesome
so the first one include what goes in
here is what file to include which we'll
be talking about putting file paths in
the next video now I'm just going to be
explaining how they work well include is
going to try to grab the file you want
to include but if it can't it's just
going to display an error and then go on
with the rest of the page the other one
require
this if it works it's going to do the
same exact thing it's going to take the
fire including or requiring put it
within the code and then put the rest of
the content the web content within it
was in that page now the only difference
is when require doesn't work it will put
an error and it will not display the
rest of the page so if we have a failure
web page with include and let's say this
top bar is included and then the rest is
down here well if it fails we're just
going to get an error here but the rest
of this content is still going to be
here if we have a required all we're
going to get is the error and we're not
going to get any content that's if it
doesn't work if they both work well then
we're good they're both going to have
content within the website now both of
these have another function that's
similar to it which looks like this
what both of these do is they only
included the file once well what are
your probably like oh why would it
include it more than once well in some
cases your website may try to grab the
file more than one time and if this is
the case I mean you'd have to see a
specific situation when that happens but
this is basically just going to only
allow it to be grabbed once within your
specific page so this one page can only
try to include it one time and if it
doesn't any more than that it's not
going to work we can also require once
which you know the difference between
these so the include once if it doesn't
get the file it's still going to display
the content the require once it's not
going to display the website content so
now all you have to think about is what
situation to use what if you absolutely
absolutely need the required file or the
included file then you want to use the
require function or the require once
function but if it's something simple
such as like okay let's say your footer
doesn't have much information on it and
then for some reason it fails to include
it which is probably a problem and you
should probably fix that well then you
can use include it just kind of depends
on the situation and you may need to
look up what's appropriate for that
situation and then there's which this
group or this group do I use include
once the require once or include or
require well the once takes more memory
so you will want to use that only if
having it on there more than once is
going to cause a problem
so if including it twice would be
extremely bad then use these two so most
of the time use these two but I can't
tell you the appropriate one to use in
every situation because it just depends
if you absolutely absolutely need the
file and you cannot have it more than
once
this one if you absolutely absolutely
need the file but if it's on there more
than once it's no big deal
this one if you don't absolutely need
the file but you can only have it once
if it does work this one and if you
don't absolutely need the file and if
it's on there a million times it doesn't
really matter this one so yeah I know
that's pretty rough explanation you just
have to see some examples and we'll see
that as they go on in the series so
thank you for watching and as for what
goes with in these parentheses that will
be in the next video where we will be
talking about relative and absolute
paths which just points back to another
file so this is going to point to it
file which will then be included within
the website so that's all I'm saying
this video thank you for watching be
sure to subscribe and I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
