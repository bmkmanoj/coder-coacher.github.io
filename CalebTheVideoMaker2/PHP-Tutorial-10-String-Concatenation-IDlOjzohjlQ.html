10th PHP tutorial I hope you like my new
attire and I look I look good alright I
lock with being a weirdo anyways this
video I wanted to talk about string
concatenation so in just in case you
don't know what I'm saying calm cat this
is joining two strings together and it's
quite common believe it or not so the
way we do this well we can have let's
just go through a little example I'll
just this is probably one of the most
common ones we could have first name as
a stored variable and then we can have
last name as a stored variable or you
can spell those out if you want it
doesn't really matter
well oftentimes you want to put these
together and to create I mean to create
a full name and we can do this a couple
of ways but the one of the most common
ways is using concatenation so how would
we do that well concatenation works by
using a period between strings that you
want to combine so we can say name as
the value of first name period last name
that makes sense
so now what's going to happen is it's
going to take the first name put it with
the last name and once those two are
together it's going to be assigned full
name is going to be assigned that value
so how would this work let's say if
Caleb was the entered value for first
name and curry was the entered value for
the last name when these are
concatenated well neither of these have
a space you see so if you like this when
you put these together the final result
is going
like this and this is probably not
correct in the situation you want to use
it in because there's no space between
the two words so you can also
concatenate other things within this you
mean you can you can I use concatenation
to create spaces and other things so
that's what I'll be showing you next in
order to add that extra space wheeler we
are going to have to have another period
so originally we had it like this full
name so here's our variable full name
and we are assigning it the value the
combination of first name period last
name and obviously these both have
values themselves too so we could say
first name has the value of Caleb last
name has the value Curie so now
hopefully you guys can see that can you
guys see that can you see that dude I
don't know that's like my biggest worry
is that you guys have no idea what I'm
writing this it's not very it's not very
bright anyways get off top gear so now
how this is going to come out is Caleb
curry which is not what we want so in
order to fix this we're going to have to
concatenate another part onto the full
name so to do this now we put a period
and then quotes and a space within the
quotes a period and then last name so
why did I do this
well basically concatenation works like
this it's going to go through okay
it wants the first name Caleb oh there's
a period now we're going to add
something on to this part right here
we going to add we're going to add a
space anything within the quotes is
going to be added onto this so a space
is added and then it's going to add the
last name so here's the final result of
this right here you can also put other
things within these quotes as well for
example let's say instead of Caleb curry
you wanted curry comma Caleb well we
could switch a few things around put the
last name first first name last and then
within the quotes you could have a comma
and a space so now it's going to come
out as curry comma space Caleb this is
actually pretty common so I recommend
that you fully understand concatenation
by the way do you guys remember in my
for those of you who know me from before
this series my old MySQL videos I always
erased with a red towel
well I erased so much stuff it turned
white that's unbelievable so yeah that
is concatenation and you can concatenate
a log stuff so you could be like oh
let's competin eight things
all these periods and stuff yeah let's
do it but that's pretty much the basics
of that so that's all I really have to
say about concatenation thank you for
watching
be sure to subscribe and I will see you
in the next video thank you and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
