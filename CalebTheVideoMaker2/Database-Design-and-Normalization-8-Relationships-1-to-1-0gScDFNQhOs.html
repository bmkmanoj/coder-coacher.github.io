one-to-one would be the social security
number thing I was talking about one
human can have one social security
number a specific social security number
can only have one human that is
one-to-one if a human could have more
than one social security number there
would be one human to multiple social
security numbers so let's say you have a
social security number of 8 I know
that's never gonna happen
but whatever you can't have Bill and
blade let's say these are two people
they can't both have the same social
security number because if they did in
your reference referencing the person
was the social security of number of 8
you would get bill in Blake that's just
not going to happen now let's say you
have just Bill and then you have the
numbers 8 and 12 he has a social
security number of 8 and he also has the
social security number of 12
that can't happen either bill can't have
the social security numbers 8 and 12
because a social security number is
supposed to be first specific person you
can't have two of them that's like
having two birthdays it's impossible you
go to a college all right and then every
single college student when they
graduate let's just say they get a
college description oh sorry that's
doing description that so that tell us
about the student and what they you've
accomplished so you're going to a
college and your student ID is three
thousand and twelve now on the student
description it has a student ID of three
thousand and twelve now this description
will forever be in the college forever
be in the college database so they can
know about all the students they've ever
had so this will say blah blah blah
about the student okay
now these are connected obviously so
this student ID is the same as this one
so the message is about student the
student with the ID of 3012 now the
thing is you can't have two messages
about the same student because if they
have one about ID 3012 over here what if
this says something different because I
mean if it doesn't say something
different then why do you need to you
don't it's not to be conflicting so this
is a one-to-one one student can have one
message about them one message about
them can go to one student this isn't
going to be students with the IDS of
three thousand twelve thirteen and
fourteen it's just three thousand and
twelve that is a one-to-one relationship
I hope that I hope that makes sense
and like I said by the end of the series
you'll get it because I'm going to make
a sweet database with tons of crappy
information you'll never need and you'll
learn all this I swear okay guys as you
can see we have two tables here we have
classes over here we have teachers over
here there's two classes math and
English there's one teacher Joe now one
class is on the lot that one teacher for
this case I know there's some classes
with multiple teachers but for this
example each class only has one teacher
so Joe is a math teacher but guess what
Joe is also an English teacher you see
that now let's say we have Jim Jim is a
math teacher uh-oh look math has two
teachers that's not allowed
that's because it's a one-to-many one
teacher can have many classes
but many classes but one class can only
have one teacher that's because it's one
but many some may repeat that a teacher
can have multiple classes but a class
can only have one teacher
it's a one-to-many relationship</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
