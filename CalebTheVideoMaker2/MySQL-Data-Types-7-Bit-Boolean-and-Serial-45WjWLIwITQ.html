bit which is our next datatype and then
in parentheses
well many more refer it to to refer to
as M this is a bit value so let's say 12
this allows up to a 12 bit value to be
entered so doing that I'm doing that 2
to the 12th power minus 1 all right let
me just do that on my head real quick
and I think I did my math right in my
head I got 400 4095
all right boolean is very simple it's
the same thing as one where if you don't
know anything about bullying it's
basically true or false
that's all boolean is so a zero entered
into a boolean is equal to false and
then a 1 will be true all right boolean
is very simple it's the same thing as a
tiny hint one where if you don't know
anything about boolean it's basically
true or false
that's all boolean is so a zero entered
into a boolean is equal to false and
then a 1 will be true but for my sequel
basically anything that is not a zero is
true so not 0 0 and if you didn't know
this when you put a little explanation
mark before something for coding it
means not so not 0 equals truth cereal
is the equivalent of a big int unsigned
not a normal auto-increment
unique entry now if you have no idea
what that means that's ok all right so
Stromberg his strength down if you
remember bigint from our earlier videos
basically a huge flippin number so
that's is the big big number unsigned if
you remember that means it's not
negative so just the positive range now
if you watched my last series you'll
know that not null means that there
always has to be an entry because Noor
was nothing so not normal means
something so you have to enter into a
serial if you don't know if that means
let's say you're on a website and that's
a box that has a submit button down here
and the data type is not mole and you
put nothing in there and click Submit
it's not going to work because there's
not an entry in here if you put an entry
like 5 then it will work so then it does
work but it had that as long as has an
entry it's fine
but it can't be it can't be no auto
increment that means it'll automatically
go up by one each entry so if one person
enters and then another person enters
this one will be let's say five and then
this one will be six and then when the
next person comes every seven and so
forth don't keep doing that by itself
now what unique means that just means
that there can't be any other entries
with the same number so six thousands if
there's another one with six thousand
it's just not going to work because it's
not neat it won't let that happen so
this is going to have to be six thousand
one or something other than six thousand
just think of serial as like a serial
number for an item in a store it just
keeps it's a big number because there's
lots of items and its unique because
it's a that's that specific item and it
always has this here
number and so forth alright so um I
covered all of the numeric types and now
we're going to move on to date and time
so stick with me it's gonna be sweet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
