from cable to video maker to this video
we are going to be talking about the
MySQL enum or a new data type now this
is short for enumeration and enumeration
in computer science is a data type where
you can give a list of values and then
whoever uses that enumeration has to
pick one of those values in MySQL this
is considered a character data type we
can list available options for a column
and then whoever uses that database when
they do something like an insert they
are going to have to insert one of those
available values do you remember when we
were talking about integrity a couple
videos ago well this could have been
something added to the integrity list on
how we enforce integrity but I didn't
think of it at the time but this can
enforce integrity by requiring certain
data in a column and it just started
snowing now the secret behind
enumerations is that everything is
actually stored as a number so let's go
through an example and I'll explain how
this all works so let's go to our
bidding website and let's say we can add
an item on there to sell and we select a
condition and there's only so many
options so let's say these are the
available options on our condition
drop-down list and the user gets to
select one of these that is an important
thing when it comes to enumeration is
that they only get to choose one these
are all going to have what's known as an
index and this is not the same kind of
index that a database table would have
where we can index certain columns to
improve speed this kind of index is just
a number so new would have the index of
one two three four and five and note
that the index here starts at one this
is interesting because in a lot of
programming languages the indexes start
at zero and actually this thing does
have an index 0 and that is actually
going to point to an invalid value so
you could say that the index starts at 0
but the actual values that we created
these ones start at 1 so this invalid is
actually going to be stored as an
strain so no data there is also an
option of null so we move this over nor
would be another option and the index is
of course null so here are all of our
options for this data type now it's on
our table this data is stored as numbers
so rather than storing for example here
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 characters we can
store one number and save a lot of space
but the important thing to know is that
when you work with this column it's not
that odd it's not like you're inserting
a number you still insert the string
data and the database does all the work
for you of figuring out what number it's
going to be so a lot of this stuff goes
on behind the scenes working with this
data type is very similar to working
with just a normal string data type like
varchar' or text it's slightly different
when we declare it that's because we
have to give all the available options
but using it isn't a whole lot different
now when you get into more complex
things this kind of stuff will come up
but when you're just working with basic
inserts and selects you don't have to
worry a whole lot about this kind of
stuff going on right here now a lot of
people question the usefulness of the
enum data type that's because a lot of
the stuff you can do with the enum data
type can be done with database design
for example we could create a table
condition and the columns in here could
be ID condition and maybe description
and now in another table we could just
make a column that references an ID an
ID is also just a number so it would
work essentially the same way but we
don't have to work with this confusing
data type there are a lot of other
plusses and downsides to the enum data
type I'm not going to go into all of
them because that's just out of the
scope of this video and most of them are
out of the scope of this entire series
but just look up enum and you will see
there are a lot of hard side saying no
you never want to use enum datatype it's
it's non-standard it's confusing and
it's it's just added complexity and then
the other people who embrace it but I
would say generally more people disagree
with using the enum datatype and prefer
something like data
design and this situation you could
replace this with what's known as a
lookup table I have videos over these so
you can look up I was totally
unintentional you can look up the lookup
table and find my videos now how do you
actually use this data type let's go
over that now within whatever statement
we are working with let's say a create
statement for example and then we put
the data type all you have to do is say
enum and then in parentheses list the
values that are available within single
quotes
so we could say new very good and these
are separated by commas and that's it so
for example if this isn't a creating
table would look like this
or we just have the column and then the
data type and then we end the create
table so once we got that it's good but
how do we insert the data it's very
simple all you got to do is insert a
string and if the string matches one of
these then it will be inserted as that
if it doesn't match then it will be
inserted as an empty string and that's
it very simple so thanks guys for
watching this video hopefully it was
helpful in the next video we are going
to be talking about another data type
that is very similar to enum but it
might be more useful for you in certain
situations so be sure to check that
video out and be sure to click like and
subscribe and as always I'll see you in
the next video I'm going to go this way
