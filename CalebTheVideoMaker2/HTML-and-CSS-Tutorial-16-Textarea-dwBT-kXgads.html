are going to add something else to our
registration page we are going to add a
little area where we can tell a little
bit about ourselves so we have a lot of
content on this page and it's getting
kind of messy so what we can do is to
make it visually more appealing on the
left-hand side of the text by the
numbers there's little minus and plus
signs if you click that it'll hide the
content it's still there you just can't
see it
so it's it's pretty useful like that so
it still looks the same on the web page
and we can actually just close this
entire paragraph whoops man yeah so
there's that entire paragraph which just
asks for our birthday awesome so now we
can add something else and we can
firstly put a paragraph tag and the
paragraph all of our content is going in
paragraphs and just like always we're
going to create a label to associate the
element with the text we give it and so
forth comments actually no sorry let's
go sit in comments about yourself let's
make it mini bio or biography pretty
much that's going what it's going to ask
for now in order to do this we could
give a text box input type equals text
and then when we look at it we could
type in a little bio here but that's
really inconvenient and small and we
can't really see it that well so we can
do is we can give a new type and give it
a text area here's what a text area
looks like like this check it out HTML
code within the text area so we can
create a text area and then we can end
the text area we have to end text area
text area text area text area text area
text area by awesome now we can give the
text area a name we can make it bio so
if any other scripts reference this it
knows that bio is talking about the
information we put right in here so if
we reference bio it's going to take this
content hello my name is Caleb and it's
going to do something with it like put
it on our profile or display it to other
people who are interested in me on my
dating web site I'm working on which I'm
not really working on dating website
what if I did it it would do that yeah
so yeah so that is how you create a text
area you can give it a name wha not but
you can also give it extra content like
rows so let's see what rows don't do we
give it five rows well that gives it
five rows
let's give it six it makes it taller
that's a really big bio area so I'm
going to give it six I think six is good
and you can also give it calls or
columns and let's give it a let's go
fifty boom no too fat let's go thirty
yeah perfect
actually I think would be nice if the
mini bio was on top of it right up here
so I'm going to add a little break right
here that's why the break tag is pretty
awesome so now it looks really good and
we can actually extend it a little bit
farther
let's try 42 tall to farming 36 a little
bit less let's go 34 well that's like
almost perfect awesome so now we um that
is what we can do with that we can also
I think give it a max length such as 200
characters so we can type a lot Hey Dude
what's up I haven't seen you and so yeah
and after a while it will eventually
maybe it might possibly maybe stop I
don't think it's going to stop us all
right let's try see if 10 makes it any
different right so 10 that's a little
easier because it's shorter I don't have
to type six million characters but if
you need to limit it down to like 200
that's definitely possible I'm a naughty
I may have forgot to refresh me that's
what froze what yeah so we can add a max
length and so basically yeah that's the
allowed cut loud this is what is allowed
the name the rows the columns max length
and a lot of other attributes that may
be accessible to other things such as we
can give it an IP if we really wanted to
or anything like that so yeah that is a
text area you may use that in your
future HTML programming or building or
whatever you want to call it so yeah
that's all I really have to say for this
video is pretty short compared to the
others but I don't want to ramble on for
20 minutes but you want to know
something funny real quick I was at work
we had some downtime so I was studying
like you know HTML and PHP and whatnot I
was planning the series and I was so
into it and then like this girl came in
and one of the code one of my co-workers
talked to her so I went back to studying
and I was like so into I didn't even
realize that the person who came in I
was in class with her for like an entire
semester so I felt like an idiot because
I looked right at her and I looked away
and then I was like ah no I knew that
person and I just completely ignored
them and I was like ah so stupid of me
so then when she when she caught came
back
eventually I was like oh sorry for
ignoring you I and then she's like yeah
it's okay that you didn't recognize me I
was like no I recognized you I was just
I was just in in my studies once I get
into my studies I can't get out and I
just don't care I'm sorry
and I felt like a total idiot so yeah
that's my rambling session that's all I
have to say so I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
