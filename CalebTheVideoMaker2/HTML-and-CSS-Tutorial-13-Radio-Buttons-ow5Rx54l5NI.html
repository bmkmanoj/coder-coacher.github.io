wanted to explain the forum a little bit
more because I filled my directions and
my explanation was a little bit rough in
the last video especially with these new
tags
alright so to make things clearer the
forum action is where the content we
type in goes so it goes to this page
right here the PHP script takes that
data and does something with it
the method is how it does it obviously I
didn't put anything here because you
don't even know what the what it means
yet but a method is post and a method is
get so that's PHP concepts which we
don't need to get into that because this
isn't a pH pH tour tutorial field set
and legend these are not even required
for the forum they just look cool
because we get this cool box with the
title here so if I get rid of these
maybe that'll make things a little bit
easier and then we can add them later if
we so desire so now we get this crappy
looking script but it works does the
same thing alright so you may be
wondering all right what about this
label thing right here it's kind of
pointless if you ask me because if you
delete it oh it looks the same well the
point of the label is it tells PHT ml
that this text right here is associated
with this input box so it tells it tells
HTML that this text is related to his
input box which somehow gives better
performance I don't know the details so
that's what the label does this is the
label for the input box so I guess we
could get rid of this if they really
wanted to and boom we just have an input
box we don't know what it is but by
adding a label it's saying anything
within this label and this label are
connected so the user name and the input
box I'm saying enter your username text
and the input box
that's why we have one for the password
and as we don't really need one for this
bit so that's pretty much all for that
but I want to get into a new type of
input which is called radio buttons you
type that out these things are actually
pretty cool if you've never seen them
they look like little circles that you
can select one or the other and so forth
so just like always I'm going to create
a paragraph tag and end the paragraph
tag okay so within these paragraph tags
I'm going to make a new type of label
this one's a little different so I'm
going to make one for your sex like
frequently it once and I'm just kidding
like like boy or girl so this is saying
the label for the sex radio buttons so
you know that this is connected to in
some way so we say sex and then we end
the label why do we end the label here
instead of afterwards well there's
actually going to be multiple inputs
here so what we do is we go input type
equals radio and then name equals sex
value equals now and then we end the
input so this is what it looks like
sex check and then what we can do is
we're gonna put male right afterwards
male and then what we can do is do that
again and put type equals radio name
equal sex
so this is what we get now male and
female and what if you notice you click
one and the other one is unchecked
how does HTML know to do that well that
is because the name here are the same
for both of these so for example if I
change this to sex 1 guess what I can
check both of these because they're no
longer grouped together in any way the
only thing that's keeping them together
is nothing exactly so if we put them as
the same name HTML knows that you can
only select one that's the idea of radio
buttons if you need to check both of
them well we will get into that in an
upcoming video with checkboxes but for
now this is for selecting one and only
one so this this label is for the sex
radio buttons and I put sex and then we
end the label it's basically saying
there's a label here for these two
options right so if the label crap is
confusing you and you need to you can
delete it for now and once you're
getting used to HTML add it back in but
for now you can just copy my code if you
need to and then you can figure it out
later but we could actually do something
else like add a third one of these and
that would give us another option which
you can still only check one that's
because they all have the name sex so
that is all I really have to say about
radio buttons we will we will change
this sign-in page into a registration
page so let's go oh I also want to add
back in that other stuff so let's see we
need to add in the via the field set
sorry I stutter all the time
and the legend registered you can take
the stuff out keep it out if you need
now we have a cool form here and we get
rid of this top register J and also I'm
going to take this submit button I'm
gonna move it down to the bottom alright
now let's do a little cleaning here see
this paragraph tag should line up these
get rid of the radio buttons button text
I mean alright I think it's starting to
look pretty nice everything's clear if
you need to you can comment this stuff
out if you need to go check out my
commenting video check that one out but
that's all I have to say about radio
buttons and in the next video we will be
getting into something new so be sure to
check it out because it's gonna be
awesome
and if you're not there you're lame so
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
