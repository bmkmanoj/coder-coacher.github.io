do everything to configure manage
control all of your websites over here
is all the important stuff right the
domains or the web address as you own so
you can click it and click manage
domains you can see we already have our
domain on here and it is processing if
you set a little clock right there you
can close domains and go to goodies and
you can find MySQL databases here is
where you're going to create your
database that's going to power the
backend of your website that in addition
to PHP allows you to make dynamic really
cool websites so the first thing you're
going to want to do is put a database
name so we're just gonna put PHP MySQL
tutorial host name yep that looks great
then you're going to want to create a
username I'm making all these very
similar so if you want some more
security
you can mix things up but I'm just
keeping it simple for the tutorial
you're going to want to take note of all
of these things so we have a database
name a host name a user name of an
account that can access the database in
the password for that user name you're
going to need these later and why not
I'm just gonna put the password in here
so I don't forget talk about really high
level security add the database and
there you go now that that's done we can
go check on our domain as you can see
that is still processing so in the
meantime maybe I can teach you guys some
other stuff the first thing is that you
can actually add new subdomains here so
if you want to add another website and
you want to use the free subdomain you
can just put it right here this is going
to allow you to create another website
if you need just so you guys know that
way if you want to try some other things
you don't have to erase your old website
I think that's good for now we will
continue in the next video so that's the
username and password what about this
host well there's two options here
either the web address of the website so
you could be like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
