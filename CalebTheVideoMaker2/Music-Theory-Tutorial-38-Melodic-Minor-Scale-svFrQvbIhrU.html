learn is the melodic minor scale
melodic minor now if you remember the
natural minor starting on a this is an a
originally start up here but I moved it
down we used all of the Black Keys or
basically no sharps or flats so this is
a natural minor scale well a melodic
minor we'll take these two notes and
sharp raise them a half step so now we
get I think it's whole oops I was really
bad whole half whole whole whole whole
half let's see this is a a 2 B is a
whole step B to C is a half step C to D
whole step D to what is this every c d e
whole step e to F sharp whole step F
sharp to G sharp whole step and then G
sharp to F I mean a sorry is a half step
so this is the pattern for a melodic
minor scale right here but there's one
exception when you're going downhill or
descending going back down the scale so
we go downwards once we get to their top
it's different and I'm going to erase
this and show you what it's like when we
go downwards we take those sharp notes
so we let's say we're over here where
that a was and then the next note it was
originally sharp well now we're gonna
take it and put it back into its natural
state
right and then we're going to do that
for the next note ooh whoops that was
horrible sharp flats natural sign well
that's a natural son and then we keep
going down until we reach a so basically
what we did is we sharp them on the way
up or rose them raise them
half step and then our way back down we
flattened them and this is the same
descending pattern as a natural minor
scale because if these are in the
natural by the way when I said we
flattened them flatten them down back to
their natural state not put them in flat
they're not flat they're not they're not
like this with a flat sign we took they
were sharp and we flattened them which
means we lowered them a half step I
should have said we put them in the
natural state it would have made more
sense but anyways we rose them half-step
the seventh the sixth and seventh note
of the scale on our way up and on our
way back down we put them in their
natural state so if you notice these are
all natural notes that means this is the
same pattern for a natural minor scale
so on our way up it's the equivalent of
a melodic whole half whole whole whole
whole half but our way down it goes back
to the natural minor scale so oops
here's a picture of it we started at a
moved up to B C D E oops a sharp G sharp
a then we flat met gosh dang we natural
we put this back in the natural state
here and then we kept going and then
it's the same as the natural minor which
is very cool because you already know
the natural minor from previous videos
so if we were to recreate the natural
minor with you remember the pattern it
was I don't even think I remember it was
a whole half whole whole half whole half
I think let me check that
Sorry Sorry
Oh half oh oh oh sorry yeah my bad
this is a hole not a half this is the
pattern for the natural minor scale so
we travel this pattern up and then on
our way down we take this scale but
reverse it because we're descending so
it would be whole half Oh basically a
natural minor flipped around because
we're descending we don't we don't
follow the same pattern they sending and
descending we flip it so it sounds the
same I'll show you what I mean
Oh half cool cool half cool cool
now we flip it so I'm saying so for a
natural minor scale furrow sorry that
hurt a melodic minor scale it sounds
like this probably I screw this up
so I sharp I Rose these two notes a half
step because this would be natural
this is harmonic or sorry I melodic so
those are three types of minor scales
you should be familiar with I'm sure
there's more out there but that's all
we're going to learn for now and in the
next video we're going to be getting on
to something super awesome so I better
see you there
and thank you for watching be sure to
