you're still with me this video is gonna
be awesome alright so basically I'm
going to be teaching you how to start
when you're first making a database so
where to move start if you couldn't read
that that is what I'm going to be
teaching you very first thing I usually
do I find what the database will be used
for so for my example that I'll be
teaching you
it's for college so this is all about a
college to the database now you find
everything you want to store in this
database or basically anything you need
stored and you can store it that's what
a database is for it's awesome I made up
a sweet list of things I want to school
I don't know if you can see this or not
it's a ton of crap all right
College I mean got the address of
students that is classes offered
professors and their classes students in
their classes student ID students name
address birthday major minor hair color
dogs names students relationship status
best friend's name best friend's address
best friends house color dog's name
birthday students best friends school
major minor favorite color students
email accounts students favorites books
favorite books books author books number
of pages books topic genre publisher
city of publication that's a lot boom
check that out here's everything I want
listed in this database now I know
that's like impossible to read ok the
very first thing first normal form get
rid of anything that's an almond tonic
now first look at this I can see major
and minor that's two things one column
so what you would do is break that up so
anything else it's best friend major and
minor that's something that's no atomic
mmm what else
students emails that is non-atomic that
is because that lists more than one and
that is bad these are two things that
you would list this could be a list of
unlimited because you don't know address
here's another one professors and their
classes that's a little confusing I'm
gonna just star these and now that will
come a lot easier once we look at
relations see birthday that's a date
which is like month/day/year but I like
to keep the dates together and most
people do because there's functions that
can help with times and dates very
easily and it's just a pain in the butt
to have all the extra spots that is one
of them things where the normalization
it's up to you what you want to do one
thing that I see about this database
that is actually good believe you're not
is we do not have any repeated columns
of information an example of this would
be students emails one student email two
student email three student email four
that's horrible design and if you see
that or you do that stop don't do that
all right so now so where to go from
here it's kind of it's kind of iffy
because it's such a huge unorganized
data hopefully like when you start this
you automatically know not to do things
like this and to break them up because
that'll automatically save some time and
effort that's why it's very good to
learn these normal forms before you get
into a huge database and then you're
just like whoa okay the next logical
thing to do would put things would be to
put things in tables of related data now
when you do this it may not be the end
result because this just helps you
organize it for the each form and when
you get farther in the forms it cleans
itself up so if you see me put something
in here wrong and you know don't be like
wrong
you suck because it'll change so first
thing you find what's very similar okay
you see here we have a student ID that's
a very good that could be a primary key
it's good that they have this in here so
we can make this a table so
score this name address birthday
major/minor hair color dog's name
relationship status favorite book that
can all go in one table so I'm actually
gonna do this down here save book
staying for favorite so this can all be
a table and then we can have a favorite
book table which I don't need you to
race to that let's make it a book table
book so now you're running there and why
did that's because these are all having
to do with a book so I'll put these in
here together and now I'm see best
friend's name and then address these are
all to the best friend because we
where'd have a listener here so this all
goes to the best friend I have no idea
why that color is there was that on my
list I don't see it I don't know what
that something's gonna here is that so
now we can sort of make a table for the
best friend I mean this is just logical
there's no walls against there I mean
laws to follow so now I sort of have
three tables and then this should go
over here so I'm just going to erase it
and move it over there fit it in here
emails sweet so now we have three tables
and then two extra things this is
probably where I would go on a computer
because this is manageable on a computer
like at first I'll get all the
information and sort of organize it in
my head and then I would go on a
computer to finish it and when I say go
on the computer that doesn't mean that's
all I do on the computer I'll come back
out I'll be drawing things you want to
see my notes
it's over databases how designed them
and then working with the databases
especially this one because I've worked
through this a little bit I haven't
finished it but I started getting
working with it to see if it seemed
possible and obviously it is if you just
follow the forms so I'll see you in the
next video and I'll be teaching you how
to install a program called MySQL
workbench it's an example of an ERD
thank you for staying with me and you I
hope that you finish this series thanks
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
