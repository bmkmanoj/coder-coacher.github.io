the video Minato wouldn't spit we're
talking about referential integrity okay
so yeah let's just think about this if
we didn't have referential integrity
what horrible horrible things are gonna
happen with our database so you go
through the database normalization you
break your tables up and all that good
stuff but then the problem is you don't
go through the effort to make foreign
keys and you just hope that everyone's
going to use your database correctly or
you say oh well the software is going to
use the database correctly you are
setting yourself up for failure or a
miserable life or death or both
wait that's three things okay anyways
let's go through an example so I gave
you this example a little bit ago let's
say you have a users and you have
members now one specific user has the
IDS of one now there's three types of
memberships one is going to be bronze to
silver and three gold
well this user is going to reference one
of the memberships so let's say this
user puts a four
the problem is there is no membership
with that ID so this is literally
pointing to nothing with foreign keys
this kind of thing can not happen and
that's what referential integrity is all
of our references have integrity when
you look at this here without any kind
of references or without this membership
table you can be assured that that for
reference is something it has integrity
you get rid of a foreign key now you've
got problems and you don't want problems
so make sure you use foreign keys
foreign keys are gonna be like no bro
you can't use a four because that
doesn't exist over here so that whole
concept is called a referential
constraint a constraint restricts the
data to certain values specifically
values that exist over here as the
primary heaps if that's the call and
we're referencing so if this column
references here
well now we're only allowed to use one
two or three but that's not all
referential constraints do referential
constraints also dictate what happens
when you go and delete data for example
if this here was a three
what happens if we went and just deleted
this row do you know what happens what
is db2 going to say honestly I have no
idea what it's going to say but I do
know that it's going to not let you I
think
anyways the three cannot be deleted
because we have a child referencing it
these kinds of rules can be configured
when you create referential constraints
so when you make a foreign key there are
some default rules that are applied to
your references but you can configure
those specifically there's two kinds of
referential constraints there's own
update constraints and on delete
constraints so when you make a foreign
key if you created this column as a
foreign key I have code examples of how
to do that on my website that is going
to configure the on update to do
something and the on delete to do
something so both of these are packaged
inside of a foreign key so it's not like
you have to make a foreign key for the
updating and a foreign key for the
deleting you just make one foreign key
and then you can do all this stuff
inside of that so this example of
deleting this 3 refers specifically to
this delete what happens when we delete
the same thing happens with an update
what happens if we change to this 3 to a
4 which generally primary keys should
never change but that's a sides point
the on update is going to kick in this
what happens to this value over here you
see I'm saying for example it could
update it
that would be cascading there are some
specific options that I'm going to talk
about so let's do that now so once again
the two categories were on update and on
delete there actually is a third one on
insert which I actually described
already I just didn't give it a
definition so when you insert data it
verifies that there is a parent with
that value so if you remember the user
ID had to reference a membership ID so
there's on insert on update on delete
now let's talk a little bit more
specifically about let's go with on
delete a lot of these things are going
to apply to the other one so you can
kind of move these around but let's
start with on delete and it'll make a
lot of sense because that one's the most
easy to think about so the first option
is restrict slash no action so these are
two separate ones there is a minor
difference
if you want to know you can look it up
but it's over my head so I'm just gonna
move on essentially these do basically
the same thing if you try to delete a
parent when on delete is set to restrict
it's only going to let you delete that
parent if there's no child referencing
it so if you have an entity here and
it's not referenced by anything and then
you try to delete that row it will let
you but if you have another entity down
here this would be the child and it
references this entity well now it's not
going to let you because it's saying hey
you can't delete this entity because
it's being referenced so it would say
nope can't delete that row you could
delete this row though because it's not
being referenced by anything the other
option is cascade this is one of the
most dangerous things of all time so be
warned if you want to lose your job make
sure you use cascade essentially with
cascade is if you delete this parent
it's going to delete any children that
reference it the problem is you don't
always know everything that's being
referenced by everything so you might
delete something intending just to make
a minor change and that might cascade
through your database deleting all kinds
of important information you know the
last option is setting off and what this
will do is it will set this reference to
null when we delete the parent so if we
have columns you know like let's say
it's in the user table so we have a
membership ID and let's say this value
is 1 and this value is 1 well over in
the membership table if we deleted the
row with this ID in the user table this
would just be replaced with another user
table this show up as this now this is
OK if you allow orphaned children so
this is called an orphan row this right
here
in some situations it's appropriate to
have orphaned rows other times it's not
that's a decision that is going to be up
to you or your boss or someone else you
know so make sure you're careful to
understand how your tables are going to
be used does it make sense for a user to
not have a membership well maybe they
signed up and you know they got rid of
their membership and they still have an
account
they just can't use any of the stuff
well then it would make sense to allow
nulls here and you might set it to set
null when you delete otherwise you might
set it to restrict if you don't want
morphe intros now if you don't want
nulls and this ever then you're going to
want to set this foreign key is not null
and this is basically saying this child
has to have a parent for that column
that's a summary for on delete you can
apply it essentially the same way to on
update but now you guys just get an
overview of how the referential
integrity works in different ways you
can configure it thank you guys for
watching hopefully that gave you a great
introduction to referential integrity
the next video is going to be talking
about a new type of integrity so be sure
to check that out unless you're super
lame and in that case you should check
it out anyways because you need to learn
the material so please be sure to check
that out subscribe like the videos and
check the descriptions for some useful
links to download db2 and to check out
my website thank you and I'll see you in
the next video peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
