design video series in the last video we
talked about one-to-many relationships
the video about that we talked about
one-to-one relationships well now we're
talking about the third possibility of
relationships and that is many-to-many
relationships so when I think of
many-to-many relationships I like to
think of a polygamous marriage where
multiple husbands can have multiple
wives and multiple wives can have
multiple husbands I like to draw this
out so you can kind of understand what
this would be like we have the king
right here right so let's say he's a
king and he decides to marry three women
it's kind of make them real quick hey
this guy's why do you need three wives
come on all that it never go so this guy
is married to these three women right
and then he's very protective but then
he decides all of what the heck they can
marry different men if they want who
really cares so this girl marries this
other guy right so now she's married to
two people right what's wrong with her
only the King can do that well not now
because it's a one-to-many relationship
one king can marry multiple women and
one woman can marry multiple men so this
guy is married to this girl and this
girl's married to this guy over here and
this guy's married to this girl over
here so sally is married to two Jim who
is also married to this girl over here
let's see if I can roll in here and this
girl surprisingly is married to this guy
she's married to Kathy who is also
married to Jim
and by the way Jim is married to the
second wife of the king who the king is
also married in this girl over here and
you see well it gets very complex very
quickly that is an example of a
many-to-many relationship now obviously
you're not going to be storing like
stuff like this in a database so let me
think a practical example real quick I
can think of a college specifically a
class and an instructor all right
absolutely let's think of a class and a
student so here's a class and here is a
student okay now one class how many
students can be in a class multiple you
know that so we can have multiple
students in this class let's draw boxes
for quicker so let's say all these boxes
are students a class can have multiple
students well not only that but a
student can take multiple classes so
this student can take this class and
this class can be taken also by that
student and this student over here and
this student can take another class
which can have this guy in it and this
guy and this guy can be in this class as
well and by the way he is all helped
shoot a drama truck he is also taking
another class so he's in that class
which has that student and that student
and it just gets very complex so you can
see this might be very very difficult to
store within a relational database and
there are reasons we actually can't
store this in a relational database you
may be thinking well what if you need to
store the classes that a student is
taking in this students within a class
we will be talking about in the up that
in the upcoming videos with solving many
to many problems many to many
relationships do not work in a
relational database the only two that
will work is a one to one and a one
too many relationship but this is just
the concept you think of a concept of a
many-to-many relationship think of a
class in a student class can take many
it can have many students and a student
can take many classes so yeah peace out
check out in the next video I mean I'm
not going to check you out that's that's
creepy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
