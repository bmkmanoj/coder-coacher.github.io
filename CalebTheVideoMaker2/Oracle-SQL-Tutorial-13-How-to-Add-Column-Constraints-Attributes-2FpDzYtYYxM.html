SQL developer tutorial and where we left
off in the last oracle SQL developer
tutorial was we were creating a table
and we basically set up the structure
but we haven't done anything with it
just to prove to you that it works let's
run it oh I actually didn't run that
ahead of time so I was hoping it would
work okay so it's created but let's say
you want to go back here and you know
change something maybe you want this to
be called user underscore name well this
is gonna cause an issue because when we
run it it says oh this already is used
so how do you get around that well as
you get into some more advanced SQL
commands you can actually edit tables
that already exist that's probably the
recommended way once you really get into
things but when you're just learning you
can actually just delete this table and
then create a new one so to do that I'm
gonna go up here and space this down I'm
gonna use the command drop table and
then put the tables name now please
don't try this at work okay let's run it
alright so looking down here at our
results we see table users drop table
users created so you can see I actually
ran two commands at once and the way I
did that was using this semicolon this
is known as a delimiter it's the way we
tell Oracle that what comes before is a
command and what comes after is a
command if we had more commands we could
put a delimiter here and keep writing
come on of all times now that we have
the ability to drop the table and re-add
it we can reconsider the table structure
now once you actually have data in your
table you're not going to want to do
this because it's going to delete all
the data and start you fresh but for now
since we're just learning it's totally
okay the rest of this video is going to
focus on constraints and just for
simplicity sake I'm going to get rid of
some of these columns just so we can
focus on what's really important so
right now we're just creating a table
with one column and all it is is a user
ID
with the data-type number now if we want
to add a constraint to this we can just
put a space and then put whatever the
constraint name is so we can say not
null that is an example of a constraint
and that one is going to force every
single row to have a value for the user
ID but what if you want to add another
constraint for example what if we want
to make this user ID unique well it's
simple you just put a space and you put
unique and there's actually not even any
kind of order that you have to put these
in you could make it unique not null
that's totally up to you
now when you throw constraints in after
the column like this a lot of people
call these attributes so these are
attributes of the column and in this
situation we are applying the not null
and the unique attribute to the user ID
well this might be a good candidate for
a primary key because primary keys are
always not null and they're always
unique so if we didn't want to do it
this way we could make it a primary key
but just let's try it make sure it works
and you can see no errors are thrown it
works great and we can go over here to
our database open it click tables scroll
down to find our table ignore all these
random tables that I was working with
double-click users and you can see that
we're forcing it to not be null and it
has to be unique so that's kind of a way
you can look at a table and see what
constraints they have let's go back
though instead of having the not null
and unique constraint I'm going to make
this a primary key and it's super easy
all you got to do is say primary key
that's it there we go there's another
attribute you might want to use for some
columns that's default now I'm not going
to give the primary key a default
because primary keys by definition are
all supposed to be unique so if we
defaulted to a value like 12 we that
would be stupid because then multiple
rows would be trying to insert the value
12 so we're gonna create a new column
I'm going to name this account balance
and you can just imagine this being for
some kind of website that you have to
pay money or something it doesn't really
matter and we're gonna make this number
as well and then we're gonna set a deep
fault to zero so by default the person
has no money in their account this is a
good column to add the default attribute
to and you can see when we run this it
should work awesome I confess as I was
studying constraints I went to the
Oracle Docs page and I noticed that
default is not one of the constraints
listed here
and if you go back to this and go to
your table and do it refresh it doesn't
show up as a constraint either I'm not
entirely sure why because it seems to
work the same way my first guess is that
it's not a constraint because it doesn't
actually prevent you from putting any
certain kind of data in all it does is
help you put data in in case there's no
data put in if that makes any sense at
all but I'm not sure so if anybody knows
maybe you could shed some light on that
and let me know in the comments what
we've done in this video is actually
really cool but some people like to name
their constraints they want to be able
to reference a specific constraint by
name now when you do this you actually
get a default name if you go back to
this table here you can see that this is
the constraint name but that's not very
user friendly so you can actually give
it a name yourself with the way we have
things set up here we can't do that so
in the next video I'm going to be
teaching you how to create named
constraints be sure to check that out
and if you love these videos please be
sure to subscribe and share them with
everybody in the entire world thanks
guys and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
