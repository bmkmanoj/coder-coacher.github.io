ear training / transcribing is pretty
much over I just want to add a little
bit of extra stuff so basically once you
got the skill down you may be asked to
accompany somebody so let me try and
spell this as you guys probably know I
can't spell company I believe that's
correct probably not well that's
basically when you a play with somebody
else to make music so so it may be for a
play it may be for a little musical of
kindergarten singers or Broadway it
doesn't really matter but that's what
the company is now a lot with a lot of
times on this happens I get a different
market here you will get very limited or
no extra music or anything to help you
accompany them they'll just be like hey
could you play some music with my kids
here in this play here I got no music or
nothing in here so just play here with
whatever you have in your brain just use
your musical theory talent to magically
pull the song out of your brain that's
pretty much what people will do so
oftentimes you won't get very much help
but get anything you possibly can from
whoever can help you get this
information certain chords or a trumpet
part or something for a certain song
that can help you figure out how to
accompany somebody so look at you may
get a lead sheet and i don't know if i
should have red and green together for
like colorblind people so yeah when you
race thread so lead sheet or you could
have a chord sheet a lead sheet will
just have like lyrics like with little
dash between them to represent time and
then have like a G over it or a c7 or a
a flat anything like that that's what I
lychee looks like chord sheet is usually
it'll have the tablature of how to form
a cord or it will just tell you what
chords to play another thing you can do
is look at the melody and try to figure
out what chords will fit it so
example if you start on C that's
automatically a good sign that you're in
the C major scale which means common
chords will be G I mean see gee maybe g7
so for they can go through the C major
chord progression figure out what courts
can fit with what notes and also you may
just be able to like let's say see eg is
the formation of a C chord so any of
these notes will probably sound good
with that cord whoopsies I just got
marker all over my white pants oh well
so if you don't have anything you can
use your ear training skills use those
different techniques such as listening
to the rhythm figuring out the key
figuring out the notes figuring out the
intervals the pitches learning all of
that and putting it all together to use
ear training of let's say then
performing you can record it listen to
it try to figure out what notes are
being played and what scale somebody is
in you could use that to master your
skills in that area now I would not
recommend just taking the melody and
following along note by note on a piano
or guitar or whatever because that's not
really a company that's pretty much just
playing the same exact thing they're
doing and it's typically boring and
frowned upon so it's best recommend to
play chords that fit the Harmony I mean
the melody obviously play a harmony that
fits the melody and just as a reminder
for courts there are three types I mean
there's probably more types but three
types we really want ever block rhythm
appreciate it block is just like
basically every either every four beats
or every two beats just switch chords
don't do anything fancy or you could
take that chord put it into a fancy
rhythm probably not that fancy because
it sounded crappy and people will be
like what's going on bien another way is
arpeggiated which breaks up the notes so
you could have see
see followed by es c and e see eg see
you d let's see that's an arpeggiated
chord or I'm gonna cough here I'm sorry
or you could break it up in fancy ways
such as see eg ec without having on
multiple notes being played at once
Orion going fancier and go cg e c and go
different notes within the cord don't
play them in 135 31 order go 1535 135 or
whatever in a quick pattern before you
switch chords make sense so yeah that's
basis of accompanying I'm not going into
huge death because I'm not a pro a
company I've never really even done it
ma made maybe a little but yeah that's
all that's save on a company so I will
