cleaning process and we're talking about
missing values and specifically we're
going to go through a process called
imputation now this is kind of cool and
interesting that's for sure imputation
is the process where you take nulls and
you replace them with a pretty good
value to use instead of null so it's
kind of like you don't want to get rid
of this feature but you don't want to
have a bunch of nulls so you replace the
nulls with something that would still be
okay
it's kind of weird cuz I being in like
database development and programming I
just feel like you shouldn't be able to
do that like this person's null here so
I'm just gonna change it it seems really
odd to me but the reason we're allowed
to do these things is because we're not
doing this to change our data remember
that okay
we're not trying to change our data we
are trying to change our model for
reality if reality is most people have
values for this but our data set tells
us that most people don't that is not a
good model of reality so we take that
data set and we are going to convert it
to a more realistic data set that
represents reality better so we have a
null how do you know what to replace it
with typically you're going to replace
it with a measure of central tendency
which I did a video on I told you that
would be important so what would we do
for example let's say we take every null
and we replace it with the meet what
that does is it looks at all of our data
and it stays generally the same but now
we don't have a lot of nulls and because
we used one of the measures of central
tendency the making of the data didn't
change a whole lot for example if the
mean was like 10 and we made all nulls
20 well that's going to pull the mean
closer to 20 so we want to make sure
we're not skewing our data so we do
something such as using the
so rather than replacing knowles with 20
we replaced him with ten and what that
does is it keeps everything centered at
ten Fabian said it is still a little bit
dangerous for example if we make a lot
of nulls the mean well that'll actually
change some of the other central
tendencies so for example the mode will
change if we make you know 20% of our
rows where they have nulls and we change
that features value to the mean well
that might actually change the mode to
be the mean because now 20% of our row
actually has the mean value and it might
change from some other value to the mean
that's just a minor example when it
probably wouldn't be that big of a deal
but I just want to point something out
here is that you have to find a very
balanced balance and I'm sure this is an
area of controversy because if you think
about what I mentioned earlier having a
data set that doesn't really represent
reality and changing it to a wrapper to
represent reality better well maybe by
changing it we're doing the opposite and
making it not represent reality oh you
see what I'm saying
so I would say stick in the middle a
little bit change some to make our data
cleaner but don't change it so much that
we have this quasi reality that really
isn't realistic at all see what I'm
saying exactly it's what it's hoping
you'd say that so for each of these data
cleaning techniques you got to be very
careful you don't overdo it it's kind of
like makeup right we're taking something
that's hideous we're adding a little bit
of makeup just to you know complement
complement the eyes and stuff but if we
do too much we turn something hideous
into a monster with just a little bit of
changes you know we can make it make it
look okay so that's how you should
approach cleaning your data gosh that
was a beautiful illustration
I love it alright that's all I got for
data cleaning when it comes to nulls in
the next video we're going to be talking
about data cleaning but for a different
issue so please be sure to check that
out and be sure to subscribe thank you
and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
