encryption and I will be speaking of
one-way encryption for this here are
three examples of functions that are
used for one-way encryption tagging your
back to functions but that's okay I
guess we just have to do this basically
what this will do is you submit a string
within these print parentheses as an
argument so I can say my password is
password because you know everybody's
passwords password rich so here is our
entry so um this will take password put
it through this magical converter box so
it's going to take password and it's
going to submit a 40-watt depends this
is going to submit a representation of
the original data so now we have what is
called a hash so outcome the hash that's
H a sh so for example if we use the
sha-1 um one-way encryption function
this is going to return a 40 character
representation or original data so we
may get a two six v49 a for like 40
characters long and the only way to
figure out if somebody's password is
correct is to put the submitted password
in this through this converter box which
is actually the function so here insert
itself sha-1 so now if somebody puts in
password with two DS their 40 character
code is not going to match mine
it may be B 6 4 3 dot dot dot dot for 40
characters but it's not the same as mine
the only way it's going to match mine is
if they submit the original same so the
input must match my input for the
outputs to equal the same but on this is
different between too weak cut
encryption because you cannot retrieve
the data back once once we have this
this conversion once we have a sorry
once we have this
last year we can't put it back into the
box and get the original password it's a
secret to whoever created the password
that's why that may be why when you sign
up for websites and you try and change
your password and you have it like a
sent an email to yourself it doesn't
tell you your original password it just
tells you to change your password and it
gives you permission to change your
password where some places actually give
you your original password one may be
using one-way encryption where one may
be where the other may be using two-way
encryption so that's just an example of
this so it still works for encryption
it's just you can't see because you can
say my passwords hash is equal to the
submitted passwords hash here we have a
imaginary database here and it has our
stored password hashed which basically
means it's been through the conversion
box or aka the function so now we have a
be 6 3 9 1 for 40 characters and down
here we have a website and it says
username password so here my user name
is Caleb curry my password is password
no no let's make it pizza because I like
pizza so we put the user name in Caleb
curry
I put the password in pizza now you'll
when we submit it with this little
submit file and it's going to take this
to a PHP script what you're going to
have to worry about this and this PHP
script because we're not learning PHP
that's programming language which is
server-side if you know if you know what
that means that means the person on the
website does not have access to the
script only the person on the computer
where the server is has access to it so
on this PHP script we'll see it will
convert it to a hashed format and see if
it matches the stored hashed format
so if pizza is used with the bomb the
function and it's not equal to this you
don't get access but if it's equal to
this or if it's the same as this then
you get access and go under your website
so that is the basics of how passwords
work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
