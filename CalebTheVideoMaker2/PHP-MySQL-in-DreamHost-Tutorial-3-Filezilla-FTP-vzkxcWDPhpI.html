going to continue our installation of
PHP and MySQL and DreamHost
so let's do a little overview go to
domains manage domains here you can see
that we have PHP MySQL tutorial Dream
hosters com whoo it's a mouthful all
this stuff we're doing in this series
should work with just a regular domain
so you don't have to have dot Dream
hoisters so if you want to register a
new domain that's perfectly fine in fact
I think you get the first year free so
that's a good motivation to go and do
that but that's not the topic of this
video so this video we're actually going
to be talking about FTP so what is FTP
well you actually see FTP right here and
here it's what's known as File Transfer
Protocol it's a way to transfer files to
and from your website or the server so
if you click web FTP it's going to open
a page that looks like this and this
will allow you to connect to your
website through the browser and it'll
allow you to upload files and download
files etc but I think there is a
preferred way and that's using an
application you actually download so
there's tons and tons of FTP clients but
one of the most popular ones is known as
FileZilla the way you get FileZilla is
by going to FileZilla slash project
org and then you can download it and
once you get that downloaded it'll look
something like this
awesome so up here is where you put your
credentials to sign in to your website
and once you get all of that in you'll
be able to see all of the files that are
on that server right here so we need to
figure out the host username and
password so I'm going to teach you guys
how to do that in this video when you go
back to your dream host panel you can
see on your domain it says user kalcker
to and yours will be a different user
when you register you actually get an
email saying hey here's your FTP user
and it contains your username and your
password and all that goodies but if for
any reason you want to do everything
through the dream
portal what you do is you scroll down
and go to users manage users and you can
see here we have caliper two and you can
actually click Edit and then you can
scroll down and you can actually assign
a password to this user that way you
don't have to worry about forgetting
your password that's a bunch of random
characters and there's also some user
permissions up here so if you want to
allow SSH your secure shell you can do
that here but FTP is fine for me when
you assign this user a new password
you're going to need to give it five or
ten minutes for the changes to take
effect or alternatively you can just go
into your email and get the email that
has the user name and password so let's
go back to FileZilla so that's the user
name and password
what about this host well there's two
options here either the web address of
the website so you could be like or the
server name for dream host so if we go
back to dream host and we can go back to
users and it'll say machine Aqueduct so
what we need to do is go back to FTP
input Aqueduct dot dreamhost.com and
notice that this is dream host not dream
hosters com and what you can do is click
quick connect and the reason I clicked
quick connect before I put in a username
and password is to make sure that we
actually are able to connect to that
destination so if you look on this log
here says connecting to that IP address
connection established so it's working
all we need to do is make sure we get
the right username and password boom
there you go so these are all the files
on the server that are available to our
user and this is where all of the
website files are located so you can
open that by double-clicking it on the
right side these are all of the files
that are on the server so our website
these on the left side are all of the
files on our machine so think your
laptop the way you download something
is by double-clicking it and you can see
there are some stuff that popped down
here on the queued files well you can
see that there's a failed transfers and
a successful transfers so you always
want to make sure to check whether your
files transferred successfully now
obviously if you download them and you
see them pop up over here it's great but
if you're uploading like a huge mass of
files and then you forget to check that
there might be failed transfers your
website might not work the way you
expect it to so always make sure you
check that the way you upload is the
same thing you just double click and in
this case that file already exists on
the server so yeah you can just click
overwrite that's fine so how do you
create a file you can right click and
click create new file so I could say
index dot PHP and then you can
right-click and view / edit that's going
to open it in your default text editor
and then you can go in here and type in
your PHP you can save that and you can
see when you go back to FileZilla it
will prompt you to upload your file back
to the server and you always want to
make sure you check that because it's
super super important and you want to
click yes if you want to upload it and
the reason that's so important is
because you might go in here change some
files and save it but then you might
forget to go back to FileZilla and
upload it and then when you go to your
website nothing's working the way your
changes are supposed to work that's
because you only change the files
locally so when you're in FileZilla and
you right click edit it basically
downloads that file onto your local
machine and then when you edit it you
have to re-upload it back to the server
so yeah guys I think that's a good
summary of FileZilla and FTP that will
give you the foundation you did to
transfer files to and from your website
piece alright so here's what we want
we're going to create a table named
tutorials and it's gonna have two
columns one is the ID and the other one
is the title now the ID is just an
automatically generated
that is just for the databases use
that's why it's labeled as the primary
key down here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
