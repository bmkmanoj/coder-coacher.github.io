to this video we are going to discuss
third normal form now make sure you
watch the previous two videos because
these build upon each other in order to
be in third normal form you have to
first be in second normal form in order
to be in second normal form you have to
first be in first normal form so it's
kind of like this chain third normal
form is going to be the most strict
that's because second normal form and
first normal form have to be done and
it's going to have some of its own rules
so let's talk about those once again
this brings up the concept of
dependencies we discussed dependencies
in the last video and a couple of other
videos but essentially when you have a
column that column depends on the
primary key so on our bidding selling
website let's say we have a listing
stable and inside of this table we're
going to have the primary key of listing
ID we'll also have some other data we
might have a price and a category and
we'll also say what that category is
about so we have a category description
and that's going to describe the
category you could also have a column in
here item description and that could be
something custom to the user so let's
say you're selling a bicycle you could
say hey this place tickles brand new
I've only driven it like eight times
it's not very brand new but that seems
how people list things it's super legit
it's autographed by this person whatever
what the category description is
something exclusive to our website so
for example the category might be
transportation and then the description
of this category is going to be the same
for every transportation
so we could say stuff to get places and
that describes this category so we'll
add this bike on here we'll say it's
$100 and it has the listing ID of 1 now
let's say someone else gets on here and
adds a car to the website listing idea
to its price is $3,000 its category its
transportation and it has the same
category description now let's talk
about what columns depend on the primary
key the price depends on the primary key
because if you were to change the
listing ID you're going to be talking
about a different item and the price
will likely change so this depends on
what listing you're talk
about the category also depends on the
listing ID that's because every single
item can have its own category so if you
change the listing ID it'll be a new
item and the category is able to change
category description believe it or not
actually describes on listing - that's
because if you were to change the
listing ID let's say we had another item
in here and it cost ten thousand dollars
and the category is toys now let's look
at this value in relation to the primary
key if we change the primary key from
one to three so we stop talking about
the entity with the ID of one and we
start talking about the entity with the
ID of three you can see that the
category description does change so it
does depend on the listing ID that is in
contrast to a column that's completely
irrelevant for example you could have a
column of the top-selling items for that
day that's completely irrelevant to the
listing ID and even if you change the
listing ID and go through all of the
different items the top-selling item for
the day is always going to be the same
so that would not depend on the listing
ID the odd thing though about this
column is it's a type of dependency
known as a transitive dependency and
what that means is it depends on the
primary key through another column so it
actually depends on this category which
depends on the listing so this arrow can
be erased and you can see that the
category description is still connecting
to the listing ID so you get this kind
of hop these are bad and third normal
form says you're not allowed to have
transitive dependencies the solution to
fix this is actually very easy so you
start at the primary key and follow the
arrow back one time and you grab this
column here category and you break that
off into its own table categories and
now all we have to do is have a category
ID and then we can put all of our
categories in this table so the category
ID category category description then we
take this category and move it down here
so we could give it a category idea
and then the category would be
transportation and then the category
description would be stuff to get places
and now you can replace this with a
reference so the category is going to be
one same for this one and you can see it
reduces redundant data by adding another
table one and this is redundant too
because we have all this information in
here twice that we don't need we can
actually just get rid of this column
altogether and we also need to add this
row though so we'll say two toys fun for
all and then when we need to reference
this row we can just put it two and that
means this column is no longer needed
that's it for third normal form
hopefully you guys understand that
whenever you have a transitive
dependency all you have to do is grab
what the closest to the primary key so
you can have multiple jumps for example
you want to grab this one and put it
into its own table and the chances are
you'll have this problem again and
you'll need to put that into its own
table if you liked this video be sure to
