course this video we'll be talking about
numbers a little bit more so in this
series sorry of my voice is a little
scratchy I can hear it now but this
series has talked a lot about the basics
of a lot of different things but before
I dive into like extreme programming
concepts I want to go over more in depth
some of the basic things so we're going
to start from the beginning at numbers
and we're going to talk a little bit
more about them so there's two actually
there's three main types of numbers in
Python 3 we have the int and then we
have the floating-point so I'm just
trying these out float and then we have
complex numbers complex numbers we're
not really going to deal much with those
in this video but a complex number has
real and imaginary numbers which we're
not even going to get into that in this
video the main two that we're going to
be talking about are intz and float so
an integer is a number that does not
have any decimal places
or decimals so like 40 401 is an integer
as soon as we put that period it becomes
as soon as I put the decimal point it
becomes a float or a floating-point
number so that just means that it uses
decimals so when we do math like a three
plus three we get an integer as a result
well
Python can actually do math dynamically
so we could add two different types of
numbers an integer three plus three
point three a float and it the final
result is a float so the when we do math
the integer will always become the float
not the other way around
although we can force certain number
types using functions so as we talked
about in the video where we define
functions the functions do something
with data
well Python has some built-in functions
one of those is we have int sorry which
forces a number to be an integer so
three point three
becomes three well we could do something
like in three plus three point three and
this see what happens it gives us six so
it basically forces the result of this
to be an integer now one of the
important things with this function is
the way it rounds so let's just kind of
look let's give us some trials so let's
try point zero it will obviously round
to zero and then if we go point five it
rounds down to zero so let's try point
five point one oops sorry
whoops point five one it rounds down to
zero
and you can see that no matter what we
put in here oops
gosh I'm horrible at typing day it
always rounds down so if we have int
point point nine nine nine nine nine
nine nine nine nine even though that's
so close to one when we use this
function it rounds it down so that means
if we put in forty point one it's going
to give us 40 so for this equation or
I'm sorry for this question it's three
plus three point three which would be 6
point 3 which rounds down to six then I
I'm forgetting what it's called it's not
an equation because there's no equal
sign what is is it just a problem I I
forget what that's called but if you
guys know let me know but anyways that's
something to be aware of we also have
the float function which forces
something to be a float so if we have
three it puts it as a float so these are
how we can force certain variable or
certain um number types this works with
variables as well so if we have cat
equal it has the value five and then we
turn float cat it returns 5.0 now I want
to talk a little bit more about the
operator so we learned four of
main ones for we learned plus/minus
division and multiplication well I want
to teach you a couple more right now the
very first one is the forward version of
division so if we have something like 10
divided by 3 the value that we get back
is 3 point 3 3 3 3 and so on but
sometimes when we're doing division we
can't split things for example if we
have 10 basketballs and we want to
divide them up among three people we
can't give a person a third of a
basketball it doesn't make sense so the
most we can give is three so to do a
floor version you put two of the little
forward slashes three now the max value
is three now the other thing we can do
is find the remainder of a division so
this right here this is called the
quotient of the remainder is whatever's
left so if we give three basketballs to
three people that's nine balls and we
have one left the way we can figure that
out mathematically though is to use the
percent sign or what's called the
modulus I believe and then we put the
three so now that returns one because
there's one left over another thing that
might be useful to you is the power is
putting a number to a certain power such
as 3 to the power of 3 just so to do
that you do two asterisks or capital
eights as I like to call them so 3 to
the third power what that means is it
takes the first number multiplies it by
itself 3 times so 3 times 3 times 3 27
let's try another one 3 to the power of
4 81 81 to the power of 9 9 9 9 9 oh
goodness gracious all right there's a
whole bunch of other functions just like
we had an int and we had an in function
and a float function we also have a
complex
function which we will be discussing
sometime in the future maybe if we get
to it and we also have some other things
but just like we have the power operator
we also have the power function which
looks like this 3 to the power of 4 it
works the same way another extremely
useful function is div mod and what
basically just division and then modulus
for the left over so what we do is we
put a thing that we want to divide so
just like earlier we had 10 basketballs
and we want to divide them up among
three people well we could put 10 and
then 3 and what this will do is it will
return two numbers the first one being
how many basketballs each person gets
the second one how many are left over so
this is a great way to use division and
the modulus all within one command so
you can see three balls to each person
with one ball left over all right so
guys that's probably all I'm going to be
talking about in this video I just
wanted to go a little bit more in depth
with numeric types so keep this all in
mind when we are working with bigger
programs it's very important to be sure
that we get the right results by
understanding how Python does its
mathematics and all of that stuff so
thank you for watching and in the next
video we'll be continuing with some more
in-depth stuff so be sure to stick
around and subscribe it's gonna be
awesome guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
