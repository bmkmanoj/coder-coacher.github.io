over in the last part there were three
there's one-to-one one-to-many and
many-to-many those are the three types
of relationships when you're designing
tables and columns and rows and
databases and all that stuff you want
people to understand it I mean you don't
want to be the only person who is able
to read your database or design and
understand what's going on
so there's consistent methods or ways to
do things so basically you have a
one-to-one of two tables let's say which
isn't always necessarily necessary isn't
always necessary because if it's a
one-to-one say one person can have a
social security number and a social
security number can have one person then
you can just list it under this table as
in let's say people you can have the
social security number over here but if
there comes a case where it needs to be
where there's a one-to-one relationship
that needs to be over multiple tables
and you'll know when it comes that then
it's written like with a line just a
simple one across there like that if
there is a one-to-many relationship it
is written differently so you have this
square it's not square table haha
and then you have this table and this
table can have multiple of these so like
what was my example I used I can't
remember
oh yeah classes so a class and then
proof and then teacher a class kind of
one teacher and a teacher can teach
multiple classes so the way to design
this is an arrow and then three break
off like that because the teacher can
have multiple classes an easier way to
see this is pretend we have three
examples here man third grade so three
maths and then science fourth grade and
then engineering yeah that's close
enough engine and that's this college
level so let's suppose D for college and
this teacher can teach this teacher over
here let's say his name is mr. Phillips
whoops
and here are three cells or squares or
entries of information and he can teach
all three of these it goes out 1 1 and
goes to 3 separate boxes but if you just
have one table that's about it's the
same way how you would design it say
have a table for your classes this and
then align with three break ups that
that is very important if you miss drawl
this with just a line connecting around
people think only the teacher can have a
teacher can only have one class and a
class can only have one teacher that is
an example of a one to one one to one
design when it's actually a one two man
so last one is many-to-many and it is
written as this three line three and I
also went over the intermediary table so
you would change this into two one two
one one of minis but if let's say you
did it it would look like this a table
may need too many and then a table so
it's many as you can see think of it as
it going into three separate ones and
then it's going to another one this is a
many-to-many
if you can't process that right draw out
separate examples so movie one and then
two and then three
think of it going to each one separately
like that that is why it is written like
that because it can be many to many
because there's many here and here that
is basically all you need to know for
designing relationships when you're
writing it out we're using a program
this is so vitally important if you mess
this up the structure of your database
could be wrong because some people may
think it's a many-to-many when it's
actually only one too many and then data
will be entered wrong when other people
are working on it or when you come back
a couple years later you'll be so
confused and you won't understand it and
then you'll have to go through and re
learn your entire database structure
when otherwise you could just look at
the lines and it'd be right so thanks
for watching that video and see in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
