just a continuation in the last video if
you remember we made a database and we
explained how you do that and then I
explained creating a table and inserting
information into the table and then also
briefly explained retrieving that
information but there's one more thing I
need to add to that index is you can
define those when you create the table
so you basically have the table name up
here then you have each individual
column and their information such as
integer or long text or anything like
that
and then also not more other column
features then down here you would have
just this right here index and then in
parentheses the column so we'd have like
first name this would be an index and
you would also put like primary key down
here because that's also a type of index
if you remember there are 4 so any
indexes you basically just put at the
bottom of this so if you also remember
from the last video we had a column that
was name and I like things to be broken
up more so you can do it queries more
specifically so you can search people by
their last name rather than their full
name without having to go fancy into it
so um basically you can break this up
into first name last name first name
last name by using a alter command so um
it would be a alter and if you haven't
noticed it I usually put the up commands
for SQL and capital letters and then I
put the information we put in such as
name or first name last name and
lowercase letters this isn't something I
just do this is like a common convention
with MySQL it's just like the main way
you should write SQL so you can write
alter and then you can put the table you
on alter and you go write add first name
so alter uh what was it called members
so alter members and
add first name do it again alter members
add last name and we can do this ultra
members drop name so this will get rid
of this and add these so now you don't
have a lehtinen name you have a first
name and a last name which is good see
uh then what you can do from here is you
can update the information and insert
first names and last names so you can
run an update alright now that you have
a first name and last name column you
can actually insert information into
that but you don't actually do this with
an insert command you do it with an
update command because if you remember
we had let's say we have an entry kaleb
curvy hopes for my name occurring and
then aged 28 total lie ah and I am a
bronze member because I'm Way too lazy
to work out so when we get rid of the
first name last name and this is going
to get rid of that which you don't want
that so you should get around that and
make a first name last name call them
first
so you don't have to do any whacky stuff
to separate this and do a bunch of work
separate it from here and then put this
some first name this and last name that
takes away too much effort so what you
want to do is do this from the start but
let's say you create a new column such
as your email um from here you can add
that column into the database like I
said same way with first name and last
name
you just a altered table name and then
um add email as a call so now you from
here you can update that column so
update get update members and then you
update the column so you'd set the
column email to something my email
address column and then um you'd say
which row you want to affect so let me
explain that a little better
I'd say have an entry here's a database
and here's all the individual people
arose the members reverse and each one
has an email so the email goes right
here just like that now you click the
submit you make an update command and
you update you set the email to your
email but if you set the email it'll go
through here and set all these as that
email you submit because it doesn't know
which row to effect so if you set the
email to Caleb at currycomb it's going
to go through here and set every single
one as that so that's not good what you
need to do is you need to make a where
Clause wh e RV which will basically you
say update where the ID is say 603 so
the ID of 603 which is let's say this
member right here because he has an ID
of 603 so you'll update and set the
email where the ID is 603 you'll set it
to caleb currycomb that's an update
command so we go back to the same
example of the Jim and as I said
everybody has a membership status such
as gold bronze or silver and um
basically you want to select everybody
who has a gold membership status so
you'd use a where membership status
is equal to gold and then um basically
this will take everybody in that table
of members and select everybody's whose
membership status is equal to gold which
would not be me because I was only a
bronze because I'm lazy and I'm not
going to pay $3,000 a month to work out
I'll just do push-ups at my house if I
ever feel like it yeah you got a problem
but um basically that's what that aware
Clause will do you so this I'm trying to
say here where can be used to limit what
kind of options come back
because if you just use select
everything out of the table then it's
just going to give you a bunch of
information it's not going to be much
use and then you're going to go have to
go and look through everybody who has
the gold membership status yourself
which takes way too much effort so use
the where clause and then on we can also
use the limit so let's say we want to
display ten members you can say a limit
then you can say ten so it's like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
