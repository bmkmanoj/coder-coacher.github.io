be talking a bit more about sound for we
get into something new and just so you
know we're talking about this right here
and how to pronounce this well I don't
really know because I looked it up and
like I heard timber timber timber a
Hummer so I really i think it's timber
or 10 bar but I'm hardcore and I don't
do what everyone else does so I'm just
gonna pronounce the timber you know like
like a tree falling down even though I'm
pretty sure that's wrong so as a quality
teacher Hugh pronouncing things
improperly I I don't know if you should
trust me just kidding but seriously i'm
pronouncing it wrong on purpose timber
pretty sure that's wrong so timber
consists of spectra and envelope that's
two other words we probably don't know
what that means either so spectra is
basically the sound spectrum right sound
spectrum is anything any sounds that
make up a sound so I know that but to
make sense either but that goes into the
concept of partials and overtones and
stuff like that so see my videos I just
created before this one and that is the
idea of sound spectrum so we already
kind of know what that is that this
timber is what a sound consists of and
one of them are these are these uh
different vibrations but that's not the
only thing that makes a sound unique we
also have envelope which consists of an
attack sustain and release also known as
decay so a tech the attack is when you
start playing how quickly or how loud it
gets or anything like that so that's the
attack sustain is how long it lasts at
its highest or the sustained level of
volume how long it lasts there and the
release so when you stop playing how
long it takes to go back to zero sound
so here we have the attack here we have
this
and here we have the release all right
so it doesn't always have to look like
that for example we could have an attack
and then a sustained and then a really
slow release or we could have an attack
a sustained really quick release almost
instant release so that creates
different sounds that differentiates
between such as a piano or guitar not
only is it the amount of different
frequencies of round the fundamental
frequency it's also the envelope that
has the attack sustained release also
known as decay so these things put
together these two things put together
create sound that's pretty much all you
need to know about understanding how
sound is created and how it works so
just to re-explain this attack is how
quickly a sound is frog goes from zero
volume to whatever volume you end that
how quickly it does does that and any
alterations and pitch or anything like
that we also have this sustained which
is how long it lasts at its highest
volume and the decay so when you stop
playing it takes time for that to fade
down to no sound so if you just pluck a
guitar it may look like this and they
make a really loud really quickly
sustained for a while and then fade out
slowly cuz guitar Wang yeah you have to
point so it depends on the instrument if
you pluck a key on a piano sometimes we
don't and it may look like a box but I
get on it and kind of last a while it
does that for a piano too if you hold
down the little pedal so that is all
examples of how sounds work and that's
pretty much all i have to say about this
kind of a shorter video but i really
don't feel like blabbering on for 20
minutes and making you pretend you're
learning extra stuff because you're
really not because i'm only going to
repeat myself like i always do
I have this bad habit of talking too
long and repeating myself because I
don't know i have like ADHD and i can't
like focus and I'm like ah so yeah yeah
so I think that's allowed to say try not
to repeat myself a million times in this
video I already said that alright see
you around subscribe to my channel
please follow me on twitter facebook me
but especially subscribe to my channel
see you then in the next video
