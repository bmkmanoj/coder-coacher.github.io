video maker - in this video we are going
to be talking about naming our
constraints so I'm an idiot and I forgot
to do something important in the last
video and that is make these columns
foreign keys so we will do that in just
a moment but for now I wanted to talk
about this primary key and if you go to
the object Explorer and expand that
database will go to subscribe tables
interests keys and you see there's one
primary key and we talked about how
disgusting this name was and we want to
change that that's what we were going to
do and then I'll talk about naming
foreign keys and that's when I'll put
the foreign keys on the other columns so
this is at the table level right now and
you can see it's right here and it's
very easy to add a name all you have to
do is add the constraint keyword and
then give it a name now what do you name
it well that is up to you ultimately but
there are some conventions there's
something known as Hungarian notation
and what that is is where we put what
the thing is inside of the name so for
example we could say PK underscore and
then give it a name and that PK is a
prefix that says what the thing is some
people like this some people don't like
it some people prefer at the end that is
ultimately up to you but I'm going to
follow this convention for right now so
I'll say PK and then I will put the
table name so that way we know this is
the constraint for the interests table
and specifically it's a primary key
constraint you can figure that out just
by reading the name so let's run the
script I'll make sure I am on the
subscribed database because I forget
that every stinkin time and now let's
run this and you can see that it
executed successfully so let's go back
to our object Explorer and go to keys
and refresh there you go you can see
that it's nice and beautiful now let's
talk about how to do that with foreign
keys it's very similar we're going to
put the foreign keys at the table level
so I'm going to start right here and I
will say constraint give it a name FK
underscore now what are we going to name
it well we will name it the first table
so interests and then the second table
which is the table of references so
interests and this one is going to be
for the animal ID
so I'll say animals then you have to say
the constraint type which is foreign key
and then you have to say what column it
is on in parentheses so this is on the
animal ID and then you have to say what
it references first you put the table so
it'll be animals and then in parentheses
you say the column and there you go you
can see this is a little bit more long
than the primary key but overall it's
not too complicated normally all you
have to do is put references animal ID
up here with the column but if you want
to put it at the table level this is
what you need to do let's add another
column for the species ID be pretty
similar and there we go now let's run
this and make sure everything works
awesome let's check the object Explorer
do a refresh on our keys and you can see
these foreign keys have such beautiful
names why do we care that much though
the reason is that when we try to insert
data into these tables and for some
reason something's incorrect it's going
to give us an error and say the
constraint name and if we have these
nice beautiful names it's much easier to
figure out what constraints it's talking
about and we will talk about that in the
next video when we learn about the
insert statement so hopefully you guys
are enjoying these videos and I'll see
you in the next one and as always be
