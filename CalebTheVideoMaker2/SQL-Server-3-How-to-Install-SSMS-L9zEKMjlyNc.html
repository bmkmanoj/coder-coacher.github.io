Caleb the video maker - and in the last
video we talked about installing sequel
Server 2016 and I said the next step was
to install SSMS or sequel server
management studio but before we do that
I wanted to talk a little bit more about
what we already have installed so once
you install this database there is a
cool tool you can use if you open your
Start menu and go to all apps you will
find something known as sequel servers
2016 configuration manager now within
this tool you can do all kinds of
configurations but one of the ones I
wanted to point out is under on the side
here sequel server services so services
are things that run in the background on
your computer so for example when we
start up our computer it's automatically
going to start our sequel server
database and it's just going to continue
running as we are using our computer to
see all of those services you can go to
the Start menu and type in services open
that and if you scroll through here and
you can see we have sequel server right
here and there's actually two types
there's Microsoft sequel server and then
sequel Express the sequel Express is
basically a smaller slimmed down version
of the full sequel server that you can
use free for production here you can
stop the service and start it again but
you can also do the same thing in the
sequel server configuration manager so
up here we have sequel server and we'll
go to the full version and right here
you can right click and for example we
can restart it if for any reason we need
to restart the server so that is how you
restart your sequel server if you ever
need to do that but let's put that down
for now and let's click install SSMS we
will go with this one right here as
that's the most stable release so we're
going to give this a run and it's really
simple I mean you guys probably don't
need a whole lot of help learning how to
install things but I just want to make
sure I cover all grounds so that way no
one's lost no one has no idea what's
going on I want to make sure we're all
on the same page so once we start
studying this in the next video we can
just go through it and I hit a bunch of
walls so we're gonna have to let this
install and I might have to go through
and install a bunch of other stuff we'll
just let it do its thing and we'll be
back in just the
little bit all right so what's done
close that and now we can open up all
apps and here is the shortcut Microsoft
sequel server management studio I'm
gonna pin that to the Start menu so I
can find that and now let's open that
when you first open it you're going to
need to connect so I connected to
localhost and where did I get that from
well when we installed it there's a
bunch of information that popped up at
the end and that was part of it that's
why I took a snapshot of it so you can
see here local hosts so this is the app
we are going to be using to type our
sequel statements now to actually write
some sequel we go to the new query and
we can do anything in here such as
select five times five and it gives us
the result 25 so over here inside a
localhost you can see our databases here
and within each database you're going to
have tables and a bunch of other good
stuff
well we'll be getting into all that in
the upcoming videos but I just want to
make sure you guys get this application
running because that is what's important
for the upcoming videos if you by any
chance have another server you want to
connect to you can click this little
green button over here and you can type
in whatever you need over here so as you
can see I just connected to the dot
which is another way to say localhost
you can see in here we're gonna have the
same databases these are all called
panels and if you by any chance screw
everything up there is a way to reset
your panels to the default one so all
you got to do is click window and then
reset one to layout and there you go so
I think that's enough to get you all
started obviously there's a whole lot
more to learn but on the bright side
we're not going to have to figure out
how to install everything again we got
that done so now we can start working on
actually studying sequel statements so
thanks guys be sure to check out the
next video and I will see you then and
