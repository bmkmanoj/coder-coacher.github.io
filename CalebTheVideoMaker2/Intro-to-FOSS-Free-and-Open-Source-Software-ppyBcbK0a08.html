Caleb the video maker I'm pretty sick
today I actually called off work and I
didn't go to school so it's gonna be
pretty chill today I decided I would
make a video but nothing too fancy just
gonna go over my notes here rather than
try and memorize this all so yeah that's
got a new set ups and just chilled show
you my content but mostly it's gonna be
through a voice so this video is going
to be over free and open source software
so the acronym f OSS or false I guess it
would be I don't really know but anyways
free and open source software is
something that's really common in the
software industry that you'll find when
you search for software online or you're
looking for programs to use for your
business or whatever you're doing really
all right so what is software all
computer programs are known as software
this includes your operating system and
any application you are running such as
Google Chrome Photoshop et Cie by the
way all these notes that'll be going
over I'll either be putting a lot of
this in the description or on my website
which all you can find everything you
need in the description so just check
that out all right so another thing
you'll need to know about is source code
so source code is the software the
software is created with what's known as
the source code it's the original code
that the programmer uses to create that
software so if you're programming a web
application in PHP well the PHP code
that you type is what's known as the
software or if you're using some kind of
compiled language such as C++ well then
you would actually have to have the C++
code that's uncompelled to have the
source code
alright so oftentimes when you're
working with software this source code
will be available to the people who
download the software or buy the
software so they can look at it or
modify it if necessary
now not all software allows you to view
the source code
and that'll get into some distinctions
as it go on so so far we learned two
definitions there's gonna be a lot of
definitions here so you may want to take
some notes first one software which you
uh whoops software I think that's can
you even see that guys I don't know
close enough so I guess I'll have to
write a little bigger gonna get my
eraser here
they have software and then we have
source code so source code is the code
that's compiled or ran to create the
software all right so this is where we
get the terms free and open source
software false and we also get the term
f/l OSS or false which this is stands
for free so free slash Libre open source
software now Libre this is another term
you will probably need to know and it's
a distinction between the two words
gratis I believe it's pronounced and
Libre so what are these two terms gratis
and Libre that's what we need to focus
on right now so when you're working with
software there's two there's two
different types of words for the word
free because we're working with free and
open source software so what does free
mean well if we're looking at the term
gratis that means free as in without
charge so you don't have to pay any
money to use it
Libre is free as in you have specific
rights with the software or freedoms all
right so a definition for for Libre
which I got from GNU da to work is users
have the freedom to run copy distribute
study change and improve the software so
that's what it means by free so there's
two distinctions free as in free of
charge and then free as in you have
specific rights or freedoms to do with
whatever you want with the software so
when we're talking about free and open
source software it's talking about leave
or basically you you can still pay for
it but you still have rights it's
talking about freedom as in what you can
do with the software so that's why we
get the term floss which is free or
Libre open-source software it's quite
acronym there that's where we get this
from Libre now so we have the aqua
acronym Foss which can confuse people
because people think free as in without
charge when in reality means free as in
freedom and rights if you want a good
way to remember this just think free as
in freedom of speech rather than free as
in free beer so free as in speech not as
in beer because if you're getting free
beer it costs 0 dollars if you're
getting free speech that means you have
rights to say or do whatever you want
with your speech so most most oftentimes
though we will just use false probably
just because floss is a dental tool and
people don't like using the word floss
my guess so yeah
often times you will see the word Foss
for free open-source free and open
source software all right now that means
there's two different distinctions here
that we need to focus on we have three
and then we have open source these are
in fact two different things
so software can be open-source and it
can be free as a speech but they're not
always that these are not the same thing
so the rest of this video we will be
just we will be talking about the
difference between these two types of
software all right so we have what is
known as first thing we're going to talk
about is free software so newbies tend
to mix these terms up and confuse people
so we are going to clear up all
confusion between these two terms which
you will need to know about all right so
the term free software comes from the
Free Software Foundation or FSF for
short the FSF or the Free Software
Foundation is fighting against
proprietary software proprietary
software is software that charges
typically and doesn't give you free
rights with the software so I think of
the Microsoft operating system so if you
have Windows 7 you can't just do
whatever you want with that software you
have to follow certain restrictions and
you can only use it on one computer and
so forth if it was free software you
could redistribute it modify it and so
forth so proprietary software highly
restricts the consumers of the software
the the free software foundation is
fighting against this to provide free
software free as in speech once again so
most software is given out to consumers
with what is known as a licensed this
tells you what you're allowed to do with
the software and what you're not allowed
to do with the software so the free
software foundation wants to give
licenses
I think that's licenses that have a lot
of freedoms with the license so they
have four freedoms that are included
with this license they can
one you're allowed to use the software
in whatever way that you like to you can
view and modify the source code three
you can redistribute the software and
four you can redistribute the modified
software with the source once the source
code is changed by you modifying the
source code you can then redistribute
that modification to other people so if
you have software and you want to
improve it you can add stuff to it and
then you can redistribute that to other
people or if you want to remove stuff
that's not good and take that away and
have a better version of the software
which can then be redistributed that is
how the Free Software Foundation defines
free software so people who redistribute
the software are required under the
license to redistribute it as free so
that means if I create a a new software
and then someone takes my software
modifies it and then redistribute its
redistributes it they have to continue
the same license that means that new
version of the software will also be
free which means I can then take that
software modify it for myself or someone
else can take it and modify it for
themselves and redistributed so what I
can't do is I can't take someone's
software change it and then leave it
closed source so nobody can see the
source code and then give it out for
people to buy and I get all the money
from it that's against the license so um
this this concept is known as copyleft
so you've probably heard of copyright
which is often misused to restrict
software development while copyleft is
basically saying oh if it's free it has
to be redistributed as free and I'm
posting links to all where I'm getting
all this stuff so you can check that out
on my website or in the description so
the Free Software Foundation wanted to
create a license that could be used to
distribute free software to any
buddy who is a developer and wants to
work with freedoms all right so they
came out with the license GPL or general
public license I'd probably write this
all out but it looks out of focus so I'm
not going to you can just write it down
if you want so the general public
license is a huge free software license
that is out there so the license
originated to protect the freedoms of
the GNU operating system so this was an
operating system that people could take
modify and then redistribute the new
improvements or whatever that they did
to the software so they created this
license to protect that so people
wouldn't take the software and then take
it keep it for themselves and keep it
closed source code or a closed source
which basically means the source code is
unavailable to anybody rather than open
source which means you can get that
source code all right so a lot of people
get this confused with the concept of
free it doesn't have anything to do with
money so in fact I can create a new
modification of this operating system
which is published under the GPL or the
general public license and then I can
sell that creation to other people as
long as once they have that that
modification they can redistribute it or
modify it for themselves so I am
actually allowed to sell these
modifications so this is because the
idea of free software is freedom to use
the source code in whatever way and
redistribute it as long as you are
keeping the original license for the new
product that means I'm allowed to sell
this product that doesn't stop somebody
from copying it and so forth so let me
illustrate this on this whiteboard right
here it'll be easy to see
alright ok so here here we have a
company just kidding here we have a
company and this company creates an
operating system right so this is the
operating system they created well then
this company over here realizes ok this
company is giving out a free operating
system for anyone to use what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna take it
redistribute it but this time I'm gonna
improve it and I'm gonna sell it for ten
dollars right
well a third company right here can then
take mine and redistribute it exactly
how it is I don't even have to change it
and they can redistribute it for zero
dollars so that's the concept of three
software this company is a lot to take
this publication this company can take
this one and redistribute it even if it
originally costed ten dollars this is
the concept of free you're pretty much
allowed to do whatever you want as long
as you keep it free
all right
so the idea of the general public
license is not to help make software
free of charge it's also not there to
help software developers become rich
because obviously if this person took
this software recreated it and sold it
for $10 well that might get them a lot
of money but this guy comes over here
takes it and redistributes it for free
well obviously people are going to go
for this software because this one cost
$10 and it's exactly the same as this
one so it's almost like stealing if you
think about it but it's allowed because
it's free software so that means if if
some guy decides ok let's say all my
friends want the software it's some
video editor for example and I take it I
pay $10 well then I can redistribute
this to all of my friends who are also
video editors legally so now all these
people have this software so if you have
an operating system such as Windows 7
and you pay 10 bucks for it let's just
say well there's restrictions you're not
allowed to give this to all your friends
you you can't do that under the license
that windows 7 runs under you are only
allowed to use it on one computer and
all the other ones are breaking this
license and makes it illegal well with a
free license you are actually allowed to
redistribute that operating system just
for an example so um because Microsoft
aw the Microsoft operating system cannot
be shared freely it's known as
proprietary okay No
now we just talked about free software
for like forever there's another type of
software we need to learn about known as
open source software so if you haven't
realized already almost all free
software all free software is open
source so that means if you get
this software you can modify the source
code it's available you can look at it
you can judge it and do whatever you
want with the source code so it in fact
is open source but just because
something is open source
does not mean it's free software so for
example Microsoft can release an
operating system let's say it's Windows
9 ok
they take the code that they use to
create the operating system and they
send it with the operating system so
people can view the code that makes this
operating system open-source that's
because you can openly view the source
code that was used to create the the the
operating system or the software well
that does not necessarily mean it is
free because you can still have
restrictions on this software so for
example just because it's open source
does not mean you can redistribute that
source code to all your friends so you
can all have Windows 9 that does not
allow you to do whatever you want with
the software so there's two distinctions
free software allows you to do a lot of
stuff with the software and it's always
open source open source software is
always open source but it doesn't always
allow you to do certain things with this
software such as redistributing it
modifying it and so forth now there's
different levels of open source nests
so you can have open source programs
that you can redistribute you can have
open source programs that you can modify
and redistribute and then you can have
open source programs where you can only
look at the source code so there's
different levels of what you're allowed
to do and that's going to change from
program to program from license to
license so that's something you're going
to need to look over so I pretty much
explained all what I was going to talk
about but just for some extra
definitions from the state of can
I don't even know what I was trying to
put there oh yeah from the state of
Kansas open-source software is software
for which the source code is freely and
publicly available though the specific
licensing agreement vary as to what one
is allowed to do with that cooked so
just like I was talking about earlier
you may not be able to redistribute it
redistribute it and so forth so we
learned two things from this definition
one unparent apparently entire states
can publish definitions that's pretty
interesting and two open source software
does not ensure users the freedoms of
free software this means that even
though the source code is readily
available you can't necessarily modify
or redistribute this source code in any
way this is largely dependent on the
specific license and because this video
is not over licensing we will not be
getting into any other licenses besides
the basics of the general public license
which we talked about earlier the GPL
which was used to protect the GNU
operating system so in summary there are
two main types of software we learned
about this in this video write these out
even though you probably can't even see
this this whiteboard is really crappy -
alright we have three and then we have
open source software so a free software
and open source software free software
which is what we talked about first
allows you to do a lot of stuff with the
source code so for example you can
redistribute it you can send it to all
your friends you can modify it and then
redistribute it to all your friends you
can modify it and then sell it for a
price such as a thousand dollars for
example which
a lot of money and then you can
redistribute it well you can also do
other stuff with it that D license is
going to specify so an example of a free
software license is the meter is this G
PL which is the general public license
this was created by the free software
foundation for the G and u operating
system so those are a lot of acronyms
that you're probably just acting into
practice with but basically just think
of free software as you can do pretty
much whatever you want with it
it does not limit it to price so just
because it's free does not mean you
can't sell it for ten dollars because
it's free it allows you to do whatever
you want including selling it as long as
the final product itself is going to be
free so it has to stay free as in
freedom not as in price open source
software is different because you no
longer have certain freedoms so freedom
goes out the window
it's just dependent upon the certain
license so open source software allows
you to see the code that you may be
reading blah blah blah and you can look
at it and depending on the license you
may be able to redistribute it you may
be able to modify it and then
redistribute it or you may even be able
to modify it and resell it which in that
case it's pretty darn free it's just not
technically free because it doesn't have
a free license so this means that when
it comes to open source software you
have to pay attention to the specific
licensing to see what you're allowed to
do same thing with free software
generally you're going to be allowed to
do whatever you want
but it's still important to pay
attention to your limitations such as
closing the source code and so forth
alright so another thing you wanted to
remember probably was copyleft
which is basically saying anything that
was originally three that's modified
must then be free in the end as in
speech so yeah that is the general
foundation of free and open source
software or false so now another thing
would be to understand proprietary
licensing which tells you what you're
allowed to do with stuff that's not open
source such as Microsoft operating
systems Adobe products Mac operating
systems and so stuff like that there's
tons of them so um so those are the main
three types of software there's all ton
more and basically now you want to get
into exact licensing to understand
different licenses and what you can do
with those licenses as licenses even a
word and it sounds really stupid anyways
that's this lesson hopefully it was
helpful sorry it wasn't super
professional just don't feel like
professionalizing it today just thought
it'd get my notes out and teach you some
junk so I was studying Linux systems and
it talked about the GNU operating system
and I realized that free and open source
software is a good video idea because I
never really done anything like that and
it's quite confusing because people
think free as in money when it really
has nothing to do with money at all so
hopefully this video helped to clarify
any confusion and hopefully this helped
you become a better IT professional or a
whatever you're doing it doesn't really
matter
others other types of licenses such as
Creative Commons and stuff like that
that you will need to pay attention to
although this video is just going over
free and open source software so if that
was helpful please be sure to subscribe
and I'll leave any comments like this
video mainly subscribe though because
then you'll get notified every time I
create future content and it's free so
yeah all these notes will be either in
the
or on my website or both you can check
those out and check out all the other
website links I will refer you to so
once again
I'm Caitlin from Caleb the video maker
please be sure to subscribe and we are
done don't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
