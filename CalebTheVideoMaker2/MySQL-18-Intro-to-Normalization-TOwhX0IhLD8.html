video maker - welcome back to your MySQL
tutorial series this video we are going
to be covering normalization this is
going to be an introduction that's
because the next few videos are going to
talk about each of the normal forms if
you have no idea what I'm talking about
don't worry about it we'll get into it
but essentially normalization is a
process we go through when we're
designing a database to help make sure
our database has the right structure
normalization now everyone makes a
normalization way to Stinkum complicated
so I'm going to try and explain it in
English but essentially normalization
has three main steps and they're called
normal forms we have first normal form
second normal form and of course third
there are a couple others after these if
you want to research more but I think
once you get to third normal form you
can say that your database is pretty
well normalized normalized is kind of
like the finish line so if you've
learned about normalization and it
doesn't really click with you
essentially think of it as pouring dirty
water into filters okay the dirty water
is your database the filters are the
normal forms and you have three filters
the top filter has very big holes so
this just gets rid of like the obvious
things you shouldn't drink like rocks
and snakes and scorpions and explosives
it gets rid of all those ones the second
normal form has a little bit smaller
holes so this is going to get rid of you
know dirt and then finally the third
normal form has like really really
really small holes so that's going to
get rid of like bacteria viruses all
that good stuff now this is an
illustration so it doesn't apply
directly to databases but essentially
after you get through all of those
filters you're going to have nearly pure
water if you want you can add more
filters by adding more normal forms but
there's a consequence in that in that
the database becomes more complex just
like if you add 20 filters to a water
filter things become more complex and
more
disorganized so when we use the normal
forms we are going to look at our
database with a certain pair of eyes or
think of like glasses and we're going to
look for certain things that are wrong
with our database structure and then fix
those each normal form has to have the
previous one done in order to do it so
second normal form requires that first
normal form is already complete sort of
like if you have these filters and the
water filter the second one is going to
be hit after the first one is already
done third normal form same thing it
requires that second normal form be done
and obviously if second normal form is
done first normal form is also done so
you have this chain now when you study
normalization you are going to run
across the term dependency this is when
something depends no not like the
diapers this is when something depends
on something else essentially think of a
column describing whatever the table is
so a user's table every single column
inside of the users table describes this
user you could say the user is the
entity and each thing describing it is
the attribute we can talk about a
specific user using a primary key so for
example we could have an ID and that ID
for example could be 7 for a specific
user now when we describe this user we
might have something such as an email
this is an example of an attribute this
email depends on the user that's because
if we change the user to someone else
the potential of this changing is very
high that's because every user doesn't
have the same email so that is an
example of a dependency and there's
different types of dependencies that we
are going to talk about when we're going
over these normal forms that are not
okay so for example second normal form
talks about something known as a partial
dependency third normal form addresses
something known as transitive
dependencies that being said I'm not
going to bog you down with all of the
details because when you study this
stuff online people talk about
dependencies more than they talk about
databases and how to design them so you
end up reading and
cool and you have no idea what they're
talking about at least that's how it is
for me but I'm not a super genius unlike
all the other people who do this kind of
stuff so hopefully because of that I can
explain it in English a question we have
to ask now is how do these normal forms
work how do they actually improve our
database structure the primary way they
help us is by getting rid of redundancy
redundancy is when we have something in
a database more than once for example if
we have a comments table we might have a
comment ID poster ID the actual message
and if applicable any replies so we'll
store one reply in here now this is not
the best way to design a table and
you'll see why in just a moment let's go
through some example data so the comment
has the idea of a thousand thirty to
just some random number and this points
back to a user with the ID of 702 for
example and the message can be anything
and this is the original comment
therefore it's not a reply so we'll just
say not then someone comes back and
replies and because this one is a reply
to this message all I gotta do is say
our reply and this person says nope I
disagree and the message we're applying
to is the one that says great and you
can see that this is just an awful way
to design this that's because we have
this message in here twice and also this
message cannot uniquely define a row
there could be 50 comments that have
great this here though is an example of
redundancy that's because we have the
same data in here twice and now let's
say in our application this person goes
back and edits their comment so we grab
his comment the guy who posted this one
great and changes it to and ok so to do
this we would use an update statement
and say update the message of the
comment with the comment ID of 1032 and
change it to whatever we want to change
it to but this is dumb because it
doesn't update this one this is an
example of an anomaly and anomaly is
when something does not work the way
it's expected to work it's out of the
ordinary
with database normalization though we
can prevent anomalies but do keep in
mind that this builds off of
relationships so that's something we
talked about in previous videos I highly
recommend you remember how to design a
one to one a one to many and a many to
many relationship because just doing
that alone would help us to understand
how to design tables pretty good we also
need to have a foundation in primary
keys and foreign keys because that alone
would help us understand that this is
just a dumb way to design this we'll get
into the good ways to design things in
the upcoming videos but that's all I
have for you guys for now so thanks for
watching sorry if I rambled in this
video I just wanted to make sure to give
a good foundation for the upcoming
videos over each of the normal forms
that's because this stuff is super
important so thanks guys
