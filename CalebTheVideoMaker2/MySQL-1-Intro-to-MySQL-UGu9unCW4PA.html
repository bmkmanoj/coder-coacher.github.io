video over MySQL now I know what some of
you are going to be saying what this
ain't your first video over MySQL you
actually did an entire series over this
yes this is actually my second series
over MySQL the reason being is that
minus QL has changed a lot over these
last few years and it was as many years
ago so I think I've learned a lot more
about MySQL and I'm prepared to make an
even better series ah so that's what
we're doing now hopefully this series
will satisfy you guys have been wanting
some more of MySQL because a series is
going to be more in depth more techie
and cool and up-to-date and stuff all
right let's do this
so what is MySQL MySQL is a relational
database management system essentially a
database is a software that allows us to
store tons of data or information so
data can be really anything think of
something you want to store that you can
use at a later date often databases are
used behind an application so an
application might say something like
hello and then say the username this
section right here has to come from
something all of this information is
stored inside of a database so this
allows us to make apps that are dynamic
what does dynamic mean it means changing
but only certain parts so often we'll
have an application let's say this is
our application right and we might have
some kind of code that presents this
information here but it's dynamic and
that this user name can change depending
on who was signed in or what your user
name is this allows sort of like a
separation between the application and
the data that the application needs so
you have the application here
and the database the code itself is
going to get information from the
database to present to the user so let's
say this user uses this application does
something on it
and that information is stored inside of
the database
well then later when he wants to use the
application again we can get that data
from the database and present it in the
application and then that will be
delivered to the user so this is kind of
a key word of it all we can make dynamic
websites websites that change websites
that render content so you can make an
application that renders your most
recent blogs and you don't have to go in
there and update your recent blogs every
single day or whatever it'll do it
automatically that's because you can
code it and it will do it dynamically
now the other part of relational
database management system is the
keyword relational and this word right
here relation actually means table you
can use that at a party and impress all
your friends okay so we have a table and
the way things are organized is that we
have columns going this way and then we
have rows of information going this way
so for example we can have a column of a
username and then all the data in this
column is going to be everybody's
username but the way this data is
entered into this table is by row so a
specific user let's say this guy signs
up for an account he puts in a username
he might put in an email a phone number
first name last name whatever it is
doesn't really matter all this stored
tabular Lee table table e all of this is
stored inside of a table but it's not
just an ordinary table the table is just
the way the data is presented a
different way we can think about it is
with the key where it's entity and
attribute so an entity would be the user
or the person the attributes would be
the username email first name last name
phone number all that good information
now these attributes that describe the
entity these are stored as columns
inside of the user to
now don't freak out if you don't
understand how to design all this stuff
yet that's not the point of this video
the real point of this video is to give
you a rough introduction to what
databases are and what MySQL is so now
that we kind of understand what a
relational database management system is
which if you just need like a one
sentence summary it's a way to store
data in tables really simple but now we
should move on to figure out what MySQL
is now as I mentioned before I have that
other MySQL series and that content is
still pretty relevant so if you want a
slower introduction to MySQL go ahead
and watch that now MySQL is a management
system that means it allows us to store
data in tables and the way we do that is
using what's known as SQL now MySQL is
just a software system that adopted the
SQL standard this my year I'm pretty
sure it was like the makers daughter's
name or something but essentially it's
just a software that allows us to type
SQL and store data in tables so SQL
stands for structured query language
structured query language and
essentially this is kind of like a
language that's between computers and
humans so here's where SQL goes that's
because a computer can interpret SQL and
a human is smart enough to write SQL so
we can communicate with the computer
using this language and that's really
what this video series is going to be
about we're going to be learning SQL but
we're going to be learning the MySQL
dialect of that essentially what a
dialect is is that it's the way this
database system it adopts the SQL
language for example there's other
database management systems there sequel
server there's more chol and there's a
plethora of other different database
management systems but they all have the
commonality
of using SQL there's just some minor
differences and that's where this whole
dialect thing comes up so for example
writing something in MySQL is going to
be very similar to writing something in
sequel server or Oracle but there's
going to be some minor differences
that's because MySQL has adopted its own
dialect for example there's extra
features in MySQL that are not specified
inside of this standard and those extra
features are not going to be the same a
sequel server and Oracle but even so if
you know MySQL it's very easy to pick up
another database management system such
as sequel server that's because they're
all based off of a standard structured
query language hopefully that kind of
makes sense don't be overwhelmed with
all of the details what's really
important to know is that MySQL is built
off of a standard known as SQL SQL is
the language we use to store data and
retrieve data from our database now
there are a lot of ways you can store
information for example why don't we
just use an excel sheet or you know a
text file well there are a lot of
benefits of using these but there's also
some really serious downsides and we'll
learn all of those as we go on and
you'll see why databases are so
important but to start off I'll just
give you a couple for one excel is just
a way to make spreadsheets and the thing
with spreadsheets is that they are all
or nothing that means if you have a
spreadsheet and you want to get data
from this you have to look at the entire
spreadsheet you can't just select
certain columns with the database you
can that's because you have what's known
as a Select statement and you can
specify which columns so you could say I
want this one and this one but not this
one
along with that is security for example
in a database you can prevent certain
people from doing certain things in a
spreadsheet you can do that a little bit
with file system rules but it's it's
very limited and that if someone has
access to a spreadsheet they can
basically do whatever they want you
could make it read-only but let's say
they had
read and write abilities they can do
anything but with a database you could
say here are some things they can do and
here's some things they cannot do so you
can have a little bit more flexibility
and you can make basically a entire
system that allows many users but you're
not going to open up your data to be
destroyed by certain people right so you
can prevent big disasters using a roll
system in addition to security databases
also allow us to store much more
information databases can be expanded to
Tone's
tons of data and still run efficiently
that's because we can separate data very
easily we can index data and the
database management system is optimized
to work with a lot of data spreadsheets
can work with a decent amount of data
but when you were talking like millions
of rows things might get a little clunky
and not very organized so if you're a
very small business and you just need to
store a little bit of information I tell
you a spreadsheet will do just fine a
text file might even do just fine but if
we're talking about an enterprise
application that's going to have tons of
information in that situation I know
you're going to want a database so we've
talked about what a relational database
management system is we've talked about
what MySQL is but now let's talk about
why MySQL why would you want to choose
MySQL over some of the other database
management systems one reason is that
MySQL is open source that means you can
go and view the code that actually makes
the database in addition to it being
open source I think it has one of the
most flexible licensing systems meaning
you can do the most with paying the
least and being restricted the least
because of this MySQL is often used for
smaller projects such as websites Claire
ah websites often use MySQL literally
almost every website that has a content
management system think of like
WordPress Joomla Drupal all those
they're almost always powered by MySQL
in addition to this flexible licensing
there is a small learning
so you have to learn a lot to use a
database but once you figure it out your
efficiency goes much faster whereas a
spreadsheet you know it doesn't really
require much knowledge but it takes it
takes a lot more work to maintain it's a
lot less efficient you end up losing
more time up keeping on all that
nonsense but MySQL compared to other
database management systems the learning
curve is small so for example Oracle
might have a learning curve like this
you know I'm just drawing random charts
but the learning curve and Oracle in my
opinion is much higher it requires more
knowledge to get started with Oracle so
for small projects most people pick
MySQL because it's really not that hard
to adopt it just has a small learning
curve sequel server well that's kind of
somewhere in the middle it has a steeper
learning curve than MySQL but it's not
too bad so if you really support the
open source community and you like
flexible licensing if you're that kind
of person I'd go from MySQL but if
you're looking for a world-class 100%
reliable you know has to work all the
time like a crazy application kind of
thing I would go for Oracle and if it's
somewhere in the middle
maybe sequel server it also often
depends on what code base you're working
with for example PHP people almost
always use MySQL c-sharp people will
often use equal server and the reason
why is this that certain languages work
better with certain database management
systems most websites built with PHP use
MySQL does it have to be that way
no does every website that uses PHP use
MySQL no it's just the way people do
things so it ultimately depends on your
goals what you're trying to accomplish
but either way I think MySQL is a great
database management system to start so
