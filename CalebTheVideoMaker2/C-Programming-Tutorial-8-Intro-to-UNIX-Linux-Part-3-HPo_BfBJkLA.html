to be the last Linux tutorial inside of
the C programming series so if you're
sick of Linux don't worry it's it's
almost over
the very first thing I wanted to teach
you how to do in this video was how to
create your own directories so if we do
print working directory you can see we
are in the YouTube directory and if we
say LS you can see that there's
absolutely nothing in this directory
well I'm going to teach you how to put a
directory into the working directory so
the way to do that is MK dir which
stands for make directory and then you
give it a name now when we say LS you
can see that there is a folder or
directory inside of the current
directory or the working directory we
can go into that directory by using CD
tests and now when we say PWD you can
see that we're in that directory let's
go out of that CD that goes to the
parent and now I want to talk about
auto-completion because this is going to
be one of the most helpful things I
promise so to explain auto-completion
I am going to make a couple directories
mixer so every single space is and new
directory so I'm making two directories
here pumpernickel and kombucha now when
you type CD P and then press tab it'll
automatically fill out pumpernickel for
you it's awesome I want to show this a
little bit more so let's make another
directory we are going to make a
directory called plump now if you type
CD PL well there's only one directory
that will match this and that's plump so
it's going to work when I press tab boom
there you go the problem comes up when
you don't type in enough characters to
make it unique so for example if I
delete down to the P and press tab
nothing happens if I press tab again
it'll list all of the options that match
that and now we have to pick which one
we would like so I can add you and then
press tab and goes to pumpernickel onyx
would you quit your drinking ok I'm sick
of your subliminal advertising because
you're my sponsor
I mean you can interrupt every single
video he obviously doesn't care that's
it for auto completion it's going to be
super helpful once you have thousands of
files and you just need to type things
real super quick the next command I
wanted to teach you is called the echo
command so it's really simple all it
does is take whatever you give it and it
will spit it back out in the console so
we could say echo and then in double
quotes we could say something like hello
world then when we press ENTER it just
spits it back out to us and you're
probably thinking wow that's completely
useless well we can actually do some
pretty cool things with this for example
we can do something like this and now we
can use a greater than sign to output
that to a file called output now when we
say LS you can see that there is a file
output how do we see the contents of
that file we get to use a new command
called cat so we can say cat output and
you can see that the output is in that
file so whenever you need to redirect
some text into a file you can use this
command right here let's try it again
echo pizza and we're going to put that
into output now when we say cat output
the only thing outputs is pizza where
did hello world go well this actually
overwrites everything in the file so you
have to be super careful when you do
something like this if you want to
append to the end of the file
meaning keep ello world and just add to
it you have to use two greater than
signs just like this now when we say cat
output there's a bunch of garbage in
there that's because I messed it up a
couple times but you guys get the point
let me try it again without messing it
up we're going to put put this into
output and then cat output and you see
pies right they're ready to be eaten
pizza cat YUM the greater than symbol
can actually be used with other commands
for example I could say LS - la and then
output that into some file let's say
LS output what would that command
normally output it would output this and
if we see what's inside of the file
using cat we could say LS output and
it's the exact same thing so if you ever
need to barf the output of some command
into a text file that is how you can do
it
sometimes when you output a file on the
screen like this using cat they're just
going to be way too much text for us to
look through there's actually some
commands to help us with that just to
show that I'm going to make the text in
the file super super long by appending
this again and then just running that a
couple times so now when I say cat LS
output well it's so much garbage holy
cow like how am I supposed to read that
well the command you want is called less
because we want to see less of the file
you see then all we got to do is say the
file name LS output and it only displays
a little bit just to make it clear I'll
clear the screen and then let's do it LS
LS output there and now you can actually
scroll using your arrow keys pretty sick
I know the trick is how do you get out
of this trap ah that's for you to find
out I'm just kidding
you just have to press Q and an
absolutely last thing I got to tell you
is if you're ever in a program that just
keeps running and running and you can't
get out of it for some reason all you
got to do is hold ctrl and press C so I
know that was a lot for one video and to
be honest the last couple videos have
been a lot of information so do your
best to learn it all but don't freak out
if you don't get it all figured out by
the end of the day it's okay I will
still be here on YouTube to teach you on
this video so thanks guys for watching
if you've enjoyed this video please be
sure to click Subscribe and if you need
all of these commands on nope be sure to
download my notes which I will link at
the end of this video and yeah that's
all so be sure to subscribe and I'll see
you in the next video which by the way
we are going to be talking about the
basics of C so we're going to start
talking about how to actually do things
and C programming
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
