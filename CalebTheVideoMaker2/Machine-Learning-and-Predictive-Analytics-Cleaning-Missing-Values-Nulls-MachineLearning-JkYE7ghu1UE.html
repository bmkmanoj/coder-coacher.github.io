for your machine learning tutorial
series now I did want to mention that
some of this information was taken from
machine learning and data prepared why
is it so hard to remember machine
learning for predictive data analytics
book which I have not really based the
series on but used it as a learning
material so one of the percentages I'm
going to use in this video I got from
that book ok let's get started we are
going to be talking about missing values
missing values are known as no so when
something is null it is missing a value
so when we are going through the process
of building our analytics base table
some of the features for example you
might have one column that has a lot of
nulls when we're looking at all of the
different rows this is a problem as we
lose values for a particular feature the
feature becomes less useful I mean think
about it if we had a million people and
we're trying to figure out if people are
likely to have diabetes and we have a
feature in here and only one person has
a value for that feature and everyone
else doesn't have anything for that well
that's not going to contribute a whole
lot to our process if everyone has a
value well then we can use that in
figuring out correlations between the
descriptive features and the target
feature so the less null values the more
useful now the book recommends that if
there is a particular feature where 60%
of values so you look at all the
different instances if 60% are missing
meaning you have 60% null then you just
want to remove the feature altogether
so if 60% then both gone and that way we
don't have that extra feature to
complicate our machine learning process
since it's not really contributing a
whole lot anyways now this figure might
vary and you can reference the book if
you want to learn all of the details so
this is looking at the feature view
which is going from top down but now I
want to look at the instance of you
which goes from left to right so we are
going to look at one particular instance
so if we are looking at one person and
what I specifically want to look at is
the target feature so down here we have
the target feature which is whether or
not they had diabetes in their lifetime
and remember this is all historical data
if we look at that target feature right
here and it's missing its value well
then the process is to just remove that
person all together and the reason we do
that is because that person does not
contribute extra information think about
it makes really good sense if we had 1
million people and we're trying to
figure out if someone is likely to have
diabetes based on the data of these
million people and we find out that you
know 900 thousand of them well they died
we don't know if they had diabetes or
not
well that means all of their descriptive
features about them
we can't correlate that to whether they
had diabetes or not so their actual data
is useless to us so we just we just get
rid of them
sorry guys I know you're like still
important and stuff but sorry ok so now
you just have a hundred thousand and
this is going to unfortunately reduce
our data set but it's going to get rid
of all that extra data that we don't
really need for the machine learning
process to reiterate on that if we had
one of those people where we don't know
if they had diabetes or not and then we
have according to our data set an exact
copy of this person well in the present
like we look back at the historical data
and there is someone who has all the
same descriptive feature values as Caleb
here you know he's he's male he's under
50 he's extremely good-looking all of
those things match up perfectly so this
is that old guy who died and this is me
and I'm trying to figure out if I'm
likely to have diabetes well we don't
know
this guy had diabetes so we're not able
to predict on me whether or not I'm
likely to have diabetes so unfortunately
I'm just can't know and his data is
useless to us so that's all I got for
missing values for this video in the
next video we're going to be talking
about a very cool process that will help
us with missing values but I just wanted
to dedicate a whole video to it by
itself so please be sure to check that
out and be sure to subscribe as that
really helps out this channel thank you
guys and I will catch you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
