Caleb's video maker 2 and this is your C
programming tutorial series now we are
going to start covering the basics of C
now we already did the hello world
program and I discussed functions and
all that good stuff but now I want to
teach you how to learn to write your own
programs so I highly recommend you get
the general structure of the hello world
program figured out almost to the point
where you can write it yourself it's ok
if you have to reference some but you
want to understand the general format of
how to write a program I don't think you
have to sit there with note cards
memorizing every single thing because
honestly that's going to come with time
just have a rough idea of where to put
what and where semicolons go in this
video the very first thing I'm going to
talk about is spacing so where do you
put spaces and C so to get started I'm
just going to create a file job we'll
just name it subscribe dot C and let's
just start with the basic format so you
want to get into the habit of writing
this out every time you write a program
now you can see I put some spaces in
here there's a space here there's a tab
over here and like how do you know where
you put those things well fortunately
for us C is a space insensitive language
what that means is we can put space
wherever you want that means I could
just the same write this like this or
like this or like this or like this and
it's all going to work exactly the same
just to prove it I'm going to exit out
of this and we'll compile this as you
can see there's no compilation errors
let's go back into our code and you
might be wondering well if you don't
have to put spaces why did I choose to
put spaces so let's kind of format this
back now I had it we can go into insert
mode by pressing I let me just kind of
clean this up you know
the reason I formatted this is for
clarity I put a distinct separation
between the includes and our first
function right here
additionally inside of these curly
braces is a code block and by convention
we indent everything in this code block
so if I was to add another line in here
I would also indent that like this that
way there is a clear visual presentation
that both of these lines are part of
this code block so now we know how to
format things well how do we actually go
about coding things well the very first
thing I wanted to introduce to you when
it comes to coding is variables a
variable is something that can store
some data that can be used later on in
our program so inside of here we can
create a variable by typing int X now
the X is just the name of the variable
you can name it whatever you want that
would work just fine there are some
conventions here though for example I
lowercase the first letter and I
uppercase to each of the other letters
if you're just doing a single variable
like int X I would leave it lowercase
this statement right here is called a
variable declaration we are saying hey
there is a variable called X we are
declaring that the variable exists how
exactly though does the variable store a
value you know like what use is a
variable if it doesn't store anything to
give the variable of value we need the
variable initialization so to do that
all we got to do is go down to the next
line and say x equals 5 or whatever
value you want to give it the only thing
is it has to be an integer value because
up here we said int so an integer is a
whole number think 1 2 3 4 negative 5 23
anything without any decimal points now
a very important word that you need to
know when it comes to computer
programming is syntax syntax is the form
or format like where do we put
semicolons where do we put equal signs
and where do we put all those other
fancy symbols and stuff
all of those rules are called the syntax
and you will become more familiar with
the C syntax as you start programming in
C now that I have this variable X let's
talk about using this variable first let
me get rid of this garbage and then up
here we are going to do some math I know
you guys probably love math most people
do so we can just create a new variable
and say int y equals x / - anytime you
see an X in our code like right here you
can think of the value five going and
replacing that X so it's five divided by
two so Y is going to equal half of five
so let's go through an example with some
simpler math x equals ten ten divided by
two is obviously five so if you were
asked what is the value of y well you
could say five the value of y is not X
divided by two it is not that that's
because the value of x is replaced here
and then the division happens and then
it gets assigned to the variable Y so
the variable Y only contains one thing
and the thing it contains an integer as
you can see right here now you may have
noticed that instead of using X here we
could have just put a 10 so I could just
put 10 divided by 2 and Y would equal
the same exact thing so why would you
ever want to use a variable like that
well if we are using the variable X you
know 10 or 20 times in our program we're
not going to want to have to repeat the
same value over and over and over again
instead we could give X a value like 10
and then just replace those values with
the variable other times we might get
the value of x from a database or from a
user and we might not know ahead of time
so we can't go in here and type in the
value of X because we don't know the
value of X so it's always best to use
variables when either of those
situations come up the last thing I
wanted to teach you in this video is the
concept of an expression an expression
is anything that can be evaluated and
the result is going to be one value so
down here we have an example of an
expression X divided by two that
expression evaluates to one value
which is five then we have the value
five inside of a bigger statement so to
summarize the key words we need to know
our expression statement declaration and
initialization up here you can see that
we declared the variable and then we
initialize the variable with the value
down here we're actually doing both
steps in one line we're declaring the
variable Y and then we're giving it some
value five in the next video we are
going to be talking about how to get
this to print to the console using
printf hopefully everything so far makes
sense to you guys and that you're
keeping up if you have any questions
please be sure to leave a comment either
I or some of the other viewers will be
able to help you thank you and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
