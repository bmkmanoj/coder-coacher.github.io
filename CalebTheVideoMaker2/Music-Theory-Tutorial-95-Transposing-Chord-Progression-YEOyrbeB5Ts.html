gotten farther into your music theory
tutorials I'm going to be going into
more advanced topics but they're not
that advanced you should still
understand them just because like whoa
there advanced I don't need a study on
them as as much no they're equally as
important so I'm going to be going over
something called transposing and we
talked about this some in previous
videos so I'm going to be going over
some of the most common ways of
transposing transposing is keeping equal
distance between certain notes but
raising the pitch of them for example if
we have notes down here and there too
low for us to sing or play we can scoot
them up and they'll still sound ok so
let's say this is c c e and g well if we
raise them all one half step we get C
sharp F and G sharp I mean let me plan
on my piano so it makes a little more
sense SI g if we transpose it up one
half step c sharp F G sharp it still
sounds similar
and that's actually the formation of a C
sharp major chord this is the formation
of a c c major chord oops what I do
there get what I'm saying so what we
learn now is that transposing is raising
or lowering the pitch of all the notes
together so one way to do this is to
look at the scale degrees this is one
method of transposing now let me show
you an example if we have a um we're
going to go you we're going to go with
the harmony so that's the courts and we
have we are in the scale of let's say
gee so the scale of G major is g a b c d
e f sharp g it's not really have sounds
but whatever now if we have the tonic
major chord we have AG major chord then
let's say we have the fifth chord that
would be one two three four five
represented with a capital V if you've
ever seen that he's in here a bit
shadows or so bad it's nighttime now so
there's no natural light in here so g d
then i take e which will be e minor
because if you remember our chord
progression it was major minor minor
major major minor diminished so this one
will be major minor minor major major
minor so this one is minor then we take
the fourth which is two three four see
so here's our chord progression so
instead of giving the letters let's give
the roman numerals g is
the first this is the fifth is a V E
minor is the sixth VI C is the fourth I
Z makes sense hopefully it does now when
we transpose all we have to do is worry
about these um scale degrees so let me
play this what were the chords again g d
e minor and C so let's play this on the
keyboard real quick G major D major D
minor so this is called the 1564 chord
progression sounds nice now if we
transpose that in to see the tonic or
the first is now the C major chord
what's the fifth well that'll actually
be 1 2 3 4 5 g major what's the 6th a
minor what's the fourth F major
convenient balance all on the white keys
so all we really need to know is that
the first ones major these are minor
major minor diminished so that's the
pattern you must memorize and it helps
things to be super easy so what if we
are in the scale of D major the sharp
notes would be C sharp and F sharp so
that's what this key signature will look
like it have one on C and one on em so
now let's figure out this Gale I mean
the certain chords for that
we'll have for the 15 1564 we would have
D major the fifth d e f g a it would be
a major the 6th would be B minor and
then the fourth which is also major will
be G so d a B minor G that is the chord
progression so that is the concept of
chord progression by the scale degree so
now when you swap keys you can just
figure out the chord progression so
let's say the chord progression was 1642
just random anything so now I from the
scale of C this is going to be see the
sixth is going to be a minor ah the
fourth would be F sorry the fourth here
should be capital here sorry about that
IV that would be F major and then the
second is going to be D minor how do we
know this well we already know that it
goes major minor minor major major minor
diminished so major minor so C's major
which is the first now the sixth one two
three four five six is minor so that
means that's minor now the fourth major
minor minor major major and then the
second is minor so that is the concept
of chord progression by scale degree
