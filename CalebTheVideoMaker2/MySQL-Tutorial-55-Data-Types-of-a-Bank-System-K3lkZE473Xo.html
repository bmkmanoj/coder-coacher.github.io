will actually be telling you that more
about each of these columns for our
little database for making and where my
stupid piece of chalk oh here it is I'd
use this little owner here but it's like
Impulse well it's like look that house
mr. Oh would you look at that it's like
yeah so I I got this larger piece right
here which is still pretty small I'm not
a chalk thanks to you guys I had to
steal this from a school what's wrong
with you guys right so member ID that's
obviously going to be our primary key
the one that keeps everything unique
within a row so this will be a int
auto-increment
not null basically what this means is
it's a number because it's a key and the
reason i'm sumed in so far is so you can
see this because it's really small so if
you if you still can't see this and it's
cutting my head off apologies my
apologies so it's an it's an integer
which it's Auto incremented which means
to go 1 2 3 4 5 6 automatically and it's
not moved so it can't be blank first
name that's going to be varchar' because
everybody's names lengths vary from
person to person so I'm going to give
them 30 characters to mess around with
which is a lot for a first name
mine's 5 so 30 but I don't know anybody
with name 30 characters but just to be
safe bar chart 30 not move last name
same thing now these should be
capitalized but it doesn't matter
phone now this one's a little different
because phone numbers are always ten
digits at least that I know if there may
be somewhere else they're more but
around here they're ten digits so this
one's going to be char and it'll be ten
this means that they should all be ten
and if they're not they'll be padded
with zeros which will kind of screw
everything up but it's better than being
a variable character because they should
all be ten digits
this one will be not known to also email
a varchar' thirty again now this may get
varchar' six there's some long emails
out there wonder what the longest email
is like what's the limit let me tell me
please
March our 60 no that's Vietnam pass for
password that one we're going to use the
sha-1 function on it which is just a
hashing function that we speak to
popular so this one will be char forward
because it's going to create a function
I was talking about is going to create a
40 digit hash this will also be horrible
stay Oh our charm 20 should be good I
don't think there's any states at least
in America that are over 20 this is this
is for American bank that is why there's
no country sorry
not no zip code that would be five all
all zip codes are five so this will be
charged address let's give them off this
far sure
so here is everything I know that took
my a year it's been cutting that off the
whole time better not have been so as
you can see they're all not noble
because most of these require the only
ones that may not be required or phone
number or email but holy crap I look
really red thanks though
oh is that red um whatever so yeah
here's our first table and I'm going to
have to erase this to make the next one
actually let's put the next one down
here so here's our other table account
ID that is going to be an int also just
like this primary key up here because
this is a primary key so int int restart
this is getting way too small for
writing and chalk especially Auto
increment
not normal you see that'll resettle
hopefully account holder that is a
foreign key up to this primary key
because this member will hold the
account will be in their possession you
see so this is going to match this one
exactly in Ottoman increment nominal
Auto increment I'm just gonna write a I
for sure right now not normal because
again way too small amount this is how
much money they have on their balance
this will be a decimal for exact
precision if you remember that
so decimal now in parenthesis it is
going to be we're going to have 10 -
basically what this does I think this is
right if it's not I'll tell you in
future is this is saying it'll give it
two decimal places after the decimal so
that's how money is counted like 10 holy
cow I'm so red is does it look red my
screen is like I'm looks like I'm on
fire but I am pretty hot but um this
will give it to decimal places like
$10.50 so you get decimal not null and
then we're going up a default default of
0 with 0 cents
that way if somebody doesn't put any
money in it'll go to zero dollars access
code the difference between access code
and password the password is to access
their account and then the access code
will be used to access individual banks
not banks sorry account this will access
their user account this will access
their different bank accounts so the
access code is actually going to be var
binary because off
oh because and then sixteen so if that's
this VAR binary that is because the
encryption AES encrypt week gives you
back sixteen digit binary crap so you
want this to be invite a bar binary and
we're going to make this normal so
here's our entire database structure by
um I can't believe you just watch me
write all this you have no life
that's I don't put that in unless you
wanna what am I talking to I'm the one
who edits is cheese</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
