going to be discussing inserting data
into a db2 database so we created this
table and I just left it there so you
can see the structure of how we created
it just in case you jumped in in the
middle of the series and you need to
create the table just run this SQL and
you should be up to speed so when we
insert data into a table it's very
important that we know the table
structure so there's two real ways you
can do that you can go to the table in
here and you can find it in the table
Explorer users and then go to either
columns here or going to data here and
seeing the names of the columns and this
will also tell you the data type so you
know what kind of data to put into the
column so let's go back to SQL and I'll
teach you the other way select star from
users and just so you guys are aware of
the capitalization standards anytime we
have key words there in all capital
letters so create table varchar' all of
those are capital anytime we're
referring to something we created we use
lowercase letters users now let's run
this and this is going to select every
column from the users table you can go
down here and click result set and you
can see the columns right here this is a
little bit more handy if you do not have
data server manager to help you find the
columns and this will help you do it in
code so once you have that table
structure we can coordinate our data
that we're inserting into the table with
those columns so to insert data what we
do is we use an insert statement so let
me just get some extra space here and
the way you do this is insert into and
then you say the table name
so users then on the next line I usually
go to the next line but you don't have
two values and then parentheses this is
the general structure inside of these
parentheses is where the data is going
to go and it has to match this structure
so the very first thing is going to be
the user ID and it's a number so we
don't quote it or anything the next
thing is going to be the first name
Caleb and we separate all of these data
pieces by commas then curry and we'll go
with Caleb
email comm is verified this is going to
be a boolean which is just true or false
in this case so comma and then we can
actually get a timestamp value very
easily by using the keyword current
timestamp and then lastly I'm gonna put
a semicolon at the end of our statement
and let's run it by holding ctrl and
pressing yes and you can see it worked
now if we go back up and run this select
statement again boom there you go
there's our data I'm not quite done
though I want to do a couple more insert
statements so let's go back down here
the next thing I wanted to show you is
that you can explicitly say what columns
you're inserting into and you'll see why
that's useful in just a minute so what
you do is say insert into users and then
in parentheses what you do is you type
the column names and then you do the
values again and you put data and then a
semicolon and now let's run this make
sure it works and you can see the insert
did work so the reason this is useful is
because you can actually rearrange the
columns now to say exactly how you want
to insert the data the end result is the
same but this this might be for a
personal preference if you want to
rearrange the columns so to show this
we're going to do a third insert
statement but we're going to change the
order of the columns just to make this
easy I'm going to take all of these
columns and I'm gonna paste them right
here but now I'm gonna rearrange them
I'm gonna take these last two columns
and I'm going to paste those right here
and let me just clean up a little bit
there we go now we can insert our values
according to that column structure so we
could say so 3 true current timestamp
Leia Smith and then Leia and then we'll
give her an email Leia email calm but
the semicolon and now we run this and it
worked so you can see how versatile this
is we can do it just like we like
another great reason for having the
columns explicitly typed out like that
is because sometimes you don't want to
insert data into all of the columns so
I'll show you an example of that now
let's just say we want to put the
user ID first name and last name so it's
an insert into users and then we just
say the columns that we want and now we
only have to put values for those
columns just like this and it worked but
how does that work when it comes to
viewing the data well that's going to
give us nulls nulls are the absence of
values this is how you make a comment by
the way two hyphens so expect to see
that word in the future because it's
very common and very popular in
databases so let's go back up to our
select statement and see our data there
you go so that is how you insert into a
db2 table thank you guys for watching
and I will see you in the next video
