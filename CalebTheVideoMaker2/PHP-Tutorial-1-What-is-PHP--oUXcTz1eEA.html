tutorial my name is Caleb curry I am the
owner of the YouTube channel Caleb the
video maker killed the video maker too
so well it's my facebook twitter and my
website Caleb curry dot-com of course
yeah so anyways in this video I will be
talking about PHP and I'm going to be
introducing this series where we will be
learning a lot about what PHP is and so
forth so if you have no idea what PHP is
and you just either you're being forced
to learn it for a job or you want to
learn it or you accidentally ran into
this video somehow I'm going to be
explaining what this is so PHP is a
programming programming language it's
what's known as a server-side and I'll
get into that in a minute so mainly PHP
is used to develop websites it can be
used to create a shell programs through
shell applications through the command
line but we're not going to be getting
into that so we're going to be
developing websites with PHP so I'm
actually going to erase this beautiful
content I know took me eight hours but
oh well so PHP is a programming language
to develop dynamic websites and that you
can use it as an interface to connect to
a database so that's two main things my
chalk is not working because I just wet
the chalkboard roll go Mads
there we go dynamic websites and
connections to databases alright so when
you're creating a website or you're on a
website you'll often find these forms so
it'll be like you have these boxes and
so forth where you can put your username
and password in well that's what's known
as html5 or text markup language I just
did a series over that so if you're
interested in that you can go back to
that will be using HTML in this series I
expect a little prior knowledge but I
mean if you don't know it that's okay
you're not going to die but if you would
like go check out my HTML and CSS series
so that's what HTML is that's used to
create the forms PHP on the other hand
takes the information put within the
forms and does something with it such as
puts it in a database or uses it to
create more web pages within the website
so what is it a dynamic website that's
something that changes the term dynamic
right here that means it can change its
dynamic versus static static does not
change it is static so static water for
example dynamic changes static does not
change so let's go over a little bit on
dynamic websites I don't know what my
chalkboard too much it's not going to
work probably shouldn't have got such a
wet rag but full-width
all right so we can use what's known as
a variable and we'll be getting into
that in a future video but in PHP you
can take values that are submitted on a
form such as a name and then somebody
puts their name in there we can assign
this to a container that stores that
value so I can name it here's how you
declare a variable in PHP and if you're
not really following me yet don't worry
I'm giving a broad overview of
everything PHP can do and then we're
going to start very slowly I expect no
prior programming language we're going
to learn pretty much all the basic
programming concepts so you're way
better programmer and then we're going
to develop dynamic websites and database
applications so we can store this in the
variable name and then we could do
something such as print main so what
this is going to do I'm not using exact
syntax as a should say something that
you will have a wow I can't believe a
semicolon at the end but that is going
to say oh it's going to print out Caleb
so I could do something such as friends
and then within a print I could say
welcome and then put the name variable
name and then it can say welcome Caleb
so forth so a dynamic website changes by
what people do with it so for example if
I change the name I put within this box
the end result is going to be different
that's what a dynamic website does so
what else can
PHP well we can connect to a database
and why would we do that well if we have
a user registration on our website so
for example the top you may see
something like register and then you can
also login well you can do that with PHP
you can develop those systems so
register you may say it may request an
email a username and a password so you
put your email in put your username in
you put a password in right now this is
all going to be taken and it's going to
be divin to a PHP script right and what
that PHP script is going to do is it's
going to make sure you're putting the
right content in it's going to try
because some people try and hack
websites or just put random stuff in
it's going to check is this really an
email address is that really the proper
format for the username for the website
is that really what are they really
trying to put a password in there and if
it passes all those tests through the
PHP script the PHP script will put it in
a database so if you don't know what a
database is that's okay
stupid fly where did you go we I did a
series over databasing you can check
that out if you want there's a total of
a hundred videos in three different
series I did a database design a data
type series and then a complete my askew
l series but if you don't want to get
into that right now that's okay you can
check that out if needed if you're
confused on some of the database
concepts basically a database stores
information so a database has tables and
we can give it appropriate rows so here
are the rows this direction which
obviously a database isn't going to
cross out their information these are
the columns
so an actual database maybe something
like this email name password and then
that PHP script sends this information
and it puts it in here adds a new row so
adds adds the email it adds the name and
adds the password then when you go to
login so now I have a login page it's
going to ask for your username and your
password so let's say you put it in
these are also going to be sent to a PHP
script it's going to check okay
are they the appropriate format for
username and password if they are
they're going to check the database does
it match is this username and password
correct if it is it's going to send it
back to the page and it's going to allow
you to sign in if it's incorrect it's
going to send it back to the page and
you're not going to be able to sign and
it will request you to sign in again so
that is just a basic use of PHP
obviously there's a lot more which I
would get into it I don't want to make
this video too long so I'm going to end
it here in the next video we will be
talking more about PHP and we're going
to be learning this in a very in-depth
easy-to-understand process so thank you
guys for watching be sure to subscribe
to my channel and I will see you in the
next video thank you and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
