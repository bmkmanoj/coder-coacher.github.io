again you look really nice today it's
kind of weird
oh but anyways then this one in this
series in this video I'll be going over
the dates uh yeah so first one
move over date time and then I'll go
over all these other ones after that so
I'm just going to erase them so we have
well I guess I'll go over them a little
date date time time year time stamp date
time consists of a date and of a time
and date for system a year so I mean
that's kind of confusing a bit time
stamp is something completely different
which look into that so let's go the
acceptable range I believe is 1000 year
1000 heroes ero 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 and then
the max value is $99.99
for the year 12 for the month and then
31 for the day 23 for the hour minutes
59 and 59 seconds that's basically the
max you can have because you can't have
it there's no such thing as a 13th month
and then the days no months go over 31
you actually break this up into
microseconds which is six digits after
the seconds so you could have two
seconds and point zero zero zero zero 55
up to six digits there now if you take
this and you break off just the date you
get up you'll come up with the next data
type which is date date is very simple
it just stores value in this form
second second so no second day day day
day so the number of letters is how many
digits so 1984 February the third that's
how that's an example that's all that is
for date four simple so here is time and
it allows for hours minutes and seconds
and also as I said you can have
fractional seconds six digits the max
for time is 839 hours 59 minutes and 59
seconds you can also have negative and
the reason for this is events can be in
the future and they can also be in the
past so let's say you have 30 hours
until your birthday
after the birthday has passed it'll
become negative so one hour after your
birthday negative 1/2 hours be negative
- so that's why this goes above 24
because it doesn't just go up to a day
it can be hours over the course of a
week or two weeks and so on now one
thing about this that's kind of scary is
if you put in an invalid entry it comes
out at zero zero zero zero zero zero
zero
now that range that we had written down
there I accidentally erased it it
actually allows for you to enter this so
if you screw something up and they turn
it converts it to this value then you're
not going to know if that's now as in
it's this value or if you just type
something wrong in so you want to avoid
invalid entries at all cost this and if
anything else but especially this year
now this can be four digits for two such
as 97 so let's say 97 that can be 1997
2000 97 and so on so it's not good to
get this to this because you're not sure
which one it will be that's why it's
always best to use the for which would
then specify if it's 19
or 2,000 or 1,000 and so here are the
accepted values per year this means if
you put 1900 like that it will be
converted to all zeros that is that
right that's an invalid entry so if you
see that that means you messed up
putting in the year or somebody messed
up all right now we have time stamp now
on 1970 this is a date to remember it's
called the epoch believe that's how it's
pronounced if if it's not correct me
please so basically a time stamp is the
amount of milliseconds from 1970 the
epoch um it is stored in UTC which is
oddly coordinated Universal Time I think
that's right yeah so basically that is
um a universal time that you can find
from any time zone plus or minus some
minutes or hours so that that converts
it all to a standard time which then the
amount of milliseconds from 1970 would
be the timestamp now this seems kind of
weird and a little odd which it is but
this will give you an exact point in
time to the millisecond so like a
gajillion and 3 so like let's say we
have 93 milliseconds from 1970 that's an
exact point in time you can't change it
and always be there um when you update a
database or enter into a database and
you have a timestamp it'll automatically
update to that point of time which would
be UTC 19 from 1970 milliseconds so I
hope that kind of makes sense it's a
little bit confusing but just think of
it as an exact time that is universal
from 1970 all right that's all I have
for data types in these three videos and
you're probably so glad because you're
probably like oh my gosh it's boring so
in the next video we'll be going over
something new we're not programming a
database yet but will be soon I'm just
going over some stuff that you need to
know before you get into this and I
promise the next video will be helpful
and we'll go over some more over
entering data into a database what you
need to know so catch you there and
better subscribe and like this video
leave me a comment some feedback
correction suggestions yeah so thanks
and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
