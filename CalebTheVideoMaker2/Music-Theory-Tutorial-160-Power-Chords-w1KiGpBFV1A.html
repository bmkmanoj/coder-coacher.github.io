to be talking about power cords yeah
their level is over 9000 so power cord
is basically a cord where it has the
root and the fifth so AC power cord with
the C&amp;amp;G that's because the G is the
width you don't know that yet you might
want to go check out some of my other
videos basically we got c d e f g a b 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 so we can take for a major
Corbin take the tonic or the route the
third and the fifth now if we wanted to
make it a power cord well just get rid
of that third in there so now we just
got the tonic the root and the fifth now
is this really a chord it's more like a
dyad rather than like a triad it's kind
of like an interval most in a harmonic I
her more a harmonic interval but we
accept these as chords and they are
power cords probably really chords I
don't know I guess they are I consider
them chords but I'm awesome some people
are just complicated and like now has to
have a least blah blah blah blah blah an
order for it to be officially accord
it's close enough to Accord my eyes now
you may see these represented with a 5 g
5 would tell us to play G
and D which is the fifth this would be
an AG power chord another way you can
see is GI and D which stands for and
determinate the reason for this is we
have a major chord consisting of let's
go with G we have G B and D and we have
a minor chord G b-flat and D so what is
making this minor well you see the only
difference between these is this middle
note so if we get rid of this middle
note and make it a power cord is it
minor or is it major well that's why we
would say it's indeterminate as in its
not decided so if you're expecting a
minor chord to be placed there this will
sound good if you're expecting a major
chord this will also sound good because
it's the same thing you just get rid of
the third if that's another reason why
thirds are pretty important because it
doesn't allow us to tell whether it's
minor or major but sometimes you won't
want it to sound like a triad so you
will make it a power cord these are
commonly played on guitars so yeah
that's all I got about power cords so
yeah peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
