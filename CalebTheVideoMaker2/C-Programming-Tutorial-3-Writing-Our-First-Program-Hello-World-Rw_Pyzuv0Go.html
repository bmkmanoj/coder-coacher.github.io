video maker tool in this video we are
going to write our first computer
program ooh magic not really it's just
programming so one tip is if you are in
the shell here and you just want to get
rid of all this crap
there is a keyword you can use and that
keyword or command is clear voila now we
are going to create a new file and we're
going to call it hello dot C now this
dot C here is how we say this is AC file
kind of like how when you have a text
file you put dot text or you'll see dot
txt somewhere exactly the same way so
let's press Enter
so when you open this and you start
typing you know like oh it's not doing
and then it finally starts working well
the reason it's kind of a pain in the
butt like that is because then has
different modes and one of those modes
of insert mode as you can see we are
currently in insert mode so to get out
of insert mode you press the Escape key
to get back into insert mode you press I
so whenever you want to type all you
have to do is first press I and then
type so let's just type some stuff in
here I meant to say Caleb but I wrote
stuff to kind of walk around like this
you can just use your arrow keys while
you are in insert mode in some upcoming
videos I'll teach you some more tricks
and some fancy ways to kind of move your
cursor around that'll be coming up in
just a couple videos oh yeah let's
delete everything now since this is your
first program you might just kind of
have to copy and put exactly what I put
but I will try to explain it the best I
can in the next video and the video
after that I'm going to be explaining
this stuff in more detail so first we
need to go into insert mode and you want
to type include and then you put stdio.h
so the very first symbol you have to put
is the pound symbol and then you put
include then you put a less than sign
standard IOH greater than sign then
enter to go down two lines and you can
put int main parentheses
blind curly brace and curly brace so
this is where the bulk of our code is
going to go like I said you will
understand all this formatting within a
couple videos but for now just get into
the habit of typing it just like that
inside of here what you want to do is
say print F and then you use parentheses
and put a semicolon that is how you do a
statement in C this is basically saying
to the computer hey I want you to do
something specifically print something
these parentheses we put some data
inside of that so hover over it and put
two double quotes back up a space and
now what we are going to put is hello
world exclamation mark to indent you can
use the tab key and then what you need
to say is return zero semicolon so if
you are completely new to using the
terminal you'll notice that the cursor
is actually a huge box so sometimes it's
a little less clear as to where you are
typing so if you are like here for
example and you start typing it's going
to put the characters right before the R
so if you need to visualize a thin line
it would be the left side of the box
that is blinking so that is where our
cursor is one other thing I wanted to
add was in this printf statement at the
very end inside of the double quotes I
wanted to put a backslash N and you will
understand what that does pretty soon
here so we've written our program now I
want to compile it and run it so to get
out of insert mode again you press
escape and then we need to save it and
escape out of the entire program so to
save it you can use : w and then to quit
you can put a Q so you just type all
that at once you just put : WQ and press
ENTER and it brings you back to the
terminal to compile this we use GCC
which is the compiler we downloaded in
the previous video hello dot C and press
Enter and you can see that it didn't do
anything
that's actually a good thing when you
get no response that means the
compilation was a success if you did
something wrong you're going to get some
errors now when you compile a file it
creates a new file that we can run to
run that file what we do is we type
period forward flash a dot out it's kind
of weird I know but trust me you get so
used to it you can type this stuff
without even looking then we can press
ENTER and you can see that it outputs
HelloWorld
isn't that cool we got to tell the
computer something to do and it did it
now let's go back look at our code and
try to explain a couple more things so
to go back into our code we opened them
again the first thing is this main here
well this is called a function and we'll
explain that in a ton of detail in the
next video but this gets ran when we
execute the program that is compiled so
when we put period forward slash a dot
out this function gets ran and inside of
this function we are saying hey we want
to print this thing right here this
backslash n is called a newline
character and it says hey after you're
done printing this go down to the next
line the return 0 is saying hey we're
done with the program and everything
went well so we can end it right here so
let's go back to the terminal and I'll
show you the output one more time cool
and cue you can see up here it says
hello world and then it goes down to the
next line that's because we did that
backslash n now if you're not so lucky
you'll have some problems with your code
and the first time compiling it's not
going to work but don't freak out don't
worry just always try again and just
remember if at first you don't succeed
don't try skydiving to illustrate
compilation errors let me go change some
of my code let's just go in here and you
know just bleh
right it quit and then we need to
compile again so to compile we do GCC
hello see oh there you can see we broke
junk so this is an example of an error
and I'm sure you will see thousands if
not millions of more of these it's very
helpful to practice reading these
because they actually might be able to
help you figure out what's wrong with
your code but for now that's all I got
to say in this video if you've enjoyed
it please click like and subscribe in
the next video we are going to explain
in much more detail all of the pieces of
this code we have right here so that's
going to be really good if you're a
beginner or you're just starting so be
sure to go check that out thanks guys
and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
