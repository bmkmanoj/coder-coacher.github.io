series I'm currently using a new edit
screen recorder so give me some time to
get used to it hopefully everything's
working alright and if not I'll be sure
to fix it for the next video and if it's
really bad the notice we recorded all
right so so far we have we're going to
going to pick off right where we stopped
so me open our web page so this is what
we have alright uh I will shrink down
our notepad so we can look at both of
these at the same time so yeah it's kind
of small but this should work we can
pretty much see everything so on our
index page this is what we have we have
the include of the header and the
include of the footer and this is what
we actually get on our website I'm going
to save it okay whatever this is what we
have on our website site alright so now
we can actually create a new page for a
form which is what we're going to do now
so we want to do is open a new page file
save as and we can just name this form
dot it's going to be a PHP file the
reason for this is we're actually going
to include the header and the footer so
I'm just going to copy the format of the
index dot PHP and then I'm going to
change the title to a news letter
signup so that's our little theme here
where we can refresh all right go to
this page by forward slash form PHP and
actually I think it actually make more
sense to save this as newsletter dot PHP
so we just renamed it and we can go to
that page newsletter PHP so this is what
we have on our website alright so we can
do is we can erase this content and we
will put new content here instead so if
we refresh we will probably have nothing
there we go and what we want to do is I
want to have a whole
and now we can end reform and then we're
going fancy so we're gonna make a
fieldset a and we're going to end the
fieldset and then within the fieldset
we're going to make a agenda and we're
going to end with a legend and if you
don't really know what's going on don't
worry just copy that's what I'm typing
in it's not
I think people worry like way too much
about the forms honestly if you don't
know how to do it you can literally look
up a test form I just type test so what
we want to do is for the action we want
to send it to handle dot PHP that's
going to handle our form and then we
want a method of post so here's our form
start and then we can drop down our form
here so this is what it looks like
terr your information and then we can
update our page and see what we have
this is what it's going to look like so
far now from here what we want to do is
a bring down the field set everything
within our field basically everything
within our form is going to go within
the field set all the tags that go away
all right and then what we're going to
do all right so we're going to add our
our inputs so what we do for this we
just create a label and then we end this
label and this paragraph - so every time
we open it we just close it before we do
anything and we're going to make a name
and then we're going to have an input
type equals text name equals name
and then what we're going to do is copy
and paste this so now we can just change
whatever this is so we can make female
input type equals text name equals email
refresh the page this is what we have so
far pretty awesome now what we want to
do is we want to add a radio button so
we're going to take a paragraph and that
paragraph within here we have to make a
label for and this is going to you're
going to be able to put your sex into
here like this
now from here we will enter the label so
basically this the radio button will
have to fill in the world the radio
button will have two options so we need
to connect this label to sex which will
be the name of the actual radio buttons
so what we do now is we can have input
type equals radio and then we say name
equals six so that connects the label to
the name and then we'll give it a value
and we will put rarely and then we can
say rarely to show up as HTML so this is
what we have so far
sex rarely and then what we need to do
is we need to create another input type
radio' name as the same name because
it's in a group with the sex so about
value equals never
all right so now basically uh this is
what we have the reason they have the
same name is because they're grouped if
they had different names you could check
you couldn't you could check them
separately so for example if I change
this one to that refresh the page well
now they're in separate groups so it
doesn't work out right and by the way if
you want to be able check more than one
this is not the proper way to do it you
will want to use checkboxes rather than
radio buttons radio buttons are designed
to only be able to check one alright so
then we end the fieldset which will end
this little box and then uh outside of
the field set what we can do is create a
submit button so create a paragraph
close the paragraph and then what we
want to do within the paragraph is make
an input type and this type will be
submit name will be submit and the value
that's what will actually show up on it
that's what we put and then we'll just
self close the tag and I haven't been
properly um the reason some of these
will have closing tags like this that's
just for um HTML standards it doesn't
really matter honestly so this is what
we have so far and what I want to do is
I want to Center this button so what we
do within this paragraph we can put a
line equals center and then save it
refresh it now this is what we have it
looks pretty awesome to be honest so
this will be our form and it's pretty
good another thing actually that's all I
want to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
