ready to make some more videos cuz I
just did a sloppy joe some mac and
cheese and some tater tots and I went to
my garage to give me a cold pop so yeah
I'm ready
let's get started well in the last video
we talked about comments and I don't
really care for this comment so I'm
going to delete it and I'm probably not
gonna comment at all for the rest of the
entire series but you never know I'm
gonna shrink the head and now we are
going to be learning about links so yeah
that's that one guy in that one game who
beats up that one guy who steals all the
princesses yeah I think that one Prince
Abboud yep nevermind links those are
things you click so a link looks like
this HTTP colon slash youtube.com
forward slash Caleb's a videomaker -
that right there is a link so if you
double click it here on the notepad plus
plus it takes you to my youtube channel
but that's not going to show up properly
in our web page you see it doesn't it's
not a clickable and it looks pretty
pretty lame to be honest so let's figure
out a better way to make links we use
what's known as an anchor tag yeah so
it's a and then we end the inning
so this is an anchor tag and we put some
text in here this is my youtube channel
refresh alright so we have have this
text here it doesn't do anything that's
because the anchor tag doesn't send us
anywhere but we can actually assign the
H by H ref so this is referring us to
another document or website I'll put the
link right in here
so I think that's right refresh now it's
clickable boom sweet so this is my
youtube channel oh man that guy is
attractive Wow two ladies out there
currently single Oh
anyways I'll get up now I cannot focus
for like more than three seconds and as
long as I continue to make these videos
I probably will always be single so I
don't even know why I said that so gosh
just get back on track
alright so leave this link so now we
have our official link here as you can
see it's purple well that's because we
visited it let's see if when we don't
when we haven't visit a link it's blue
and underlined when we click it it turns
red but if you let go it sends us that
way and then we go back it's purple so
blue is when it's not visited unvisited
red is when it's active or currently
being clicked like you click on it but
don't let go and then purple is already
visited links so that is the idea of a
that is how you what am i even
transitting
that is how you make a link in HTML so
yeah just an anchor tag close the anchor
tag H ref equals and then put the link
within double quotation marks now not
only can they send you two YouTube
channels but it can also send you to
other documents so let's make a new HTML
document and we're going to save this so
let's type some save and then we're
going to save it in the same directory
which is basically what where did I say
that oh yeah
desktop so desktop same directory same
location and we are going to name this
social links HTML
and then we put doctype HTML HTML close
the HTML tag you know we've done this
already head and the head body sorry I
stink of typing and the body sweet so
now we can add some links in here title
and then we can actually name this to
whatever we want to show up up here you
can see that right there that is what
will show up so I could say all of my
social links all right and then we can
post some links in here so if we open
this page lets to open it we can go to
let's see there's a trick here run and
then launch and whatever web browser
you're using I'm using Chrome so I could
press ctrl alt shift or or I can click
here hopefully you can saw that
hopefully you saw that Chrome yeah so
here is all of my social links so I
don't have any right now but we can make
some by making anchor tags so I like to
start just by making the base basis
basic tags and then I add from there
it's ref actually let's skip that first
Facebook YouTube Twitter so now we have
three options now I also want them on
separate lines so if you remember we can
use the break tag for those from one of
our older videos so now look at it and
it looks a lot better then we can turn
these into links so href equals H ref
equals
Hof it gets this is pretty awesome
because I can actually advertise my
social networks while we are making
tutorials so yeah I'm totally taking
advantage of this opportunity Caleb the
video maker No - that's the link that
takes you to my Facebook fan page or
like page or whatever you want to call
it which is where you can find behind
the scene content what I'm thinking
about and future videos as well as
technical support business advice and
all kinds of great stuff check out my
youtube we got HTTP colon slash slash
youtube.com forward slash Caleb the
video maker - Twitter it's too DP : / /
twitter.com slash Caleb Kurd so now
these are all links as you can see they
two of them have been clicked the blue
one I've never visited that page which
that's kind of confusing but anyways
these are all links now right so if we
click them they'll take us to our pages
there's my Facebook page here's my
YouTube page and last my Twitter page
Twitter page just I just post random
stuff so if you want to follow me go
ahead but no pressure now I want these
to be able I want to be able to get to
this page from this page so to do that
on our index dot HTML page we can make a
reference to social links HTML and
refresh it well it still says this is my
youtube channel but it's actually not
that's because I didn't change this text
click here to see my social links
awesome so this is going to take us to a
new page which will display our social
links and then you can click on each one
of these which will take you in separate
paths so that is the idea of links
that's all I really have to say for this
video so the next one will be going into
something new not sure what yet but it's
gonna be cool so be
to subscribe and I will see you then
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
