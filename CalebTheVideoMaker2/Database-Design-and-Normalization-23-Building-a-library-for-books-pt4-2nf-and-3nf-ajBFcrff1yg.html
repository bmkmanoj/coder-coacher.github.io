far this has covered everything that we
have needed except two main things and
this was if you remember professors and
their classes and students in their
classes and in this video I will be
teaching you how to properly make these
tables okay but before you even start
making a table I always like to think of
the relations okay a professor can teach
more than one class and a class for this
example is taught by one professor so
that's a one to many relationship and
then students can have more than one
class and a class can have more than one
student so that's many to many so the
very first thing is I just make I make a
table and I make another table you open
both of these ones going to be perfect
profit for professors and others going
to be for classes table two let's make
that professors
glasses now maybe an ID class ID int
class name and with college classes they
usually have like a number stating their
difficulty or their what they cover so
I'll just put this as class number which
I don't know the technical term for it
but for say English would be like Eng
101 and that that's what I mean by that
so I'm not sure what that would be cold
however in professors
instead of that
professor ID professors first hangover
that personal and for address all have
street address state city zip code now
all of this stuff could have been added
up here for the best friend but it's
fine for now and then also we will have
what else hair color because that's
vitally important
all right now we're going to make a
table an intermediary table actually and
this is going to be professors and their
classes first column class ID and then
professor ID make this the type of int
and set them both as the primary key all
right we set them both as the primary
key because they'll never change now
you'll think well maybe a class will
have a different professor but actually
it technically be a different class
because the ID would change so for
classes what I'm actually going to do is
make a table let me open this here if I
can get it open a new window and I'm
going to make this class subjects now
that really doesn't anything to do with
anything but I think that's a cool idea
because then you can organize classes by
their subject so class subject ID
something like English writing science
whatever you whatever really doesn't
even matter and then over here in
classes we're gonna edit this and we're
going to add a column which will be
class subject ID and this will be a
foreign key of course set that to int
and then over in foreign keys not
subject reference table this will go to
the class subjects
just like that so the column class
subject ID is connected to the column
class subject ID in this table now this
makes it a little more easier is to
differentiate classes of the same thing
as in if a class called English just
broad title English theirs first was
taught by mr. Doolittle and then changed
to mr. Smith well that's how you can
differentiate them by their class ID and
they'll also both be in the class
subject which that sucked okay so now
we're going to connect these over in
foreign keys Blas IB which goes to
classes calm class class then another
one professor oops
from ID ah professors professors
professors Colin professors reference
Colin professors waiting just like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
