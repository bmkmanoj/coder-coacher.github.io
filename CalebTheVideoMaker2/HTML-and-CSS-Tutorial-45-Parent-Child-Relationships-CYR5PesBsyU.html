know who I am my name is Caleb curry
owner of Caleb video maker and this is
your HTML and CSS tutorial I believe
we're on like video authority or
something 40 something I mean sorry if
you hear some loud clicking in the back
I'm at the gym right now that's some
weirdo it's probably a Claire's brother
anyways anyways what else joste is in
this video we're going to talk about
parent to child relationships or
mother-daughter relationships or hot
girl and Caleb career relationships haha
just kidding so I'm gonna illustrate
this in a paint document alright so we
can have let's say this is a pack it can
be aged I believe we've talked about
this already some and then within the
div we can have daughters right so this
can be a paragraph key tag this can be a
paragraph so you could say these are the
this is the father or the mother or the
parent would you stop thinking I'm just
playing
alright or you can have a another
daughter or child whatever going to call
this can be like an h1 tag and then you
can have content you can have content
like within you did some so you can have
you can have content within the div come
on work
okay whatever close enough you can have
content within the div I've said that
eight times you know so that's pretty
much how it work so you could say that
div is the parent and the things within
the div are the children all right and
then you can have stuff without that's
not part of the parent so for example
down here we could have a let's think we
could have a paragraph down here
yeah so let's make a paragraph down here
so this can be a paragraph that's not
part of the original document right so
then gonna have another div right and
then Oh someone Clark is that you
oh my gosh I'll be right back guys all
right so as you can see we can have the
main div with subparagraphs and within
it and a huge header then we can have a
miniature paragraph so this is like the
outline of website then we can have more
content and then we can have footer so
this could be let's say I make this look
nice so this could be a footer and this
could be another footer and we could
also have sidebars for example over here
so these could be our sidebars and then
occasionally we'll have content within
our paragraph you know what I mean so we
could have some content right here just
to tie things together so now we really
have a really good website right here so
now let's look at our code and see how
this is illustrated so we've talked
about this a lot
here we have a unordered list so if we
open the unordered list we have list
items well if you could say the
unordered list is a parent of the are
you climbing a jungle gym right now come
on
sorry guys list items are part are the
children of the unordered list the
anchor tags are a child of the list item
so this is a grandchild of the unordered
list not to get these in our CSS we
talked about it earlier we could go we
want to affect any
ordered lists let's go list items that
are part of an unordered list and then
we can stay color equals red so if we
take a look so we take the list items
I'm gonna get rid of any styling already
for the links I'm just gonna get rid of
all of this so now we have our stuff so
these are backwards I'm sorry unordered
list a list item within an unordered
list so this changes the color of these
little dots here now if we had a list
item that wasn't within a non-word list
color equals green here's here's what
it's like so we have a list item that's
not part of an unordered list that's why
it is green so that's just an example of
that now we can also do this with IDs so
I could give a list item an ID let's
name it and we could say just add on to
this any Shanique was it can be red okay
I stirred something up all right yes go
for it all right so let's take a look at
this we have Shaniqua put an extra s on
there I'm spilling something sha sha yi
q UW a hope if I quoted these properly
save that and now let's take a look at
it map and refresh the page it's red
because we're getting any Shaniqua IDs
within an unordered list so let's let's
try it with a class we're gonna change
this to class
just save both of the files including
the CSS refresh it you can see it turns
red so that's pretty awesome now let's
try something else let's create another
list item over here and whoops that's
not how you do let's tie them and list
item within here I can say content and
I'm going to give this one a class of
Shaniqua then we refresh and you can see
we have content
Shaniqua class and it's not read for
some reason why is that that's because
we are targeting it using a class that's
in an unordered list so neither this one
which is not this nor this one is
affected this one's not because it
doesn't have a class if Shaniqua this
one is not because it's not within an
unordered list what if we make an
unordered list
save it refresh you can see now it turns
red so that is pretty legit if you ask
me right so that that's really all I
have to talk about as for styling
classes and ID's that are a daughter or
a child or a grandchild or whatever or
something within the document so in the
next video we'll be talking about
something else so be sure to subscribe
and I will see you there thank you for
