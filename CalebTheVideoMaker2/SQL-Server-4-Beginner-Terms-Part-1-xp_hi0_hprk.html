be an extreme success in databases you
need to speak the right language and I
ain't talking no SQL or any other fancy
programming language I'm talking
terminology and what I mean by that is
it's important to know some specific
terms so that way when you communicate
with other experts in the field you know
what they're talking about you don't
just want to be like you know that one
thing that that one guy talked about
that helps things be unique I figured
it's called you know one be like that so
I think it's important to know some of
the most common terms just studying
these terms alone will help you get a
better grasp of databases how to
structure them how to make them all that
good stuff the first term you should
know is data not data that seems pretty
simple but we're gonna gradually more
complex data is facts information
anything you want to store for later use
when we collect a bunch of data it's
known as a database so think of data as
information and a database as a
collection of a bunch of information now
when we have a database we need a way to
interact with that database and that's
where a database management system comes
in now the database management system is
a software that allows us to use the
database sequel server is an example of
a database management system now the
distinction between all of these terms
is kind of cloudy so often people will
use things interchangeably so someone
might say oh sequel server is a database
don't be like no it's a database
management system this is because
there's they're so similar that there's
not fine lines between these terms in
fact there is another type of database
management system known as a relational
database management system now the R in
this word stands are relational a
relational database presents our data in
tables essentially the database
management systems job is to take data
that could be scattered on the
computer's hard drive or solid-state
drive and present it in a beautiful way
so let's go classic we'll go with the
hard drive
say this is the hard drive right and you
have data just stored all in this thing
right well you want to look at this data
in a certain way the database management
system will take all this data and
present it to you in a nice beautiful
table that's what a relational database
management system is sequel server is
also a relational database management
system but not all database management
systems are relational so if you had
this circle that represents databases
this might be relational databases all
relational database management systems
are database management systems
obviously from the name but not all
database management systems are
relational for example we still have all
of these ones out here that are not
relational now the important thing to
take away from these words is relational
that's a fancy word that means table now
what exactly is a table well you can
think of it as a square and this table
is going to have a name and inside of
the table there's going to be columns so
each column is going to have a header of
what that column is called
so it really depends on what the table
is about but you could have a table to
store recent orders for example so the
name of the table might be orders and
the columns might be like order ID date
ordered who ordered it stuff like that
now this is just an example as to how to
actually structure this data that's
something that requires database design
which we'll talk about that in upcoming
videos but let's just say this is the
perfectly designed table and we want to
store information in this table that's
where the term row comes in
so a row is a record of information that
goes this way and gives it value for
each one of these columns now this is a
really bad example of the kind of data
you it storing here but essentially
every single purchase is going to be
entered into this table as a row so this
will probably be called me purchases
table and every single row would be an
example of a purchase or you can think
of it as an instant
of a purchase so we could have another
one in here with the idea of eight this
guy bought a house three hundred dollars
she bounced who bought it the guy with
the idea 112 date purchased so the two
key words here you really need to know
our column and row there are a few other
terms you will come across including
record and record is essentially another
name for a row you'll also hear the term
field which I use that to represent one
value within a column and you can also
hear that called a cell there's a lot of
different terms that you need to become
familiar with now when you are inputting
data into this table sometimes you will
leave a field blank
for example we can have the idea of 10
stuff we could have them buy a total
cost $300,000 who bought it the dude
with the idea of 96 but the date
purchased we don't put that information
in when we do that that is called a null
or a nulls a null is essentially the
absence of a value so I'll just continue
my list down here some people think
nulls are acceptable some people don't
think they're acceptable and it
ultimately depends on what column it's
in for example having the stuff null
would be not okay because it's a
purchase how can you have a purchase
without buying anything and even in this
situation the date purchased would
probably want to have a value every
single time so making those decisions of
what's allowed to be normal and what's
not allowed to be null brings up the
idea of database design again not for
those of you who've seen my other series
you know I really focus heavily on
database design so the start of my
series are almost all identical because
we go through the whole database design
process but I find that it's very very
very important because your database
design decides how your database is
going to work what kind of tables are we
going to create what are we going to
store in those tables what are we going
to name our tables what columns have
what attributes all of that information
is decided by our database
design and the database design helps us
to protect data integrity now I'm not
going to write that one because that's
actually the term we are going to start
with in the next video so thanks guys
hopefully all of this information was
somewhat useful these are beginner terms
so you're going to come across a lot
more as you go on but it's very
important that you understand this
foundation and have it in your brain so
thank you guys for watching I really
appreciate it be sure to click like and
subscribe and as always I will see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
