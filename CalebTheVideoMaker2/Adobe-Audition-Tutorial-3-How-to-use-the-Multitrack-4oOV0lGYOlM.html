third Adobe Audition tutorial and this
I'm going to be talking about the
multitrack so in order what this is is
here we have a bunch of untitled audio
files and then we have lalalalala
and with audition you can combine these
to make like a master like put
everything together into a single file
so this is called the multi track so if
I click file new multi track session or
ctrl n as you can see we're going to
name this first multitrack session
subscribe and my footer location as you
can see it's in my music folder it
doesn't really matter we're now sampling
rate that's I'm gonna drop this down to
match my microphone here and then uh
click OK and yep that's all so now this
is what it looks like and basically each
one of these will be a different bar to
store files so we can put the
la-la-la-la-la file right here and then
we can do is we can play the entire
group of files the entire group of files
so I can drag this file down here too
and yeah
don't care so now I can play both of
these together we can see my voice way
that that is impressive right so what we
can also do is we can actually be quite
dog ah well we can actually do is we can
record in the multitrack too so if you
remember in the waveform all we had to
do is click this record button and I
could start recording just like this see
I just over recorded that and I can stop
it and if you ever screw anything up
when click edit undo so if I'm in the
multitrack what I have to do is prepare
a single track to record because if I
click record how is it going to know
which track to insert it into so I'm
going to click track 1 and then down
here we can see a little our set arm for
recording so this basically means it is
monitoring my levels and it's ready to
record so the next thing I do is just
have to click this record button so
let's try and make a song here
sweet and now what we can do is we can
turn that off and then mute it now we
can go down here it's prepared to record
then click record c-suite now if we play
this back it's going to sound horrible I
promise oh yeah
got on mute the other ones right so I'll
meet this play these back together
oh yeah turn it off so as you can see it
didn't really fit out so well so what we
can do is we can cut off the beginnings
and makeup line up straight okay so what
we can do is we can cut these shorter so
it's little and then sort of line them
up so that looks a little better you can
see that they're starting to line up and
then if I play it it will probably sound
a little better so the some beats didn't
really match but that's cool okay so if
you wanted to finish the file what we
can do is click multitrack and then
x-mas I mix down session to a new file
entire session and what this is going to
do just like how we had original laa-laa
files and my beatboxing which was pretty
horrible this is now a single file in
itself so if I play it it's going to be
those two files put together which are
pretty horrible so from here I can save
this file file safe and I'm going to
name this beat boss that sucks really
bad cuz it was pretty horrible and I'm
going to save it in wav format and
that's all good so I click OK and then
you can see I have a new file saved that
clip my la-la-la la-la-la la-la-la then
I have my beatbox into file so
that is the basics of the multitrack and
in the next video I'm actually going to
be teaching you more about using Adobe
Audition as in knowing what to do when I
mean I know that doesn't make any sense
so just watch my next video it will be
sweet and subscribe thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
