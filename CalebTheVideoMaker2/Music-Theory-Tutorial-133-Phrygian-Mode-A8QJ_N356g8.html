to the third mode Phrygian it's spelled
with a p fridge and I think this is fun
right mode so what is the Phrygian mode
it's a pattern consisting of half whole
whole whole half whole now if we are at
any key this is the same thing as
starting on the third scale degree so in
order for all the notes to be diatonic
or within the scale we must start on the
third scale degree for example if we're
in the key of C we must start on E so
the Phrygian mode in the key of C of E
would be e f g a b c d back to eat so
what is the Phrygian mode of e well this
will be the answer because we're
following this pattern right here so
let's clear this up some oh I just wrote
him a wall accidentally oh well let's
show this on the keyboard half whole
whole whole half whole whole half whole
whole whole half whole so that is the
pattern of the Phrygian mode let's try a
different one let's start in the key of
a let's try a different one let's start
in the key of a so we know the scale of
a has three sharps we had first draw the
letters a b c d e f g back today we have
a we have C sharp F sharp and G sharp
those are all of the notes within the a
major scale if you don't know this check
out your circle of fifths and learn
about that so let's draw a staff here in
black one
345 let's add these notes in here we
have C sharp F sharp and G chef so how
would we make the Phrygian mode diatonic
using only these notes we would start on
the third scale degree one two three so
we're going to start on C sharp and
since this counts all the way even if we
have a see down here same concept this
is still a c-sharp even though the sharp
is up here so we have c d e f g a b and
then see so here is the Phrygian mode
and the key of a but what is the
Phrygian mode on it's on see why is that
because in order let me just show you
this to you let me show this to you so
this little black note here that's C
sharp the pattern by the way is half
whole whole whole half whole so C sharp
half to d their whole to e their whole
to F sharp there remember we have a
sharp sign for their whole to G sharp G
with the sharp sign there oh I don't
remember if I i lost my spot so anyways
we go half oh oh oh half o
so we went through all of the diatonic
notes of the a major scale by starting
on the third scale degree so that's just
a way you can think of that this is like
the natural minor scale with a lowered
second if we did it on a we would have a
b c d e f g with a b-flat cool I know
and the way you can think of this in
order for this to be a third we would
have to start on F now what are the
notes in the F major scale and the
reason this would be a third just
because F G a one two three so the notes
in F major scale are F G a B flat C D so
that's all I have to say about the
Phrygian mode and the next video we will
be talking about Lydian mode
