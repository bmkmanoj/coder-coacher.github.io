maker to this video we are going to be
covering the floating-point data types
specifically float and double these data
types are used to store estimated values
the numbers that they store can only be
so precise they are well known for
causing problems when doing math
problems we will get some weird numbers
and some odd results and the reason that
is is because these data types are only
capable of maintaining a certain level
of precision that means you only want to
use these data types when you don't need
exact values if you do want exact values
you will want to use a fixed point data
types as what they're known as and that
could be decimal if you're using whole
numbers you could use int and even if
you're not using whole numbers you could
still use int and then do some kind of
math on it for example if you wanted to
store money in an int column you could
store as cents and then you could divide
that number by 100 to get a dollar
amount but I'm getting off topic so
let's get back to the topic of floating
point numbers why exactly are they
called floating point it has to do with
the fact that we can present a number in
multiple different ways for example
let's say we have the number 150 another
way we could present this number is some
numbers multiplied by 10 to the power of
something so for example 1.5 times 10 to
the second power and if you work this
out you would get 1.5 times 100 is 10 to
the second power is um hundreds and then
1.5 times 100 is 150 so you can see
these are two different ways to present
the same value and if you think of where
the decimal point is and this situation
is here and in this situation is here so
you can kind of see it as floating
across the numbers I am probably going
to butcher this entire explanation but
if you want to know tons of detail look
them all up online
for now that's a pretty good explanation
essentially with this data type behind
the scenes we are going to store some
number and then store what we are going
to multiply it by this is known as
scientific notation another way to
present this would be
1.5 e - that's just a another
representation of the same thing here
the e means times 10 so 1.5 times 10 to
the second power that means when we
store a number of one of these datatypes
we're not destroying the number we are
storing the sign bit whether it's
positive or negative we are storing what
to multiply the number by and we are
storing the number itself so when we
have a certain size for one of these for
example float takes up four bytes not
all of the bits within those four bytes
are used to store a value that's kind of
a good thing but it's also kind of a bad
thing it's a good thing because since
we're storing some number to multiply by
it's going to allow us to store much
larger numbers in a smaller amount of
space the downside though is because
let's say this is the number we are
storing our data in and this want to
take in with this and assign bit well
this is on as less for the actual number
because of this we have lower precision
so in summary we have be benefited
storing larger numbers at the cost of
having lower precision lower precision
than what I guess to be lower precision
than if we stored the entire number as
an exact value such as using the decimal
data type now you have to ask yourself a
question
should I use this data type show you is
either one of these it really depends on
the type of data you're storing and
sometimes it's perfectly fine for
example let me let me clean this mess up
let's say you have the number fifteen
trillion I believe that would be this
you can see we are storing a huge number
but the actual two numbers that are most
important to preserve are these two
right here that's because we can
represent this number and 1.5 times ten
to the thirteen in this situation we
don't need a whole lot of precision
because we're only storing two numbers
that are going to really be important to
us the length here is going to be
preserved what would change though is if
we had like a six here well it would be
hard to ensure that the six is always
going to be a six especially when we get
into doing man
you can get all kinds of funky results
so if we have some crazy number as we go
this way we have less assurance of
precision now I said both of these are
floating-point numbers so what exactly
is the difference well it just has to do
with the size flow it's four bytes as I
said earlier and double is eight bytes
and because the double has more bytes it
can maintain a higher level of precision
so how much precision can you expect
from these numbers well a float you
should be able to maintain around seven
digits and then with double you can
maintain around sixteen the actual
number you can store though is much
thinking huger than fifteen digits so if
we were trying to sort something like
this we would be wise to pick the double
data type now in what situations you
want to use flow well in general if you
have the option you most of the time are
going to want to click double that's
because for obvious reasons it has a
higher level of precision and minus QL
does its calculations using the double
data type so with float you can get some
odd results now with double you can get
some odd results too we can get more odd
results with the flow
so I would Bank on the side of trying to
store all your data as the double data
type although that is not required the
ultimate decision is up to you just be
sure you understand the differences
between these two data types that's all
I have to say about float and double I
know I didn't go in tons of detail and
honestly this is a topic that is pretty
confusing I'm reading it online I'm like
what so I covered the bare minimum of
what is required to understand what the
float and double datatypes are but if
you want to know the exact specifics go
to Stack Overflow or Wikipedia or
something like that
in conclusion float and double our data
types that can store tons of numbers
including numbers after a decimal point
but they don't maintain precision if
you're unsure whether you should use
float or double just remember that
prepare for trouble
make it double I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
