form video made sense and that you kind
of understand it it's kind of a lot to
grasp at first but basically all you
have to do is prevent it from being
non-atomic and also prevent it from
being multiple columns of similar
information so to get out of first
normal form just get rid of extra
columns that are very similar as in
actor one actor to actor three actor for
exam that's that's a good example the
second normal form is basically getting
anything that is not anything that is
not dependent on a key in a table and
removing it okay guys I put this up
closer so you'd be able to see better so
you might not be able to see me talking
okay so basically here's an entry they
want your name your age and your
favorite book and I put my favorite book
as understand physics but that's a
complete lie
alright so let's say I actually have two
favorite books because I really like
biology for example I don't either but
so let's just make another entry in this
so my name is Caleb my age seventeen my
favorite book biology I don't have
anything against biology or physics it's
just not my favorite
I like physics um alright so now this is
what we have do you see a problem I do
for one they already know I'm 17 why do
they need to know again but this
basically gives it away you do not need
to know my age seven you do not need to
know that my age is 17
twice so what do we do should we get rid
of the age I think not I think the
problem is actually overview
because favorite books is not relevant
to the primary key now
I actually didn't write the primary key
but it would just be that I g1 so yeah I
D one for Caleb
now there's two entries with ID one
that makes two primary keys with the
same number so that's definitely wrong
so this pretty much gives everything
away now you got to think about this how
can you fix this you automatically know
this is not in second normal form
because this is not reliant on the key
okay guys I recorded this and I realized
it's a little more difficult than I
thought so I'm gonna try and explain
this a little better because I didn't so
well in the video basically the second
nf rules say it has to be real anything
has to be reliant on a key and a really
simple example of this is like today's
weather if you put that with the
students information it's completely
unreliable
that has nothing to do with the student
information at all the way I have this
setup favorite book is reliant on the
key the thing is when you allow it to be
more than one book if you have like
three favorite books then it becomes a
many-to-many relationship this is
because a student can have more than one
favorite book and a specific book title
can be favorited by more than one
student so the proper way to do this as
stated in my previous videos is an
intermediary table and an intermediary
table is not reliant on a key you would
not want to store that with the student
information because if you had a table
student favorites favorite books that
has nothing to do with the specific
students information so I hope that
helped clear things up and the way I
have this written where it says favorite
books
it should say this the books ID
connecting it to the other table which
would be the books alright thank you so
this over here would be a table
and let's put an ID in here I know it's
one now this is the primary key so PK
sometimes I just write that to read to
make sure I remember that now this over
here student ID this is the foreign key
to this over here and if you'll remember
foreign key is a reference to another to
a primary key in another table that
keeps these connected and then if you
need to get the results of the students
age with their favorite books you can do
it join or you can get separate results
and then just get the information
separately and put it together yourself
basically instead of listing your
favorites book favorite books with your
student information you separate them
you have to do the first normal form
before you go into the second normal
form so that's basically I just I mean
you know about second normal form and
the next thing we'll be doing is third
normal form</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
