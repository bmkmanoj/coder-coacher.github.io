it is 404 p.m. just random information I
am the owner of Caleb's video maker and
Caleb video maker - and I am ready to
create some new tutorials because I just
ate a bowl of cereal and took a shower
well like not at the same time that'd be
kind of weird well unless you had like a
waterproof food I guess you can eat like
fish yeah anyways I'm getting off-topic
this tutorial series we'll be going over
HTML and CSS and if you don't know what
that is don't worry if you just ran
across this video somehow we're going to
talk about it in a minute and I'm going
to explain what it is we just want to
say real quick I'm going to be making a
PHP or something of the like tutorial
series very soon and I wanted to give a
brief overview of all these concepts
that will help PHP programmers to
understand because I don't want to spend
my whole time in PHP series talking
about stuff that would be that should
are to be known so this series is going
to be like quick introduction for
beginners on HTML and CSS
all right so HTML stands for hypertext
markup language CSS stands for cascading
style sheet I believe and basically
these are used to create websites HTML
puts content on a website so if you look
at this beautiful website right here
this title here is HTML the search bar
is HTML this picture is inserted with
HTML this video is brought on to this
page using HTML this little subscribe
button this is actually a picture that
is also a link so it indeed is HTML if
you click it it'll bring you to my
youtube channel and I think it asks if
you want to subscribe I don't know so
all this stuff is inserted with HTML now
CSS on the other hand that is what
styles it to look the way it does so as
you can see I have a video here why did
it why isn't the video over here where
this tweet box is why aren't these
switched places
well the cascading style sheet design
the webpage in a way that that looks
nice in my eyes and then people view it
this way so if you've ever seen forms or
anything like that so you go to a
website to ask for you to sign up for
something like let's use a search bar
for example let's say I asked for a
username and you type in your user name
right and then you search it which this
will bring up like every single video of
mine yeah I figured so anyways that if
you want to do something more with what
you search with you can use a
server-side scripting language so hTML
is just for looks this search bar is not
going to do anything unless you program
and programming is done with what's
called a server-side scripting language
and that's what I was going to teach
soon PHP is one of them so if you want
to get into that check out my upcoming
videos or my databasing videos are good
for well I guess you need something to
interact with the database anyways I'm
getting off-topic basically HTML is the
content of a website such as the words
the the grouping so like this right here
might be a div which it you probably
don't know what that is but it's just a
division of the website besides this it
keeps the platform looking nice what the
CSS is what designs it to look like a
website so if you just use HTML it's
just going to look like a bunch of words
but CSS puts it into a website design
and we're going to be focusing a lot on
HTML forms because I don't feel people
address those very well so I'm going to
be going over a lot of those as well as
some basic CSS and just as a side note
this tutorial is going to try I'm going
to try to make it timeless so basically
this is going to be concepts that will
allow you to be able to pick up new
concepts so forth so that way in a year
so hopefully all this stuff is still
usable and not out to date at night out
of date all right so the first thing I'm
going to do is uh we're going to program
HTML and you can do this with just a
notepad
so you may you may have like a notepad
here right but the thing is this notepad
is really crappy so we're going to
download a really new one if you want to
use that one you can I don't recommend
it it oftentimes adds texts extensions
to your files so it's not really an HTML
of HTML file and it's confusing so we're
going to download a new one so what you
can do is you can type in notepad - + -
+ dot board and that will bring you to
their website or you can just search it
on google or whatever notepad plus plus
will be the first one that comes up go
to the home page and you can download
this file so there's this huge download
button right on the Left clicky clicky
notepad plus plus installer wait for it
to download I have slow internet so it's
going to take forever okay that wasn't
so bad
so you can see it down here I think you
can see that hopefully I didn't cut off
you can click this click open or if
you're using Internet Explorer or
something it'll come up in a new pattern
basically all you need to do is click
save and then open it once it's done
saving it'll you can't see this I don't
think but a window that'll pop up that
says user access control and it says do
you want to allow the following program
from an unknown publisher to make
changes to this computer blah blah blah
blah blah publisher file blah blah
showed yes is click yes select a
language my main language is English and
PHP just kidding so I'm going to click
OK click Next definitely read this
there's a lot of good stuff in this so
if you're looking for a a book that's
really good read that so when you get to
the destination folder you will wanted
something like this the chances are
though yours is going to say AC instead
of a G C is in cat instead of GE as in
gorilla this is because I messed with my
computer some and I'm on a different
partition so install it on C if you
don't really know what you're doing put
put this C colon backslash Program Files
x86 backslash notepad plus plus if this
x86 isn't there that's probably okay -
don't worry about it just depends on
your operating system and just G that's
it so I'm going to change my back to G
next and you can install this stuff
doesn't really matter I'm pretty sure
all right so I'm just going to click
Next and show you what happens create
shortcut so boom everything is completed
if you get an error that pops up just
try clicking ignore and see if it'll
still work if you ignore installing them
files because that's what happened to me
last time and I had to restart so it
should work if you just try ignore and
once you're done click finish this page
will come up this my friend is notepad
plus plus so it'll show you all the
lines over here you can type you can so
if I put up oops my bad if I put a bunch
of content here and then I copy it all I
can copy ctrl C and I can paste it ctrl
V so as you can see it keeps going to
the right you may not like you might not
like that so you can do is click view
and then go down and there should be
somewhere that says word wrap right here
you can click this and it will take it
all and smash it into one block and as
you can still see on the left it is
still on line one
so notepad considers this line one even
though it takes up multiple lines that's
because I didn't press ENTER for press
ENTER it goes to a second line so that's
all I have to say in this video and the
next video we will continue and we will
be talking about starting our HTML
program and start building a little
website or whatever so I shall see you
then
