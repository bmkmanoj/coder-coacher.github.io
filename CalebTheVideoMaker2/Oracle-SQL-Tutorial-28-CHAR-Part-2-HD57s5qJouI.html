tutorial series in this video we are
going to continue our discussion on the
char data type but this video is going
to talk about only one small thing and
that is what value is allowed inside of
this parenthesis what is the range that
is acceptable well the lowest is
actually char 1 and this would allow up
to one byte of data what about the
maximum though the maximum is actually
2,000 and this would allow up to 2,000
bytes
yeah I know that seems pretty simple but
there's a reason I thought it'd be good
to separate this into its own video
because unfortunately it's not that
simple yes these are the values you can
use anywhere from one to two thousand
but using these values can introduce new
errors for example if we declare this as
char 1 and we don't specify keyword char
here it allows only one byte what
happens if we try to put an Asian
character into that column well we are
going to get an error these kind of
problems increase what's known as
runtime errors and these are very bad so
for example if you're working with the
programming language like Java and you
type something incorrectly you might get
what's known as a compiling error that
means we can't even compile the program
but runtime errors is when the compiling
works but the program itself does not
work we get an error when we run the
program and the bad thing about these is
that it can happen anywhere for example
in our code if we have even one if
statement the path divides into two and
then if we have let's say a switch and
we divide into five same over here and
you can see that all of these endpoints
would have to be individually tested for
runtime errors and what that means is
runtime errors are very hard to find for
example in our application we might only
talk to the database at this endpoint
and now we talk to the database so we
insert an Asian character into this char
one and we get an error
so that means part of the time on this
case are we going to get in there if we
put an English value it's going to work
because English characters only use one
byte so you can see how finding this
thing can be pretty rough the same thing
goes for char 2000 that's because this
is two thousand points and if this is
two thousand bytes what happens if we do
this you can see here we're specifying
two thousand characters well Oracle was
actually going to be ok with this but in
my opinion this is not okay that's
because with certain encoding such as
utf-8 certain characters can be multiple
bytes and either way the maximum is
still two thousand bytes so even though
we put two thousand characters if we for
example put a thousand and one two byte
characters into a value of this column
that would total two thousand and two
bytes which would actually break the
thing so just because you can specify
char here does not mean we go past the
limitation of having only two thousand
bytes and it's just very important that
you guys are aware of these limitations
so they don't come back and bite you in
the butt that's all I have to say for
this video hopefully that I was hopeful
please be warned on these issues always
be careful when you're going to the edge
cases of the lowest or the highest
because that's when the issues usually
start to show up if you liked this video

I will see you in the next one thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
