database clustering series this is Caleb
from Caleb the video maker - got a lot
of good useful information in this video
so I'm hoping it's helpful for you guys
let's get started so in the previous
video we talked briefly about Galera and
Galera is an example of a database
clustering technology and this
technology basically just describes oh
the infrastructure and also some other
things so this is a master master
infrastructure or topology I should say
and what that means is that all of your
nodes are an equal standing you can
write data to all of the nodes and you
can read data from all of the nodes so
if you have multiple nodes obviously
data is going to have to be transferred
somehow because you know we write to
this node well how exactly does that get
replicated to these nodes and when does
that happen well there's two real
categories of how that happens and that
is synchronous versus asynchronous
probably going to spell this wrong but I
don't know and also a synchronous let's
talk about asynchronous first the way
asynchronous data transfer works is it
just happened sometime in the future
you're not really sure when it happens
you just know that it will happen
so I write to this node first and then
eventually that data will be replicated
down to the nose
but we're not guaranteed you know hey
this is going to take twenty seconds or
five minutes it's just going to happen
sometime now I think some databases give
you the capability to kind of determine
the time frame of within how long you
want that to happen but I don't think
you were going to always have that
capability so essentially when you're
working with asynchronous transfer you
cannot always be guaranteed that these
nodes the ones that are getting
replicated too are up-to-date and that's
a term called slave lag and it's kind of
weird because we're in a master master
topology here but Galera actually is
synchronous which is a little different
so if we're using an asynchronous system
we're probably in a master/slave system
where the data gets replicated from the
master down to the slaves and that time
that time difference is called slave lag
so for example with you write to this
master and then immediately read from
the slave that data might not actually
have propagated yet down to the slave
and you might be getting not up-to-date
data so that's why I like synchronous
and what that means is the data is
transferred immediately as soon as you
make the change here it's going to
propagate to all of the nodes cólera
has a pretty cool system where all of
the nodes have to be a mutual agreement
that the data can be written and all of
the data is going to be applied
immediately it's kind of confusing how
Galera works on this and I kind of get
it but not entirely sure I get all of it
to be honest but essentially you make a
change and this node will propagate that
change down to the other nodes and let's
say this knows this
oh yeah that's ok well it's going to
keep those changes on that node and then
this one says it's okay and once they're
all in agreement then you're good but if
for any reason one of these says oh no
we can't apply that for some reason well
then all of those changes are going to
be rolled back and that data is not
going to be inserted into the database
yeah I probably totally just slaughtered
the way it works but that's my Caleb
curry explanation aka incorrect I think
it was close enough though the downside
with synchronous though is that the
writing process altogether kind of takes
longer because we have to get agreement
amongst all these things before the
official change is applied that means
when we're writing to our database that
transaction is going to take longer
whereas if a master slave topology you
can just write to the master boom it's
done and then that data change gets
applied everywhere so it's kind of a
give and take it just depends on what
you're working with in your situation
whether you would like synchronous or
asynchronous that is all everyone that
gives you the rundown
of synchronous and asynchronous
technologies for transferring data and
how that works and these terms are
pretty Universal in programming so if
you haven't heard these terms you'll
definitely want to memorize these
because this is a very common thing to
describe how things happen if something
happens sometime in the future it's
asynchronous
if it happens right away and we actually
have to wait for it to finish
synchronous and they're both good things
it just depends on the situation so if
