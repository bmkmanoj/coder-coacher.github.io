over absolute versus relative interval
sizes so we have absolute i'll explain
in a second and then we have relative we
have been using relative interval sizes
and that's to say as in for a a chord we
can have the root so here's the root so
let's let's say it's C then we have a
major third from see that would be e
then we have a minor third from E I
guess these should be up here so let me
redraw this real quick we have I see a
major third which brings us to eat and
then we have a minor third which brings
us to G so that is relative because
we're relating back to this one right
here and we're relating back to this one
same for 7th chords we could add a minor
third and it points back to here and
this would give us a a dominant 7th or a
major / minor 7th chord now what is
absolute measurement well that's always
measuring from the root right here now
let me give you an example if we were to
create the same thing make some room
here using absolute measurement we
always measure from the route we have C
right and if we're going to make a
seventh chord this is why they're called
seventh chords by the way so first we
have a major third and then we
relatively added a minor third and then
we added another minor third to give us
a dominant sort of made dominant seventh
seventh chord so what if now we have see
EG b-flat sorry i shouldn't be flat if I
said being lost them but anyways what if
now we measure it like this Cee Cee 2g
C to B flat well this this up here is
relative this down here is absolute
because it doesn't change now see for
relative these things all relate back to
the previous know so if one of these
changes let's say we flat this note B
flat well now the distance between these
notes grew the distance between these
notes shrunk so it kind of throws
everything off you know what I'm saying
because here I'll all illustrate this in
a better way I'm such a genius okay here
we have two notes so we have C E and G
cool eh so if we fought this note it
moves closer to the C E flat so this
distance shrinks and this distance grows
because it's relative now this is
pointing back to hear but if we're an
absolute only this distance shrinks
because this is measured from the root
so when we're creating courts you will
often see absolute measurements rather
than sorry where we will see absolute
measurements so for a major triad will
see the root see for example that can be
anything then we'll have a major third
and a perfect fifth kula so major third
has four half steps perfect fifth has
seven half steps so for from c.c 1 2 3 4
e now that's that one now for the
perfect fifth from C 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
gee that is the basis of absolute
measurement now if we had a seventh
chord let's say a major seventh not a
dominant seventh that originally as I
told you consisted of a major third
minor third and a major third if we're
an absolute measurement it's a major
third line up non lancet sorry a perfect
fifth and a major seventh so a major 7th
has 11 half steps perfect fifth has
seven and a minor third has three so
let's create one of these and let's
start on G this time yeah g then let's
start from g here's G 1 2 3 4 B that's
the major third oops are from g we go
away perfect fifth seven half steps 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 d now we go 11-5 steps from g
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 f sharp and
another way you can think of that is an
octave has 12
so you just subtract one F sharp so this
is a major seventh Oh seventh chord
major seventh grade so this was using
absolute measurement that measurements
that's why we have the seven because
we're adding a seventh a major seventh
on to the chord we're taking the seventh
scale degree of the G Major scale g a b
c d e f sharp and G we have one two
three four five six seven eight we had
the root the major third the perfect
fifth and the major seventh hopefully
that'll makes good sense and that is the
basis of absolute measurements yeah
pretty awesome i know so yeah and also
by the way another way to think of this
is as the chromatic diatonic thing
remember in the last video or however
whenever was we had the notes within the
scale a major seventh is within the G
Major scale if we had a dominant seventh
we would have a flat seventh or
philosophy thur one so that's another
way to think of it dud f sharp was
diatonic if we wanted a dominant seventh
we lower that taking out taking it out
of the scale to make a chromatic and
giving us an F which is a flatted 7th so
that is what you'll see some times and
you're creating in your cord creation
travels or adventures so yeah that's all
I have to say for this video and next
video I'm going to go over something
cool so I'll see you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
