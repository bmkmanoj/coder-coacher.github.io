series hopefully you are all having a
wonderful Christmas in this video I
wanted to talk about a bunch of little
random things so first off I wanted to
say I added a new link to our navigation
just so we can easily go through our
pages so I added a link to our
newsletter on the left-hand side to do
this I just modified the header file
added a new link pretty simple and I
think you guys can figure that one out
so now I don't have to type it in at the
top I can just click it on the side so
basically we're just building a little
web page here it's temporary and it'll
work for now all right so the next thing
I want to talk about is first I want to
change these gender these sex things to
male and female and get rid of this joke
here so value equals male value equals
female and save that then on handled PHP
we need to update this so to do this I
don't actually I think it's still good
because we never used the specific
values of the PHP so what we need to do
now is we can actually use those values
so we can decide if it's a boy or a girl
so what we can do is within our if
statement we can have another if
statement so that means this if
statement is only going to be ran if the
first conditional is evaluated as true
and what we're going to test is the
value of sex so as you can see here's
the variable sex which we get from the
value of the request array which this is
an associative array so this key points
to a value if we assign this to a
variable we're creating a shorthand
variable we're taking that value and
storing it as a string in the variable
sex so we want to check if this sex is
equal to male and if it is we can just
test it echo
you are a guy know what can do so we had
a little else statement elsif what this
means is that we're having another
option within here and within the here
we want to test the value of sex and see
if it's equal to female if it is we can
echo out you are a girl so let's just
try this out we can save our pages
refresh our page name whatever does
really matter email whatever and okay I
also need to update this real quick male
and female let me refresh this right F
it doesn't only matter submit and it
says you are a guy you can just ignore
what's over here if we go back and click
female it will say you are a girl so
that's how we can test actual values
within our PHP script alright now
there's only one other thing we will
need to do is we need to say all right
what if they don't submit either male or
female and looking at this you'd say oh
it's possible there's only two options
but if someone wants to maliciously
attack your website they can easily
change your form or create a form that's
submitted to your PHP page which would
then give them the opportunity to give a
different value and I will hopefully be
demonstrating that in an upcoming video
all right so now what we need to do is
we need to create a final else that
basically just says if nothing else was
successful if it you're not a male or
you're not a female then you are
something else
enter a correct value refresh the page
watch this it it's still going to work
but if we change the page to allow us to
put in another value well then this is
going to cause an error until us too
enter a correct value so that is how we
can easily test specific values in PHP
and now just to make this webpage a
little more clear I want to sort of
clean up our our page so the first thing
I want to do we can actually use these
values to create a custom page so we we
can say we will email you shortly before
we say this we could say thank you and
then use the name name we will email you
shortly at email we can save this
refresh woops put in some values here so
I can say name Caitlyn submit it and it
says you're a guy Thank You Caleb we
will email you shortly at cool-guy a
hotmail.com
so we can also add a period after this
email and we could change this to hello
madam now let's try it and we also can
echo a break down here and this will
clean things up a tad bit continue and
this is what it's going to look like now
and just like their school we can put
commas here if you wanted you could put
this break within these quotation marks
up here and I'll show you how that works
now so if I got rid of this one refresh
the page you can see it still stays the
same but if that's the case we're going
to have to put that for this one this
one and this one so just to make that
easier I just brought it down here
echoed it out like that so full this is
what we have hello sir
Thank You Caleb we will email you at
cool guy calm and if you wanted we could
just add some extra stuff in here we
could say echo I am glad you are
interested in our newsletter here is a
custom message from Caleb add a line
break close the parentheses and yes so
then we can refresh the page and you can
see let's look at this little bigger so
you can see little thing tell us sir I
am glad you are interested in our
newsletter here is a custom message from
Caleb curry Thank You Caleb we will
email you shortly at cool-guy dot-com so
that is the basics of creating dynamic
web pages and taking specific values of
variables and echoing them echoing
things out by testing what the value is
so we tested if it's male or we tested
if it's female so yeah that is an
example of how that all works and
hopefully I was helpful I will see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
