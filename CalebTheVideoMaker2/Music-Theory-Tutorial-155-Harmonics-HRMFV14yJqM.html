we spoke of partials and we also spoke
of overtones well there's actually
another word we're going to need to know
that is harmonics all right so when we
have partials as I said they're very
commonly twice or multiples of the
fundamental frequency the fundamental
frequency is the frequency we hear the
most because sound is complex and has
multiple frequencies to create specific
sounds so the fundamental frequency
let's say it was 440 Hertz a partial
would be 880 Hertz
well a harmonic is basically any partial
that is a multiple of the fundamental
frequency I hold number multiple so hold
on a multiple I'll write that out whole
number multiple so if you remember in
the last video I said sometimes they are
not always whole number multiples for
example I said 10 20 40 80 and then I
said 85 well 85 is a partial but it is
not a harmonic no no no it's not it is
not a harmonic you know why because it's
not a multiple of the fundamental
frequency so another thing we get when
we're working with these frequencies our
frequencies that are not quite a
harmonic so let's say we're working with
a four at 440 Hertz right so a partial
maybe 880 point five with
880 one point five so as you can see if
it was a harmonic it should be 880
because 880 is twice a 440 well what's
the problem here as you can see
as an extra 1.5 vibrations per second
that means is a partial so it's so close
to being a harmonic we actually still
call it a more harmonic because it's not
always perfect this is what's known as
inharmonicity how close this is to a
harmonic that's what an armada city is
inharmonicity is it's a measurement to
how plus this number is to being a
harmonic as you can see here it's only
1.5 vibrations per second off so that's
still pretty close and it doesn't really
sound bad to our ears especially because
this is not a fundamental frequency this
is a partial so now we have a bunch of
words floating around we need to make
sure we have clear distinctions between
what what's what and what's not what and
what is what which made no sense at all
to begin with because that was this
confusing so let's just start from the
beginning partials are any extra
frequencies over the fundamental
frequency the fundamental frequency is
the main key so 440 Hertz would be the
fundamental frequency 441 is a partial
we don't necessarily hear it as well but
we hear 440 Hertz right if this is a
whole number multiple by the way a whole
number has no decimals so 881 is a whole
number 880 1.5 is not whole number and
it has to be multiples so this can only
be a harmonic if it's 880 but it's
almost impossible to get perfectly 880
and then perfectly 880 times 2i Camryn
would this so we came up someone came up
with the concept of inharmonicity when
it's so close to being a harmonic but
it's just a few either cents or Hertz
off that's the idea of inharmonicity so
we may still call 88.1 88 1.5 we may
still call it a harmonic now what is an
overt
overtone is basically just any partial
minus 1 so if 886 point 5 is the fourth
partial that means it's the third
overtone
that's a very easy to remember way to
remember it basically it's as partials
excluding the fundamental frequency so
that is a lot of complex stuff so you
may need to study that write this down
or watch this video a couple of times to
make sure you understand it because all
the information you need is here it's
just a lot to grasp at one time when
there's so many words to remember and
concepts to grasp so instruments wind
instruments often have very close
overtones and parcels so we have
overtones partials and this is what we
talked about in the first video so often
we get very close to holdover multiples
and we could say that that's a harmonic
obviously but if it's 88.1 we just say
it's a little in harmonic and a little
has a little bit of inner mono city but
it's still a hammam harmonic so wind
instruments have very close partials and
overtones to being harmonic so they
sound very pleasant all the percussion
instruments have not quite as exact
overtones and parcels especially pitch
ones they have a lot of complex ones but
it still sounds pleasing to the ears non
pitched percussion instruments have a
whole variety of stuff which gives them
that distinct sound from all the other
instruments and that's all I have really
is to say about that old I wanted to get
into these two little words down here
sort of down here so wouldn't forget
we have a sub harmonic and an undertone
that's the same thing as a harmonic and
an overtone except it's lower than the
fundamental frequency so this is the
fundamental frequency
two-twenty would be the second partial
partial yes it would be a subharmonic
because this would be the second partial
going down obviously not up because the
second partial would actually be 880 so
I'm not sure what the under partial is
called so this is a sub harmonic and
it'd be the first undertone because
undertones go back from the main
frequency and we don't count the first
one so this is not an undertone this is
the first undertone so that's all I
really have to say about all that
be sure to study this and get it drilled
in your brain in the next video we will
be talking about something new so if you
