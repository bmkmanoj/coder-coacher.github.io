video maker to this video I'm going to
be talking about a database that will
help you and your next software project
it's called DB - part of me likes this
database just because I has a - at the
end but there's a few other reasons I
like it and that's what I'm going to
share with you in this video first thing
is that DB - is a relational database
that was created by IBM they are the
ones who created the relational model
that we all know and love today but not
only is db2 a relational database you
can also use it for no SQL so if your
data doesn't quite fit right into a
table db2 supports JSON XML and graph
additionally it is a widely available
database running on all the major
operating systems and you can
communicate to it using various
programming languages db2 is a
well-established database with a
plethora of features one of them that
sparked my interest is called Blu
acceleration using Blu acceleration with
your database allows for in memory index
free processing of your data which
essentially that means it makes your
database is super fast this performance
type of ibm's analytic platforms is
becoming increasingly more important as
companies manage more and more data
overall db2 is a pretty slick database
and these are just a few of the reasons
why I'll be using it for upcoming
software projects but wait there's more
IBM just released a new version of this
software that allows you to try out all
these tasty features for free
it's called the db2 direct trial this
version is specifically designed for
developers once you give it a try I'm
sure you want to know more so stay tuned
in this video I'm going to talk about a
database that will help you out for your
next software project it's called db2 Oh
is so gross though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
