will be talking about creating seventh
chords from scales now we had the C
major scale I really hope you guys know
this by now c d e f g a b we can have
seen too if you want so here's the c
major scale now to create a c major
triad we take the first the third and
the fifth because we're in the major
scale so we had a bunch of 7th chords
but i'm going to be going over the major
7th chord not the dominant seventh which
is major / minor this is the major sent
this is taking the seventh out of a
scale one two three four five six and
seven be so now we have a front of staff
here see here is our new seventh chord
we have see e.g and be pretty awesome if
you ask me so that is how you can create
a major seventh using the scale so if
you don't know what notes to use and
don't feel like figuring out just
recreate the scale and take the seventh
now these are all diatonic notes which
means in the scale because we just took
them right out of the scale but some of
the seventh chords use chromatic notes
which are not in the scale such as the
dominant seventh you guys probably hate
me for rain sideways like all the time
so can you even see that anyways I don't
know but the dominant seventh takes the
seventh note where r at this the seventh
note and flattens it to make it
chromatic so we take the B and make be
flipped so this is not from the C major
scale because it's chromatic although we
can figure it out using the C major
scale we take the seventh and the C
major scale lowered half step and boom
we got the major scale not the major
no the dominant 7th chord I don't know
as a major scale I need pay more
attention so yeah that's that for that
let's try one with a minor scale we have
let's go G minor first we can create a
major scale g a b c d e f sharp and G
then we take the third to sixth and the
seventh and we lower them one half step
so we got got one two three four five
six seven and eight so now we take this
one this one this one lower than a half
step so now this will become the flat E
flat and we already have a sharp here so
if we lowered half step becomes F
natural then I can you raise all these
so if we were to take a triad from this
it would take this note this note and
this note to give us gee bee B flat D
this will give us a GU minor chord now
if we take the seventh we get F natural
see what I'm saying so this is a diet
tonic chord to the G minor scale
sweet to find out what 7th chord this is
we can find the relative measurements
between the notes and I just think
that's easier because I like relative
measurements they're not as big so we
have a G let me go to be flat 10 that's
be fun 1 2 3 so you have a minor third
from here 1 2 3 4 or D which is the next
one that was four half steps which gives
us a major third now to F 1 2 3 that's a
minor third so what 7th chord consists
of a minor major and a minor well this
is actually a minor 7th chord now you
may have you make run across a minor /
major which will actually sharp get a
different color so you see this nice the
last note so we would have F sharp
rather than F but this is a minor 7th
chord and that's all I have to say for
this video so come back the next one
where we'll be going over something more
yeah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
