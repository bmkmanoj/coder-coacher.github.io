caleb the video maker to caleb curry
calm basically I want to make a quick
video telling you that now I have some
of my course contents that i put here on
youtube you can download them on a web
site known as you to me that's ude my
and it's pretty awesome I set up a
course and the courses they do cost
money it's nine bucks which I know must
be some cheap scape charging for this
but by putting those up there for
download I actually get less money
through Adsense so yeah but anyways I
put those up there so now anyone who
wants to download my course content they
can and they can watch it pretty much
anywhere so you can place put it on your
tablet or your phones or your desktop
and anywhere without even without an
internet connection you can still watch
those videos so that I thought that was
pretty awesome and i have the mysql
database design series a total of 100
videos for nine bucks and then i also
have the other ones on there i have the
PHP series what's so far of it the HTML
and CSS series and that's all that I
have on there right now but until
January first there is a coupon code
it's a temporary discount no spaces and
i'll put a link that you can click on to
use until january first of 2014 and
you'll get it for four dollars so that's
like like really cheap just saying so
yeah hopefully that makes some you happy
i know some of you wanted me to allow
content to be downloadable and i found
that this was the best solution there's
already 47 people enrolled in my
database design and mysql series which
is awesome most of those people got a
discount and especially since Black
Friday's coming up the entire website
has a coupon code that you can use on
any series which is cool but the amount
discount goes down over time so the
sooner the better
and I'm just for those of you who may be
wondering my PHP series I only have 20
videos on there so far so I haven't
uploaded all the content and the chances
are i'll be making more PHP series here
on YouTube so as I create more i will
upload that content there so within a
series if you subscribe now you will get
any upcoming videos for free so that's
pretty great so that's all I really want
to say see you next video please be sure
to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
