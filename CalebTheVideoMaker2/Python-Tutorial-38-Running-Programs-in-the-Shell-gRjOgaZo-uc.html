just going to be showing you something
that's going to make programming a whole
lot easier for you so basically this
whole series I've been kind of making
things a little complicated
unnecessarily so I apologize for that
but anyways if you click file new file
we talked a little bit about this a
while ago Oh what we can do is we can
save this and just name it like legit
and then we can run this by pressing f5
and it will run it over here so we can
just bring one one over here and one
over here so that way we can program
over here and run our programs over here
so that way we don't to keep retyping
things or rearing things down so when
you're learning new just trying little
simple things it might be best to try
over here like oh I wonder what this
will do I'm guessing it'll print this oh
and I printed it but when you actually
want to make like a structured program
you'll probably want to do it over here
if v is greater than 6 I mean lessons
Brent hey and then you can press ctrl s
to save it and then f5 and you can see
it prints hey so like a while ago I was
showing you like whenever I printed
something to the screen I'd go like this
and I type it out but when you're
testing over here it makes it very
simple you actually don't have to do
that because you can just say it by
itself like uh like this you don't need
to put print so that means I can have a
variable what they value like five
hundred and then I can rather than
saying print X I can just be like X and
it will tell me the value of that
variable so this can be really good for
like testing certain little things
that'll be easy and quick but for big
programs you definitely want to use the
whatever this box is called B anyways
what you can do is you can just click
run and then run module if if that's
easier or you can just press f5 so yeah
that's going to make things a whole lot
easier so now we can run do our
programming over here we can be like
bear with me just give me SEC
you are not Caleb
you are Caleb and then I can have an
else statement who are you just make
this a little more clear so now what I
can do is I can save this and then press
f5 and it will run the program over here
so yeah that's all I really have to say
in this video I know I probably should
have told you guys this like years ago
but I'm pretty sure I think I mentioned
it once so yeah alright so in the next
video we'll be getting some more stuff
so I'll see you guys then be sure to
subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
