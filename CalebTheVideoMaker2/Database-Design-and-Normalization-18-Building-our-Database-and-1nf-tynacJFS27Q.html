start designing your database with my
sequel workbench for MySQL workbench
however you want to pronounce it so just
open it if you need to know I've
downloaded it check out my previous
video in the series then under data data
modeling you want to click create new
EER model you see I already have one
right here but I'm going to start fresh
so you guys know what's going what's
going on so you click this and this will
come up and right under here you want to
click add diagram you want to double
click this this will open now when you
create a table up over here on the Left
here's all the tools you have and this
one right here looks like a little box
with a bunch of dots in it this is a new
table you click this and then you can
select anywhere on your grid to start
the table and I know this doesn't look
like much but you can click it and then
right click and click Edit table this
will bring up the table properties now
table name this is what you will name
the table so we're going to start with
students I'm just going to keep
everything relaxed just keep it the same
all right so here's our students table
and now the very first column you should
make is always an ID so we have student
ID now over here on the check boxes you
see it says prop PK that stands for
primary key and it automatically becomes
checked because it's the first column
you made and and that stands for not
normal that's all you really need to
know and this is also an int which
stands for integer integer is just a
whole number and this this is what keeps
the ID like it's not a word it's a
number but we don't really need to worry
about any of this stuff right now so
we're just going to scoot all this over
here okay so you have the student ID the
next column we're gonna make and just
like that you just double click we're
going to make first-name
all right and also lastly see this could
be stored as just name if you wish but
I'm separating them because that's how I
like it
and I think it's easier now the data
type its var char or how everyone counts
it it just means characters that vary so
and if you don't have 45 letters in your
name then you can have less okay now
from here you can see up here on our
table we have the tables the columns
that we made I'm going to change one
thing under edit I want you to click
preferences and then go over to model :
my own SR diagram and then under tables
where it says show : types uncheck that
now what this does it gets rid of all
that extra information that we're not
gonna worry about right now because I'm
not programming this database I'm only
designing it and I don't need to worry
about that right now because this is
over normalization if you're going to go
over data types and all this other stuff
then yes you may want to show that but
for this this is so much easier for what
I need done so now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to populate these tables
and with everything we need to know okay
guys as you can see I just populated the
students table with everything we had
listed up on the chalkboard now the next
step is to make the new table so back
over here on our tools
I want to click table and then click
anywhere on the grid now this will be
your second table for the books so now
you want to edit this down here what I
like to do is right-click and then
instead of edit table I click Edit in
new window now this will open a second
window down here so you can easily edit
both that's very quickly change from
table to table and as this I will name
this books so now I will start making
this and populate it with what we have
and I'll also do the other table and
then I'll be right back okay here's the
three tables that we had up on the
chalkboard okay so let's first look at
the books table I'm going to go over and
properties panel and we'll see what we
have a very first thing you should
notice that the explanation mark for
student idea are here is the primary key
that is how my sequel workbench says
it's a primary key now do you think
that's a very good primary key no why is
it like that it's because it's the very
first thing we entered into this table
now you should always put the ver the ID
as the first thing so what we're going
to do is down here we're going to make
book ID and we're going to change this
to int that is because above primary key
should always be an integer so now on
over here we're going to unselect
primary key so it's it's how it was now
this is just a normal column and over on
book ID we're going to select primary
key and now we're going to drag it to
the top so that looks a little better we
have the student ID and the book ID okay
now best friends best friend let's look
at this one now best friend's name do
you think that's a good primary key well
it could change because I mean it's a
changing thing but I don't really like
it now first you notice the best
friend's name is an integer that's
obviously impossible so you'd have to
change that to varchar' okay we know
that this can be an int so the very
first thing I would say is change this
well I don't know instead I think we
should have a best friend's ID so that's
what we're going to do just like we did
for the books best firm and then we're
going to set this integer and select as
the primary key now this one over here
we're going to unselect that and change
that back to this like that and we're
also going to drag this up at the top to
keep it consistent
okay this is a lot better now I have an
ID for each table and now when we look
at this over on a chalkboard we had
something squared or circled boxes these
were the ones that violated the first
normal form rule that is everything
being atomic these were major and minor
major and minor over here these you see
are not combined and this one is that's
a problem you want to pick one or the
other I like I'm separated it's over
here on best friend we're going to
change this to best friends first name
best friends first oh sorry last name
now it's consistent I like everything
consistent that's what keeps your
database organized so what we're going
to do now is change these major minor
we're going to break that up into and
major so that's better
we're also going to do is for students
so major minor let's make a new table I
mean I got major okay so the very next
thing is when I look at this everything
looks good except books you see we have
the book ID and the number of pages and
all this information about the book but
what book is it that's the problem we
need to know what book it is so we need
to make a new - a new column and make it
book name so now the book name will be a
part of this so you know what book has
how many pages and I'm going to drag it
up the top because that's where I like
the names that's what it is about
keeping consistency see all the names
are on the top and that's how I like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
