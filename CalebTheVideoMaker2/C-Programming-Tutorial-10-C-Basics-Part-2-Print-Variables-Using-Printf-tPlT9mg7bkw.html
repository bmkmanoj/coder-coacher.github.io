programming tutorial series by now I'm
sure you guys are si experts so I'm
going to stop explaining things and just
start typing kidding but it seems like
that's what a lot of people on YouTube
do when it drives me crazy so I'm I
don't even know I'm talking about let's
get started this is where we left off in
the last video and I'm just going to
clean up some junk so we don't need like
any of this junk and then we are going
to condense this down to one line as we
learned we can do so now we have two
variables and I told you that the value
of y is going to be five but you know I
can be deceiving you how do you how do
you know the value of y is five well
this video I'm going to teach you how to
print the value of these variables to
the console
oh I'm also going to get rid of this
crap down here so let's just try going
down here and let's just print a number
okay
we'll print 9001 and now let's save the
program by hitting escape to get out of
insert mode and then type in : WQ and
we'll compile that GCC subscribe dot C
oh crap what what what is all this these
are compiler errors the compiler is
basically saying bro quit being an idiot
make sure your program is correct before
you tell me to compile it and then I'll
compile it stop being a noob so let's go
back in there and fix our problem so
we'll go back into them and the problem
is that we can't just print a number I
know it sounds stupid but you just can't
do it
alright that's a rule just deal with it
so to print a number you have to type in
some extra stuff before the number so
follow me go into insert mode and put
double quotes and then a comma so let me
get my stupid cursor out of the way you
can see we're passing in a string and
then a comma which says hey we're going
to give you some extra information and
then we're giving the number well what
goes in this string here is what's
important and that is called a format
string this string right here is called
a format string inside of the format
string we can put format or conversion
characters because we need to convert
this number into a form that the console
allows
so to do that we have to put % I for
integer so that is how you print and
number will hit escape and save the
program and exit and now let's try
compiling okay we still have an issue we
got some period or something floating
around so let's go back in there and fix
it and this brings up a good point this
will usually tell you about where it's
wrong so we can look for these lines and
columns so we can go back in them and
you can see on line 11 go work early on
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 column 2 there
is a period it's not supposed to be
there so got that fixed we can escape
and save and then compile and now let's
output it and you can see the number
output it right there but we want it to
be on its own line so to do that go back
into them and after the % I conversion
character go into insert mode and put a
backslash n which as you've learned is
the newline character so that'll put it
on its own line but you know I don't
really want to print out this random
number here I want to print out the
variables that we already have created
because these are technically just
variables storing an integer we can use
the value Y wherever an integer is
expected and just like this is an
integer we could replace that with Y so
let's just go over here and do that so
if we did everything right this should
print out the value 5 so let's save and
compile and then run and you can see the
value 5 is right there another thing is
that anytime you change any of the code
even if it's just something super super
small you have to recompile using GCC
that's because this a dot out is
actually a file if you say LS you can
see that the file exists right here and
when you don't compile even if you
change this file right here this file
stays the same in order to update this
one you have to compile this one so
anytime you make a change
to compile the next thing I wanted to do
is rather than just printing out this
random number
I wanted it to give some kind of
description like hey the magic number is
five or something like that so let's
figure out how to do that let's go back
into our code and we can just add it to
our string inside a printf it's really
simple so literally the value of Y is
just going to be imputed into this
location inside of this string which is
going to be printed so it's going to say
the magic number is colon five and then
it's going to go down to the next line
every time we have something in here
separated by a comma these are known as
arguments so we're passing two arguments
to the printf function we can actually
pass more arguments for example if we
want to do include X in this we can do
that for example we get to start typing
here the value of x is percent I
backslash N and pass in another argument
of X the reason this is kind of
connected right here is because it looks
weird here but in the console it's going
to go down to a new line and then this
is going to be the start of a new line
so it's actually going to look pretty
cool so let's compile and make sure
everything looks right the magic number
is five and the value of x is ten
awesome so we got it working all of our
code is working exactly as expected so
hopefully that's cool and satisfying to
you guys in the next video we are going
to be covering
taking input so I will see you then guys
