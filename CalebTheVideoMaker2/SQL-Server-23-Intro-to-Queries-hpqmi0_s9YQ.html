Caleb video maker - this video is going
to introduce you to the concept of
queries so we're going to run a couple
of queries in sequel server now we
haven't really done a whole lot of
on-screen content so we're going to
start kind of slow but be patient
because we are going to speed up as we
go so I'm not going to bore you for the
rest of this entire series if you are
not a complete beginner now I did want
to mention you guys this is video number
23 and I decided starting with video
number 23 I am going to do a competition
between sequel server MySQL and Oracle
you know just to see which series you
guys like the most so if you like sequel
server be sure to click like and view
all of the rest of the series because
I'm gonna add up all those points and
see which one gets the most points and
the winner is going to get 50 extra
videos for the series so I ain't gonna
waste your time anymore because it's
already been like a minute so let's
connect to our database now when you
first connect all this craps over here
we're not gonna worry about that right
now what we want to do is click new
query this is where we put all of the
commands that we want to tell the
database for example we can create a
database using the create command
followed by a database and then we can
give it a name and then to execute that
we just press f5 now we can go over here
and look at our databases and boom look
at that we got a subscribe database but
the focus of this video is not creating
databases I actually want to talk to you
about expressions an expression is
essentially anything that can be
evaluated by sequel server what do I
mean by evaluated well remember back to
math class you'd have you know these
problems and they'd be super hard like
five plus five and you had to evaluate
those two an answer so you could say
five plus five is an expression so we
can have sequel server evaluate
expressions for us the way we do that is
use the Select keyword and then we give
it an expression five plus five now the
semicolon at the end of these is
actually optional although I am going to
try to use it because it's recommended
and if
you have to select statements in here
for example select five plus six you can
run both of those at the same time this
is known as a delimiter and it tells
sequel server that there's going to be
another command after this one but if
there is not a command after this one
for example let's say we had this you do
not need it you can put it so this would
work but it's optional if you have two
statements and you want to run them both
at the same time it is required so
essentially the last semicolon is
optional but as good practice you should
probably put it in there alright but I'm
getting off-topic let's go back to
queries so let's run both of these so
press f5 and you can see the first one
returns 10 and the second one returns 11
and you can see here I actually did not
put a space after the 5 here that's
because SQL is not whitespace sensitive
so what is white space white space
includes spaces it includes tabs and new
lines so you can see I just put a space
tab and a new line and when I run this
thing it's going to work just the way
that it did before now there are some
limitations to this for example we can't
put whitespace between a keyword for
example when we do that it's no longer a
keyword additionally when we are working
with string data for example if we have
that if we put a space here that's
actually a different string and I'll
show you that because we can actually
put a string inside of a select to
return it to us so this here can
actually be returned back to us so we
can tell the database hey we want you to
give us this string back so to do that
all we have to do is say select followed
by that string so this is a string and a
string is just a collection of
characters each one of these is a
character and it's surrounded by single
quotes so let's run this and you can see
it returns that string now what I was
saying about whitespace is that when we
delete this white space here and then
run it again you can see that it
turns the same thing that's put here so
the white space inside of these quotes
makes a difference but the white space
here makes no difference
you can see that the result is exactly
the same one other thing that I wanted
to mention in this video is comments a
comment is something we can put there
for our use but sequel server just
ignores it when it runs the query to put
a comment you put two minus signs and
then you can put whatever you want so
you can see here this is a different
color and sequel server is actually
going to ignore it so if I execute this
you can see makes no difference now
these two minus signs this is an example
of a single line comment what that means
is when we go down to the next line we
are no longer in a comment anymore and
you can tell because it's a different
color so down on this line we can put
other commands and I'm just gonna add
that semicolon there to get into my good
practice the other type of comment
though is a multi-line comment and the
way you do that is a forward slash
asterisk asterisk forward slash and then
in between these two asterisks that's
hard to say you can put whatever you
want and now you can see this entire
section is ignored by sequel server now
you don't have to put these on multiple
lines for example this is all on one
line but it still works as a comment so
yeah that's a pretty good rough
introduction to queries now we never
dived into all the keywords and
everything you can do that's just
because there's too much to cover in one
video I'm already feeling a bit
scatterbrained because I'm trying to
explain so much and ah but essentially
everything's going to piece together as
we learn more about sequel server but
for now just know that you can use the
Select statement to have the database
give us back some data but what we need
to know now is how do we get data from
tables and that actually requires
another keyword known as from and we
will talk about that in upcoming videos
so thanks guys be sure to click
subscribe and like this video and I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
