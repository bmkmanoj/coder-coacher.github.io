it's a new day so I'm ready to create
some new videos this video we're going
to be talking about attributes if you've
seen any of my other videos you might
recall that I've told you that
attributes are something that describe
data so basically a description but what
does that mean in this context
well on the server side and the c-sharp
code there's something called attributes
and they describe a little bit more
detail how our class works or how its
accessible etc so I'm going to be
teaching you two attributes that can be
used for signal are also I apologize my
air conditioners like right there so if
you guys hear oh that's what it is the
way you create an attribute is you go
above whatever you want to describe and
you put two brackets I believe they're
called and within there you can put the
attribute name the first one I want to
show you is pub name now this isn't
going to highlight as a keyword
automatically because it's in a
different name space than what we have
imported so everything is grouped within
a namespace the one we need is not
currently here so the easiest way to fix
that is to click on whatever is not
working hold ctrl and press period that
will give you some tips and one of the
suggestions is to import the namespace
Microsoft asp net signal are hubs
fingers press enter and there you go
it's still an error though that's
because we need to pass some data in
parentheses so what is this attribute
for essentially what we want to do is we
want to create a name of how this hub is
accessible from the client but we don't
want to change the server name so it's a
way to make the name on the client
different than on the server so for
example I'm gonna get rid of this my hub
because I think I have a better name for
it I'm going to name it chat hub
and then and here we could just name it
whatever we want it just chat but
there's one thing to keep in mind and
that this is case sensitive so if you
name it chat over here on the client
side we can't say lower case chat we
have to use upper case Chapman that's
different than just using the class name
because it would automatically be
converted to camel case and we would
have chat with a lower case C for chat
so you got to keep that in mind when you
are using these attributes and my
recommendation is just to try to make
everything as natural as possible and
since it's common to use camel casing
with JavaScript leave the hub name
lowercase and then that will keep
everything working as you expect and
then back on this client side but the
hottest lower case let's give it a run
and see if it works make sure you build
you can do that using ctrl f5 mix out of
these other ones here whenever you
update the JavaScript you don't need to
build but if you update c-sharp code you
need to do a build and there's two ways
you can essentially do that one is to
start without debugging or if you
already have a browser open you can just
build using f6 so that'd be build build
solution so you can see everything still
seems to be working fine if I open up
another window
you can still see that there is an
announcement to everybody now that we
figured out that attribute I have one
more to teach you guys and it's
basically the same thing as this except
it's method specific so we can name a
method something different than what the
actual name of the method is the benefit
of that is if you have some kind of
standard on how you name your methods
but it's not really user friendly on the
client-side or for really any reason at
all I'm not really saying you should do
this I'm just saying you can do this so
the way you do that is packets and they
say pump method name and then in
parentheses give it a name so we could
say announce to everybody and for
JavaScript sake I'm going to lowercase
by day then on the client side all you
got to do is replace it with this name
so I'm just gonna copy that and the one
time we use that method is right here my
hub dot server dot announced so I'm
gonna replace that with announced to
everybody also something you might have
noticed here is that we're still using
my hub why is that well that's because
my hub is actually the variable up here
that we've been referencing so if you
want to make it to where we're always
using chat you can change the variable
name there you go let's do a bill make
sure it works open up the web browser do
a refresh and you can see it still seems
to be working if i refresh the other one
you can see it announces it to everybody
that that client connected so that's
attributes pikas I'll let you decide how
useful they are or if they're
appropriate for any situation
thanks guys in the next video we'll be
continuing our app development see that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
