video maker to this video we are going
to be talking about implicit type
promotion and i know
bunch of big words so let's break this
down but first let me advertise the
previous video the previous video is
going to give you the foundation to
understand the content in this video so
make sure you go check that out
so to get started we're going to create
a file and we will just call this
implicit type promotion dot c so we set
up the standard beginning file and now
when you start to study implicit type
conversion i can guarantee you there is
a certain topic you are going to come
across and that topic is called
promotion and i have an article to share
with you guys here is an article that
talks about implicit conversions and
inside of this article there is a
section on promotion and you can see
there's scattered throughout this
promotion section talks about what data
types can be converted to other data
types without loss of information I'm
going to give you an example of a caste
that does not lose data so let's get rid
of this article let's create a float
variable and we'll give it the value
50.0 now if you want you can put an F
here just to specify hey this is a float
it doesn't really matter though if you
don't put it there it'll get stored as a
float so either way it is fine now let's
print this value and we want to print
this value as a floating point value and
the value we're going to pass in is X
now the interesting thing here is that
print s takes a double what that means
is that when this function was created
let's say it's down here somewhere just
as an example
it was probably way more complicated
than this but just for simplicity sake
pretend this is the printf function when
someone created it so when someone
created this they accepted arguments
into what are known as parameters so the
parameters are the variables that
store the values passed in to the
function so in this situation this gets
stored somewhere and this gets stored
somewhere so the parameters might look
something like this for example but
don't really worry too much about it I'm
just showing this so it makes more sense
essentially this argument gets stored in
this parameter this argument gets stored
in this parameter the data type of the
parameter is double but we are passing
in a float so in this situation you can
say that the X is promoted he used to be
a float but now he's a double but do
keep in mind that this does not change
the original data type of X X will
always be a float but in this situation
this X is a different X so we could
actually rename it just to make it a
little more clear okay so now X is
promoted and what that means is that the
value of X is stored as a double in
pizza essentially the value of X 50.0 is
stored as a double you can use the
percent F conversion character for both
floats and doubles so if we went up here
and made this a double well the same
exact thing is going to happen the
reason that works is because in this
situation we would take the value of X
and store it as a double so either way
we're working with a double so we don't
need to conversion characters it's
always going to be printed as a double
when we use this percent F we're
basically telling the printf statement
how to interpret our data and it only
makes sense to have one of them because
no matter whether we put a float or a
double into the function we're going to
get a double the other common example of
implicit conversion is when we're doing
assignments so for example if we did
50.0 with an F well that is a float
value
the F at the end is basically saying hey
here's a constant that is of the
datatype float and it's getting stored
as a double but the cool thing is is
that a float can fit inside of a double
because a float is a smaller data type
than double this is a super simple
example but unfortunately when we're
converting data it's not always so easy
and we risk losing data and that
situation of losing data is often caused
by explicit typecasting and that is what
we're going to be talking about in the
next video so go check that out
thanks guys and I'll see you in the next
one if you've been enjoying this series
