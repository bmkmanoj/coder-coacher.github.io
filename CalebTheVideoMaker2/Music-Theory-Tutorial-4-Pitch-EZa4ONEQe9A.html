pitch pitch pitch pitch pitch pitch
pitch with a P not a B but pitch is whoa
Wow
well picture all right so it's kind of
hard to explain the concept of pitch but
we do know what frequency is frequency
is how fast something vibrates or cycles
so this has a higher frequency than this
makes sense now
pitch is how we perceive frequency so
this one down here which has lower Hertz
or cycles per second it's perceived
differently or interpreted say this
doesn't sound the same as this one now
this is because it vibrates faster and
we hear it faster hey miss um this one
is going to be perceived as a lower
pitched noise so pitch is the sound we
get from frequencies that is a low
pitched sound because it vibrates slowly
now this up here on this keyboard is the
higher pitch sound that is because it
vibrates quickly so the faster something
vibrates the higher pitched it sounds
and again
pitch is just the perception of
different frequencies so for example we
have all these different pitches we have
a guitar these up here
or higher-pitched I mean large sorry
then these up here because biome he let
me do some theory right here so we have
a string that plot when we pluck it and
it vibrates across this board if we
press our finger like halfway down the
string becomes shorter which means it
vibrates more quickly because it doesn't
have to take a big of a cycle for
example we have we've plucked this top
string the sixth of the string so now we
still have an e it just vibrates twice
as fast and we interpret that as
higher-pitched so now the strings kind
of relate to these a little bit more if
we have a string on a stringed
instrument and it's this long day
markers failing
no wonder nobody uses dry erase boards
they stink so we have this string and
let's say it's at E then we have this
strings and it's that E and you're like
whoa there's two E's how's that even
possible well if they're not technically
the same ease because if we take a look
at this on this keyboard it displays it
nicely we have an e here whoops ye6 and
if we go down a bit we have E 5
that is called pitch notation to
differentiate between different pitches
so we don't just have a a we have a 1 a
2 a 3 a 4 a 5 and we will get into that
into we will get into that in another
video coming up shortly ok we have this
graph here and it looks like this so
here's let me make a positive one here
here's the positive here's the negative
positive negative positive negative and
by positive negative I just mean
compression and rarefaction
I don't even know I try writing this so
now if we have something that vibrates
twice as fast I don't even know if I can
be able to draw this okay so now we have
say this vibrates twice as fast we're
going to have two cycles for every one
cycle up here if we alter it so it's not
quite double such as there's not double
the frequency we can still have it sound
nicely because let's say this one this
will vibrate three times every time this
vibrates twice which means it doesn't
sound the same but at some points there
at all they're both going together
they're both going to hit high points at
the same time see in the next video
where we will be talking about I can't
remember but it's gonna be awesome
