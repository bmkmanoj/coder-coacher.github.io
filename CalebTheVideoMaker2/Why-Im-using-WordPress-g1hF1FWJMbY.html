a quick video over why I'm using
WordPress so um some people have asked
me this and I've came up I've come up
with a couple of reasons that seem
pretty cool of why decide to use
WordPress of first one is that WordPress
lot of people think of it as a blogging
software so you can like write about
your feelings and like throw your brain
into words sir for people to read but
not only for that it can be used for
e-commerce so if you want to make a
store online you do that with WordPress
and as well as um business reasons as in
i post post my videos on there don't
necessarily use it for blogging right
now although a lot of it I mean as time
goes on obviously I'm going to add some
blog posts on there it's a slow process
skinny time but yeah it's not like a day
to day thing like Oh today this today
that but you can post guides and
tutorials and all kinds of stuff on
there as well as use it for other to
like bring all your social networks
together on your website as in rather
than putting all your business content
on your facebook account you can put on
your website and then instead of posting
also on Twitter and post on your website
instead of posting on google+ and all
this other crap you can just point those
to your website and if you wanted you
could also post it on your into the
social networks whatever that's just one
example uh main main good reason that
I'm using WordPress is it's free and I
don't like spending money on stuff net
well I mean it's probably worth money
I'd probably consider paying for it if
it was cheap but it's free so pretty
much anyone can use it there's two types
there's wordpress com and wordpress.org
so you go to wordpress com this is for
starting a blog as a sub domain of work
so it'd be like wordpress or um I think
it's basically a part of the wordpress
com website if you go to wordpress.org
well this is a downloadable version
which you can then upload on your own
hosting service for your own website so
mine's Caleb curry com it's not
wordpress.com or Caleb curried wordpress
com it's my own website and I upload
those files onto my server well the
web's the web hosting I bought and then
it's displayed I bought a domain Caleb
curry com which can be used to access
the files on that server what were some
other reasons I got them written down
but I lost the page where to go where to
go okay it's quick and easy so um you
can if you are working for business or
you need to set up someone a website you
can literally set up a wordpress and
like like you can set up a good
customized working up to date safe
wordpress in less than a few hours i
mean if you rush it you might be able to
go faster than that but it's really
quick it's simple so no you don't have
to be a genius they even have like a
three-step installer if you're like
really beginner and you will actually if
anyone wants to use that they can so
it's very simple you don't have to know
tons of code you don't really have to
know any code and if you do it's very
simple to figure out what's going on and
how to fix certain problems and do
certain things so that's one thing it's
quick and another thing is it's easy and
even if you are an 80 year old it was
never used to computer well you're
probably has some struggles but in
general it's a lot easier than other
platforms out there for web development
rather than coding all of your pages at
want like by yourself hand coding use a
wordpress brings everything you did
that's great for clients so it doesn't
require a huge knowledge base of web
development
computer programming to run so that
means if you were um aunt or uncle where
your grandma wants to start a knitting
business and she wants to post her stuff
on there for others to see she's not
going to have to learn HTML or anything
like that she can just post her content
share the pictures and WordPress is
going to do all that on its own and if
you're an expert and you want a little
bit more customization you can also use
code so that's what's great it's perfect
for both ends so experts are not limited
there's tons of customization and coding
opportunities as well as plug-in
development so basically with WordPress
it is what's known as a content
management system it takes all your
content and it manages it and it's a
system so it's a content management
system and then basically once you have
the basics you can add plugins so like I
can't think of a good example but if you
have like like a website you can add an
extra piece to your website to make it
better or to change something that was
already there so there's tons of plugins
for the beginners to download and as
well for advanced people to develop and
a great thing about WordPress is it is
continually updated so your content does
not uh get old it is always updated to
the newer version of WordPress man you
can do it by clicking update and boom
it's done it's pretty simple and a good
thing about this is a lot of your
content in WordPress is stored in a
database so you don't have to go and
update every single page and change a
bunch of code all you do is click update
and it's going to take your old pages in
your old pages and put it on the new
updated website this is secure this is
safer and it's going to give you a
better website it's less work to
obviously because you don't have to
update every single thing and because
it's less work it is good for businesses
and clients because in all honesty a lot
of people don't like to work why do
something that takes
hours which can you do something that
takes one and they get pretty similar
results um it's automated so a lot of
its by itself that's great as for
example here let me show you my website
here to get it up dude alright it's up
now let me show you my screen here
screen share alright so here you can see
my pretty simple website and um I got a
picture it's really small right now
because it lets you see easier and I got
a video on here and then I got all my
other videos up to 50 so when I upload a
new video this is automatically updated
so if i refresh it I upload a video not
that long so it might be on here and
it's not yet but sooner or later this
video will be on there and if I turn
caching off it would be on there right
now but this is automated so when I
upload a video it's automatically put on
my website and I don't have to do any
work with that and that's pretty awesome
another thing is I have my tweets on
here other recent posts pretty much
everything's automatic which means less
work for me I can create awesome
drop-down menus very simply and if you
want to see videos such as JavaScript
then you can scroll down and boom you
you want to watch number two you click
it and it starts playing so that's
pretty awesome and it's all automated
now as for plugins here's a good example
I have this donate button you click it
and you got this options to donate and I
didn't program anything on this page all
I did was download a plug-in and it did
it for me
so that's pretty awesome it's pretty
much like the most easy thing in the
world and as less work for me which
means I can focus more on creating
content rather than putting that content
on my website because honestly a lot of
my time was going into trying to keep my
website up to date and so forth so yeah
that's my main reasons for using
WordPress I'm sure I could list a lot of
other ones you can add a lot of features
so obviously i like the donate thing
it's through paypal which means i don't
have to deal with any credit cards and
I'm too worried about security it's all
through paypal so that's safe secure and
it makes if anyone wants to donate they
feel more confident ernet and it makes
me feel more confident in that there's
also a million other things for example
the videos that were automatically
posted on there that was through a
plug-in that was through am yeah so that
way I didn't have to code anything I
don't have to add a video and now if I
uploaded to a hand coded website that i
would have to embed every single video
and do all the coding myself every time
I upload a video and that's not a sailor
can be so yeah those are just some of
the reasons I chose to you as a
wordpress and hopefully that was helpful
probably not kidding oh yeah thank you
