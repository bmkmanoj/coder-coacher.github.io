video we're going to be talking about
one little keyword very simple this
video should be really short very simple
and to the point
it's called pass so don't pass this
video up or pass gas or pass out that
I'd be bad anyways what pass does is it
tells python that we're not ready to
give it certain information so like for
example when we write a function let's
let's define a function and we'll name
it carotid job so true story guys I used
to think carrot in karate were
pronounced like the same same way so I
was like karate so we're gonna karate
chop right and then the argument is
going to be who we are who our karate
chopping alright so what we can do
within here we can like have it do
something like return whoo right and
then we can print karate karate chop and
we could be like Jane
James bomb and then we can run this
program you see it returns James Bond's
what if we were making this function and
we didn't exactly have the chant we
didn't want to finish it yet we wanted
to come back and finish it later or
anything like that well we started
typing outside of the function and let's
say we haven't typed anything in here
yet and then we start working on
something else so we're like we're like
oh x equals five twelve y equals snow
dizzle fo-shizzle
and then like Z equals under my umbrella
umbrella I don't know I spell that under
me umbrella oh man I need some sleep
anyways let's just say we're going on
with this program we save it and try to
run it we're gonna get Oh what is this
come on work you piece of crap I just
want you to work work oh and it's not
gonna work the reason is because Python
expects this to be part of the function
even though it's not that's because we
haven't had anything written in our
function so if we did write something
like print it's working and then we run
it well you can see we haven't called it
but we have something in that function
so therefore it no longer X and no
longer expects that this is part of the
function because it was part of the
function it should be indented like that
so what if we don't want it to actually
have anything the function we just want
to go on and come back to later we put
the little keyword pass and save and
then we can run it and you can see it
can work perfectly without having to
give us an error because it's just a
word that pretty much does nothing it
just tells python that there's something
in the function this works for other
things like classes and all that junk
but we'll be getting all that in the
future so hopefully that was useful and
I will see you all in the next video be
sure to subscribe and go take some
carrot classes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
