continuation of the last video so in the
last video I told you that you can make
this a range but I didn't really say how
to do that and I kind of just left you
guys hanging well thankfully I'm super
awesome and I'm gonna tell you how to do
that rather than just leaving it there
to keep you up at night you know so in
order to do this we have to use the
keyword and Oh or we can use the keyword
or in some instances so let's just take
this if statement click it and press
ENTER to bring it back down here to
retype it and now what we can do is
press input and and then we can put age
is less than 21 so now the age has to be
greater or equal to 18 and age has to be
less than 21 same for this one we could
say and age less than 21 so now when we
try this if we did it open up 21 sorry
65 now if we did this right age
considering it is 52 here it should say
you get this special pass dog let's try
it you get the special pass dog that's
awesome you can also do if statements
where it's like if age is greater than
10 or less than 5 sorry or age less than
5 do something well then we could say I
print this is just example I'm telling
you how to use the or statement true now
let's see what this worked like if your
age is greater than 10 or age is less
than 5 so this will become true if your
age is anywhere from negative unlimited
to 5 or I mean up into 5 but not
including 5 so anywhere less than 5 up
to 4 exactly
or 11 and higher so if your age is 5 6 7
8 9 or 10 you will not get the print
true and it is true because our age is
above 10 so now let's compare a little
bit about the and okay the and and the
or let's compare these two of it for the
ants the and word I forget what that is
the keyword what this will do is it
require that all of these age has to be
true and this has to be true all of them
have to be true for the or only one of
them has to be true you see so we could
have it to where the if statement could
be true in either instance if age is
greater than 10 or age has the value 15
well it's possible for both of these to
be true at the same time let's just add
an a oh whoops I forgot a colon all
right so let's define age and let's make
it 15 and then let's take this and let's
run this we can say print true all right
now let's try it you can see it prints
true both of these are able to be true
at the same time you know why because
when Python reads this it says oh is age
greater than 10 yes it is and then it
basically just ignores the rest of this
to save computer resources so the first
time it hits a true statement it will
execute the command and pretty much
ignore everything else
now for the and it's a little different
the and it's how it's going to test the
first one and if it's true it's going to
test the second one and if that's true
it's going to test the third one and so
forth and if it does that all the way
without hitting a false then it will
print the next command if it hits a
false one it basically just stops there
and then
goes on with either the else or the LF
or just goes on with the program so for
the or one has to be true for the and
all of them have to be true so that's
just a little example and just so you
know you can do it with multiple things
so if age is greater than ten or age as
as the value 15 or age is smaller than
ten well now this is pretty much going
to be anything except ten because age
can be greater than ten it can be 15 or
it can be less than ten and it's not ten
because age is 15 let's try it again
with your age of 10 right and then we'll
reprint this and you can see nothing
happens because we don't have an else
statement and our age is 10 therefore
this is not executed so that's just an
introduction to and and/or so hopefully
that was useful and in the next video we
will be getting into some new things so
hopefully you are willing to subscribe
and click like thank you and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
