programming tutorial series now this
video we are kinda going to go a little
bit off topic but the content is still
going to be extremely useful so I am
going to have this video and probably
the next video to talk about vim so then
is the text editor that we've been using
to do all of our fancy coding the thing
is this text editor is very hard to use
when you don't know how to use it
so if you're not using them you can just
basically ignore this video in the next
video but if you are using them
hopefully I'll be able to give you some
good tips to teach you how to use them
to the best of your ability if you
aren't using them though you might still
want to consider watching this video to
learn a little bit about within that's
because you might end up passing to you
someday anyways let's get started the
very first thing is that when you look
at this Eustis oh it's all green and
ugly and yours is probably black and
black it's just ugly so we can actually
fix this by typing colon syntax on hooha
now look at that that's pretty the other
thing is sometimes we get errors and
I'll say oh this error is found on line
17 or whatever and we have to go count
one two three and then by the time I get
to like 14 we lose track and have to
restart we can actually put line numbers
on this by using set number oh nice the
only downside to using these two things
that we just enabled is that if we close
it using WQ and then reopen it
everything is gone really so that's one
thing that's really annoying when you're
first starting vim even when you try to
make vim a little bit more user friendly
it turns around and stabs you in the
back and he erases everything you've
done in order to make the line count and
the syntax highlighting on by default we
have to add those commands to a
configuration file so I will show you
how to do that first is you want to quit
them and just go to your ordinary
console I'll just clear the screen so
it's nice and beautiful the next thing
is you want to travel to your home
directory
if you remember how to do that in Linux
you use CD now we need to actually
either edit a file or create one if it
does not exist
so the file is actually dot VI m RC so
the changes are if you're new to them it
doesn't exist so if you put LS dash a
you can look in it in here and if you
look closely you're probably not going
to find it
we found vim info but that's not quite
what we want so we're actually going to
create this file if you do have the file
and you want to edit it you can follow
along just type VI m and then put dot
vimrc now the dot means it's a hidden
file so if I was to open up a finder and
look in this folder all of these would
be hidden the dash a makes it show
hidden files so let's open that and now
we need to put the commands in this file
so go in insert mode by pressing I type
syntax on and set number and then escape
: WQ now let's go back into our YouTube
folder list the files and we'll open
eggs and there you go that is how you
make the lines and the syntax
highlighting on by default the next
thing I wanted to talk about was how you
move the cursor around now you've
probably figured out you hey you can use
the arrow keys and it works just fine
but there's actually another way to do
it that people who are like advanced at
vim prefer but the recommended way to
move is first make sure you're not in
insert mode so press escape to get out
of any mode you're in and then you can
use HJ k and L to move around H move to
the left L moves to the right J moves
down and K moves up I'm pretty sure
these characters are based off of an old
keyboard that used to have the arrow
keys on those four characters but now it
just kind of sticks and a lot of people
prefer that and also you don't have to
move your fingers as far for those of
you who are like super lazy now whether
you use these or the arrow keys is
totally up to you but either way you'll
probably want to try to get into the
habit of only being in insert mode when
you really need to insert something and
not all the time
so what I mean by that is like let's say
I want to go down and change the double
data type to float or something like
that to some other data type well you
don't want to be like oh I'm an insert
mode let's just walk down there and okay
let's delete that and put something else
that's not what you want to do what you
want to try to do is only be an insert
mode when you really have to so I'm
actually really bad at this the
recommended way would be to travel down
to the double not being an insert mode
and you can see I had to press that key
a whole bunch of times to scroll down
there there's actually a shortcut to
kind of go down into your code you can
see that that is on line 10 so we can
jump to that line by typing in 10
capital G and you can see it jumps to
that line so you don't have to press
colon or anything like we did in some of
the other commands you just push one
zero capital G if you want to go to the
very end of the file you can just put
capital G another thing you want to do
is go to the end of a line so for
example if I wanted to add a comment
after line 10 first we can travel to
line 10 by pressing 10 capital G and
then we can use the dollar sign to go to
the very end of that line if you want to
go to the beginning of the line you can
use the caret symbol which is capital
six let's go back to the end by using
the dollar sign and now if you want to
start typing after the semicolon there's
two ways you can really do this first
you can press I to go into insert mode
and then use your arrow key to scoot
over one and then you can start typing
but there's actually an easier way so
let me escape and go back character so
we're just exactly where we were a
second ago you can press lowercase a and
that will go ahead of the character that
you're currently on and insert you into
insert mode there are a few last
commands I want to teach you and the
first is using the lowercase W and that
will jump to the beginning of the next
word so for example if I'm over here and
I'm on dozen right and then I press W it
jumps to the beginning of eggs you could
also use B which will jump to the
beginning of the previous word lowercase
B goes to dozen those are some of your
quick ways to move around it's going to
take you a while to learn all those if
you need comprehensive No
you can download my notes I'll put the
link here at the end of the video if
you've enjoyed this video please be sure

really helps my channel and I really
appreciate it
thanks guys and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
