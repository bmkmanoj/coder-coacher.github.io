want to do one more thing with our app I
want to take this message here and I
want to display it on the page rather
than alerting it and then after that
we'll just kind of do an overview of
what's all going on here and here just
so you guys get the full picture because
they can get a little confusing with all
these parameters and arguments and
everything so that's the plan for this
video let's get started so the very
first thing we want to do is go to our
index page right here and once again you
can find that in views home indexed OCS
HTML and within here we are going to
make a div and we'll give it an ID and
set it equal to welcome messages all
right save that go back to our
JavaScript and then what we can do is we
can in here get rid of that alert open
that up so I got some more room we can
get that element in our JavaScript by
putting a dollar sign parenthesis and
input quotes and then put pound welcome
messages so that is going to get the
element from our HTML and then what
we're going to you do is use an append
method and we're going to pass in the
message so now when we go to our page
and what we do is we're gonna refresh
what refresh it our message should
appear in our HTML and it works so now
let's try it with two browsers and
you'll kind of get a little better of an
idea of how this real-time application
junk works so I got one open let's open
another and we'll give this page a
refresh sweet okay so as you can see on
the left side it also put the connected
so no matter when every single time i
refresh it's going to post that
connected message on the other browser
so these are effectively both working on
the same app at the same time they are
real-time and just to make this a little
prettier we can go back to our index
and we could add a or actually go back
to our JavaScript and we could add plus
and throw in some HTML here to make a
break tag now let's give it a shot let's
go back to our browser's refresh go back
to this one refresh and you can see
there it shows the connected message on
the other one all right so let's just do
a quick review about what's what all is
going on here as it can get a little
messy sometimes let's start with this
the client-side so the very first thing
is we make the connection and once
that's done we console.log it and then
we reach this announce method on the
server and we pass in a string connected
on the server side and guys you can
right click and you can click new
vertical tab group and that'll display
them both at the same time so now we can
kind of get a little better view here so
we pass in this data on the server side
it is expecting a string and it gives it
the name message so that connected meets
the qualifications now it takes that
message which contains the data of
connected and it sends it to the
announce function of all the clients and
just Reap pushes that through so on the
client side it receives that down here
so this function takes a message which
would be connected and then appends it
to the element with the ID of welcome
messages that is essentially how the
whole process works for some
clarification there's basically two
things here when it comes to passing
data there's parameters and arguments
parameters are the variables that hold
the data so like for example string
message here that is a parameter an
argument would be the data we pass in to
it so in this case connected is the
argument for the announced method and it
gets stored in a parameter named message
that parameter message is then reset out
as an
argument of the client-side announced
function and then on the client-side it
accepts that as a parameter and then
announces that in the HTML of the
element with the ID of welcome messages
so that's a lot of words and a lot of
stuff going on so just study it make
sure you got it down and in the next
video we'll be doing something even
cooler so thanks guys I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
