programming tutorial series this video
we are going to continue our discussion
on Linux commands so make sure you watch
the previous video because that kind of
laid the foundation of how Linux works
and why we are talking about Linux when
this is supposed to be a C programming
tutorial series so let's just get
started no more wasting time one thing I
would like to share with you is that you
can imagine the Linux filing system as a
tree now I wish I could draw this for
you but I'm limited to just this
computer screen but when you run PWD you
get the absolute path of where you are
you can think of the slash users as a
branch to this tree this brings up many
important terms relating to paths that
you should know the first one is root
directory when someone says root
directory they are referring to the very
first directory to get to the very first
directory all you have to do is say CD
slash and now when we say PWD you can
see we are at the very beginning
another important directory is called
the home directory now to get to the
home directory all you have to do is
type CD very simple press ENTER and then
PWD you can see that we are an users
flash Caleb curry
so Caleb curry is my home directory if
you are a very visual learner it might
help you to open a fight or a window
whatever you want to call it this is the
home directory
next we can travel to the users
directory and then inside of the users
directory we can travel to our home
directory this is the folder that we are
currently in inside of the terminal so
let's get rid of that there is also a
way you can refer to the home directory
and that is using the tilde so for
example we could say change directory
tilde and that will do the same exact
thing the benefit of this though over
just using CD is that we can reference
stuff from the home directory so for
example if we list start directory we
can see there's this YouTube folder so I
could go into that folder by doing
something like CD tilde slash YouTube
and now we are in the YouTube folder
this is a good example of a relative
path we don't really care where the home
directory is we're not starting from the
very beginning by starting with the
slash and then putting users and then
blah blah blah we're just saying hey
let's go from the home directory and
then travel into the YouTube folder we
can actually do some more complex things
for example we can use relative paths to
list certain folders so for example if I
wanted to see what was inside of the
parent folder all I'd have to do is say
LS dot dot and you can see it lists all
of the stuff inside of three PWD inside
of Caleb curry we could even do LS dot
dot slash dot dot and what this does is
actually lists everything in the user's
folder these are things you're not going
to really have to use that often but
it's useful to know that you can do that
if I wanted to for example go into this
shared folder what I could do is first
compare it to where we are currently at
we are in YouTube so we need to go up a
parent up a parent and then down into
the shared folder so we could say CD dot
dot slash dot dot slash shared print
working directory you can see we are now
in the shared folder that's pretty cool
I think that's enough about listing
directories and moving around in the
file system now I want to talk about
creating files first I want to go to the
Caleb curry slash YouTube folder so to
do that all we got to do is say CD home
slash YouTube and now let's create a
file using the touch command so anything
that comes after the touch is the file
name that we want to create so we could
say file name dot C now when we list the
files you can see we have the file name
dot CU right here now that we have a
file let's talk about how to move this
file around let's say I wanted to move
this file up into the Caleb curry folder
currently it is in YouTube and I want to
put it into Caleb curry the command to
do that is MV and then you say the name
and then you say
where you want to put it so we want to
put it in the parent enter now let's
view the files in the parent to do that
we can say LS dot and let's look for
file name dot see right there oh yeah
now this part's kind of odd but you can
actually rename files using the Move
command because if you think about it we
could move this file to the same
location with a new name that's kind of
how I like to think about it or how I
grasped that concept so let's try that
first let's move it back into the
YouTube folder so let's move file name
dot C into the current directory but
this is actually not going to work
because the file name dot C that will be
searched for in the current directory so
we need to go up to the parent because
we're currently in the YouTube folder so
we are here the file name is inside of
Caleb curry so we need to go up to the
parent and then grab file name dot C
then we need to say where we're going to
move that which is the current directory
which is YouTube so right here hopefully
that's clear as mud okay let's run and
now when we say LS you can see the only
file inside a YouTube is file name dot C
now to rename this file all we have to
do is say move file name dot C so the
original file name and then space and
then the new file name new dot C and
when we list files you can see that the
file name is no longer there and it's
replaced with new dot C lastly let's get
rid of this useless file using the RM or
remove command and there you go it is
now gone don't feel like you have to
have all this memorized by the end of
this video like really this takes a lot
of practice the next video is going to
be the last video on Linux and then
we're going to get back into C
programming so thanks for watching be
sure to subscribe and I will catch you
then peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
