that we did in the last video and I'm
going to be showing some more things out
SQL that you may need to know before
doing some deep SQL in whatever would be
I don't even know databasing yeah
database alright the first one is um the
capitalization it doesn't really matter
so usually I mean what you should do is
all the SQL recognized words should be
capitalized like create a table not know
auto-increment
that's one and it's not like that Ino
primary key although it should be
capitalized and all the data type should
be capitalized and then um basically I
like to have everything on a new line
like this but none of that really
matters
for example let's make a table members
too and I'm working in my test database
so that way I don't mess anything up my
other database and have to go through a
bunch of work fixing it so this is where
I test a lot of my stuff and let's
change this to create table spelled like
that completely wrong but if I click go
you can see it still works
so the capitalization doesn't really
matter to be honest and I the same thing
works like this I can say this one sec
this may actually see the the
see the capitalisation doesn't even
matter it changes it so members see that
and then the next thing is see if I this
this is different than this with the
lowercase B but it says it already
exists that's because it's a case
insensitive so the next thing I want to
say is white space
you can have it set up however you want
so this will still work you see it still
created the table even with all this
space it doesn't matter and I can also
do this rather than putting everything
on a new line I have it all on the same
one like this and you can see it already
exists but it worked because if I put it
as a four it should create a new table
like that and then spaces after commas
you see if you delete those click go
let's make a new table here you can see
uh still works so it doesn't really
matter I most people including myself
like to have the open parenthesis on the
top line with the first command and the
closing one on its own line at the
bottom and have every single column on a
new line this makes it easy to read so
but I just want to show you how it
doesn't truly matter how you set it up
and how you type your code so if you
like it some other way go for it because
it's your database but notice if you get
hired somewhere or go to college they're
going they're probably going to want you
to do it a certain way and I'm teaching
the most common way and also probably
the best way because if I look at this
now it's kind of confusing like oh
that's kind of kind of scary but if I
separate this out into multiple lines
like this you can see oh that's easy all
the colon types right here and then the
data types and so on it goes down to one
it's really easy to read
all right the next thing I wanted to
teach you guys for comments comments are
basically things that the engine will
ignore so let's say I'm going to make a
little comment about this I can put a
number sign or a pound sign and say this
will store the unique ID for each member
and when I click go it should create a
new table ucpc because it ignores it
member 7 located down here it doesn't it
doesn't do anything with this code so if
I was like create table blah blah after
this it's not going to do anything and
then another type of comment is a
forward slash and then a star I think it
may be asterisks I'm not sure and then a
star and then another board slash
basically anything you put in here will
be uh ignored so hey go and it works
well you see there's a difference
between this quick okay
and this hey the thing is this is for a
single line so I can type a hey hey hey
all the way down this line but once I go
to the next line it's not going to work
out right see it gives me an error and
it says near name varchar' 60 so and yet
it's close it's right so this is a
single line comment and this one I can
type hey hey as long as it's within
these two opening and closings and click
go and it works fine here is another
useful tip you can see the error up here
it will say what's wrong and then it
will also give you an error number and
what you can do is just type that in on
Google or anything 1050 MySQL error and
you should be able to find sites like
right here I visited this one and it
will tell you some more about that error
and you can also find lists of all
possible errors and this will help you
fix see what's wrong and
fix what what needs fixed and the last
thing maybe that I'm going to show you
is the leading database or tables
because as you can see this is a mess
draw table numbers 3 and then also drop
table members for now I want to show you
something if you click go and okay oh
something's wrong now here's what it is
you try putting a comma click go and oh
it still doesn't work basically these
are two separate commands so what you
need to do is put a semicolon after the
first after the commands when there's
one following it so if there was another
command here drop table numbers 5 I
would need to put a semicolon here then
when you click go click ok and it works
drop table I'm going to paste this a
couple times to get rid of all these
extra so members to member 6 and number
7 and then you'll need to put a
semicolon after these and I believe you
can put one on the last one and I
believe it's good syntax good good to do
that now you can see it didn't update
here but if I click refresh it actually
has and this is our only table now so
that's everything I wanted to show you
in this video and in the next video I
will be altering our to our table in gym
to show you an alter command which I'll
be getting into in the next video and
also some videos coming up so thanks for
sticking with me and I'll see you in the
next video subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
