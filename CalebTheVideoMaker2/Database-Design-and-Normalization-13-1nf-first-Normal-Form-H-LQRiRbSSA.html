normalization and hoping going over the
first three forms because they're the
ones that are most used the other ones I
mean I've never used them I mean if you
want to look into them just like google
search it you'll find it's pretty easy
so we'll be going over one and if first
long-form two and then three and if all
right sweet first normal form is it's
getting rid of extra data and making
sure things are atomic so if you don't
remember what atomic is that means it's
as small as it can get this one's a
moment coming this one's atomic this one
is not a sonic because these are
separate and this is not I mean that's I
mean obviously you can decide what needs
to be separated and what doesn't I mean
the time like let's say eight hours and
12 minutes and 32 seconds I mean I don't
see a reason to break that up especially
since most databases work really well
with x all right so the first normal
form
everything is atonic that's a very first
thing the next thing is it gets rid of
extra sets of data so I'll be doing it
I'll give you an example here yeah movie
so
it's my movies table and we got title
and then actor one so I got the title of
the movie and the actors there's a huge
huge problem with this I mean as soon as
you see this you should be like no
because look let's say we have a movie
named I can't think of anything awesome
yeah that's awesome awesome and the
actors are Jim
John and Jake now what if you have four
actors then you would have to go and
alter the table to have fourth actor
column now we have another movie named
cool Caleb and Carl so let's divide this
up some so it's easier to see whoops Oh
horrible alright so you can see each one
of these is filled but this one it's
empty so this will be replaced with a
null null box that is bad so you may
think a way to get around that
alright so yeah title and then you have
actors saw the title see now we have all
the actors listed across with the movie
this is another problem because you see
these aren't atomic anymore
this is non-atomic because they're all
together which is not what we want we
want them separate names so I'm going to
erase this and show you how to fix this
so the way to fix this is if you think
about it movies and actors is a
many-to-many relationship because a
movie can have more than one actors and
an actor can be more than one movie so
either one is many-to-many and you do
not one of many many too many too many
relationship in your database so the
proper way to do this
his movies over here and actors over
here and each one assigned a primary key
IV so I'll put these as movie ID and
actor and each clip
alright so the next thing I do is draw
an intermediary table so this will be
movies and actors or movie actors
whatever you want to call it doesn't
matter this is an intermediary table we
have to memorize that I mean it's not
really necessary as long as you know
what it is now this would reference the
IDs
so it would be movie as a coelom
actor us a colon and then it has for
example ID 1 and then the actor ID ID 1
so that would be the movie Oh awesome
and this would be I think his name was
Jim then you can have ID 1 again
and then this would be ID to which that
would go to the next one with his name
John I think yeah maybe I don't know
they all I J is for whatever and then
once you get to a new movie you just
change the ID to this ID 2 and then you
can have ID 1 so now when you do the
search you just replace the IDs with the
name so it'd be Jim and Jim playing at a
movie 1 and a movie - so you tell what
movies Jim is
you
in the next video I'll be teaching you
about the second normal form and you
better watch it because it's gonna be
awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
