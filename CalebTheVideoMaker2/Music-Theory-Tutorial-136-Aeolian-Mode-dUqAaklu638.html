going over the eolian mode the pattern
for this is whole half whole whole half
whole look familiar this is actually the
natural minor scale and it is
conveniently enough starting on the
sixth scale degree to be a diatonic to
the key so it's a surprise you well it
shouldn't because if you remember a long
time ago we talked about relative minor
scales it's basically the scales that
use the same notes as the key that we're
in so let's say we're in G we have g a b
c d e f sharp back to G now the sixth
one two three four five six would be e
so we know that II minor would be e F
sharp G a B C D that is the same thing
as the eolian load starting on the sixth
sixth scale degree and again to the
scale of G it would be e so this is nice
to know that the mode lines up with the
sixth scale degree the same way that the
relative minor because it works that way
on the circle of fifths we get cool guys
drink alcohol not really this is the
sharp side so basically we can find the
relative minor or the eolian mode that
would be diatonic to the scale by taking
the sixth scale degree C 1 2 3 4 5 6 a
so this would be a a minor or a la mode
is the same thing as the natural minor
scale so if we're in the key of C we
have no sharps and flats let me show you
here kind of screwed it up there but
that's the C major scale for in the key
of C now the sixth of that scale degree
123456 a the Aeolian mode of a would be
kind of played a little faster so let's
try this again in something else let's
do the F F major scale we got F G a B
flat C D in an F now let's draw a little
staff and create this appropriate key
signature we would have B flat this is
an F the key of F or F major scales key
signature and what would be the diatonic
eolian mode of V 1 2 3 4 5 6 D so let's
start on D this is in trouble cliff so d
would be right here here's the pattern
so what do we get we get d e f G a B
flat because this points back to here
and the key signature see be that is the
eolian mode starting on D in the scale
of F major cool be sure to come back for
the next video where we'll be going over
the LA Korean mode which it only gets
funner so I will see you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
