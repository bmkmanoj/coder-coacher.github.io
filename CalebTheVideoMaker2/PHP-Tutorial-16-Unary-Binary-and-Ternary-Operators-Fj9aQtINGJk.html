we have learned about a bunch of
operators and I'm sure you can figure
out sort of like the the like how they
work and stuff but there are three
classifications of operators that I'm
going to be teaching you we got I don't
know if ounce words or spelling but
close enough so what is the difference
between all of these well it's how many
things they affect or do something with
so if you remember earlier we had like
five plus five this right here is the
addition operator but this is classified
as a binary classification because it
has two things it's working with five
and five so this is 1 this is 2 and this
is 3 it makes sense so what about the
increment operator cat plus plus or if
it's like CA TTT but no it's cat plus
plus this is a unary because it only
affects one value which is the value of
cat so that's basically the difference
there's also ternary which I'll be
getting into at the end of this video so
unary affects one thing we have had
increment decrement there's also the
negative
X equal five well the negative the value
of x that is a unary operator because
it's only affecting the value of x
hopefully that makes sense basically
just how many things are involved when
we use an assignment operator such as
well this is a binary one because it's
taking the value of cat and five and
it's doing something with those values
so hopefully that makes sense
now I want to get into the ternary which
is kind of confusing and it really have
very little similarities to these two
appears so what does a ternary operator
look like it looks like this you can
have parenthesis with some kind of test
and then a question mark a value now
you're probably thinking what exactly
it's kind of confusing so let me try and
break this down for you what does this
do a ternary is it's a test so this is
sort of like a conditional basically we
are going to put something within these
parentheses that can either be true or
can be false such as 5 plus 5 has the
value 10 that's what these double equal
equal marks means has the value so this
is to say when you add these together
you get this value it's not to say five
plus five has value
ten so that's a little minor difference
that is important so five plus five has
the value ten which is true so if this
is true this first value here is going
to be used it's going to be returned if
that helps anything if it's not true
then the second value is going to be
returned so basically we do a test
within parenthesis and then we put a
question mark outside of the parenthesis
first value it can be the string true yo
and then it : and then another string
true jaqen is not okay I'm kind of
running out of space there so let's run
through this five plus five that
actually does evil - so that means five
plus five has the value of ten is true
this is this is math so I guess I should
do that
that's us confusing ph PS this is not
correct this is this is only used when
you're assigning a value to a variable
which were not so it is true that means
we go to the first part true yo that is
returned so what if I said what if I am
said and I go up here
that equals face the this is assigned
the value of this well how is that going
to work it's going to run this test here
and it's going to realize cease oh yeah
this this is true so that means cat has
the value the string true does that make
sense
so this is the value true yo that's
assigned to cat basically it's it's
what's known as a conditional only one
of these two options is done and if it's
true the first one if false the second
one now that's that might be a little
bit confusing to you but don't worry we
will be getting in conditionals into in
the next video and for the next few
videos so after all those I'm sure
everything will make perfectly good
sense there is another unary operator
that we could use and that's an
exclamation mark this is the same thing
as not so for example I could say five
is not so this right here sorry this is
not my original name
five plus five is ten
this is valuated as true but if I put
this non sign five plus five is not
equal to ten
well now this is false so that's a way
you can sort of do the opposite of what
may originally be true or false and get
true so that's the basics of unary
binary and ternary operators and once
you know those terms when you see him
it'll kind of help things so thank you
for watching that be sure to subscribe
and I will see you in the next video
where we will be getting into basic
conditionals and awesome stuff so yeah
don't miss it
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
