be talking about a new topic known as
cardinality at least I believe that's
how it's pronounced but if it's not
don't don't judge me
alright so I'll write that out for you
we actually talked about this a little
bit but we haven't really designed it or
anything because now we're talking about
actually drawing out databases
cardinality is basically the
relationship type between a row of one
table and rows or a row of another table
so I thought of a grew out the best
example I have for this is a credit card
database so like basically a credit card
company has a table for credit cards and
then a table for card holders or the
people who order the credit cards and
use them to buy things and basically
they're cut the credit card companies
customers I guess so
I will draw those tables out just for
you to see this I'm not going to draw a
real big or anything but just so you see
how the connection works so we have a
card holder and then over here we have
the card and there's some kind of
relationship between here between these
two tables now the only two
possibilities for cardinality are one or
many obviously for both sides so you can
have one too many one too many or many
too many those are the only three
possibilities now another thing to think
about when it comes to many to many that
might even you might even consider that
is not a possibility because you have to
have an intermediary table which we
talked about that when we talked about
designing many-to-many relationships
when when we're talking about many to
many relationships here it's logical
which which are what I mean by that is
were drawing it as a just like this and
we would say many to many and then when
we actually implement that in a database
we would have to have a card holder a
card holding table
and then the cars table that would be
how to draw a many-to-many relationship
so hopefully that kind of makes sense
for that so in reality when you're
actually drawing out finalized products
of databases the only possibilities are
one too many or one too many because
even if you have an intermediary table
this is going to be a one-to-many
relationship and then a one-to-many
relationship and there's certain way to
draw those out that's what I'm going to
be drawing right now so I wonder many
it's pretty simple the one side all you
have is a straight up-and-down line like
this the many side you have this this is
a thing that we're doing right now is
known as crows foot notation because it
looks like crows foot I think that's why
they call it that I don't really know
but this is a one this isn't many so
when we're drawing it one many we could
also have one two one of course so
that's another possibility I forgot to
mention one two one now before we start
drawing on both sides I think it's easy
just to think about one side they think
of a cardholder relationship to a card
we would have one card border now that
we have that side fit figured out we got
we just think about the card holder then
we can add in the card and we have many
cards so one card order can have many
cards and that's how you would design
the line between the tables like that
now there's another thing we need to
talk about known as modality which we'll
talk about in the next video but for
this we're just going to keep it simple
just drawing these things here but you
might see also like circles you might
see a circle here for example we'll talk
about that in the next video
so now you know how to draw a
one-to-many relationship so what is this
exactly mean that means one row can be
connected with many rows and the stables
it's not necessarily the table but the
rows within the table so we can think of
a specific card holder we've got out of
car holder with the name Jack ID of two
and we can have many rows over here
cards we could add a card with the ID of
ninety-six iv8 ID 12 and you can see
this guy has a lot of credit cards so
all of these rows can be connected to an
individual row within the cardholder
table now let's look at it the other way
we could have a convenient to one
relationship or basically a one-to-many
go in the other direction so we could
have this so now one card can be
connected to multiple people but
multiple people can't be connected to
one card I'm sorry one card can be
connected to multiple people but one
card holder can only be connected to one
card so that means one person can not
own more than one card so now we think
of it the other way around we have a
card
I was the id3 we have a card with the ID
for the ID of six doesn't really matter
what the numbers are and then we have a
card holder where you just got got a guy
named Jack leash
ID is three and then we got Bill
idea of - well we had we can have one
card attached to many people so this
card could be attached to many people
which means these people co-owned a cart
they're both the owner of one card but
now you have to realize an individual
cardholder can't be connected to
multiple cards so Jack cannot own
another card that's not going to work
out if you wanted that to work out then
you'd have to have the intermediary
table which we talked about in designing
we need to many relationships and this
this video is less to be a review of
relationships for more of how to draw
them so you have to realize the
difference between all these
possibilities one one one to many or one
to many it just depends on the actual
application alright so thank you guys
for watching sorry that was if I've kept
stuttering this is the first time I made
a video in a couple weeks so you know
first started I first started making
videos and I stutter and I can't get
things together but next video will be
awesome see ya catch you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
