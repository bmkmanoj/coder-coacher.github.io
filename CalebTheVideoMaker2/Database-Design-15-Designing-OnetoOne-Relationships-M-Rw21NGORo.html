design video series in the last three
videos we talked about one-to-one
relationships one-to-many relationships
and want too many to many relationships
this video I wanted to talk about how we
design these relationships I decided I
was going to break them up into three
videos so first we will be talking about
designing one-to-one relationships and
then one too many and then many too many
so this video will be about designing
one-to-one relationships in a database
alright let's begin so the first thing
we need to realize is that when we have
a one-to-one relationship the attribute
side so we have an entity so let's say
let's just say we have a connection
between a person and their their
username alright so we have this we have
this guy here let me give her these
boxes I don't need those we have this
guy and he has a username on a website
what I say it's kale Curtis that's
usually my username for things and we'll
just name this guy Caleb right well that
username the only person who's going to
have that username is him and he is only
going to have one username that account
is only going to have one username
that's a one-to-one relationship so we
need to realize that this is exclusive
to this person it's all hits no one else
owns it no one else is connected to it
it's only his so that means we can often
store one-to-one relationships as
attributes rather than entities so
rather than his username being an entity
it's in a tribute if you don't really
know what that means don't worry I'll be
explaining in just a second but just
think of it as it's exclusively his so
that is part it describes him what is
this guy's username
it's Caleb curry it's an attribute of
that person when we're talking about
one-to-many relationships though or many
to many we think of like a class so the
students of the class are not exclusive
to that class they can take other
classes therefore it wouldn't really
make sense to store them as attributes
because it's not really it just doesn't
make much sense and I know it will be
clear so just wait a second
so we can actually have a table the
relationship between the account and the
username of the account can be stored
just as a column within the table so we
have an ID and then we have a name for
example and then a username this
username is exclusive to this ID of this
person so like six Caleb Caleb curry
that is how we would design a one-to-one
relationship we would put it within the
same table but if we have a new row
within our table we now have a new
person this person can't have another
username that Caleb curry they have to
have a different one so we can make it
John one two three this name is
exclusive to that person so we just
store it as a column within our table
make sense so here are our individual
rows this points to this ID it's an
individual entity so the entity is the
account the username is an attribute to
that account there will be occasional
times when we store a one-to-one
relationship over multiple tables and I
will explain now when that would be the
case let's just think of an example of
database for a credit card company we
have a relationship between the
cardholder and the card by a cardholder
I just mean the person who who gets the
card and can use it to buy things the
person who owns it pretty much and then
we have a car
all right now let's just say this this
uh company only allows you to have one
credit card
so this cardholder can only have one
card and this card can only be owned by
one cardholder that means we have a
one-to-one relationship one-to-one how
would we store this in a database well
if we just want with you attribute thing
that we talked about earlier here's what
it would look like here's our table and
I'm just going to list the columns so we
have the D cardholder table first thing
is we've have like an ID from the
cardholder we would have probably card
holders first name the card borders last
name and then we would have the card so
we could say well that's their card we
could let's say we could assign every
card an ID or a card number so we can
saying card number if they have a card
we can give it a value if if they don't
have a card we can leave it null well
that can be considered and attribute of
the card board because all these point
back to the card board now if we want to
store more information about the card
such as the the issue date when the card
was given to the person
so we could say card issue
eight well now we can see that this is
relying on the card not the card holder
so if we want to store extra attributes
about the attribute in the one-to-one
relationship we can move that to a new
table and we can make it a card table
give it an ID and then we can say a card
number and then issue date now we can
store as much information about this
card so if we want to store the max
amount the late fee
pretty much anything we want to store
about this card can be stored in this
table and we can replace this card
number with a reference so the card ID
and that points back to this ID you see
what I'm saying this is a one-to-one
relationship over multiple people just
like this card has a connection to the
card holder there's a one-to-one
connection over multiple tables the
reason we did this is so it could store
more information about the card
because if we start it all in one table
we would have bad database design and
I'll show you why in just a second
all right so here's our table can I see
that all right we have the ID and then
the name of the person and then we have
the card number and then they get max
amount and so forth well you can see
that this table is really about two
things it's no longer about one thing we
would have to say this is a user and
card table which is not proper because
we're not following the rule of one
where a table should be about one entity
and a row should be about one entity
because now we have the user side and
then we have the cards up it's like
trying to store two tables in one the
only time it's okay acceptable to have
the card number in the users table is
when we don't store more information
about it because now all we have is a
card number the card number is about the
user it points to the user but the max
amount of the card has nothing to do
with the user therefore is reliant
dependent upon the card so I want a one
relationship in conclusion
one a one-to-one relationship the way it
is stored is either and a tribute within
the table or if you need to store more
information about the entity then we can
have another table and then just use
foreign keys to connect them which
that's something we'll be talking about
in an upcoming video almost always
though you will be seeing a one-to-one
relationship used as an attribute so
when you think of you have a 1:1
relationship between something you have
a connection let's say it's a dating
website the user is in a relationship
with another user that that's a
one-to-one relationship we could just
have that as a column within our user
table so we could have the user table we
could have the user ID with the name
first name last name a phone number or
whatever else and then we can say
relationship that's a one-to-one
relationship we could just have that
have that be an ID of another person and
we don't have to worry about having
another table for that so yeah that's a
one-to-one relationship in the next
video we'll be talking about designing
one-to-many relationships
