will be talking about converting from
numbers to text and back we talked about
the song throughout the previous videos
but I just want to explain things a
little bit more in depth so we talked
about some functions in the previous
video specifically int and float whoops
not flat these basically take a number
and can convert them to a specific type
of number such as in five point five
well this is going to take it and turn
it into five same thing float five will
turn float five point five point zero
obviously because but anyways the int
this can also be used for some texts so
if we have a string that's like five for
example well with these functions we can
convert those strings to numbers so
let's try it if I can type probably not
all right so here we go you can see that
it took a string and converted it to an
integer let's try it this way
same thing it works that way now there's
also a similar function for Strings
which is stir which stands for string
string that's kind of lost my speech
there for a minute so anyways let's say
if we have the number five well this
will convert it to a string five you see
what I mean
so we can convert numbers to strings in
certain strings to numbers but you have
to realize only certain strings can
become numbers let's try an example
where it will not work
let's go int and then within here we're
going to put yo dog now will this work
or will this not work you see it does
not work because this is not
even a number basically basically Python
is smart enough to realize this is just
a number but it's it's not able to
convert this to a number because it's
not a number so that that is a form of
protection but any number can be
converted to a string so you can see
that works and it does it apparently uh
does some rounding or something there
but anyways uh we'll get into some of
that more later there's another thing
when we're concatenated we could say
something like whoops I didn't mean to
gosh okay point hey dude well this would
not work because these are two separate
types this is string and this is number
you can see it doesn't work out so right
because it just just doesn't so way we
can do this is we can force this to a
string like that now we get hey dude
five so this allows us to convert it to
a string that way we can concatenate it
with strings because strings can only
concatenate with other strings hopefully
that all makes sense because if you have
it like this it's basically trying to do
a mathematical equation sort of how five
plus five it gives us ten and that that
doesn't work right and it can't convert
this number to a string by itself it
protects that datatype and keeps it as a
number so that's just just some things
to think about when converting from an
integer or a number to a string and a
string to a number any number can become
a string but only strings containing
only numbers can be converted to numbers
so like one more example real quick
this is not going to work out right what
we could do is we could say that will
work the same thing for variables if we
have a a variable like value which is a
string five let's say it was an input or
something from like we talked about a
couple videos ago well now we could say
we could force that to be an int and say
value plus five so that is just a little
bit of introduction on converting types
so thank you for watching guys and be
sure to subscribe and I will see you all
in the next video so peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
