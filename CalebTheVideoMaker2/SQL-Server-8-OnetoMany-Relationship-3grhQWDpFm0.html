server tutorial series this video we are
going to be my throat like welcome back
everyone to your welcome back everyone
to your sequel server tutorial series oh
gosh
really welcome back everyone to your
sequel server tutorial series this video
we are going to be discussing
one-to-many relationships the last video
we discussed one-to-one relationships
and we briefly mentioned one-to-many
relationships the example I gave in that
video was a blog posting website so
we're creating a website where people
can write blogs about themselves and
their lives or whatever and we made it
to where a user can write as many blogs
as they want but that blog is
exclusively owned by that one user so
this chicken wrote a couple blogs and in
this situation the blog is exclusive to
this chicken this is the perfect example
of a one-to-many relationship the reason
this is a one-to-many relationship is
because if you take one of these let's
say users and then you compare that to
these so you would say one user can have
many blogs but then you take one of
these and compare it to this so you say
one blog can be owned by only one user
this is the easiest way to figure out
what kind of relationship we have see we
have one user can have multiple blogs
but one blog can only have one user if
this said multiple users then it would
be a many to many relationship that's
what we're gonna talk about in the next
video but for now let's focus on
one-to-many and learn how to design this
in a database before we dive into the
actual way to design this let's go
through some incorrect ways to design
this that are common amongst improperly
designed databases this is the first
incorrect way to design a one-to-many
relationship as you can see we have the
blog's as an attribute
of the users so you can thank users as
the entity and then we have blogs as the
attribute and then you would just store
the content of the blog inside of this
column so Caleb curry posted a blog
about me and then I told my life story
why is this a bad thing for one it
doesn't give a separation of the
attributes for the blogs for example
this is the blog title so we might think
oh let's separate that a little bit
let's say blog title I'll make a new
column blog content and then you could
say whatever you wanted in your store it
as a string this is also bad though
because now we are actually storing this
as a one-to-one relationship that's
because we can only have one blog in
here so how do we add a blog if we did
it this way well we could say let's
throw a comma in here and put the next
blog name so now I have two blogs my
life and then we'll just put a comma or
something to separate the contents and
then we write the next blog well that is
also just really bad because these
values are no longer atomic they're not
their smallest indivisible pieces if you
had it this way and you did something
like select everything from users the
blog title would be returned as just a
comma separated list so you'd have and
this is just awful now we don't know if
this is one blog with the comma or if
it's two blogs it's just really bad
design so a way around this hmm let's
add even more columns so we could say
blog title too and store that and you
have a blog content too but that's also
really bad because now are limited to
two blogs and plus if someone only has
one blog that means all of this blog to
stuff is going to be null wasted space
it's stupid don't do that now let's go
into the third a bad way to do this and
that would be to actually add a row so
we would say Caleb curry and we would
put the second blog in here and in this
situation it's really not that bad
because we only have one username column
but if we had some other attributes of
the user in here for exam
we could have their phone well now we
have their phone number in here twice
this is just really really bad because
now we have redundant data bad you just
don't want to do that
so the three ways you don't store this
is comma separating your values adding
extra columns or adding rows with
redundant data three bad things you
don't want to do now let's talk about
the correct way to do this let's go back
to just one blog accidentally erased it
and what we need to do is we need to
take this blog and separate it out to
its own table and name it blocks now in
this situation we would have a reference
to the user which in this case we could
have a foreign key to the username or we
could use an ID if you want it and then
we would have column for the title and a
column for the content and that would
work just fine and now if you needed to
add another blog you would just add a
row so we have the first row Caleb curry
and then the about me in the title and
then the blog content right here and
then when you need another one you add a
row now the reference to Caleb curry
another title another blog content as
you can see my drawing is awful but in
this situation we don't have another
column here that says phone so we don't
have redundant data so let me just erase
this and kind of make a cleaner version
of this could I have a user's table and
one row could be like seven then we'd
have a blog stable have a blog ID title
and content and then each blog gets an
entry inside of this table and is
associated back to one user so we could
have user india seven login to you one
that would be one blog then if we had
another one to be seven two
that would be another blog and you can
see we don't have any redundant data
that's because the blog's table has the
bare minimum required to describe a blog
if we stored the blogs in here and we
added rows we would have the username
repeating we would have
repeating and that's just not good at
all and one of the important things to
remember here is that in a one-to-many
relationship you're going to need a
foreign key so in this situation we have
the user ID this is a foreign key up to
the user ID primary key and the users
table you could just as easily make this
username and reference the username it
doesn't really matter as long as there
is a way to associate it with one user
so that's that guys that's a one-to-many
relationship
it's a little messy I know this is
designed more for conceptual
understanding and once we start building
databases and we will actually you know
program this crap so hopefully by then
this will be a little bit more clear and
that's all guys so please be sure to
