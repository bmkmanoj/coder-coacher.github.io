like I said I would be going over some
cool terms you may run into these terms
will be about tempo I know we just went
over dynamics so I should have already
talked about these when we were going
over tempo or maybe I'll just put this
video first I don't know whatever
whatever I do doesn't matter so
basically when we're playing a song may
we will see beats per minute so like duh
is it ok as markers crab honey bee
markers so we could say 60 beats per
minute but we can also see some of these
cool tempo words fancy words I don't
know why they just I just like the idea
of just like symbols and stuff I don't
like the words but whatever it's cool do
you have pew which means more then we
have poco I think that's how you
pronounce it which yeah poco which means
little we have a chela Rondo or seller
ando which is another which means to
speed up it's where we get the word
excel and then with that we can also say
Ryland tato I made it that's how you
pronounce I don't know here we have
Ritardando which means to slow down all
tempo or a temple which means to go back
to the original tempo tempo point oh my
bad I was like what did I just right
tempo primo guys means to go back to the
tempo you had at the beginning of the
song moto is just a word for motion I
don't know why I decided to write that
definition to help but none of the
others and then um doppio probably
pronounced Mountain Rome movie Mentos
that means double the speed so speed
times two so some of these words you'll
see combined together for example maybe
since this one means motion we may want
to speed up the motion or we could see
more of
more motion or bolt you have to have
there's a whole bunch of our words i
recommend well i don't recommend because
of the boring but you can read the
harvard dictionary of music which will
go through almost every single musical
term you'll ever need to know but you
will see poker retard which means you go
up to your friends and poke them just
kidding but that means you slow down a
little bit because polka means little
and Ritardando it means to slow down or
a week retard you may see it retard with
an e which is just a different way of
spelling it and then um I think that's
all the terms we need to know for tempo
right now which I make it at this more
later but in the next video I will be
getting into terms for volume and some
of these will be used for can be used
for volumes such as this one can be used
for volume and so forth so yeah I'll see
it bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
