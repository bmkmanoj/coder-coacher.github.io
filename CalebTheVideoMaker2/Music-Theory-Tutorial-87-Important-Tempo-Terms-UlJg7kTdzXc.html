like I said I would be going over some
cool terms you may run into these terms
will be about tempo I know we just went
over dynamic so I should have already
talked about these when we were going
over tempo or maybe I'll just put this
video first I don't know whatever
whatever I do doesn't matter
so basically when we're playing a song
May we will see beats per minute so like
duh
okay this markers crap couldn't be
markers so we could say 60 beats per
minute but we can't also see some of
these cool tempo words fancy words I
don't know why they just I just like the
idea of just like symbols and stuff I
don't like the words but whatever it's
cool so you have pew which means more
then we have poco I think that's how you
pronounce it which yeah poco which means
little we have a cello Rondo or Celeron
dough which is another which means to
speed up it's where we get the word
excel and then with that you can also
say Rylan tato I made that say
pronounced I don't know then we have
Ritardando which means to slow down all
tempo or a tempo which means to go back
to the original tempo tempo we mo broke
my bat I was like what did I just right
tempo Primo guys means to go back to the
tempo you had at the beginning of the
song moto is just a word for motion I
don't know why I decided to write that
definition to help but none of the
others and then um doppio probably
pronounced mountain realm movimento that
means double the speed so speed times 2
so some of these words you'll see
combined together for example maybe
since this one means motion we may want
to speed up the motion or we could see
more of
more motion or both you have to there's
a whole bunch of her words
I recommend well I don't recommend
because it'd be boring but you can read
the harvard dictionary of music which
will go through almost every single
musical term you'll ever need to know
but you will see polka retard which
means you go up to your friends and poke
them just kidding but that means you
slow down a little bit because polka
means little and Ritardando it means to
slow down or a weak retard
you may see it retard with an e which is
just a different way of spelling it and
then um I think that's all the terms we
need to know for tempo right now which I
make it into some more later but in the
next video I will be getting into terms
for volume and some of these will be
used for can be used for volumes such as
this one can be used for volume and so
forth so yeah I'll see you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
