Kayla's video maker - and welcome back
to your MySQL tutorial series this video
we are going to start our discussion on
first normal form now first normal form
is our first layer of normalization it
gets rid of the most obvious most simple
mistakes in our database design and
first normal form really focuses on
things being atomic or singularity if
you want to make sure your database
adheres to first normal form you want to
make sure that every single column in a
table is single so if we have let's say
we'll go off of this example we've been
working on an auctioning site so this
site people can sign up for and they can
put items on there and sell them and
make some money and on this website
let's say you can put your social
network links on there so you can link
to your Facebook's and your Twitter's
and your MySpace's and your link dins
and your Twitter's though I already said
that
and your youtubes and your Google pluses
and your other social networks so how
did we set this up let's say we have a
user stable and we'll add some columns
we'll say user ID email now this is
where the first example of singularity
comes in each column describes only one
thing an email we don't have email and
social networks we split that out in
addition to that we want our column
headers to be singular so we could have
in here I'm going to break the rules and
say social networks with an S this is
breaking the rules because this implies
that you're allowed to put multiple
social networks in one row which are not
that's also breaking the rules of
singularity so each column has to
describe one thing and it has to
describe only one of that one thing so
one email in this situation how would
you put data in here well you might have
a user ID of let's say ten an email and
then you could put your social network
links on here so you could say you know
Facebook comma Twitter but this is not
single because we have two values for
that column which is breaking first
normal form now that we broke the rules
how do we
go about fixing it there's two ways we
can fix this the first one is in the
column header don't make it plural when
we do that we would imply that we only
want one value the downside to that is
that you can only have one value so we'd
say our Facebook so you have your
Facebook link and you're limited to just
one value in that column if you wanted
to try to put two you'd have to figure
out another workaround such as adding a
row but the downside here is that we
have this email repeating and we have a
primary key repeating which is not okay
so this too is not going to work so how
do we fix this the other way how do we
allow us to be in first normal form but
also allow multiple social networks the
only possible way is to add a table so
we can have a another table up here and
we can name it networks now it's going
to have a couple columns we could say IV
so each row is going to get an ID and we
could say user ID and then network so
now each network is going to get an ID
so you could say one and then we could
have the user ID of ten and this is a
reference so this would be a foreign key
to this column right here and then we'll
add the network in there obviously we
have put the whole link to their
Facebook but that's fine for right now
now that we have this we can alter the
original table we actually don't even
need the social networks column anymore
and we don't need this row because
that's redundant information and it's
not allowed so the final result is this
going to be a user ID an email and then
any other data that's related to the
user goes in here any data related to
the network would go in here this is
essentially making a one-to-many
relationship and you can go back and
watch that video about one-to-many
relationships but essentially this is
going to have a foreign key the user ID
and the parent is not even going to have
anything referencing back to the
children in the main table so the users
doesn't even need to know about the
networks now this column here you could
potentially get away without having it
because you could have this as the
combination for the primary key but in
this situation I think this way makes a
little bit more sense and that's how I'm
going to go for that one for now the
last thing with first normal form is
that every column needs to describe the
entity so in this situation we have a
user
table so that means we couldn't have a
column over here like listing details
that's because this doesn't even
describe the user so everything inside a
first normal form you could summarize it
as every column describes the key the
user ID in this situation and every
column describes it singularly so each
column is individual and there is no
repeating rows so if you make everything
singular I'm sure you will do just fine
with first normal form now you might be
asking what about this here users that's
plural well that's because it's a table
for users but each row describes only
one user you can't store two users in
one row so yeah guys that's first normal
form hopefully that was helpful if you
like this video click like and as always
be sure to subscribe because that really
really helps me out and I appreciate it
so be sure to watch the next video and I
will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
