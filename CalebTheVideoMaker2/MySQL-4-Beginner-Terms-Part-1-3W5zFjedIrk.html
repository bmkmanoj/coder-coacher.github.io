your MySQL tutorial series now as we go
through this series I'm going to be
throwing words at you and key terms and
if you don't know what these terms are
you're going to get lost that's because
when you start with databases there is a
ton of terms that you need to become
familiar with and if you're not you're
not going to be able to keep up with the
important information where those terms
are considered prerequisites because of
that I'm taking a couple videos just to
talk about terms and go through them all
so that way we're clear on what is what
so the very first term is data now data
my friend is just information
don't make it too technical or fancy
your you know data oh we collect data
it's fancy but really it's just
information when you take a bunch of
information and put it all together you
get what's known as a database so data
gets put into a database now how do we
work with this data we need something
known as a database management system
this is essentially a software that
allows us to work with all of this data
now MySQL is an example of a database
management system now if you took every
single database management system a
subset of those would be called
relational database management systems
to think this circle represents database
management systems inside that we have
relational database management systems
now MySQL is also an example of a
relational database management system so
if we had MySQL right here not only is
it a relational database management
system but it's just a general database
management system and that's pretty
clear from the name because they both
have DBMS in the title but not all
databases are relational database
management systems we still have all of
these databases
over here but what's the difference well
we're not going to focus a whole lot on
these databases right now but these ones
they are what's known as relational and
all that means is that they present our
data in tables a really cool word for
table is relation now what is a table
you can think of a square and within the
square you have what's known as columns
columns are the headers of the table the
table will also have a name so we could
say this is the membership table then
the columns are going to list the data
we want to store about memberships we
are essentially going to make a table
that lists possible memberships for a
gym or for a website or anything like
that so you might have you know an ID a
title and then a price so that's what
the columns of this table are ID title
and price now the other term you need to
know is row rows are data that we put in
to match these columns but we give
actual data not just categories of data
so we give an actual ID we give an
actual title and we give an actual price
so for example we can have the idea of
one the title could be silver the price
could be $30 or 30 whatever that is an
example of a row and we often have
multiple rows inside of a table you can
think of the rows as instances of
whatever the table is describing so each
row is an example of a membership and
the data it has is the ID title and
price you'll often hear a couple of
other terms when we're talking about
tables one of those terms is a record a
record is just another name for a row
you'll also hear the term field which
that usually describes one value inside
of a column or you can also call it a
cell now some people when you say field
they think of the whole column so that
can get a little confusing so I'm not
going to use that term a whole lot but I
will use record it'll also use the term
entry which is
same thing you can just think of
entering this data as an entry inside of
this table now when we have a table
sometimes it is appropriate to leave
some information out in this table we
don't really have a good column that we
can do this for but let's just go
through it and see what what that would
look like we could have another
membership with the idea for and the
price of 200 dollars but the title has
no value as you can see it doesn't make
a whole lot of sense in this membership
table because it's important that every
membership has the title but if we had a
column such as description it might make
sense to leave some of these blank so we
could say this is the ultimate title but
we can leave the description empty in
this situation you could say this is a
null a null is just an absence of a
value so continuing our list I'm going
to put that down here sometimes that's
appropriate sometimes that's not it's
often a decision you have to make does
it make sense for this to be null or
should we force every single row to have
a value for this column all of these
things are part of what's known as
database design database design makes us
ask questions like what tables do I need
what columns do I put in that table do I
allow them to be null or do I force them
all to have a value how are these tables
connected to one another how do I
enforce the way they're connected
all of that information essentially
database design is all about what's
known as data integrity that is actually
the term we are going to start with in
the upcoming video so you guys better go
check that out hopefully all this
information was helpful thank you for
watching please be sure to subscribe
click like and as always I'll see you in
the next video thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
