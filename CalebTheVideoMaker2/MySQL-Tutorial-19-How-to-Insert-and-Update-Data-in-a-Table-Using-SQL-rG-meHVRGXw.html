tutorial and in this video I will be
teaching you how to insert rows into
your columns so basically we have a
database gym which stores people members
of a gym like where you work out and
then we have a table members which
stores their information and we have all
this stuff now what we want to do is put
somebody into this so let's say with a
member ID of seven and so forth so first
name Caleb just like that so what we can
do is from home click Jim and type in
SQL and then from here we can type our
query
- you do on Jim so but I want to show
you something even cooler if you click
structure you can select members or from
the side select members and when you
click SQL from here it will display the
columns on the side to make things
easier which I always recommend doing
that if you always forget what you need
to put in so to do this we need to do an
insert command which first thing first
but the name of type of command it is
and then insert into the table members
and then we put values so insert into
members the values don't belong I'm just
saying in English first one for a member
ID remember I do one a birthday let's
say 1990
nine skids young then well it's not that
young
so then we're going to put in the what
is it phone number let's say four one
two three four five six seven eight nine
zero good phone number and if you
remember this was the type char it
wasn't a number so has to be in
quotation marks and also be sure to put
a comma after each entry so right here
we need a comma this keeps everything
separate now the membership status he's
going to be a gold member because he
likes to work out get his exercise uh
and then the first name would be Caleb
in quotation marks single quote I'm
gonna use single quotation marks and my
last name thirty all shoot there we go
it's like that so let's break this down
we insert into the column with the name
I mean the table with the name members
now insert into the column the values
one 1999 one two three four five six
seven eight nine zero gold and Caleb and
then curry so these will go into in
order these columns are here remember
idea one birthday 1999 which actually
that should be month value and add a
value so for let's say 13 yeah
14 13th of April
so then the phone number one two three
through all the way to zero membership
status is gold first name is Caleb last
name is curry then if you click go one
row inserted so if we go to members we
can see now we have a new line right
here and that's pretty good so next
thing I am going to be showing you is
another way to insert data into a table
so we have members SQL and let's type
out the old one insert into members
values now we have blob one here but I'm
going to show you something pretty cool
uh let's say we don't want to put a
member ID because if you remember it was
a primary key so what we can do is we
can say what columns to enter the values
it after the table name so we can have
birthday birthday phone membership stat
up status first name last I think that's
everything yeah right here on the side
everything but the member ID now the
values we don't have to put a member ID
because it's not listed over here
because all these will line up so if I
put them up let's say I thought I did
have to put a member ID in a put 24 then
that's going to be put as the birthday
which isn't going to work out right so
what we want to put four values the
first one would be birthday so 1970 307
24 27 like that seven twenty seven so
that would be the first entry into the
date and then the phone would be same
guy same one as the other
actually survivalist so we have 0 9 8 7
6 5 4 3 2
there we go comma and remember this is a
string I mean this is a char so we'll
need to quote those in quotation marks
and then the membership status let's
make this person silver last name Lenin
first name John now I also want to say
one more thing from now on instead of
keeping making mistakes all the time I'm
going to type both of the quotes first
and then I'm going to go back a
character by using the left arrow and
then I'll type into this quotes that way
I don't have to make as many clicks and
mistakes as I have been so hopefully
that helps things out and then if I
click go one row inserted and we go to
members table on the left you can see it
automatically made a member ID of two
that's what happens when you make it
auto increment and we must discrete
something up on the birthday because the
default value is zero zero zero zero
zero zero zero zero and then we have a
phone number a membership status first
name last name so now I'm going to be
fixing this and I figured out what I did
wrong
basically you have to quote dates so SQL
and we're going to I'm actually skipping
ahead a bit and I wasn't planning on
doing this but I mean everybody makes
mistakes don't hate me don't unsubscribe
I'm sorry so we're going to do an update
command and just follow me with this
update the table and then we're going to
set the column birthday too
let's say 1974 Beaufort sorry Beaufort
well that sounds great 12th of April and
then um now what we want to do is make a
where clause and if you don't understand
what's going on that's okay I'll explain
it in second where member ID is equal to
two so basically we're updating the
members table and we're setting the
birthday to 1974 April 12th and we're
selecting only the column where the
member ID I mean only the row where the
member ID is two so I open this in a new
tab don't see us cheat and look at the
manual I'm allowed to do that so the
member ID with two that would be this if
we didn't select a member ID it would
affect both of these and set both of
their birthdays the same day and all
right let's go one row affected so if I
go back over here click members we can
see now they are almost at the same
birthday but John Lennon it's born a day
before Caleb curry that's not my real
birthday so yeah sweet so thanks for
watching sorry for making a mistake I
guess I don't have to apologize this is
my video if you don't like it you can
leave yeah that's what's up
so subscribe and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
