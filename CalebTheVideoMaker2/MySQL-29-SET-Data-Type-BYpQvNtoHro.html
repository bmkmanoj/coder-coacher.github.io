maker - this is your MySQL tutorial
series and we are going to be covering
the set data type oh it's already
written there oh wait you can't see it
now set it's so similar to the enum or
emu however the heck you want to say it
data type so make sure you watch the
video over inna if you have enum figured
out figuring out set is a piece of pie
looking back at unum it allows you to
pick one of many options set on the
other hand allows you to pick many of
many options so literally you are going
to pick a set of data a group one of the
primary differences between set and enum
is that with set the number of available
options you're allowed to have is much
lower in fact you're only allowed to
have 64 whereas with enum you can have
thousands practically you should never
have more than 3000 but even with that
many options I mean that's a crap ton of
options you might not even need that
many 64 on the other hand is a pretty
small number you might hit that as with
the enum type the importance of the set
data type can be thrown into question
when you start talking about database
design I mean think about it
let's say we make a list of options and
we'll just make a couple here and over
here we have some rows so let's say this
is a row from the table this is a row
from a table and this is a row from a
table and these can all be in the same
table that's fine and one of the columns
in that row is of the set data type so
let's say this row picks this one and
this one and this one picks this one and
this one and this one picks all three
you can see that an individual entity
over here can pick multiple things over
here and an individual option can be
picked by multiple things so this is a
many-to-many relationship in database
design is well known that you should
never use sets now the set data type is
a little bit different because it's
designed to work as a set but even so
you can avoid the set data type by
having database design we've discussed
how to design many to
relationships when we were talking about
relationships all you would need is a
table for this a table for these options
and then an intermediary table to list
the associations from one of these rows
to one of these so to go through an
example let's give these to my DS one
two three one two three our intermediary
table would look something like this one
goes to 1 and 1 goes to 2 so it'd be
like this 1 1 1 2 2 most 1 &amp;amp; 2 goes to 3
7f 2 1 2 2 3 and then finally 3 2 1 2 &amp;amp;
3 3 1 3 2 &amp;amp; 3 2 3 you get the point so
the set data type is really not needed
and a lot of people see it as a
non-standard way of creating a database
that being said I'm not a database
expert if you know there is a genuine
reason to use the set data type go for
it I won't tell anyone except maybe your
boss and they'll get you fired I'm just
kidding but seriously now let's talk
about how to actually use this data type
in case you do decide to use it let me
clear off this board for you you declare
this data type just like you would the
enum data type so within a create table
statement or an alter table statement
for example you would give the column
and then you give the data type you know
it looks something like this now in
order to show this let's think of an
example in our bidding website we can
add items on there we also have
categories on this bidding website so an
item can be added to a category but it's
not always so that an item fits a
category exactly an item may fit
multiple categories so on our website in
this situation rather than having a
drop-down box where you can select one
you might have checkboxes where you can
select multiple and in this situation
you could have all of the available
options within a set data type and you
would literally just put the options in
here with single quotes separated by
commas now let's say we have an old
antique car the categories for this
thing might be automotive for automobile
transportation and antique so we are
going to list these in this set now
you normally would put all of the
available options here but for
simplicity I'm just going to put the
convenient three that we need and that
is how you would create the set data
type now the difference between set and
enum shows up when we are inserting data
so let's say we are inserting this data
into the listings table so we have one
listing for this car insert into
listings values and then once we got to
that column what we would do is we would
quote and then put all of the value
separated by commas and there you go now
notice the difference here in this
situation we quote every single value
but for this situation we quote the
entire thing only one time and then
separate each value by commas because of
that you don't want to use words that
have commas in them because it's going
to confuse my SQL now if you were to add
the same value in here twice it would be
ignored and when you select this data
back from the database it's going to be
organized in the order that it was
declared
additionally something you need to be
concerned about is what's known as a
collation and what this is it has to do
with character sets it's how things are
compared and some of these are case
sensitive some are case sensitive if
you're using a case sensitive collation
for a column you need to be careful when
you're inserting data because if you put
something lowercase when it's supposed
to be uppercase you're going to cause
some problems so yeah everyone that is
your introduction to the set data type
hopefully that was good for you and nice
and helpful if you've enjoyed this be
sure to click like and in the next video
we'll be talking about something new so
what guess not bad new we're still gonna
be talking about data types but we're
going to be moving on to numeric data
types so thanks guys I'll see you then
