there's this great program that'll help
you with basically everything state
MySQL workbench and just Google search
it first link this thing will help you
with everything you need to do up here
just click downloads and then you can
scroll down now you can download the
entire package which I probably
recommended but I'm only gonna use the
workbench out of these the tools so I
don't really need everything else so I'm
gonna click this and then Microsoft
Windows and then over here download the
Installer not the zipped crap I don't
want that stuff now I ask you to sign in
bla bla well you can just click no
thanks just start my download save that
and wait for this to be done this
probably take a while
alright that was pretty fast open this
this might come up yeah just you can
always yeah you bla bla this is the
installing location you can change it if
you want I'm just gonna keep it where
it's should be next now I always do
custom cuz complete usually installs
extra crap you don't need see
yeah I mean everything looks fine so
next install just wait for this
shouldn't be too long
alright guys it's done and I just wanted
to say if something comes up asking you
if you are sure you want to install this
or firewall or something just click yes
it's not going to harm your computer or
anything and click Launch the workbench
now and click finish
okay so this is what it looks like and
here's to develop SQL and make a new
connection and that's server
administration this is what you want
right here data modeling you click new
EER model and it looks like this and
just add a diagram by clicking right
here
and this is where you will do all your
database design well maybe not all of it
but this is where I'll be working and be
showing you what you need to do so thank
you for watching I hope this helped with
anything and if you have any questions
just leave me a comment or ask somebody
around in the comments thank you and
I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
