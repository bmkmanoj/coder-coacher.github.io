real quick I wanted to say I just
uploaded a new video on my other channel
well that is if you're watching this on
YouTube
Caleb the video maker too so basically
whatever channel this is on Caleb the
video maker to take off the to check
that out if you want that is if you're
in a cheesy humor cuz I sure AM and also
I just got new markers hope so now I can
use my whiteboard with some confidence
that you can see and if you can't I
I'm sorry but I'm pretty sure that's
pretty it's pretty visible so we'll see
how long these last and let's get
started so I haven't recorded in a
really long time this is like one of my
longest breaks it's been a couple of
hours so I am going to do a quick review
so we had the chord inversions for
example we can have C EEG and what we
can do is swap it to move to C over here
and we get e GC can we can do it again G
you see these are all chord inversions
of the C major chord which consists of c
e g and the reason it consists of c e g
is because they're all in major third
apart i mean a major 3rd and a minor
third or third so basically if we have c
d e f g a b c major scale take the first
and a third from that one two
basically one two three that's what a
third consists of you start on the no v
count on
you count the note you start on 1 2 3 1
2 3 so 1 2 3 1 2 3 or you can think of
it as taking the 1st the 3rd and the 5th
of the c major scale to get a C major
chord
hopeful that makes good sense and now I
wanted to go over 7 2 chords
so I've got my handy dandy eraser Oh
fancy I know okay erase this stuff
whoever invented that eraser ideas
genius so now let's make a D major
seventh chord no let's go Wow let's go G
major yeah so we have first we can
create a G Major scale G a B C D F sharp
and G now there's two ways you can think
about recreating or creating a G 7th
chord we can start with the G and then
we can go up a major third which will
bring us up to a B then we go up a minor
third which has three half steps versus
four which will bring us to a D and then
we can go up again either a major or a
minor if we go a major we'll get F sharp
if we go minor we'll get an F now we
want what's called the dominant seventh
and for that we do not want the F sharp
we want the F now most usually when
we're getting into 7th chords and you
have a 7th chord in a song a simple song
it'll say something like g7 this means
they want this not this
this is called the major slash minor or
what's called the dominant 7th chord so
you may see the short short hand Dom or
dominant bonus bow that that just means
we take the 7th note in the scale and
flat it or take it down a half step so
if you have F sharp and we lower the
half-step we get F naught F sharp will
crash so this is the note we use in the
seventh chord so that's one way we can
start from the bottom start on G go up a
major third to B go up a minor third to
D and just look on a piano just count
each half step so from like this key to
the black key right here will be one
half step and then you go up a minor
third to get F that is called the major
slash Minard that's like a slash it's a
really major slash minor G seventh chord
or g7 chord seven or seven doesn't
matter now the reason it's major or
minor is because we're taking a major
triad which consists of a major 3rd and
a minor third four half steps versus
three half steps sorry for writing
sideways um then we're just going to add
a minor third on top of it so we get
major then we add a minor third saying a
major slash minor this is also known as
the dominant seventh cool so now that I
ranted about that for a couple hours the
other way we can figure this out is to
take the first
the third fifth and seventh flat of a
scale so how do we do that here's the
first because it's the first note of the
scale one two three here's the third one
two three four five here's the fifth one
two three four five six seven here's the
seven f-sharp if we lower it a half step
just one key on the piano we get F boom
so this creation would be G B D so now
for chord inversions of a seventh chord
we had G and F one of the inversions is
we can have the D F and G we can have D
G B F G B D and then finally we can go
back to the original G F this one's one
off defier because we're going up the
scale so what did I do here well if I
take this scale this is the first third
fifth seventh I'm taking the first and
putting it at the end so we actually
start on the third and then we put the
first at the end so now if I look at
this on a keyboard I'm gonna have to get
one because I don't have one right here
basically we're just let's say we have
the notes here we're taking this one
scoot it onto this end then we do it
again take this one so go down to that
end that's how the whole concept works
so yeah I'm gonna get a keyboard real
quick so here's my keyboard and it's
shorted out so bad I had to build a
contraption I wrap the wire around it
and I put my phone on top keeping the
wire in place now it is working so
hopefully nobody calls me Oh like
anybody would alright so here we have a
man my phone fell but the piano is
working so that's good oh that's G sir
okay G chord G seven four dominant seven
G chord when you take the G move it up
to the front so move this up to this G
and I'll clip higher taking this raising
it twelve half steps one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten eleven
twelve
basically all that's all we're doing
then we take the B okay this is the
first inversion we take the B move it up
octave so now we get this is the second
inversion take the D move it up to here
we get the third inversion and then we
take the F move it up and we are back to
the original root position chord the
root is the don't you start off and it's
in the root the base the root is in the
base which is good so that is chord
inversions for gd7 cores so be sure to
subscribe and in the next video I will
be talking about a new type of chord
notation and it's really cool so I
suggest you watch it see you then right
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
