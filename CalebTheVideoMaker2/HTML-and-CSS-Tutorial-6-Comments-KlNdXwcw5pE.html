HTML CSS series all right so I wanted to
go over something I kind of forgot to
explain in the first few videos so I
thought I would use it to help us
understand what's going on here
so what I'm going to be going over is
known as comments so comments they are
you can they're sent to the browser so
we can view them but they don't show up
on the web page so I know that's
confusing but we put them when we need
to explain something that's going on so
here's how you make it comment so if you
look closely what we have is we have a
this line 12 on line 12 we have a less
than sign and exclamation mark two
hyphens or dashes whatever you want to
call it and then we have the comment
right here so we could put whatever we
want and then if we save it and go to
our page refresh it you can see we don't
see it anywhere but if we just put a
comment like that well look what look
what look what happens we can't see it
so when you put it between these little
comment openers and comment closers it
is not displayed on the page so I'm save
refresh that's what's great about
comments is we can use it so when we are
looking at our code 40 years from now we
can understand what's going on because
when we're creating the code it might
all make sense well after a while it
starts to get confusing and you see all
these these opening tags and closing
tags that you're not even sure what's
trying to happen so comments can come in
very handy so if you don't know this
already when you're on a website you can
right click and I'm in faut I'm in
Google Chrome it might be a little bit
different for the other browsers well
for Google Chrome you can right click
and click inspect actually no we go to
view page source I'm pretty sure that's
the same for all browser sorry and you
can view everything the website has so
all this stuff is not secret so don't
put anything too significant in here
that somebody could steal or something
write your password on here and then put
it on a website but the comment you can
see is still visible so to viewers of
your website comments are visible you
just don't see them on the website
itself so if we see it right here now we
don't see it anywhere we can highlight
it doesn't show up it's not showed on
the website so that is how a comment
works so good commenting would be
something like this up here we can go
all right let's start a comment and then
close a comment within here we could say
by the way this is a multi-line comment
so you can put it over multi lines and
also when you're programming with other
programming languages such as JavaScript
PHP those are going to have the most
comments where hTML is simply the basic
stuff and is often developed by PHP and
I'm basically you will use PHP comments
way more than HTML comments but since
we're using HTML let's let's do this
thing we might say this page is designed
to show for theirs to show database
users aims side I don't know proper
grammar in here names would be that I'll
shoot out on them they're supposed to be
gosh I stink it English let's figure out
some of the ways they just show the
databases users the database users in a
table displaying name age and
description
so that is the intent of our page and
that's exactly what it does now we could
say developed by Caleb curry or a
company named LLC whatever and you can
say contact at Booker and put your email
or whatever and then you could say
developed what's the date let's just
make up a date for fifty seven ninety
five which obviously is impossible so
this is an example of a bad comment
that's not how you want your comments to
look you want a day date that actually
exists like the sixth so this would be
January February two bull headers first
row gonna copy this easy second row
third row fourth row and I mean
obviously you're not gonna have to go
through every single thing and write a
comment about it because once you figure
out that this little is this is a row
this is probably a row too because it
looks almost exactly the same so as you
can see it doesn't go to the browser so
that's very useful when you need to
comment something out or if you're not
if you're working on something and
you're not sure if it's giving you an
error or not you can comment it out like
this and then you can see it disappears
from your web page but then when you
need it back you just delete these
comments comment markers and boom it's
back so that's pretty useful that's
really all I have to say about comments
sorry if I ramble on a bit but just
wanted to get it clear in your brain so
in the next video we'll be talking about
I think links so I will see you then
