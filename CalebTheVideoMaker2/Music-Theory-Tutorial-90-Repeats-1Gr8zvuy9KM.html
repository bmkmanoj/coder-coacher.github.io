pen go all right sometimes we get lazy
I'll take my jacket off cuz it's hot
I'll get hotter than I get colder then I
got hot in the nickel I get cool so
we're writing here's our staff can you
even see that hopefully you can next
measure here's our staff next measure
there's your staff now we can see
sometimes we get tired of writing the
same thing if we have a repeating
pattern let's say these are half notes
we do the same thing here and we don't
want to write it anymore we can write a
repeating symbol which looks like this a
slash and two dots that's telling the
musician to play the previous pattern so
if we see one of these with that too
somewhere along the lines of it that
means play the last two measures and so
forth it looks like almost like a % yeah
it kinda is % sit so that's what that
looks that looks like that's what that
means when we are repeating rests as in
you don't play for a really long time
sometimes you will see what looks like
this as markers dying which is sad
because I don't know what else somebody
who's this is my best one mm-hmm rishton
piece hmm okay under this one which
doesn't probably work at all all right
sometimes we'll see a bar like this with
a six or something that means you're
going to rest for six measures that's
what the number means that is another
way instead of writing whole rest whole
rest pull rest whole rest and whole rest
they can just write six boom takes up
less room takes up less time so well it
takes the same amount of time when
you're playing it but to make it it's
faster another thing you need to know
about when reading music is repeating
sections as I said earlier you can use
this little thing but sometimes you want
to repeat an entire section and remember
how I said you can have like a two above
it rather than doing that what we can do
is let's say this is the beginning
song we're playing we reach the ending
of the song if we put two little dots or
a colon this means to repeat that
section so we go back to the last ending
bar by the way an ending bar is either
two black lines or a really solid black
line I'll try and find one to show you
so that means to go back to the end of
the measure so let's say we have oh my
gosh Claire leave me alone so let's say
we have a sullen and we want to repeat
um two measures 30 times ok so we're
playing we're playing and we reach that
part where we want to repeat what can
make a ending bar which doesn't mean you
stop playing unless told to it means you
continue to go and then we have these
two measures so one two and a repeat
sign this is a by the way this is not an
ending bar this is a measure bar so
that's the difference between a measure
bar an ending bar is thicker or two of
them so now it says repeat 40 times that
means we're going to go play this once
go back planning in that's one repeat to
repeat three repeat for repeat five
repeat 6 your feet uh uh uh oh okay I'll
stop huh huh this thing works better as
an eraser than a marker uh-huh so
anyways the first time is not counted as
a repeat so we go 1 then we repeat it
for the first time so that means we play
it twice too so that is all I have to
say for now about that so in the next
video we'll be going over some more
awesome music stuff of course because
it's all awesome right so I'll see you
then and thank you for watching see you
later oh and by the way this is an
ending bar where to go right here this
is a measure bar so for example that is
an ending bar and that isn't ending bar
it doesn't always mean that we stop
playing although typically it will so
yeah that's all hey guys in this video I
want to go over what's called a fermata
a fermata is a way to hold a note for an
extended period of time
told to until you're told to stop it
will look like this so here's a note we
have a loop over it or half loop and
adopt that's what a Fermata looks like
so if you're at the end of a song duh
duh duh you want that singer or any
instruments to play that note until you
cut them off or until they can't breathe
anymore and die but that is the way to
write with a half circle dude so here's
a circle nice the bottom half so in
order to draw a circle first you draw
the face and then you erased the face
and then skating alright so that is how
you drop and that is a fermata okay bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
