pen go alright sometimes we get lazy
I'll take my jacket off cuz it's hot
I'll get hot and then I get cold then I
got hot in the nickel I get cool so
we're writing here's our staff can you
even see that hopefully you can next
measure
here's our staff next measure
there's your staff now we can see
sometimes we get tired of writing the
same thing if we have a repeating
pattern let's say these are half notes
we do the same thing here and we don't
want to write it anymore we can write a
repeating symbol which looks like this a
slash and two dots that's telling the
musician to play the previous pattern so
if we see one of these with it to
somewhere along the lines of it that
means play the last two measures and so
forth it looks like almost like a % yeah
it kinda is % sit so that's what that
looks that looks like that's what that
means when we are repeating rests as in
you don't play for a really long time
sometimes you will see what looks like
this this markers dying which is sad
because I don't know what else somebody
is this is my best one mmm
rest in peace hmm okay under this one
which doesn't probably work at all
alright sometimes we'll see a bar like
this with a 6 or something that means
you're going to rest for 6 measures
that's what the number means that is
another way instead of writing full rest
full rest pull rest pull rest and whole
rest they can just write 6 boom takes up
less room takes up less time so well it
takes the same amount of time when
you're playing it but to make it it's
faster another thing you need to know
about when reading music is repeating
sections as I said earlier you can use
this little thing but sometimes you want
to repeat an entire section and remember
how I say you can have like on 2 above
it rather than doing that what we can do
is let's say this is the beginning of
we're playing we reach the ending of the
song if we put two little dots or @ :
this means to repeat that section so we
go back to the last ending bar by the
way an ending bar is either two black
lines or a really solid black line I'll
try and find one to show you so that
means to go back to the end of the
measure so let's say we have oh gosh
Claire leave me alone so let's say we
have a song and we want to repeat two
measures 30 times okay so we're playing
we're playing and then we reach that
part where we want to repeat what can
make a ending bar which doesn't mean you
stop playing unless told to it means you
continue to go and then we have these
two measures so one two and a repeat
sign this is a by the way this is not an
ending bar this is a measure boy so
that's the difference between a measure
bar and ending bar is thicker or two of
them so now it says repeat forty times
that means we're going to go play this
once
go back planning in that's one repeat to
repeat 3 P 4 P 5 P 6 your feet stop this
thing works better as an eraser than a
marker well so anyways the first time is
not counted as a repeat so we go 1 then
we repeat it for the first time so that
means we play it twice 2 so that is all
I have to say for now about that so in
the next video we'll be going over some
more awesome music stuff of course
because it's all awesome right so I'll
see you then and thank you for watching
see you later
oh and by the way this is an ending bar
where'd it go
right here this is a measure bar so for
example that is an ending bar and that
isn't ending bar it doesn't always mean
that we stopped playing although
typically it will so yeah that's all hey
guys in this video I want to go over
what's called a Fermata
a Fermata is a way to hold a note for an
extended period of time and
hold two until you're told to stop it
will look like this so here's the know
we have a loop over it or half loop and
a dump
that's what a Fermata looks like so if
you're at the end of a song you want
that
singer or any instruments to play that
note until you cut them off or until
they can't breathe anymore and die but
that is the way to write with a half
circle dude so here's a circle race the
one man so in order to draw a circle
first you draw the face and then you
erased the face and then skating all
right so that is how you draw and that
is it for mana okay
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
