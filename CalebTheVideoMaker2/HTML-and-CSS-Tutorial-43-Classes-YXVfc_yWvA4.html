video I've talked a whole lot about IDs
and I'm going to talk in this video
about classes but first I'm going to go
get something to eat because I am
starving so yeah I will see you in just
a second hey guys I'm back man that was
pretty delicious yeah so I went in there
thinking I am going to eat some peanut
butter and jelly and I was like oh no
because I open the cabinet and I saw a
box of pop-tarts so my heart was all
like no man go for the peanut butter
jelly and why mine is all like no man
had good for the pop tarts and I didn't
know what to do but I eventually just
ate some pop-tarts because yeah they're
pretty good i toasted them and
everything so they were pretty
scrumptious and now we're going to be
talking about classes so for those of
you who don't know a class is where a
bunch of people get together and learn
about something no I'm just playing that
that's like a boring class real classes
are like my videos and then when we're
talking about real classes in CSS
there's something there's something else
so just like we can have IDs we can also
have classes it works almost exactly the
same way so see how this ID is comment
important instead I can make it class
equals column and important and then if
I want to address it in the CSS instead
of a pound sign which is shipped three I
can put a period so now it's calling the
class comet important and we we
underline it we could also do anything
else like I don't know I can't think of
anything oh font wait wait wait wait it
already is bold so that was pointless
yeah so we can make comment important so
all of the important comments are going
to be underlined now we can the cool
thing about of class is there's a
fundamental difference between a class
and a ID and I'm going to draw that out
for you right now so a class
let's say this is a class alright and
then here we have different elements or
tags in HTML alright and then here is a
is a ID let me draw that out class ID
oops cancel and then the difference
between it is when you're having an ID
only one thing can have an ID so this
can have the ID of whatever the ideas
but only want so if this discuss that
this ID as well then that's not going to
work right that's because it's an
identification it points back directly
to this guy or whatever it is so this
could be a paragraph tag or something
and my phone is going off wait game Oh
ma'am ah me I'm just so popular not
really but with a class let me get rid
of that extra pair there with a class
multiple people can join that glass sort
of like I was talking a school class you
can have multiple students in this class
and then if you affect the ID the only
people affected is this guy if you
collect affect the class well anybody in
the class is affected and don't you guys
love how my drawings make sense at first
and then I end up like scribbling all
over them until you can t and see what's
going on anymore and it's like oh so
let's try something out let's let's
change this back to ID save it go to the
style and change this to pound so now
it's underlined well let's give this the
ID the same IP we got ID equals comment
and Portman and if i refresh it alright
alright so you can see that it works
although if you if you're really looking
for a good developing what developed
website this will not pass validation
and other things so for a rule
some if you want to be a good developer
I'm going to tell you what to do alright
so first IDs their unique I'm going to
get out the paint again I think it's
funner let's see they all right sweet so
I'm gonna delete everything boom so we
are starting fresh so IDs and then we
have classes all right so these are
unique all right that means I'll get to
that in a second not unique I always
click Save I think I'm type in HTML all
right IDs that means each element can
have one ID so i can have a paragraph
tag with with ID equals something and
then i can end the paragraph tag
although for a class i can have a
paragraph like i have class equals i can
make the class paragraphs and i can also
make it class equals errors if it's some
kind of error pic paragraph so that's
one thing another thing each element or
yeah each element each page can have one
element that has that specific ID so if
i have a paragraph and in another
paragraph ID these should not be the
same there are two separate ones so they
should not be the same thing i'm trying
to get my pen back at home there we go
so they shouldn't be the same but
classes they both can be the same so
that's a fundamental difference as you
can see it works although I didn't you
know it works is that are really tried
it but yes when classes when you're
working with classes you want to instead
of using an ID here we could use a class
and this is better for us and then we
address it in the CSS we put a period
instead refresh I so now all the
important comments get underlined they
are in the class of important so let's
try adding another class class
equals error all right fatal error so
this is an important comment this is an
important comment with an error so I can
say what I named it photo any error I
can say anything in the class error we
can make it safe font size is 30 pixels
so it's very important all right I
figured out what the problem was all
right so the problem was that by
changing the error class it wasn't
affecting my text even though I clearly
stated it was in class air well the
proper way to assign it to class error
is to press space and then add another
error I mean class name so now it's in
this class and it is in this class I
didn't I put two class declarations like
this and then I had class equals and
then class equals which is improper so
when I do it now you can see fatal error
becomes very huge and i also deleted
like all of our cool stuff here there we
go let me china is oh Eric font
size 60 pixels so now fatal error that's
pretty awesome so that's all I really
have to say for this and in the next
video we will be talking about styling
links which is really cool so I will see
you then thank you and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
