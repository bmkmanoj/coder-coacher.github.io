video maker and it is so stinkin cold
I have ostrich bumps like naked party
degrees I really don't know what that
means but everyone says goosebumps
what's the special Adak goose this video
we are going to be talking about
something's wrong with me we can be
talking about varchar' make sure you
watch the previous video which discusses
the char datatype because a lot of that
is foundational to the varchar' datatype
now the special thing about varchar'
datatypes is that it doesn't pad our
data that means if we make a bar chart
of 50 characters and we put in something
like hello and a char datatype it would
Pat it with 45 spaces but varchar' is
literally going to store only five but
there's the downside in that since all
the strings aren't the same length mysql
is going to have to keep track of the
length of each string and that's going
to make it mad and because of that it's
going to punish you by making each
string take up an extra byte or two so
this will be five characters plus one
byte now in this situation each
character is probably one bite each but
do keep in mind different encodings so
I'm going to talk to ton on encodings
but utf-8 is a very common one that
allows for multiple different languages
English is going to be one byte each but
once you get into like Asian characters
or some other languages you are going to
have up to three bytes each in MySQL so
this five character string could be up
to potentially sixteen bytes and be 15
plus one now we'll talk a little bit
more about this one just a little bit
because I said one or two but worry
about that in just a moment now the
maximum size for a varchar' column is
65,535 bytes now this is a per value
measurement so if you have a table each
row can have up to 6 5 5 3 5 bytes you
also once again have to consider the
encoding for example some characters can
take up to three bytes that means you
automatically need to devise
by three and each row stores up to two
bytes to keep track of how long that
string is so you need to subtract two
from that
additionally MySQL has what's known as a
row the row limit is also six five five
three five bytes
that means if we try to make the max
varchar' the row limit is going to be
hid and we're not going to be able to
create any other columns that store any
data now when you're using a character
sets such as utf-8 each character can
take up to three bytes and MySQL takes
that into consideration because it needs
to know how much space to allocate for
this column so when you create a
varchar' and pass in something like
65,000 well you're using the utf-8
encoding that's not going to work
because it's going to do the math and
say 65,000 times 3 equals a ton and it's
going to pass that role in it this is a
little bit different than how char works
because if we say char 255 which is the
max for char you can store 255
characters regardless of whatever the
sizes for varchar' since we have this
role in that we can't go all the way up
for max that means you're limited to a
little bit less than a third of this so
to be on the safe side I would never go
past like 20,000 and that being said you
should never go over what you need what
I mean by that is if every row is only
going to have 2,000 characters there's
no need to create a column that can
store up to 20,000 now I mentioned
earlier that MySQL has to keep track of
the length of the string and I said it
takes 1 or 2 bytes
well if the number of characters is 255
or less it only takes one bite if
there's any more than that it'll take 2
bytes so if we talk a little bit more
about storage if you have an 8 bit
number which I know we haven't discussed
binary a whole lot but an 8 bit number
allows for 8 zeros or once and we have
the maximum for that it would look like
this and if you take this binary number
that represents 255 we can't represent
any more than 255 with this number and
if we need to go above 255 we actually
add a byte so that's an overview of
varchar' hopefully that was helpful in
the next video we are going to be
talking about another
character type that you should know
about so be sure to check out that video
