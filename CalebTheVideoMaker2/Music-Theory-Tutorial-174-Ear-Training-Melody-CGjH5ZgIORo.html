will be talking about ear training and
transcribing with the melody so so far
we have a bunch of different information
and you can do this in pretty much any
order you want let's say you want to
figure out the rhythms first or the
chords first or the intervals first well
now I'm going to be going over the
rhythm and I mean sorry melody suertuda
rhythm so first thing match the notes
with the rhythm so I recommend doing the
rhythm first because then if you know
it's a quarter note dotted quarter
followed by an eighth note you could
just say okay that's see and that is a d
sharp for example or e flat whatever you
want so once you got the rhythm down you
just have to figure out what notes the
rhythm all rhythm is consisted of sorry
what the rhythm consists of and then BAM
you have pretty much a transcribed song
so then if you haven't already figure
out the musical phrases if you haven't I
doubt you can read any of this this is
more for my personal use otherwise I get
in front of the camera and I'm like uh
so yeah and I hate the word uh I think
it's really annoying so I try not to say
uh because I think I was annoying
alright anyways next figure out the note
this song resolves on and starts on
typically not always but typically that
is going to be the tonic or the first
note in scale and we'll be getting into
transcribing with use ear training with
the key in the next video so that's sort
of going into the future but figure out
the note we end on and start on that's
going to help us a lot then if you
figure out the intervals from this note
then you can figure out okay let's say
this is a perfect fifth but you're not
sure the notes once you figure the note
we start on let's say it's see we can
figure out that this is a G so that
helps us figure out what notes they are
then once you do all that play what you
have with the recording and see if it
sounds right if there's that if you
let's say you're no sounds lower or
higher then you may want to adjust that
you can
get out once you figure out all this if
it sounds close but it's kind of often
has a little bit of tension it may be
like a sea instead of a seat sharp which
causes small dissonance and so forth
then if you want try to add the chords
in we talked about the chords now try
doing the harmony and the melody if
you're having trouble with that you may
want to check out the chords video again
figure out what you're doing wrong there
or something try some new chord
progressions or just listen a lot and
try different chords and then next if
you're having any problems with this see
my next video which will be over keys
which is going to probably be the most
useful thing to you to figure out what
key the song is so that's all I really
have to say for this video is kind of
short but I will see you in the next one
if you want to support me please
subscribe like my facebook and follow me
on Twitter and that's all so I will see
you in the next video thank you bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
