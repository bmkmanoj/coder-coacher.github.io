now earlier in a cup a long time ago a
couple videos ago I made a song mary had
a little lamb now if we move that too
that was in the key of I don't know I
don't know probably see but if I can
what's called transpose it so it's
higher pitched than in order for it to
sound the same I have to transfer it to
a different scale so let me show you
what I mean if we're annex gay love see
which has no sharps or flats it's all
white keys versus scale of d which
actually has an f-sharp and a c-sharp if
they remember that so if I have a song
that goes see e.g f those are the notes
and it's in scale of C and it's a little
too low pitch for me so I want to kind
of boost up the pitch then I can
transform it or convert it or transpose
it the technical term into the scale of
D so now it will become a DD we're
starting on D we're basically scooting
everything up to half steps e will
become f-sharp G will become a and F
will become G now look if you don't
understand why in order for us to make
it sound the same or similar it has to
the notes have to have the same distance
apart just because this hasn't a sharp
does not mean it sounds different
compared to a d for example from an e to
a G it goes e2f1 half-step F to G is a
two half steps so there's a total of
three so between here there's three half
steps
now f sharp to F sharp goes to G which
is one half step g goes to a which is 2
half step there's still three half steps
between these notes so the distance is
still the same it just sounds different
let me try and play this for you
probably won't sound very pleasant so
that's my song now if I play it in the
key of D it would be yeah thnkx you
versus when the key of C now let me show
you why all right originally we have C E
which is four half steps in between g
three half steps then I go back to half
steps same thing for d3 half step 4 half
steps would bring me to F sharp and then
to a which is three and down to G so
we're still work in order that's called
playing in the scale so everything is
diatonic you remember that word not
chromatic now let's say I put a
chromatic note in here C sharp well now
and the key of D it's going to be d
sharp if you don't really know what's
going on that's okay don't don't worry
about too much all I'm trying to say is
that the distance between notes has to
say the same or it's going to sound
weird as long as the distance between
the notes stays the same what note you
start on is not that important for
example if i go from C to e versus D to
F sharp there's how many half steps
between see any show you it's called a
major for a major 3rd sorry see
four half steps so for now do you f
sharp one two three four four so that
this they are they're not the same but
they sound major that's the magic of
these intervals because this is a major
a third no I'm right and weird but when
we're on in music we can stay within a
scale and create good sounding music by
following the intervals between notes
just because there's a sharp doesn't
always mean there's a bigger gap because
if you remember from E to F there's no
black key so here's E here's F and then
here is G with a black key so e to F
sharp would be too whereas F to G would
be to that make sense hopefully it does
and if that video that this video wasn't
very useful that's okay because there's
going to be a ton more so you're going
to learn and it all makes sense in the
end so thank you for watching that was
playing in the scale so yeah see you
soon thanks subscribe
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
