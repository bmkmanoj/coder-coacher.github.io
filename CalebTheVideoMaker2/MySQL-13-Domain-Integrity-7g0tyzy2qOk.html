from cable to video maker 2 and in this
video we are going to be talking about
domain integrity
now I'm fairly confident in you guys
what we've studied about MySQL is
probably enough to where you already
have domain integrity the reason I'm
making this video is so that we cover
all the details of integrity for one and
for two when someone says domain
integrity you're not like I don't know
what you're talking about just because
you might understand all the pieces of
domain integrity doesn't mean you
understand that those pieces build
domain integrity if that makes any sense
at all so once we start talking about it
might make a little bit more sense
domain integrity is essentially when our
data fits what is appropriate or what is
expected for a certain column this
requires us to define what's allowed and
what's not allowed that whole concept is
known as domain the proper data inside
of a column contributes to domain
integrity so if we have a column and
we're expecting a phone number we want
to make sure all of that data in that
table for that column stores a phone
number not just random text or some few
numbers but not the whole thing we want
to ensure that the data is as close as
possible to what's expected so the
domain establishes what's not allowed
and what is allowed so we want to make
sure all of our data fits inside of here
and it doesn't go too far this way or
too far that way this is kind of this
might make sense with numbers like not
too low or not too high but I'm just
kind of drawing this generally we got to
make sure we fit within the rules so we
don't want to make something too long we
don't want to make it too short we don't
want to make it too high we don't wanna
make it too low everything like that so
another way to think about it is this
entire thing would be the possible
values but we are only going to accept
some of the values inside of this area
right here that is domain now with MySQL
there are a few ways we can enforce
domain the first is with the data type
this is by far the easiest way to get
some level of domain on a column that's
because if you have something such
is a numeric data type that's
automatically going to reject strings
like string that's because this is not a
number it's a string it doesn't go
inside of a numeric column so data type
is one way obviously the two constraints
we talked about not in all and unique
these can also be used to help with the
domain integrity because we can force
every single row to have a value or for
every single row to have a unique value
that further restricts the data all of
these are the simple way of protecting
our domain
now some database management systems
have what's known as a check constraint
and these things are pretty cool but
unfortunately MySQL does not have these
that's when you can say something like
we want a value to be between five and
fifty for example there are ways to
mimic this in MySQL but that requires
more advanced MySQL knowledge so we're
not going to dive into that right away
that means if we want to be very
specific on what's allowed like if we
want to say oh just this data and so we
could say something like any phone
numbers that fit a certain format that's
all going to have to be done with
advanced MySQL or application logic what
does that mean though imagine a website
right and you're signing up and you have
to put in an email and you just put some
garbage in there that's not an email
clearly what you can do things to make
sure that that data is an email for one
on the client-side you can make the
input an email which with HTML five
that's already going to bark at you and
tell you you're doing it wrong then even
if someone bypasses that by modifying
the HTML we can have server-side code
such as PHP check the data and see is
this really an email and if it is then
we can store it into the database if
it's not we can return an error so all
of that goes outside of the database
into the application it's a separate
thing but just know that we can restrict
data to be very specific not so easily
with MySQL although it is possible so
thank you guys hopefully this was a good
overview of domain integrity obviously
we're not supposed to dive in and call
for the whole concept of domain
integrity we're not going to get into
this stuff or how to mimic check
constraints in MySQL for a long time so
let's start slow let's go with this
hopefully I was helpful and as always I
will see you in the next video
