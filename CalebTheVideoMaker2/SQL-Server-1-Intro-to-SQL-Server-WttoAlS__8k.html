Caleb's video maker - and welcome to
your first video in your series over
sequel server now we are going to be
covering a lot of information in this
series but to start let's just talk
about what sequel server is sequel
server is what's known as a relational
database management system there are
many different kinds of relational
database management systems the one we
are going to be talking about in this
series is known as Microsoft SQL or
sequel server now sequel server is the
database management system that can cost
money but there are free versions so
that's great I'm going to be using that
one so you guys are welcome to join me
now what is a database a database is job
is to store data now I know that's
pretty obvious from the name but let's
get a little bit more specific what is
data basically data is anything we want
to store and use at a later date
oftentimes databases are used for
businesses that way they can analyze
data and make business decisions off of
that data for example if you're talking
about sales right you can calculate what
items are selling the most how much is
selling what price are they being sold
at who's buying them all of that
information can be calculated from data
that is stored inside of a database so
using data within a database we can get
a summation of how our business is going
there's other uses - not just for
analyzing data but often databases are
used to power applications so if you
have an application here often there
will be a back-end database and then
when the user puts information into this
application it will get stored in a
database then the next time that user
uses the application it's going to get
the data from the database and present
it to the user so databases are often
used for websites when you sign in when
you create user accounts when you
purchase stuff all of that data is
stored inside of a database that's
because the application itself does not
change the code used to create this
application stays the same you can run
this application over and over and over
again and the only thing that changes is
the data so there's a separation between
the application and
data that powers that application so
hopefully that gives you a pretty good
summary of what a database is now as we
go on obviously we're going to get a
little bit more specific but this is
just a good overview you can think of a
database as something that stores a ton
of information then we can analyze that
data and we can use that database to
power an application or to just make our
lives a lot easier with storing
information so we covered a DB inside of
this acronym relational database
management system but what does the arm
that means relational what does that
mean well a relation is basically a
fancy word that means table quite fancy
so a table was drawn as a square and
then we have columns listed across this
way and will often give column headers
so for example we could say first name
last name phone email then an individual
row will fill out that information so
one person will put in his first name
his last name his phone number and his
email and you can continue to store more
and more and more people inside of this
table so it's kind of like an Excel
spreadsheet but there are a lot of
differences between a database and Excel
so now we need to discuss why would you
want to use a database over something
like an Excel spreadsheet or just a text
document and so forth
so there's many different ways we can
store data for example there's Excel
there's something known as comma
separated value and that's just a values
comma values comma values comma there's
text files and then there's things like
databases now each one of these has an
application you don't always have to use
a database for everything but there are
some specific situations when you want
to use a database one of the first
reasons if you're comparing databases to
like excel for example is that
spreadsheets are usually all-or-nothing
and what that means is if you have
multiple columns inside of this table
inside of an excel sheet you can't say
oh we're going to let this column be
viewed and this one but I want this one
to be
private and this one to be private
that's not something you can easily do
with an Excel spreadsheet or any kind of
spreadsheet but with a database you can
select just certain columns from a table
and then these ones can be private along
with that sequel server supports roles
so a role is essentially a title you
give a group of people that says what
they are allowed and not allowed to do
so you know you can have administrator
and then some other roles in there and
that's going to allow them to do certain
things with this database that's
contrary to Excel where you would have
to make different files and edit the
file permissions it's a whole lot easier
with databases because you can just say
oh anyone with this rule or this person
can do this but anyone else is not
allowed to do this it's a lot more
intuitive it's cool word intuitive so
back to this table if we're in an excel
sheet and you just want this column to
be presented that's not something you
can easily do but with sequel server
that's a piece of cake all you have to
do is say something like select and then
say let me let's say this is the phone
number for example then you could say
phone number and then say from and then
say whatever the table name is so we
could say users and then the only thing
that's going to be returned is this
column so these ones are not even going
to be shown along with all this
databases are more secure they're easy
to backup they're easier to recover and
overall it's just a better way to
protect your data if you're just working
at a small little company and you need
to store a little bit of information an
excel sheet might be fine but if you're
talking about enterprise applications
there's no way you will ever use a
spreadsheet for that kind of stuff
nearly any time you're working with an
application that needs to work with data
you're going to want to work with a
database and finally the last reason I
could conjure up is that you can store a
lot of information inside of a database
we're talking terabytes petabytes a lot
of information you can have a table with
millions of rows and still have a
functioning database where if you try to
store that much information in a
spreadsheet or a text file
or a comma-separated value file you're
gonna have really really bad performance
and probably mess everything up that's
one of the biggest reasons people use
databases is they're designed to store a
lot of information now there's so many
different types of database management
systems out there why would you want to
pick sequel server well there's a couple
of reasons one is that sequel server is
owned by Microsoft now I know some of
you people absolutely love Microsoft and
some of you hate Microsoft but
regardless if you're working with for
example the dotnet framework which that
is basically the infrastructure you
build apps on when you're working on the
Microsoft platform it's very easy to
integrate with sequel server you can use
other database management systems when
you're working on the.net framework and
you can also use sequel server for other
applications for example Java
applications but in general when you
work with a company that works with
the.net framework they will use a sequel
server back-end that's just so
everything is owned and managed by the
same company Microsoft now there are
some competitors to Microsoft for
example there's MySQL there's Oracle
database and there's a few other
relational database management systems
out there now where does sequel server
stand in competition to these two well I
would say it's somewhere right in the
middle if you ask me or on the other
hand is usually considered to be like
super up there the enterprise level and
MySQL is kind of considered to be user
level now I might be generalizing a
little bit too much because in reality
you could use probably any three of
these for any application so if you're
working with an app that is small but
might get large and it still needs to
manage a lot of data efficiently sequel
server might be the best choice for you
but even if not I have videos over both
of these topics so my recommendation is
just learn them all and then you're
going to know the differences between
them and you're going to know which ones
are right in which situations well
that's about all I got to say about
sequel server in this video hopefully
that gave you a really rough overview of
what sequel server is
and I know this had a lot of information
in it if it's a little overwhelming or
if you're just completely new to this
topic what I would recommend is just to
keep watching this series as we're going
to be breaking down more and more
information about sequel server and
learning some of the SQL commands and at
that point you're going to start
grasping things and all of this
information is just going to make sense

will see you all in the next video where
we will be downloading a sequel server
