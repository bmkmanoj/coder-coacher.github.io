in this video I will be speaking about
mathematical operations yay alright so
we have plus minus division
multiplication division modulus modulus
so let's just go over these six plus six
equals twelve six minus four equals 23
it's hard 9/3 equals three so these are
the basic math operations nine this is a
asterisk or as it's properly called
capitulate not really it's called
modulus motor oh not modulus yeah it's
called nasterie nine times 3 9 18 27 so
here are the basic math these 48 years
are the basic math operations now
instead of using these signs you can use
it div for division so rather than
saying this i could say nine div three
and we'll return the same result so that
gets rid of these five right here stupid
board and then we're left with this
thingy majigger so what this is this is
a modulus believe its goal and this will
tell you the remainder of something for
example if we have 10 and we put a %
which looks like this and then a three
the result is actually going to be one
the reason for this is if we take three
see how many times it fits within 10 we
could fit three of them within it so 3 6
9 out of 10 that we're left with 1 over
instead of using the percent sign we can
also say mod which does the same thing
mod just like that so for a different
example let's say
16 mod 5 if we do let's add these up
five that's one plus another five that's
two plus another five that's three or 15
so 15 out of 16 the result is still
going to be one you see if this is 17
the result would be too because that's
how many are left over after fitting
seeing how many in fives can fit within
17 the answer is three so if instead we
use 21 now let's make it 23 23 let's try
this now we have 5 10 15 20 and then we
can't fit another five within or be 25
so we have 20 with 3 left over so that
is why the result would be dirty now I'm
going to be speaking of priority so for
example if we had 5 times 5 plus 3 times
5 the way this is going to do this is it
will do the multiplication first so the
process is parentheses then
multiplication and division and then
finally addition and subtraction so
there's no parentheses so we can do the
multiplication 5 times 5 25 3 times 5 15
25 plus 15 is 40 so the result before is
it equals 40 so yeah you can rely on
that but what I would recommend is just
just use parentheses to make things
clear so if you need let's say sixty
times three you would do this and put
that within parentheses and if you go
out of focus one more time I'm going to
kill you not not you the camera but yeah
you're focused too so 60 x 3 plus 30
I'm six times three like this so what
this will do is you can follow it easy
first we do 6 times 3 which is 18 x 30
which is like a huge number then plus
whatever this is 180 so that's then we'd
get the final result so that is though
what I would recommend is just use
parentheses to make things really clear
and you don't have to worry about other
people being like the what I don't know
and just makes so much more sense so yes
that is all for this video in the next
video I will be going over mathematical
functions and it's going to be awesome
so subscribe and I'll see you there
