video maker - and we are going to
continue our discussion on relationships
we're going to be discussing one-to-many
relationships yeah we briefly discussed
one-to-many relationships in your last
MySQL video and really the concept is
not that hard all it is is when there is
a foreign key that references another
column to learn about one-to-many
relationships
let's go through a simple example let's
say we have a bidding website like where
you can post stuff on there and people
can bid on it to buy it now the business
rules of this application are that a
user can create an account and they can
create as many listings as they want but
one listing is owned by only one user so
you get this kind of setup this is how
you would draw a one-to-many
relationship if you had to draw how
everything was connected that's because
one user can have multiple listings but
a specific listing is not allowed to be
owned by multiple users so this
situation it's okay
but this is not okay because now this
listing is owned by this user and this
user that's not okay so we're just going
to erase that when you have this kind of
setup the thing that is being referenced
multiple times is going to be put in its
own table so you would literally just
create a listing stable pretty simple
this listings table is going to have a
foreign key column that references the
user so let's draw this out with some
actual data that way it's a little bit
more concrete here we have the users
table we'll keep it simple we'll just
have ID first name and last name here we
have a user's table and I've
conveniently pre inserted some data for
us to use so we have three people Caleb
Amy and George and these are the users
that are going to create listings on our
bidding website so this will become our
listings table and the columns will be
the ID and then a reference to the user
ID and then we can
say title for example we wanted to get
really in-depth with our bidding website
we could have a description and quality
and all that good stuff but this is
plenty for now so let's put some data in
here will give the first one an ID of
one and then we'll give it a title of
pizza rolls and now we just need to give
it a user ID now the thing with database
design is that we try to keep everything
atomic if you haven't you heard of that
word it essentially means the smallest
indivisible piece that still makes sense
so a user ID we only want one we don't
want to have to user IDs and we don't
want to have a half a user ID and we
only want to store user IDs in this
column we don't want to store user IDs
and the users name or anything like that
everything has to be atomic the smallest
piece that makes sense so in this
situation the column is atomic that's
because we're only storing one thing in
this column the user ID but now the rows
have to be atomic too they only sort one
value for each call so we already have
one value for the ID we have one value
for the title and we have one value for
the user ID and we'll make that nine
how's our choice whoo now if we wanted
to have a one-to-one relationship all
you would do is make this user ID column
unique that would force every single
road to be unique so a user could only
have one listing but we don't want to do
that we want it so that a user can have
multiple listings so we don't make this
unique now we can have another item by
the same person and we can say this is
give me a weird item very slinkys I
don't know how to spell slinkys now you
can see we have two rows that point to
one user but we don't have any rows that
point to two users in fact it's not even
possible with this set up if we're
following our atomic rules only one user
ID can be given for a single item so
this is how you properly design a
one-to-many relationship it
very similar to storing a one-to-one
relationship across multiple tables the
only difference is you do not use the
unique keyword we can also have other
data in here for example we could have
another item by the ID of 8 and it could
be give me an item Marie
dog treats YUM and that would reference
one individual user so yeah guys that's
how you design one-to-many relationships
hopefully that was nice crispy and
crispy crispy I don't know what I was
trying to say I probably like
crystal-clear maybe yeah hopefully that
was nice and crispy for you guys I will
see you in the next video and as always
if you've enjoyed this please click

thank you so much I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
