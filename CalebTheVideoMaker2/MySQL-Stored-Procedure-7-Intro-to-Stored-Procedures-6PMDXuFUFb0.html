going to talk about stored routines
there are two classifications of stored
routines their stored procedures and
stored functions we're going to be
discussing both of these in this series
but we're going to start with stored
procedures they have a different purpose
but the way they work is very similar so
once you get stored routines learning
stored functions is really not that big
of an issue eventually we're going to do
a video comparing the differences
between the two so you have a clear
distinction of when you need to use a
stored procedure and when you should use
a stored function instead what is a
stored procedure a stored procedure is
just the section of code that we can
call we put all of this code in here and
then later we can run the call command
and we don't have to put all of that
code in line and we talked about all
these things in the first video and I
think a little bit with variables in the
second and third video but essentially
we want to avoid putting things in line
as much as it's necessary so if we can
take a lot of code and put it in its own
stored procedure we can then call all
these different stored procedures as
needed so if we need to do one thing
with our database we could call this one
or we could call this one or we could
call this one and sometimes these take
what's known as arguments and parameters
and what that is is basically passing
data into these stored procedures so we
could pass in like a number that's
needed and it's going to do something
with that number starting off though you
can make stored procedures without
parameters for those of you with more
programming experience you can think of
stored procedures as creating an API to
your database and if you have no idea
what I'm talking about don't worry about
it we're gonna discuss it in a future
video
but just keep that in the back of your
mind if you guys know what an API is
there's a couple of different ways you
can work with the database as you get
more experience with MySQL you begin to
do more things when it comes to
interacting with the database just
starting out you
usually just open a client type in some
basic select commands and get results
but after doing it over and over again
you're not using your time optimally as
you get more experienced you start to
think about ways you can save time one
way is saving SQL scripts an SQL script
is just a file that you can run and it's
going to give back your result so we
could make an in-depth select statement
and then save it as an SQL script and
any single time we need to run this
command again all we got to do is find
that file and run it and we get the
results that we need this is useful but
it's not optimal in all situations
because now we have a bunch of SQL
scripts we have to organize them put
them on our file server and then open
them and they don't take parameters that
means we can't just pass state it into
them we might have to open the script
editing and then run it to match that
certain situation that we need this is
different than a stored procedure
because with a stored procedure you can
just find it pass in data as an argument
and you get the result you need for that
situation so I would vote that stored
procedures are better than SQL scripts
I need saying that you should never use
SQL scripts but it's always better to
lean on stored procedures that's because
they are actually connected with your
database so let's say this box here is
your database and you can have all kinds
of tables in your database and all kinds
of goodies like that well one thing you
can put in here are stored procedures
SQL scripts are a separate file with
stored procedures when you open your
database in your database management
system you can find all of your stored
procedures and call those from your code
and that's just really super useful SQL
scripts are great for some situations
specifically when you're setting up a
database you can just save the way you
set it up and reference that later but
they're not always the best in every
single situation you can also think of
stored procedures as extending the MySQL
language that's because once you have
your stored procedures made you can call
those say the procedure that you
to run and it will do something so you
can basically make these SQL commands
that do in-depth things they couldn't do
by default with just MySQL you're using
MySQL to do this but you end up with
commands that are much more useful to
your database so in your SQL when you
actually want to create your stored
procedure you are going to have to worry
about something called a delimiter a
delimiter is a fancy name for the
character you use to tell MySQL that a
statement is over so right now by
default it's a semicolon and that's kind
of like the standard when it comes to
programming there are tons of
programming languages that end all of
their commands are their statements with
a semicolon we are going to have to
change the default delimiter when it
comes to stored procedures we can do
that with the delimiter command and then
put it for example slash slash and now
when we go through here and make a bunch
of commands MySQL sees this as being
part of your stored procedure it's kind
of weird
it kind of makes you think they probably
could have made a way where you don't
need to do that but that's just how it
is you're gonna have to remember to put
delimiter and then whatever you want a
lot of people also use dollar signs but
it doesn't really matter and then when
you're done you can put the end keywords
whatever your delimiter is and then say
delimiter again and then follow with the
semicolon that that'll tell it to go
back to the normal standard semicolon to
be the delimiter that's a long going to
discuss in this video that'll give you a
rough overview of everything you need to
know to begin working with stored
procedures in the upcoming videos we'll
discuss the API thing I was talking
about and also show the code for
creating a stored procedure and then
eventually we'll be getting on the
computer typing up some commands and
showing the results see you guys then be
sure to subscribe and I'm hoping you're
enjoying the series if you have any
suggestions leave a comment below and
we'll see what we can do thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
