from Caleb the video maker to this video
we are going to be discussing first
normal form of database normalization if
you're completely new to normalization
be sure to check out the previous video
because that's where I give the
foundation now to put first normal form
into very basic simple English all we
have to do is put our data in tables and
don't design the tables like a noob so
we want to follow the rule of 1 also
known as a de Missa tee when you start
thinking about what kind of data do we
want to store inside of a database you
start to separate things into entities
and attributes even if you don't do this
on paper I know you do it in your mind
you just might not think about it and
these are things we store data about
here are a bunch of examples of entities
we could have and attributes are
anything we want to store about them so
for example on the orders we could say
who bought it what they bought where
they bought it when do they buy it
why isn't really relevant in this
situation or how but yeah how could be
like credit card cash all that stuff so
that is kind of how you separate data
entities go into tables each one of
these is going to be their own table
attributes become columns so for a
specific order inside of that table
we're going to have all of the columns I
mentioned who bought it what they bought
that might need to be separated a little
bit but who bought it what they bought
where they bought it if there's a store
location the date and time of when they
bought it all of that information
becomes a column but it's important that
each attribute is one column and one
column describes only one attribute this
here is essentially how we describe
atomicity every column is indivisible so
that's what atomicity is I mean imagine
like atoms you know those things they
try to teach you about and science
classes at one point we thought we
couldn't split them so we come up with
the great idea of saying this is all
atomic so that is how that term came to
be so let's kind of go into
an orders table and kind of expand it
and look at some data that might be
inside of that table inside of the
orders table we can have an order ID and
this column is super important when it
comes to first normal form just like how
one thing is described by one column
well each row needs to point to one
individual instance or one individual
order so each row inside of this table
is going to be an example of an order
one instance of an order the way we
distinguish orders is using an ID or
some kind of primary key so for first
normal form we need to make sure things
are atomic and everything has a primary
key that means every table needs to have
a primary key column in this situation
we're using what's known as a surrogate
key and that's just an ID and has no
real world meaning it's just for the
databases sake we might also have a
customer now this is a column that
stores one thing so we would have one
customer so let's say we have a website
where you can buy stuff someone places
an order it might be order of a thousand
and twelve with the customer ID of 782
all we are doing is storing one customer
if we look at the value for an
individual row we are storing one
customer they seem kind of like the same
thing but for the column we could have
named it customer comma email address
and that just seems so not normal like
when you try to design tables I
personally don't find it intuitive to
break first normal form
it's intuitive to follow first normal
form that's why I said don't design
tables like ANU if you have a column
don't try to store a customer ID and an
email because that's two separate things
obviously each one's going to need to be
put into their own column additionally
we don't have customers as the column
title customers is plural and that would
imply that you could put multiple
customer IDs in one row such as 700
and in three being somebody else you
don't want to do that so we want to make
sure the column header soars one thing
customer and it only stores one of them
additionally an individual row talks
about one thing in this case one
specific order so if we needed to add
another order we would have to add
another row and if for some reason we
had to have two customers for one order
we would add another row now in this
situation you can see there's a problem
that's because we have a repeating
primary key which is not okay
so in this situation you have to break
things off into a new table we'll worry
about that in just a moment that's
because I'm just trying to show you guys
what it means to follow the rule of one
everything describes one thing a table
is only talking about orders every row
talks about one individual order and
every column header talks about one
attribute for that order and every value
for that column stores one individual
value for that attribute it's a lot of
stuff but essentially all you got to
think of is do everything singularly you
never want to store a set inside of one
of these a set would be like a group of
things so if you're storing a comma
something else or a semicolon something
else
you're probably breaking first normal
form now this is just kind of like a
rough example let's go over a more
specific example that's going to require
a little bit more explanation and some
of my other videos I started to talk
about this database we're going to work
on and this database is going to be a
database for an animal dating website so
your little animals can go on to this
website and find their love these
actually exist by the way just so you
know so in our situation an animal goes
on this website and creates an account
so that would be stored inside of a
user's table essentially we'll call it
animals so it's a little bit more clear
that this is for an animal dating site
we'll add a couple of different columns
in here so you can see what data would
look like so here's our table we'll have
the animals name the species of that
animal the color of the animal and the
type of species the animal is interested
in let's add some data
Dalli the bunny colors brown interested
in let's go with bunnies just to keep
this nice and simple
now they call him I'm going to be
focusing on in this example is this one
right here so if we wanted to follow
first normal form we need to make sure
that the column header is only storing
one thing interested in which in this
case it is so we're following that if we
weren't we could have it interested in
comma not interested in this and in that
situation we'd be storing two different
types of attributes in one column and
now be a no no you don't want to do that
we're already good with that we're not
trying to store two things in here at
once that being said we also don't want
to design this to expect a set of
species that this animal is interested
in so interested in Bunny semicolon
gerbil in this situation we are breaking
the rule of one because we're storing
two values in an individual field which
is not okay so how do you notice this
early well just be aware if you are
doing something like interests plural
you might be designing your database in
the wrong way because you're setting it
up to expect a set meaning multiple
values interests is plural so you would
expect multiple values for it so how do
we fix this well to start off let's just
add a row so Sally is interested in
bunnies and gerbils so let's just add a
row for another sound and then we can
get rid of this little one
so this fixes our problem of having two
values for a column put that back to
interested in but now we have the
problem that two rows describe the same
bunny gosh let's think it drawing this
here is also very bad and you don't want
to do this in database design that's
because in this situation it doesn't
follow the rule of one now in some
tables it's okay to have repeating data
for example if we have a comments table
a user could post 400 comments that user
is going to be inside at a table
numerous
times but the table itself is describing
comments so each row would want to
describe an individual comment and we
wouldn't want to have two rows
describing the same comment so this
always points back to what the table is
about so in this situation we have two
rows describing one animal that's not
okay to fix this problem now we actually
need another table so I'm gonna draw
some room I'm gonna draw some room that
doesn't make sense
we will name this table interests now
it's okay to make a plural in this
situation because we're going to be
storing multiple rows so there's going
to be multiple interests but always
remember each row is only one interest
now we're going to have to be able to
refer to a specific animal and in this
situation there's not a really good way
to do it unless we made the name unique
or something but that's that's not the
best way to do it that means we need to
introduce a primary key so I'm gonna
race this over here and add a primary
key column don't put an X there because
we know that's not allowed the primary
key is the way we force that every row
talk about only one entity that's
because we can't put another one in here
because it have a different ID for
example if I said two it would be a
different animal so let's put that back
to an X to always make a primary key in
your tables now inside of this interest
table we can reference that specific
animal so first we could say the animal
ID then the other column could be this
one here now the animal ID would be one
the interest would be bunny then we
could repeat that animal ID one and it's
okay to repeated here that's because
this animal ID is not talking about the
interests it's talking about the animal
these here are two separate interests
they just both happen to be from the
same animal so that part's kind of
confusing but just think we can't have
repeating interests because that's what
the table is about these interests are
going to be distinct because each one is
going to have a different animal so in
this one would be gerbil and you can see
that the combination
is unique that's because these as a
group
do not repeat one bunny and one gerbil
are different so we're not breaking the
rule of one here now back in our
original table we're not even going to
need this column and we don't even need
to have any way to reference this table
that's because we're essentially
designing a one-to-many relationship and
if you go back to our one in many video
you'll know that this is the parent
table and this is the child table and
when we have that situation the child is
going to have a foreign key pointing to
the ID and the parent table is not going
to need to know about the child now what
about this row obviously we're not even
going to need that row so we can just
get rid of it
so if we had to clean this up which I
guess I will get rid of this call and
get rid of this row and the last thing
when you're working on first normal form
make sure each column is actually about
whatever you're trying to describe these
all depend on the primary key but you
wouldn't want something in here like
whether ok the weather has nothing to do
with the animal so in this situation
this is not dependent on the key and we
always want every single column to
depend upon the key now all of that was
a lot of information so don't get
overwhelmed all you have to remember is
to follow the rule of one when you're
designing a table just do it intuitively
make things as singular as possible make
each row describe an individual entity
and in the end you'll be good don't
worry about it because once you get to
second normal form and third normal form
that's going to take your crappy
database and slaughter it and then
you're gonna have something a little bit
better
