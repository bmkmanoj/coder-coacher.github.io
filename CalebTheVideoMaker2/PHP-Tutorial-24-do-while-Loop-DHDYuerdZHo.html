world of PHP tutorial number 23
it's really awesome now let's get
started so in the last video we talked
about the wiles loop well in this video
I wanted to talk about new type of loop
called a do-while loop very similar so
if you understood the while loop this
will be super easy let's let's do a
quick review of the while loop basically
we could do something like set a
variable let's make it variable I is
equal to 0 right and then we could say
while variable I is greater than 0 do we
say echo yo oh no no let's make it
something better subscribe alright and
then we could close the while loop makes
sense so basically it's going to say oh
when while when um I is greater than 0
we're going to echo subscribe
what as you can see I is not greater
than 0 so it's never going to be ran
although if this was like - well then
what this while loop is going to run
over and over and over and over again so
let's go back to 0 and I'm going to
explain the difference between a
do-while loop and a while loop well with
this while loop it's going to test
something and if it's true it's going to
do something and then it's going to test
something and then it's going to do
something and then it's going to test
something and then it's going to do
something
well a do-while loop flips that and they
do something and then they test
something they do something
and then they test something so a
do-while loop looks like this you say do
and then within these curly braces so we
could say echo yo and we also we could
define a variable so variable I is equal
to 0 now this is what we're going to do
do echo yo wael and then within
parentheses we should say while variable
I is greater than 0 alright so how is
this different at all all right well the
main thing is that the do is the what
we're doing the while is what we're
testing and a while loop we test it and
then we do it in a do loop we're going
to do it and then we're going to test it
so if this was ran it's going to echo yo
that's the very first thing that's going
to do and then it's going to test if I
is greater than 0 and it's not so
therefore it's going to end and keep
going within the program but if it is
it's going to go back up the do it's
going to do what we told it to do and
then it's going to test it again so the
main thing is that with a do-while loop
it will always be executed at least once
because if we're running through this it
says do this is what it's going to do
before even tests anything it's going to
it's going to echo yo and if if I is
greater than 0 it's going to echo yo
again does that make sense hopefully so
I don't even know why I asked you
questions like you're going to respond
or something that's weird
it's like Dora the Explorer or something
gosh oh you think it's weird to me too
oh yeah those are the main differences
so just to summarize that I'm gonna make
a little sharp heater we have a while
loop and then we have a do loop while
loop well test it and then it will run
it a do-while loop will run it and then
it will test it this outcome means that
a do-while loop always runs at least
once and the reason for that is let's
say it turns out false but that's not
going to be tested until we run it so
going through a program it's gonna go oh
well they want us to run this program or
run what we do within the loop and then
test it the testing comes after we do it
so I know if a p2 that like 80 times
well basically when you when you want
something to always be executed at least
once
use a do-while if you only want to be
executed if the conditions or the test
is successful basically if it's true
then we'll move on to the run and then
after that we'll go back to the test if
it's true then we'll go to the run back
to the test true then to the run back to
the test
oh it's false well then we're going to
skip the run and just go on with the
program so that's the basis of a
do-while loop and a while loop hopefully
that clears things up with both types of
loops and thank you for watching I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
