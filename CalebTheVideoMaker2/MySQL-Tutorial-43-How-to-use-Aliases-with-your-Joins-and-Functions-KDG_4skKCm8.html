will be teaching you how to use an alias
it's very simple trust me so I am in my
customers table not that it matters
because we're going to run some SQL so
we're going to select first name wrong
customers click go it brings back the
first name Caleb Chuck
James Helen Terry right now if we go
back to this and edit it
what is FN what if you don't know what
that stands for what we can do is use an
alias select FN as first name and click
go now it will display a first name so
that's really simple that's all there
really is to it now for concat or other
functions let me show you right here
here is how you do concat concat in
parenthesis I'm going to do last name
comma first name and when you when I go
you'll see that there is no spaces or
anything between the two so Caleb curry
I'm in curry Caleb and so on so to fix
this we can edit it and then add a new
in parenthesis at coma and then another
comma to go on to the next one so that's
kind of confusing just remember three
three commas and two parenthesis go now
we can see there is oh I forgot space
but you can see now there's kind of some
structure to put a space here between
the quotes then it will bring back space
so now another I want to show you
something else real quick we can
actually say as and say name this is an
alias for the name name and I'll display
rather than saying concat as it did
before I just screwed up
and I want to show you another function
concat WS this is concat with separator
so if we have a huge list of things we
want to concat we can actually use this
to make things easier I don't really
have a good list to use but I'm just
gonna pretend so let's say we want to
concat the first name last name and the
phone number so we can use the separator
right there that's what the WS stands
for with separator and then put a comma
first name comma last name phone I mean
comma phone and go now with separators
it will now separate each one with this
separator rather than having to write
this comma more than once that is how it
will work now that I showed you that I
want to go on to joins because that was
the whole point of this video and it's
already been like three minutes so
select from and then the type of join
we're going to use an inner join now to
fill this out we're going to select the
first name last name and the review from
customers inner join reviews and then
what is equal we had customers dot
customer ID comma I mean it equal to
reviews dot customer ID this is the
Equality here if we click go we can see
now it displays the first name the last
name and the review from the person
which is cool but I don't like it I want
these to say first name and last name
rather than F N and L n so we can just
put as first name last name as last name
simple as that then click go now it
displays it in a more readable format
sweet now when you're using aliases with
joins it can actually make things a lot
more simpler because if you remember I
said a few tutorials ago if two tables
have the same
name such as if reviews had a first name
we would have to use adult syntax so
let's just go with that for now
customers start first name and we also
have my bad we want to put this with :
name so customers
FN as first name and then we had
customers don't last name as last
thought Ln as last name then we had
reviews dot review and if we click go
you can see it's the same thing it
didn't change anything this is just
specifying which table each column will
go to now when you're performing and
join this can get kind of tiring writing
customers customers a thousand times
especially when you get to big joins
right so what we can do is just give an
alias to the table name so here is where
we define the table names customers and
reviews and we can just say as for
example see and reviews as a I mean are
yeah so now the the table name is
shortcutted see right so if we click go
are actually going to get an error and
this is because we have all these
written out names when they should be
shortcuts so if we take these and
originally put C dot F N and C dot Ln
this would give the result we want so
now we have the shorthand configuration
we also need to change the relation down
here because we have to use the shortcut
C and then R now we just shortened to
the query a whole lot I know it seemed
like a lot of work but that's because we
wrote the original one first if you went
in and typed it out like this you would
save a lot more time and energy and we
don't want to waste energy I mean we
don't want to use energy so we got to
save it yeah click go and now you can
see it works just fine so basically the
sea and the R represent the table names
you can name these whatever you want so
you could say car dot first name and
or instead of or you could use rainbow
or you get the point it doesn't really
matter it's a made-up name that is used
for your advantage so that is how you
use aliases with joins and it's very
simple whenever you need to rename
something you can just put as and then
the name so hopefully I haven't been
explaining this too long because it's
been like seven minutes as of right now
unless there's a mistake and then I have
to edit it out but yeah thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
