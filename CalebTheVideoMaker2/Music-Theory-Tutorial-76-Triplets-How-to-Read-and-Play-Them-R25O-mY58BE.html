over triplets did he seriously just bark
again I think you just did
triplets no I like children like music
notes so what a triplet does is it
offsets the beat a little bit to fit
three four every time there's two so for
example if I have eight notes and I have
two of them that is two eighth notes if
I created a triplet I'd be fitting three
notes in the same amount of space as a
triplet I mean as eighth notes so that
will offset the beat so for example the
original maybe well okay these would be
three notes of beat so triplet so
basically we're replacing two notes with
three so if we had sixteenth notes we
would get what's called sextuplet now
you may see sextuplets looking like this
with six notes six this is an example of
putting six notes sorry it should be
another bar here and one beat so this is
the same as replacing oh yeah four
sixteenth notes with six basically for
every two of these we put three so
instead of two we put one two three one
two three this is another way how you
may see sextuplets you may see them
connected like this now that's just
another example of a quicker triplet so
let me start from quarter notes if we
have four quarter notes in a beef
measure sorry one two three four this
would be counted one two three four now
if I replace two of these with what's
called a quarter note triplet we get
here's one quarter note triplet we
signify that by putting a bar over it
and a little three you may see it like
this do that that's one quarter note
triplet now if we do it the other one
I'm using different color here replace
these two notes with three we get
another quarter note triplet so how does
this count well normally if we counted
quarter notes to be like this one two
three now since there's three rather
than two it's a little bit quicker so
it's which takes a while to get used to
but that's the basis of quarter note
triplets now if we move to eighth notes
so we have two eighth notes and then we
have two more in notes to make a whole
measure we have four eight in total four
beats now if we made triplets out of
these we just put three for every two
represent a little three above them
because if you don't put the three
people are going to think it's three
eighth notes not a triplet and the
difference is three eighth notes would
be played one and two whereas a triplet
takes up two beats see fit three in one
and this is basically a little faster
so here is our triplets so now as we
know this would take up one beat this
will take up two beats this would take
up three and now take up basically all
four beats of a measure now basically
each one of these is going to take up
one beat so we're finding three notes
for every beat or if you need to count
your triplets you can count one yeah let
me start this match room here is quarter
note division so one two three four one
two four five place to that strip looks
triple the trip public so here you can
still hear what's called the Down Beat
which is the one two three make sense
get better then we also have oh I
figured out by the way in the last video
the fives when you place five minutes
shush shush
when you place five notes like this a
place of five over it this is called a
quintuplet I do not know what it was
called but I figured it out basically
five notes in one beat but we're on
triplets so we'll ignore that for now
we're basically giving this one the
downbeat this one to this one this one
probably not keeping a consistent tempo
here with us on quarter notes
sorry I kind of sped up I'm usually not
that bad just saying probably him now if
we go to the next step
and we have sixteenth notes one two
three oh sorry
we'll go back to first how many of these
fitnah be floor of them do on e and two
E and three E and four T now if we were
to replace these with triplets so these
two would become one two three makes
sense now these two would become one two
three we can connect these that's
typically how you see them when you see
sixteenth notes they'll typically be in
groups of four but not always done we
matter so this is now the equivalent of
this up here it's just six notes rather
than four we've placed three for every
two now we can erase this
and we're gonna replace it with what's
down here and actually we'll keep them
both
alright cool now let's do the same thing
for this one I'm gonna place it over
here so now that is the equivalent of
this four so we have to replace it with
three to replace it with three or four
replaced with six same thing for this
one I'm just gonna add some notes here
cool
same thing for this one now we have four
counts of 16th note triplets also known
as sextuplets so how is this counted
well we can count it in sixteenth notes
which is a lot more difficult so instead
of counting one E and a two E and we can
count six of them which I'm not I'm
gonna try so they're not a normal way to
count this is 6 per B sextuplets sixth
tablet and one beat so 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3
4 5 6 1 2 2 4 5 6 it's how you would
count this for 6 notes every beat so
that is the basis of triplets and 6th
uplet's now there's oh and by the way
when you're doing that you need to
signify it by putting a little 6 above
the whole group so there's two ways to
draw it you can drill three like this
and connect them like this and then put
3 3 or you can just connect them all and
place a 6 that will be a 6 template now
that is what it looks like
and also I want to say something if you
break this up if you noticed how to
sixteenth notes is equal to one eighth
note
well actually three of these since this
is a sextuplet or 16th note triplets
three of these is equal to 1/8 note so
we can kind of like that once your
answer makes sense then 2 triplet 3
triplet but I just like counting at 6 I
think that's easier but the reason I
said this was if you're doing funky
rhythms and you need to figure out how
to read them or write them and you have
something that looks like this which
pretty common okay you have an eighth
note tied to two I mean a 16th note
triplets and then a quarter note would
be how you would count it versus you
give this the eighth note value one and
triplet one one you can also reverse it
so you can put the three at the
beginning and then it makes note so
here's the three the so one triplet and
make sense so it's all just counting on
the beat that's why time is extremely
important hopefully this is all making
good sense and this video is like way
longer than I thought it was so I think
I'm going to end it now and I'll see you
soon thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
