actually be talking about two types of
scales one's called the whole tone scale
basically this will just separate each
note by a whole tone which is also known
as two half steps or a whole step so
basically two half steps or one whole
step they're the same thing so this is a
pretty simple scale basically C to D D
to e e to F sharp F sharp to G sharp I
just click pretty simple i'll show you
on the keywords easier see run see a
whole step from CS d whole step from d
is actually II because we take two half
steps one two whole step from e f-sharp
that's because this is a half step
that's another half step from here we
can take whole step from here whole step
whole step so if we start here full step
whole step whole step whole step whole
step whole step it's pretty easy that's
why it's called whole tone scale because
it takes whole tones which is just
another word for saying one whole step
whole step at whole tone or the same
thing that's just the type of scale now
the other scale I want to talk about is
called the chromatic scale
it takes some half steps plus half step
plus half step plus half step plus half
step 12 them to get every single note on
a keyboard or any instrument really so
for here the chromatic scale would be
pretty sweet Oh No so that those are two
scales you should familiarize yourself
with they were the chromatic scale and
the whole tone scale so a while ago I
couldn't remember what this one was
called the chromatic scale here and I
knew there was a whole tone scale so I
wanted to find the halftone scale I
could not find it but i eventually
figured it out so I was around while
searching for the halftone scale that's
pretty stupid of me but yeah think of
well chroma this means color so just
think it's more colorful than most
scales because it takes covers over
everything if you've ever liked done
greenscape deep green screening that's
called chroma key because you're keying
out or getting rid of certain colors
such as green or blue so chroma means
color now if you remember when I said
let's say we're in the C scale and we
played an f-sharp this is out of the
scale that note is said to be chromatic
and if it's in scale it said to be
diatonic chromatic just think of it's a
little bit more colorful add some extra
flavoring or colors to it you see so
that's a good way to memorize that and
that's all for this video so the next
one I'll be talking about I have no clue
but it's going to be cool so I'll see
you then thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
