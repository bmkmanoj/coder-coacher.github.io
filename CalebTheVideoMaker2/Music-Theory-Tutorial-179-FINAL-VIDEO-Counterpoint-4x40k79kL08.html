ending abruptly last video whoa high
five oh are you excited because I sure
AM all right so I'm gonna finish the
topic I'm talking about which is the
harmony melody stuff to make it sound
better and we start on which is this
which is this harmony melody stuff to
make it sound better and better create
which is this harmony melody stuff and
how to make it sound better to create a
better song so yes this is the last
video but we have covered a lot of stuff
there's always more to cover but I
decided this is where I should end the
video and basically I'm going to a quick
review we want to avoid parallel fifth
movement parallel parallel perfect but
sometimes thirds and sixth are what
sound good and parallel movement so if a
note is a third or a sixth apartment and
you move them together it's usually not
going to be bad although you don't want
to do it like that ever I mean unless
you want to but if you were having
harmony parts doing all I mean sorry
that lets go melody doing the same thing
like this for example
and then big jumps well it's pretty much
useless because it swirl like the
audience is only going to hear it as
warm sound unless you need these two
instruments to complement each other and
making a specific sound you like then
you can use it but otherwise don't oh
I'm not giving you the commands you can
do it ever you want just saying although
it doesn't always sound the greatest so
if this is a perfect fifth it's going to
be almost exactly the same or if it's an
octave that's even worse so if this is C
1 C 3 and this is C 4 you're only going
to hear C so that's the idea of parallel
movement
another thing to do when creating
harmony and melody avoid big jumps
because that is hard to play especially
I'm talking vocals here it's very hard
for a vocalist to play large jumps like
let's say C to B that's a that's a
seventh that's a big jump so avoiding
big jumps is always a good thing
another thing is to do another thing
that's good to do is when you have
multiple parts such as A's to voice
melody it's often bad to have two notes
very close together like let's say this
person is playing c4 and then this
person is playing the B right after that
I mean right before that that that'd be
a b b3 that is a diminished second
because has one half-step and they're so
close together that it's going to cause
dissonance and not only that it's going
to be hard for the vocalist to keep the
the pattern going with they're so close
together you'll heal for hear
fluctuations and pitch try the sound
trying to connect together and create
one sound so it's often bad to have
dissonant notes in your harmony ability
so now we're going to be talking about
counterpoint all right so what is
counterpoint it's actually a multi voice
melody where all of the parts are
equally important so that I'm gonna
stress that equally important so we're
talking harmony melody we have this
awesome melody here and then this this
uh harmony here is just here to add the
extra flavor which creates like this
delicious cookie thing that you eat with
your ears which makes no sense
so this is this beautiful noise that
goes in your ears and you digest it but
if we have two equally important
melodies we could have two cookies and
then we can have the supporting harmony
here which pushes the song forward which
I don't even know like why I'm drawing
this cuz it makes no sense so now when
this guy digest his music here it's
going to sound more full so that didn't
make any sense at all so I'm going to
explain it differently just two parts
that are equally important to to the
listener
that's why parallel movement is bad
because if we have four parts and every
single part is equally important once
plan something once playing something
else you have to hear them both but then
we go parallel fifth movements between
two of them well these two are going to
click together and it's going to sound
like one so now if two of them sound
like one that means we only have a total
of three which eliminates one of those
fourth elements then once they go out of
the parallel fifth movement it's going
to come back and we're going to
fluctuate between four and three maybe
even two sometimes so you got to be
careful you want to keep that going with
four so that is the idea of counterpoint
and that's pretty much all I have to say
for this video so you made it pretty far
we went over a lot of stuff new to a lot
of this so hopefully I did well and
explaining things and tell me give me
some suggestions also if you guys are
interested in technology go check out
some of my other videos I got stuff over
my SQL database programming and I'm
coming out with a new series soon so
that'd be awesome if you guys could
check that out and that's all so please
subscribe as always follow me on Twitter
Facebook me and I will see you in the
next video in the next series bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
