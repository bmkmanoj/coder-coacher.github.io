16th Python tutorial in this video I
want to talk about the else statement so
the else statement is attached with the
if statement so you might call it the
if-else statement hopefully that makes
sense so basically what else is is it
basically returns a value if the if
statement comes back false so in the
previous example let's look here we set
age to 14 and then we do a test if the
age is less than 18 we want it to print
this and it did print this because age
14 is less than 18 that makes sense but
what if we wanted to say something if
age is over 18 at the same time so it
runs a test and then let's say age is 14
it says you're too young and if age is
19 it says you are welcome or you can
use this program or you can come to the
club or whatever it is well that's done
with the else statement so let me show
you that right now so we can just bring
this down here to retype and then we
press ENTER and then what we have to do
is to end this block because remember
this this print is all part of the if
statement we need to press backspace
okay now we press else we type else and
put a colon so how this is set up is we
have an if statement starting at block 1
ignore these three little lines that's
just saying the start of the program so
basically if and else are aligned up and
then this is a block within the if
statement which that needs to be
indented so Python knows that it's part
of the if statement the else is not the
else will not be ran if this runs true
so it's a part of a different block both
of these will only be ran if age is less
than 18 so that means we need to go back
a block put an else statement and press
ENTER and then within this block we say
print
welcome good good all right so now what
we do is we press enter and it'll run
the test first let's look at the value
of age the most recent definition of H
was 14 so it should still print these
two so let's try it and you can see it
prints both of those
now let's reassign a value to age let's
make it 2345 well it's an old man all
right now we take take this bring it
back down here to rerun it and we can
press ENTER and you can say welcome good
dear
that's because age is greater than 18 I
know this video is pretty simple but
that's all I really have to say for this
one so hopefully you'll stick around to
the next video where we will be
explaining more in depth how the if-else
statement works so thank you for
watching be sure to subscribe and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
