going to be creating our first stored
procedure if you want to get the exact
setup here you can go back to our last
on screen video and in the description
there will be a link that'll take you
right to this point now we're going to
be continuing our work on our uh we'll
just say this is a pet dating site
because that's not weird at all so the
very first thing I want to do is add a
new row into our table so I'm going to
add a comma there instead of a semicolon
and just enter some new data we'll give
an ID of three I'm going to introduce
you guys to a pretty cool function here
which is now that'll just give us the
current date so that'll work perfectly
in this situation and then for this I'm
just going to put null to say that this
horse is still alive and now the
semicolon is going to need to go here in
the last few videos I talked about the
delimiter keyword where you say
delimiter and then you can say slash
slash for example and what that'll do is
change the delimiter so anything within
the stored procedure gets sent to the
server rather than being interpreted
well it works a little bit differently
for SQL fiddle in SQL fiddle there's
this little box down here which by
default it's on semicolon but I changed
it and you're going to want to change it
to something else
and I am pretty sure the way this works
is that whenever it comes across a
stored procedure it'll automatically
just interpret it that way so we don't
need to say delimiter here all we need
to do is say create procedure and we'll
just say pets underscore female and what
this is going to do is get all female
pets and the reason I kind of named it
backwards rather than female pets is
because when you have a bunch of
procedures it's probably easier to see
them alphabetically by the object so we
know right from reading this that this
is working on pets the pets table
specifically so after this we just say
begin and then when we're done we can
say end and put our new delimiter so you
can see how this is a little bit
different than the MySQL client because
with the MySQL
we would have to go up here and say
delimiter slash slash and then down here
we would say delimiter semi-colon but
that's not going to work in SQL fiddle
and I think PHP myadmin as well so all
of our procedure code goes in here and
I'm just going to press tab so it's
clear where the code actually begins and
we're just going to select everything
from the pets table and we'll use a
where Clause to say sex equals F let's
build our schema and see if everything
works there we go now to call it all I
have to do is stay call that's
underscore female and the semicolon
actually is not needed when you only
have one statement over here so let's
run it and see what happens
snowflake and princess are returned
which is exactly what we wanted because
those are the only ones where they are
female so all you male pets out there if
you're looking for a hot lady this is
the procedure that you're going to want
let's create another procedure and in
this situation we're going to show how
we can use variables and execute
multiple statements within one procedure
so that's free capital this is going to
be pets female with birthdate and this
is more just to show you that you can
run multiple statements within one
procedure so what we're going to do is
we're going to create a variable and
we'll just name it
birthdate and we'll set that equal to
string of 2015 Oh 328 and then we're
going to say select everything from pets
where sex is female and earth is equal
to birth date then we can end that
procedure let's build it boom it works
no errors
so it seems to be working and you want
to look down here at the second result
table it returned back snowflake which
is in fact the row that we did want to
return because that is the one with the
birthdate that we specified and this
might show you just how useful
parameters could be in this situation we
are hard-coding the date in here
wouldn't it be cool if we can just over
here say 2015 oh three twenty-eight and
then it would return all of the females
with that birth date that would be a lot
more useful but we'll be talking about
parameters pretty soon but just for now
understand that this is not the best way
to structure our procedures and we'll
get into that more as we go on so thanks
guys I will clean up this code a little
bit and then I'll put the new URL in the
description for you guys to get so if
you're having any issues just go to that
URL and she'll be working fine thanks
guys and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
