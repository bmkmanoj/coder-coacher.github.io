- this is Caleb from Caleb the video
maker - and this is my second livestream
I did one just last night
and it was so thrilling I literally
couldn't sleep so I was like I gotta do
another one I cannot wait to do another
one so I've been planning what to talk
about I'm still getting into the hang of
this so please bear with me I'm trying
to figure things out but before we get
started I did want to mention my sponsor
which is IBM db2 which is a legit
world-class database that will literally
work for all of your software projects
so go check that out
link in the description they are the
ones that are helping me produce this
content so make sure we show them the
appreciation that they deserve thank you
okay let's get started so I got a lot of
things I wanted to talk about today but
the main thing I wanted to focus on is
computer science and what that means
what it is what it is not and all that
good stuff so we're going to be going
into what kind of job you get what kind
of things you should know and just touch
from an overview perspective on bunch a
bunch of different pieces of what it
means to be in computer science or to be
a computer scientist now I am by no
means an expert I'm just going to throw
that out upfront not an expert but I am
studying computer science that's what
I've been doing these videos over for
the last few years and I try to
integrate into my videos computer
science concepts rather than just
programming and we're going to get a
little bit into that distinction in what
that means so if you are watching this
video I would encourage you if you have
any questions at all go ahead leave them
in a comment I'm gonna be watching it
here and yeah so I got my live chat here
and I can see that people
are commenting I got one person so far
so leave your comments there and I will
either address them in this video if I
find it relevant and I know the answer
right on spot or I will consider that
for an upcoming stream and so forth okay
so let's get started
computer science well that is obviously
what I try to focus on in this channel
is being adequate to take a job in the
computer science field
oh and hey person who commented uh I
probably can't pronounce your name so
I'm not gonna try okay back on topic
computer science what does that mean how
to get a job in that and what kind of
job you're going to be getting and how
is that different than programming
well first off computer science is a
science so what that means is there's
some math involved so if you go into
school or like a bachelor's program or
maybe even a job in computer science you
should expect there to be some math if
you don't want to do math then you might
want to reconsider doing computer
science because it's a science and
science requires math so there are
alternatives if you are completely
against math but I think if you put your
mind to it you can actually grow to like
it so that's kind of my situation where
I haven't had math in a couple years
four or five years and then I jumped
into two college courses one on calculus
and one on discrete math and at that
point I was like yeah I don't really
like meth or but after you start to do
it you you pick up on the conventions
and it starts to make a little bit more
sense that being said I'm still a
horrible at math which is why I do
programming tutorials and not math
tutorials but there is still a
possibility that you can start working
with math
and grow to like it which is kind of
what's happening to me because I've
gotten through both of those classes and
now I'm in a linear algebra course and
it's like a love-hate relationship one
day I'm like and then the next day I
once I figure something out I'm like hey
this really isn't too bad
makes sense once I know how to do it and
it's the same way with programming so
the same feeling I get programming I
also get when I do math so don't turn
away from math too soon but that's not
the only thing with computer science
there's more to it than just math so if
you don't like math you can still do it
but there are some things you're going
to have to get through such as linear
algebra discrete math and calculus so
how does computer science differ from
programming well there is a lot of
overlap so it's really hard to say oh
that's that's programming not computer
science or oh that's that's computer
science but not programming it it just
doesn't work that way it's because
they're overlapped and parts of computer
sciences and programming and parts of
programming is in computer science so
what that means is you can be a
programmer and a computer scientists you
can't it's not like one or the other
they are they can be intertwined but I
would say it's it's easy to be a
programmer and a computer scientist it's
not very easy to be a computer scientist
but not a programmer if that makes any
sense at all so what I mean by that is
you can learn programming you can get a
job programming you can retire
programming but never really get into
computer science but it's a little
harder to start computer science get a
job in computer science and retire in
computer science without programming
like it just it just doesn't even sound
right to me so inside of a computer
science program there is
going to be programming what if you're
programming it doesn't necessarily mean
you're doing computer science but maybe
I'm just making too much of a
distinction it doesn't really matter
that's probably what it is
so when I think programming I think you
know learning a programming language
developing apps and not necessarily
caring about the underlying processes of
why things work or what's doing what
that's more programming it's a
profession I guess I don't know if
that's the right word or not that you
can do to make a living whereas computer
science is you know the study of
computing why do these things work the
way they do how can we make them faster
all that stuff so when you get into a
computer science program at school
there's some things you should look for
to say hey is this a good program or is
this big waste of money there is already
a lot of controversy whether going to
school for computer science is a good
idea at all and a lot of people will go
with different routes such as getting a
degree in software engineering or
something in IT with a focus on
programming or something like that I'm
going the computer science route because
that's what I enjoy and that's what I
find satisfaction in but some of the
things with computer science is stepping
away from the languages and the
implementations and learning the
paradigms the methodology this the
processes behind
the different languages and the
different way we do things that's why in
a good programming or that's why in a
good computer science program you're
going to have classes on algorithms and
things that aren't specifically tied to
a language so as you start moving away
from stuff such as algorithms and move
towards like classes like Java
your your stepping away from computer
science and going more into just applied
programming which is not a bad thing and
I am a firm believer that when you
graduate with a computer science degree
you should know how to program really
good so there should be a fine balance
but with inside of a computer science
program you're also going to get stuff
on operating systems machine language so
we're talking assembly languages how
those work and how those correlated to
binary and how programming languages get
turned into that which we'll talk a
little bit about in just a bit you'll
get someone computer engineering which
includes logic gates flip-flops small
circuits all that good stuff but also
you're going to learn some of the
software engineering concepts such as
software testing source control
debugging and all of that and this is
just a high overview each one of these
topics could be a video in itself so I
can't go in for an hour on each one of
these but if we were just to talk binary
just for example well I could talk about
binary for hours I mean I've made
basically series on binary so these are
just some of the main points of what you
would want to look for in a computer
science program if you are looking at a
computer science program and your class
titles are like oh Java HTML CSS
JavaScript or I don't know arm assembly
for example well those are applications
and the more applications you're taking
away from the fundamentals which will
convert into different languages so if
you have a class on programming
languages well that's going to take a
high overview look at the different
types of programming languages how they
work
converted to binary all that good stuff
and then you can go pick up a language
that you need when the time comes but if
you just take a class on Java for
example and all of your classes are
structured that way
you might find the situation where
you're almost trapped to this technology
stack which is just all the technologies
you've learned and you don't really
understand a lot of the reasons why or
what's going on behind the scenes and
that's okay for some people because if
they know how to make an application
they can go ahead and make an
application sell it make millions of
dollars and they're happy they're
satisfied that's all I want but I like
to pick things apart to the extent where
I'm like okay why does this work so
that's why I have gone the computer
science route so some of the other
things that are essential for a computer
scientists and a lot of these that I'm
going to mention go into the application
because if you just know a bunch of
theory you're going to be completely
worthless on the job market so these are
the things you need to start learning
and if your school does not teach them
or if you're trying to study this stuff
on your own you need to make sure you
hit all of these points so when you go
looking for a job you've covered all the
bases Basie's I don't know the word so
the first one is math I talked about
that for like ten minutes so that's
enough math for the day the next thing I
wanted to talk about was managed first
managed versus unmanaged code so you can
kind of classify most languages into one
of those two groups so managed code
would be an example would be c-sharp
Java and unmanaged would be C C++ and
when it's that when you say managed what
we're talking about is memory so when
you are coding in this language are you
required to deal with the memory and
allocating memory and deallocating the
memory
if you are then you are working with
unmanaged code because if code is
managed what that means is that all of
that memory stuff is going on behind the
scenes you don't have to worry about
that so one of the languages I'm most
familiar with is C sharp which is a
managed language very similar to Java if
you've worked with Java most schools
teach Java that is a great language
either one or both very good languages
but you should also have experience with
an unmanaged language so that is why I
started the C programming series so the
C programming series is just the basics
I haven't even gotten to really memory
management and all that stuff right yet
but learning a language like that allows
you to understand what's going on behind
the scenes with the managed language and
it actually helps you become a better
programmer for example in C programming
if you go outside the indexes of an
array you you're gonna break your
program c-sharp is a little bit more
forgiving because well you can do simple
things like array dot length or whatever
and you can you can manage to protect
yourself from those kind of situations
it's you can you can also protect
yourself in that in C programming you
just got to be a lot more careful and
then when you go back to a managed
language you actually keep those things
in mind and you're better to you're
better able to protect yourself from
software explosions which we don't want
ok so what else man sometimes my
illustrations like I'll listen back to a
video I made and I'm just like did I
really have to say the computer explodes
come on the next thing that you should
probably familiarize yourself with is
assembly so assembly is like the lowest
of the low - programming and ones and
zeros so assembly will basically have a
set of
bands that you can use to tell the
processor to do something so we have
simple commands like adding or
subtracting or multiplying moving from
memory to yeah moving data out of memory
moving data back into memory all those
little things and you're very limited on
what you can do but you're still able to
do everything that c-sharp could do it
just you have to go and even extra layer
of planning and thinking about how to
make this thing work because writing
like a while loop is complicated am i
saying you need to go learn assembly and
write some crazy application no I'm not
I'm not saying that at all I'm just
saying you should familiarize yourself
with assembly and how it works each one
of these commands correlates to a string
of binary that tells the processor to do
something so we have different sets of
assembly language for different types of
processors so there's x86 there's arm
all kinds of stuff
there's MIP s mips so each one of those
is if you think about it is kind of like
the programming languages you know one
might be C one might be c-sharp or
whatever but we're talking on the
assembly level so they all have their
differences because you're working on
different hardware so if you don't know
about what what machine language is
that's okay just go learn about it just
learn the basics okay what else do I
think you should know if you're going to
be in computer science you should know a
little bit about operating systems now
in the school I'm attending there is an
operating systems class but I actually
haven't taken that class yet that's one
of the upcoming classes that I will be
taking and I'm excited for that because
operating systems are extremely
important now I'm not saying you need to
program an operating system that's you
got to get that clear is like you can't
be an expert in everything
so you need to learn the basics of all
this stuff and then specialize in one or
two things but what you do need to know
about operating systems is that they are
the intermediary between your hardware
and your software so if you guys know
anything about database design and one
of my database design videos or series
I'll talk about intermediary tables and
these tables kind of go in between two
other tables to allow them to have a
relationship without things exploding
the same thing works with an operating
system we can write our software to work
on a particular operating system and we
don't even have to think much about the
hardware we have to think a little bit
about it but most 90 95 percent of all
that probably more is taken care of
that's because the operating system once
we program to work on that the operating
system itself is going to worry about
working on different hardware using
different drivers all that stuff so I do
have a video on operating systems if you
do want to go learn more on that it's
the very very basics and that's kind of
like the conceptual side of operating
systems you know what what do they do
well they're they're basically an
abstract they're basically an
abstraction from the hardware so we as
programmers don't have to program on the
hardware all we got to do is program on
the operating system you know so that's
one thing I think is really really
important ok the next thing is caches
main memory processors I know very
little on this stuff unfortunately but I
still know a little bit so I do think it
is important but you should understand
like when people say memory we're
talking RAM the the the memory on your
computer that doesn't stay when you turn
your computer off so that is what's most
probably one of the most important
things with writing
software is you got to be careful to not
have memory leaks and essentially what a
memory leak is is we're using RAM and
we're not letting go of it so we're just
consuming more and more and more and
more ram and then eventually you're
going to run out of RAM things are going
to stop working mr. Elson also know what
a cache is and how a cache is basically
sort of like an operating system if you
think about it it's like an an
intermediary between two layers of the
hardware stack so you can have think of
like a hard disk and then on top of that
you might have RAM and then you have the
processor processors by far the fastest
and if it needs to get something from
memory well that's like a really slow
process so the cache is there as an
intermediary to store temporarily things
that are likely to be used again so the
cache is a way to allow the processor to
keep moving without having to hit the
RAM that's about all I know about caches
so don't ask me questions
okay the next thing object-oriented
programming you'll hear this everywhere
I'm sure you guys have heard of it if
you've worked with basically any
programming language except C and yeah
that's basically it maybe a few others
oh okay so this is a big topic it's
something I could literally make an
entire video over all of the pieces of
object-oriented programming and coming
from a computer science perspective I
want to get rid of the language
implementations I just want to think
about the core concepts of
object-oriented programming that are
important to understand when you dive
into languages such as C++ C sharp Java
all those are going to be
object-oriented programming languages
like I said there are languages out
there that are not object oriented so C
is one of them I know there's more out
there but almost all the languages I use
are object oriented
so there's three main pieces of
object-oriented programming and then
some people actually have a fourth piece
which I'll also mention briefly so the
first one is encapsulation so one of the
big things we try to do with programming
is we like to hide things and it seems
weird but when we hide things it makes
it easier for us to work with stuff I
mean imagine if you were driving a car
and you had to understand every single
piece of that car
in order to understand how to drive it
that'd be stupid I mean no one could
drive a car so all of the the internals
of the car is abstracted away meaning
it's hidden so when when things are
abstracted it makes it simple so
encapsulation is similar to abstraction
and basically we're going to hide
complex processes behind very simple
public processes so when you have a
class in object-oriented programming
you're going to make an instance of that
class and it's that's called an object
and that object is going to have
properties so if you think of an object
such as a person that person is going to
have a name Caleb
for example that name is a property well
you could do whatever you wanted behind
the scenes inside of that class to make
that property work so often you'll have
the property in them behind the scenes
you're going to have a field and the
naming conventions might vary from
programming language to programming
language but essentially you're going to
make the public property access that
field and the user of that class so the
programmer who's going to be using that
class doesn't usually get access to the
field the only way they can get access
to that field is through that public
property so every property is going to
have getters and
setters and you can I guess not every
single property because you can get rid
of one or the other to restrict access
to that hidden to hit to that field
that's behind the scenes if that makes
any sense at all so that's kind of like
the very basics of encapsulation
basically we're going to be able to put
a bunch of stuff inside of this bubble
and the only thing we really have to
worry about is the outside all the
internals you don't got to worry about
any of that and encapsulation is a
pretty interesting topic so we could
probably get into that in a lot of
detail but essentially just think of the
word encapsulate if you encapsulate
something you're you're wrapping around
it and almost thinking of hiding it see
what I'm saying starting to make sense
okay good and that's why I think that's
very close to abstraction which is the
fourth one I'll talk about in a little
bit but there's probably some
differences I'll probably have to do
some more research because I want to
make sure I'm giving some clear
definitions and I'm not getting any
information incorrect so I would
encourage you as well as extra study to
go ahead do some research on the four
pieces of object-oriented programming
learn the differences between the two -
uh say - between the two between the
four learn the differences between the
four because these are very very common
for job interviews because
object-oriented programming is extremely
important the next one is inheritance
inheritance talks about yeah this one's
kind of weird I don't really know how to
give a good good of a good explanation
without giving probably an overused
annoying illustration but think of
having an animal right well that's a
very broad term but every animal
has some things in common so let's say
we make an animal in our program an
animal class and we give us some data on
there so we give it the ability to
breathe the ability to die to come alive
but then what we want to do is we want
to make more specific classes so we're
going to make a class on you know we're
gonna make a dog we're gonna make a cat
we're gonna make a amount of animals
cuddle fish so you're gonna make these
animals and they are going to inherit
these abilities from what they call the
base class so I wish I had my screen
working I could show you guys some
illustrations but I'm still trying to
figure that out I haven't had a lot of
time to do this because I've been
working with my sponsor IBM db2 check
them out they're awesome but I've been
working with them trying to get these
videos planned so that's why I've been
doing these live streams out like 10
o'clock at night because that's the only
time I have time so give me a couple
days I will get the the illustrations
working and maybe maybe I'll find a
place where I can actually draw on a
whiteboard or a chalk board and once I
upgrade my my potato to a potato HD then
I can start making all kinds of
illustrations making them all pretty and
stuff so okay that's that's that one so
we talked about so far we talked about
encapsulation we talked about
inheritance and the next one is
polymorphism and this is pretty similar
but it's a little different essentially
what polymorphism is is that these dogs
or these cats or these cuttlefishes can
be treated as a dog cat or cuttlefish
or they can be treated as an animal very
generally
so if we make some kind of process a
method or function or whatever that we
want to work with dogs only well then we
would need to pass in a dog as an
argument but what if we made a function
or method that we wanted to be able to
work on any animal it doesn't matter
what kind of animal it is well then we
would just pass in an animal but the
thing is when when you say passing in an
animal any class or any object that
inherits from animal can be passed in as
an argument so if the function or method
takes an animal you can pass in a dog
you can pass in a cat you can pass in a
cuttlefish you understand so think of
this these dogs
morphing into an animal kind of a
doughnut example but when you get into
some more concrete examples it makes
sense so for example if you are working
with an output system right and you make
a function and it's like let's think
write output and you pass in what you
want to write this output - that makes
sense so you could pass in you could
pass in a file you could pass in some
kind of network stream you could pass in
a database whatever it doesn't really
matter don't think too far into it
once you pass when you when you make
that function instead of taking making
one of the functions take a file so
stream making it the same function take
a network stream and making the same
exact function taking a database you can
make all of those things you pass in
inherit from something they all have in
common so you could make a class like
input-output and then all of these other
classes could inherit from input output
and then that function you can pass in
you can make the argument
of type input/output which means you can
pass in anything that inherits from that
class so yeah if it's kind of hard to
see all this without illustrations so I
apologize I'm gonna try and work that
out how how are we going to do that with
these live streams but you can
essentially think of a file stream like
writing to a text file you can think of
that morphing into a general
input/output and it works you can think
of the database as morphing into an
input/output and it works you can think
of the files the network stream morphing
into an input/output and it works so it
makes it easier for the programmer
because you only have to write the
function one time and take a general
version class a general class that
anything that would have work can be
passed in rather than making three or
four or five functions that do exactly
the same thing hopefully that makes
sense I don't know this the the
object-oriented pieces is one of the
things that took me the longest to grasp
specifically because I started learning
programming with PHP which I would
actually probably advise against so
don't take that as advice and that was
before PHP with object-oriented
programming was really a thing so the
book I had didn't touch on
object-oriented programming at all with
PHP so when I picked up c-sharp
I was totally totally confused because
is this is just a new way of thinking
and by picking up that other language
that works a different way I was able to
expand my thinking powers yeah so my
thinking power level was like over 9000
it's pretty intense
so the fourth one is abstraction and we
kind of talked about that with
encapsulation essentially abstraction is
you know you have some crazy crazy thing
with tons of information and we just
abstract that away all you really need
to know now is that you have a document
it doesn't matter what's on the other
side who cares it's a document we just
abstracted away that information and we
can just treat this as a document this
is very interesting because the word
abstraction is so abstract but we do
this literally every day everything we
do is an abstraction this laptop it's an
abstraction because we're literally
talking to the computer through a
keyboard the internals are encapsulated
inside and abstracted away from our
needing to know so how does this come up
with programming well obviously with
object-oriented programming it's a thing
because you can abstract away big
complex things you can make a function
or an object-oriented programming a
function is called a method you can make
a method that's public meaning you can
call it from outside you can call it
outside of that file but that function
or that method can call you know 10 20
whatever other functions and methods
that are all private to that class and
we don't have to know a single thing
about them so what that means is if
you're doing something very repetitive
in your code you can make that a private
method and then you could call that
method inside of your public methods so
trying to think of a good example you
know but like let's say ya got nothing
sorry hey at least I'm honest rather
than coming up with like some stupid
example
okay so moving on oh wait another thing
I wanted to mention with abstraction
SDKs they are an important SDK software
yeah that's the word I was looking for
looking for it yeah I think so yeah so a
software development kit is looking it
up on Google I'm just kidding it is a
set of software development tools that
allow the creation of applications for
certain software package software
framework hardware platform computer
system video game console operating
system a similar development platform
okay that totally did not help at all
I'll just put that into English there's
obviously different types of SDKs I'm
sure but one way that SDKs come up is
they basically abstract away something
complicated so like let's say you're
working on an iPhone app or whatever and
to display something on the page it
doesn't have to be an iPhone just an
application and to display something on
the page it's really super complicated
well what you can do is you can make
basically a class library a library that
you can access in all of your other
files that abstract away all that
complicated stuff and make something
really super simple like phone dot
display parentheses quote hey it just
displays on the screen you don't have to
worry about how it works why it works or
whatever so that is an example of an
abstraction very very common with an SDK
because it's an SDK is basically a
toolset to allow you to make
applications without having to know
everything so this is so so so common
even in like the dotnet framework for
example you can work with things on your
computer without necessarily
understanding how everything's working
because it just you know it's very
simple like dot do something done if
you're working with an API
that comes in handy handy so if if you
if you don't know what an API is
basically it's a way to get data from
websites publicly well some of its
public not all of its public you can you
can authenticate yourself to get private
data but a lot of websites have a public
API that you can use to get data so for
example you can get the Instagram you
can code against that to get data to
basically scrape Instagram for
information in code well working with an
API in code can be pretty complex so a
lot of people will do so a lot of people
will make an API SDK and essentially
that would be like let's say this
Instagram example you could have a
function like person dot get photos and
then it just puts those photos into an
array and it's done that's all you got
to do actually making the SDK is the
hard part but once you've done that you
have a an abstraction in your code that
makes it super easy to expand to your
software system and also another thing
it's easier to test because you can test
that SDK and if you can verify that it's
working well then you should be able to
use that SDK and all of your other
software and it should work as expected
rather than doing all of the coding to
get the API information manually each
time because that's very very
error-prone the only time the SDK would
break is if the public API changes the
data structure or the data types or
something like that which is it it
happens but it's it's rarer than then we
really need to worry about it's just
something we have to deal with so yeah
those are the four pieces of
object-oriented programming sorry I
talked about that for like you know ten
hours but that's okay
so uh as a review for those ones I still
got some more so don't go yet don't you
dare leave
I'm trying to teach you okay
encapsulation inheritance polymorphism
and abstraction yeah these abstraction
you know my my abs are hidden away from
public stupid joke never mind okay
moving on let's talk about compilers
interpreters these are things that are
important if you were going into
computer science and programming you
need to know about these ok so learn
about you don't have to know everything
though the very first thing you need to
know though is what when the world is a
compiler actually let's not even go to
the compiler yet let's talk about an
interpreter so you write this crazy
application and an interpreter is going
to basically run through your code as
it's being executed and execute it at
that moment
so essentially what that means is all of
your errors and stuff don't show up
until you actually run the program and
get to that position this is different
than a compiler which will give you
compiling errors so even with an
interpreting language you can still get
some compiling errors even though
they're not really compiling errors but
you might be working with a software
that is going to help you find errors
but a true interpreter is not going to
notice those errors until it hits them
when the application is running a
compiler though is going to basically
parse your code and find problems so for
example if you put an extra double quote
it's going just not compile you
literally can't make the the compiled
version of your program because you have
a compiling error
so that means you can't even execute
execute your code because it's not
compiled yet so there's ups and
downsides to each one personally I like
compiled languages but you know that
could always change a lot of people say
that an interpreted language is an
interpreted language is easier to debug
but I don't really see why that is I
mean I guess because you don't have to
spend time compiling I don't know so if
you guys have the inside insight on that
leave it in the comments because I want
to be enlightened so why why would you
prefer an interpreter over a compiler
because everything I know I think all
compilers are the way to go but I am
curious to hear from someone who's
worked with an interpreter more than a
compiler so I like compilers because if
it catches a lot of your issues before
you even execute your code so that's
good because there's less errors and all
the errors are found before you run the
software if you're in an interpreter you
have to like go and find all the end
points of your software to make sure
everything's working so that's I don't
know how that's better
but both compiling and interpreting
languages are extremely popular so it's
not like one outweighs the other there
are a lot of compiling languages and
there are a lot of interpreting
languages so I'm sure there are upsides
and downsides to both so what is an
example of a compiled language we're
talking C C++ Java c-sharp all those
good things
they are compiled and then executed now
I'm going to go in a little bit more
detail and it's going to be a little bit
specific to c-sharp but some of this is
going to carry over into job
you know C++ and C is probably a little
bit different but that's okay that's
because they are do you remember the
word yeah so c-sharp and Java are
managed we don't have to worry about the
memory as much so let's talk a little
bit about how a compiler works with a
managed language and this is like super
high level so this is nothing like a
compiler class in school or something
you are going to write your code and
then you're going to click compile and
that is going to check all your code for
any kind of syntax errors which is when
you do something dumb like putting two
double quotes or something and it's
gonna bark at you and say man fix this
me well then you go fix that and then
once you got no compiling errors you can
compile that code down to another kind
of like a another step and in c-sharp
it's called intermediary language and I
don't know what Java is like bytecode or
something I don't know but basically the
same thing and this is then executed and
there is a another process that's
executed on this this intermediary
language using a jitter JIT just-in-time
and essentially that's going to run this
compiled code just in time for it to be
executed so it's going to compile it
down to machine language just in time
for it to be executed if that makes any
sense at all I don't know I asked if it
makes sense because it's not like you
what am I talking about I'm so not used
to doing live streams I'm not I'm not
asking you guys if I'm making sense so
please leave a comment make sure you
explain if I'm if I'm making sense and I
am getting your comments
but I just I'm going to do my teaching
and then I'm going to address any
questions and so forth yeah okay what
else yeah okay so the jitter is going to
compile that to machine language just in
time for it to be executed so there's
kind of like a two-step process and an
interpreter is just going to execute it
as it goes an example of an interpreted
language is JavaScript so yeah that's
all I got JavaScript okay what else okay
this one is probably one of the most
important things to note yeah for sure I
didn't put it at the beginning just
because I wanted to make sure I was
warmed up enough to explain it with
enough energy and kind of get into the
feel for this live stream but this is
the probably number one thing on my list
of things that you should know before
you go looking for a job okay and that
thing is that thing is I'll tell you in
a couple minutes because I'm gonna save
it for last so mean okay the next one I
got to make sure I don't forget that
the next one is testing so software
testing is so important so close to
number one but no it's not number one
because what's the point of testing
software if you don't know how to write
software so all the other stuff is kind
of important what testing is extremely
extremely important so one thing with
testing is essentially we're trying to
make sure our software works the way
it's supposed to work so we we can do a
bunch of different types of tests and
one day I'll probably make a live stream
dedicated to testing test-driven
development the different types of tests
the unit test integration tests white
box testing all that stuff so let's talk
about that okay so testing testing one
two three
the very first thing with testing that I
wanted to talk about is unit tests and
integration tests so a unit test if you
think of a unit it's like the smallest
indivisible piece so to an extent we
kind of break those rules but with unit
testing we are trying to test a very
small piece of our software to make sure
that it does what it's supposed to do so
we're talking like testing a small
method to see if it gives the correct
output when we put something into that
method so with testing you generally
need you generally aim for 100% test
coverage but in an eye in a perfect
world this would be possible but we're
not in a perfect world unfortunately so
what that means is getting 100% test
coverage is very very very very hard or
very very very time-consuming and
usually a waste of time because it's a
lot of it's going to be redundant so
what that means is we strive to get as
close as possible to 100% test coverage
without writing tons and tons of tons of
tests so we need to find a happy medium
because if we spend you know 10 20 40
hours a week just writing tests and not
writing software we're gonna run out of
software to test which means we're not
going to need a test
software and then we're out of our
product so let's explain what it means
for test coverage when you're working
with an application things break off
into pieces this is you know very common
with if statements they are called flow
control statements a way to control the
flow of your application so think of it
like this all right so you start here
and then you have an if statement if
it's true it goes this way if it's false
it goes this way well then in here you
have another if statement if it's true
it goes this way and if it's false it
goes this way well now we have three end
points one two and three to get 100%
test coverage in this situation what we
need to do is we need to write either a
manually test or write automated test
which we'll talk about maybe to make
sure all of these three end points do
what they're supposed to do so you'd
think oh three tests but we actually
will probably have more because
different ones may have multiple use
cases for example this is just a very
simple example but one specific end
point might have multiple options like
for example what happens if if a
specific variable is 0 what if a
specific variable is positive and what
if a specific variable is negative that
might actually break this point into
three tests I cannot draw this way it's
confusing so to get a hundred percent
test coverage you have to test every
single possibility and that's
unrealistic so instead what we do is we
focused on the edge cases so edge cases
are like like pushing your limits you
know like that mischievious high
schooler kid who just wants to like try
to get in trouble but like not
we get in trouble okay that was me so
you push your limits let's say we write
a function that accepts the values 0
through infinity okay I lied this is
that I schooler kid who does want to
break the rules
sorry so we're going to accept positive
values from zero to the maximum for
whatever data type you're going to test
the bottom so like zero or like one and
then you're going to test the absolute
maximum and then test just a little bit
after that so this guy's you know he's
really pushing his limits and trying to
get the system to break so that's why I
changed it this is the kid who purely
just wants to get in trouble for the fun
of it so you're going to test over the
edge there and make sure that the
software responds correctly you're also
going to test you know zero negative one
and if you want you can test them the
other negative values and it just
depends on the situation but the reason
we do this is because those are going to
cover most of the cases for example if
if you put a 64 and then a 65 most
likely it's going to do the same thing
because we're just writing a function
that can do the same thing for any
positive number so why would we waste
our time doing multiple different
numbers when we could just do you know
165 and then whatever the max is for
that data type and then the reason we
check breaking it is because we want to
make sure the software responds in a
correct manner if a user breaks it and a
user will break it every single bug that
you could ever possibly have in your
software a user will find and they will
exploit that bug and destroy your
software in your company okay maybe a
little bit of a scare tactic but I'm
serious I don't remember where I heard
this but somewhere I heard that a good
programmer is someone who looks both
ways when they cross a one-way
great because someday sometimes somebody
will be going the wrong way
account for that in your software
because it's going to happen so if you
put a negative number make the make sure
the system responds like hey this is not
valid you need to change this if you put
a zero do whatever bla bla bla
you can actually automate those things
and you can compare values and make sure
it's working correctly so that's what I
mean by full test coverage we want we
want to strive to get full test coverage
and the way we do that is by testing the
edge cases right before the limit and
then the limit and right after the limit
now do you want to do those testa's
tests automated or do you want to do
them manually most of the time you're
going to want to do them automated
because there is testing frameworks that
can do you know thousands of tests
automatically and doing that manually
would be a big pain in the butt and
that's just stupid
don't do that so yeah automated testing
the cool part though is you can actually
tie this to a build server so you can
actually prevent your software from
being released until all the unit tests
pass which is cool and that's uh that's
that goes into agile continuous
integration continuous deployment we'll
get into that another day because I'm
tired of talking about that stuff but
that is some cool stuff that maybe once
you get all these fundamentals that
would be a good topic to go into like
how do you how do you do this automated
testing with building and releasing
software and all that stuff so the other
type of tests are integration tests
these test your entire software as a
whole so this would be something like
hey this function is supposed to put
data into the database so what we're
going to do is we're going to clear the
database try to insert data and then try
to get that data back out to make sure
it worked the reason that is different
than a unit test is because this
requires your entire assistant system to
work it requires your software to work
it requires the software to be able to
communicate to the database and the and
for you to be able to get that data back
out of the database so these are the
tests that generally the
non software engineers the non software
developers are able to write not encode
but in English they can say hey we need
to make sure when we get this data from
the database it works and what happens
if you try to get incorrect data what
happens if you try to run something else
so that is a that is a little bit more
complex because it tests your whole
system and the reason non software
engineer people care about this is
because they care that these software
system works they don't care if a method
works they probably don't know what a
method is so they want equivalent of
what could be English and in fact some
software says software testing software
can make these test cases in English and
then you can tie that to code so then a
tester can go through this and see
exactly what things are supposed to do
in English it's pretty cool I've used
software like that I don't personally
like it but that's because I'm in
software not testing so that's all I
really got for testing another thing I
didn't want to mention with testing is
if you're interested in computer science
but you're not really very good go into
testing yeah that is some advice a
family friend gave me because I'm a noob
and uh going into testing is a little
easier because you still get to work
with the software and you get to write
tests which uses the software and you
get to program but you don't necessarily
have to make sure the entire system is
working correctly and you don't have to
be very intricate with your programming
it's a good as a good way to get into
the system without having to dive right
in if if you're looking for a job and
you're struggling to keep up or whatever
okay next thing man this is a lots of
stuff up to 58 minutes it's crazy
okay
test-driven development I thought I was
done with testing but I'm not okay so
test-driven development is pretty
important a lot of companies do it not
every company does it and some people
like it some people don't like it but
essentially test-driven development is
when you write the tests first make sure
they fail because you haven't wrote the
code yet and then go implement the code
to make the test pass and essentially
what this does is it forces you to
construct what your software is supposed
to be doing before you program it here's
one of the big problems with programming
is the guy who's paying for it wants
something you make them something
completely different and it's then you
know you have to go back and redo it so
that's what we want to avoid and one
ways of avoiding that is through
test-driven development get the the
person who's paying you money to you
know work with you hand and hand and
writing these tests making sure that the
coverage is what they want for what the
software is supposed to do then as long
as those tests pass everything behind
the scenes is basically up to you
assuming assuming you're in a small team
if you're working with like you know
tons of software engineers you know you
probably have to go through some code
reviews or whatever else but once you
got that testing the rule list but
basically hey here are the tests that we
need to pass to show that the software
is working the way it's supposed to be
working you can just basically abstract
everything behind those tests away from
the customer and as long as they pass
you're good so it's a really great way
to make some software yeah so the other
thing was agile controversial I don't
really feel like talking about it right
now because my throat's starting to
blister yeah so let's let's say I go on
to the next topic and that topic is
databases the reality is is that we are
moving to a data-driven world
I mean we've been doing that since I was
like 10 a couple years ago so it's
nothing new but every single day there
is more focus on data analytics machine
learning how do we implement how do we
use this data to make this data to make
business decisions because data has the
power to do so much so there is a lot of
databases out there and they're all very
competitive with one another and if I
would highly recommend that you learn at
least one database and I would focus on
a structured database because that is
like the foundation of databases
unstructured databases which I have a
video on unstructured data and all
database design so you can learn all
about what all that means but
unstructured is not quite the
overpowering database implementation and
in fact there is some problems with
unstructured data that seems at least
right now that structured data is the
only way to really make it work well so
I focus a lot on structured data on my
channel I have a 50 part database design
series all unstructured data how to
structure a database but I don't have a
lot on unstructured data because I'm not
super convinced that it's as I got to be
careful how I say this I think
unstructured data is extremely important
but I think structured data is also
extremely important and it seems a lot
of people are ditching the unstructured
data and then coming up with some
serious problems in their software
design there's an article I'll try to
link to it but I already forget
everything I said I was going to link to
so you might just want to look it up I'm
just being honest probably it's not
going to end up in the description
because how many youtubers actually do
what they say they're gonna put in their
description like nearly impossible but
there's an article out there on
something like why not to use Mongo do
for example which is an unstructured
database and he has some valid points or
she I don't know if it's a boy or girl I
don't know but I think there are some
situations when you very well should be
using MongoDB or something that does
have unstructured data so if you're new
I would highly highly highly highly
recommend db2 from IBM and the reason
this is is because I have been shown
some of the things that db2 does that
completely overpowers competitors and
the price tag is a lot better than the
competitors so the bang for your buck is
much more and if you're just learning
development that is a huge marketing
point if you can come to a company and
not only do I have programming skills
but I also have big business concepts
that can save us money then that is
another marketing standpoint and can
actually help promote you into
management so I'm not saying you have to
do management but if you know ways to
save your company money
well then paying you a bunch of money is
not really a problem you know what I'm
saying
so db2 is a database that you can use
for free which is really cool so the
developer edition is free it has all the
capabilities that the full version has
so you can try out all the features and
then you can even you can even start
selling your software or whatever with a
production version after that once you
decide hey this database rocks it rocks
my socks off I'm going to be using this
well then you can you can shift
additions if that makes any sense so
it's not like you gotta pay tons of
money up front to get like enterprise
db2 because it's really not needed you
can start with a developer edition and
then move up to the next edition in the
next edition and it's all the same
codebase so switching editions really is
problem so one of the things that I like
with db2 is well they support no
unstructured data or unstructured data
and after I was just giving some crap to
unstructured data I do think it is
important and it's definitely something
you should know I've even made some
tutorials on unstructured data with db2
and MongoDB so it's not like I'm like oh
don't use unstructured data I'm saying
don't replace structured data with
unstructured data they have two distinct
uses but db2 supports both structured
and unstructured data so you get the
boat but the best of both worlds inside
of one database some of these the
technology behind db2 completely blows
away the competitors so one of the
things is Blu acceleration why it's
called blue I don't know but it's BL you
and essentially this is an in-memory way
of running analytics on your data so
it's it's fit for analytics they are
hoping to come out with some stuff to
make this make the benefit pass on to
transactional stuff so like if you're
thinking an online store where you're
buying and profiles and all that stuff
that's primarily transactional stuff so
inserting updating deleting all that
stuff analytics is going to basically
look at the columns and run data on the
columns so if you need to have analytic
processing db2 Blu acceleration is
incredible like I have a document that
compares db2 with Oracle and it has some
surprising information it's a it's a
couple years old but I mean I'm sure not
a ton has changed since then I will try
to keep my eyes open for a new article
but so I will try to put that in the
description but essentially I'm not
trying to get off topic quote
to tell you here is that there is a way
to process data both by column and by
row so this is getting a little bit into
some of the way databases work and the
important thing to know is that db2 can
be used for a variety of different
things because it can be used easily for
analytics and it can be easily used for
transactional based processing
unstructured and structured data so it's
kind of like it's a database that can
get you started and you can get
experience in a bunch of different
things which will ultimately make you
more marketable so please go check them
out download db2 developer edition give
it a try that'll be the best database to
start with so that is all the stuff that
I wanted to talk about except the last
one which i think is by far the most
important and that is source control all
right so youyou ought to know how to
program before you use source control
but you should be learning source
control as you learn to program so it's
it goes hand-in-hand because a lot of
people they learn a programming language
really well and then the and then once
they're really good at it they'll pick
up source control and at that point they
have to catch up on their source control
skills what do I think about agile that
is a very good question I'm gonna answer
that real quick I think it can be useful
I don't think it's the only way to write
software because I think it's a little
you know I guess if if software have
religion agile would be the
controversial religion that everyone
argues about and like the most of the
jobs I've worked have done agile so I
understand it I know how it works but
it's not the only thing and I want to
get a lot more into agile once I once I
get my screen sharing working
I'm gonna show you guys how agile works
and how to use it because most software
companies use agile and it's very
important to know so back to what I was
talking about with source control source
control is essentially a way to
centralize your code in a backed-up
manner so you don't just have it all on
your laptop but you have it up either in
the cloud or you have it on multiple
laptops so the benefit here is that it
backs up your software so when you break
everything because you will break
everything you have that backup in
addition to that it's easier to work in
teams and if you can't work in a team
you're not going to be able to write
software for a company because literally
every company is going to be using
source control nowadays so if you don't
know what source control is that's okay
it's just time to catch up so the most
popular source control system right now
is get GI T that is the source control
management system art not management
source control system software or
whatever it is the source control that I
would recommend and that's because it's
a distributed source control system
whereas the competitors are not so what
that means is that you can you don't
necessarily have a centralized server
most of the times you do have a
centralized server but with get what I
can do is I can start writing software
and I make a bunch of changes and I'm
like oh this is really really really
great and I want to make sure I save
this but I don't want to I don't want to
give it to the company yet because it's
not quite done but I don't want to lose
this so what I can do is I can take
everything I've done so far I can save
it and a commit and then I can keep
working on my software and then I can
make another commit and then keep
working on my software and then I can
make another commit and keep working on
my software then once I have a a piece
of software that you know is fully
functional or a little section that's
fully functional then I can commit all
of those commits at once to a
centralized server if I work
the reason I think that is so important
is because the competitors which you
should know these two is subversion team
foundation server on Visual Studio
online those are the two main software
sis source control software out there
those are not that way they're a
centralized system and because they are
centralized what that means is every
time you commit it has to go to a
centralized server so it pressures you
because if you're working on something
and it's not quite ready like you have
half written code and all that stuff it
pressures you to push crappy code to a
centralized server or it pressures you
to not push your code to a centralized
server which is even worse because if
you don't push your code to a
centralized server regularly you get the
situation where you build so much on
your local machine and the problem is
then is you have hundreds of files or it
depends the way you're doing you might
have tens files you have tens of files
on your your machine but not on the
centralized server and your commits
become extremely large and error-prone
because the chances of it not working on
your co-workers machine is very high
because there's so many changes and you
might add files you might remove files
you might change settings you might
change configurations that's all
likely to break and also like if your
computer explodes which you know your
computers always explodes right it just
has to in that way that's more likely to
be an issue because now you have more
code just sitting on your laptop ready
to be destroyed with a distributed
system it still works the same way
because it's all going to be on your
local machine until you commit it to a
centralized server so you still have
that risk of your computer exploding and
losing it all but if I go in there make
a couple commits but I don't push it to
the centralized server yet and then I
just happen to screw everything up
everything breaks well I can roll back
to a previous commit on my low
machine to a commit that's not on a
centralized server so there is a much
much higher chance probability that I
can recover from that disastrous event
with a centralized server you're going
to have much you're going to have much
more stuff on your machine because you
are trying to make a big enough piece to
commit it all once and it's just much
more error-prone I'm not sure if I
expressed that the best way but
hopefully that makes sense the main
thing is just decentralized source
control is the way to go for your
company so if you start a software
project and let's say you're a
subversion master I would say trash that
garbage okay
get get and don't go back you need to
use git okay a confession confession
time okay I'm sorry I'm sorry I use
subversion at work but I still would
prefer to use git but everything we do
is on subversion and I hate it
okay so let's learn use git and if you
if you want to use a centralized server
you can use github which you've probably
heard used github if you don't have a
github profile in your programmer you're
probably not gonna get a job maybe but
get a github profile and also if you
want a private repository which is where
you store your code check out bitbucket
bi t bu ket they're there you can have
private repositories and you can invite
people so you can still work on it on it
as a team but you don't necessarily have
to pay for git because they're private
repositories cost money so you don't
have to pay for github because they're
private repositories cost money get in
github are not the same thing it is the
the source control software that github
chooses to use hello Mitch welcome to
the live stream hopefully you enjoy it
okay so source control learn it learn it
now don't don't neglect this okay like
I've talked to people in there who are
in software in computer science or a
programming course or a program like a
four-year program or whatever and these
programs are not teaching source control
for some reason fortunately where I go
they teach source control they teach
testing they teach all the stuff that's
important for actually getting a job and
they teach the computer science stuff
behind all that stuff but a lot of
schools I don't know if they're just
behind or what but they are not teaching
the essentials for getting a job in
computer science and maybe maybe they
don't think it's their responsibility
and they just want to teach the
fundamentals behind everything but
that's that's the question for an
argument I don't I don't know what my
opinion is on that all I know is that if
you are doing anything with software you
absolutely have to be using get or some
source of source control some sort of
source control with that it's almost
always used on a resume so if you apply
for a job there's a 90% chance they're
going to ask for some kind of code
you've written it's how you get hired I
mean how are you supposed to get hired
as a software intern or software
developer software engineer or whatever
without any portfolio I mean it's your
portfolio you should be writing all of
your applications inside of a repository
or multiple repositories and get them up
on github right now okay and then send
them to me and then if you guys got some
cool you want to share I can maybe share
with the community so it's a great way
to build communities and its really
really great now I I I
confess my github profile is pretty
pathetic
but that's because I actually use
bitbucket for my school projects I keep
most of them privatized because I don't
want to get in trouble for putting
solutions to problems on the internet
that makes any sense you know it's kind
of borderline academic misconduct if you
ask me thirsty ok so let's say you do go
into computer science what kind of job
are you gonna get and what are the
earnings like well the job you get is
probably going to be something like
super boring I mean I'm being honest
like I love programming but working
full-time is Pro as a programmer is very
challenging unless you love sitting and
you love not moving for like 8 hours
it's it can be very physically demanding
believe it or not very very likely to
have back pain very likely to have
health problems but it's not all
negative it's very very rewarding
because you get to use your brain I
would rather be using my brain all day
than getting paid the same amount to
play video games because I actually care
about myself and my personal development
so the kind of jobs there's a couple
different jobs there's software engineer
there's software developer there's
programmer there's software testing and
they all have their inter laps and my
goal is not to say the difference
between a software developer and a
software engineer it's kind of it's very
small but you're basically going to be
doing the same thing for any of the jobs
regardless of what the job description
says
the general consensus or I don't know if
that's the right word the general thing
that I found is that software developer
does the exact same thing as a software
engineer chip but just gets paid less
does that make sense I might be wrong
though oh yeah
so the earnings though are extremely
high for all of them software is one of
the highest paying things in existence
and if you're good at it your value is
extremely high
the average is insane
and also you you have opportunities that
you don't often get other places like
using your brain regularly you're
encouraged to learn you're encouraged to
educate yourself you in some in some
jobs you are actually encouraged to take
care of your health and a lot of a lot
of software companies will have their
own gyms and their own fitness programs
or whatever the earnings though are well
above average for the national average
of earnings and you can do things such
as working remotely and whether that's a
good thing or not we'll discuss another
day that is actually something I want to
dedicate one of these streams to is how
do you work remotely and how do you do
it without dying and hating your job how
do you log your time and do things
ethically and all that good stuff
because I've worked remotely for two
years a little over two years and I've
also done youtube for like forever so I
I understand working remotely and I've
also I've also worked in an office so
I've kind of experienced both and I've
found the struggles of each so I am I
have a lot of insight on how to manage
your time and how to best survive either
working from home or working in an
office from personal experience I
believe I'm better at working from home
but that doesn't mean I can't survive in
an office I've just had some problems
working in an office that I will talk to
you guys generally about like I'm not
gonna give you the specifics but some
problems that I've encountered I'm
guaranteed I'm guaranteeing that you are
probably going to encounter in your
software development career so if you
are looking for a job that is very
challenging but also very fulfilling and
it pays really well computer science is
the way to go computer science software
programming whatever if you go into
computer science you might be doing some
more sciency stuff I guess I don't know
but basically you're going to end up
with the same job to put it to put it on
bluntly I guess most computer scientists
will graduate with a bachelor's in
computer science and then get a job as a
dotnet developer or a Java developer and
then they'll stay there for the rest of
their life and not really do anything
with compiler optimization or computer
graphics or vision or machine learning
or algorithms the majority of people who
graduate from computer science program
I'm guessing end up in the same kind of
job as a software developer someone who
either picks it up on their own goes
through a camp or goes into a bachelor's
or associates program specific to
software engineering or software
development we are going to probably
talk in future future chats about the
difference between going to school or
the difference between self-training and
the difference between getting
certifications what you should do what
you shouldn't do all of that good stuff
because that's super super important and
a lot of stuff I've been wondering
myself like I I questioned hey should I
go back to school or should I just jump
into the workforce and I've watched a
lot of people on YouTube and I think
there is and over over a lot of people
on YouTube represent the minority of
what
most software developers are at least
that's what I believe that's what I've
found so you might not be getting the
best advice from watching youtube videos
because most people on YouTube are very
ambitious they I mean they're making
YouTube videos for basically free just
to get either their name out there to
teach people or to build a resume and a
lot of these people will because they're
making these tutorials have some kind of
skill that they feel where they are
capable of sharing with the world and
because of that they have a high
possibility of getting remote jobs or
jobs even if they don't have a degree
but it doesn't work the same for every
single person so you also have to
consider where you're getting this
advice so if you're if you're
considering where where to go to school
or whether you should go to school or if
you should just jump into the workforce
I believe I can give you some insight
non-biased insight as to why which one
would be better for certain
circumstances so if that's a situation
you were in I ask that you would send me
a message on facebook or on here and in
the comments and that will kind of allow
me to prepare for your specific
situation and it's different for
everybody so it's not a yes or no answer
so that's something I'm just gonna give
some general points of why you would
want to do one and why you would want to
do the other like should you go to code
camps should you just pick up books
should you watch videos should you watch
should you watch Caleb the video maker -
heck yeah you should cable WMI to talk
about pride man okay that is all for my
blabbering so I am going to answer a
couple of questions and then I am gonna
go to bed because I got to get up and do
some linear algebra back bears I can
values okay so give me some time this
parts probably the boring part of the
stream because I gotta look through
stuff and that you're just gonna have to
deal with it okay
oh got a lot of comments Wow cool
what's up been following you hey hi hey
Caleb watching your videos on BB
clustering is there any certification
for DB clustering or just the DBA
certification would cover it I honestly
don't know I will have to get back to
you on that
like if you're talking about
certifications different database
systems have certifications so db2 has a
certification sequel server has a
certification so I don't know if there's
a general database clustering
certification there might be one out
there but the question is is it valuable
another topic for another day I would
say a more popular certification system
like from db2 or IBM themselves or from
Microsoft if you've been doing sequel
server again MCSA or MCSE or whatever
that might be a little bit more valuable
I I have a friend who's got a
certification it's in it's an IT field
so we might you might chat about that
someday but definitely something we need
to talk about okay okay the next
question hopefully that answered your
question I know I didn't really give you
an answer but I would look into studying
for the db2 certification and regardless
of whether you get a certification
certifications make a great plan of
study and that's the motivating factor
for getting certifications not the
certification itself okay don't go get a
certification
just for getting a certification go get
a certification so you learn the
material required to get the
certification
and then the sort of kittens the
certification doesn't really matter
I think certifications have a great
guideline on what to study so if you go
look up a certification they'll often be
a description and say like oh here are
some things you need to learn here's a
study guide hey here's some training
videos going through that stuff can
prepare you for the workforce if you're
looking and if you have a job that's a
great way to up your resume to make you
a higher valuable employee and sometimes
employers will even pay for these
certifications so I don't think
certifications are bad some people say
oh all certifications
you're wasting your money and if you get
a certification you're stupid that's
that's nonsense okay next question
machine learning or cybersecurity which
major or certificate would be more
profitable and where do you suggest
someone get it from not a good question
yeah I have no idea sorry okay moving on
no I'm just kidding I'll give you some
insight okay so I I'm not a huge thing
I'm not a huge fan with cybersecurity I
would say machine learning is more
profitable if you are good at math and
good at heart things if you are not good
at math or doing complicated hard things
then I would suggest cybersecurity
because I'm pretty sure machine learning
is like one of the artists topics to
learn and as a result it's one of the
highest-paying yeah so hopefully that
answers your question if not just leave
a comment by the time I get to the
bottom I'll probably see it how many
years of experience do you have okay
well I started learning about computers
in high school I don't know how many
years ago that was but you know I read
my first HTML book with my friend its
sophomore year do you yes sophomore year
I think and it was like the most boring
thing ever
but then I picked up a Java book and
that was actually pretty cool but it was
way over my head so I got rid of that
one and I picked up a C++ book and then
I was like the Java book times a
thousand so I didn't get anything from
that either and then I played minecraft
and I thought I wanted to set up a
private server and that kind of led me
to a book that I actually understood and
enjoyed which led me to another book
about website development using PHP and
MySQL and not neither of which I really
use anymore so I kind of wish I started
with something a little different but
you know the way you start is always
unique of course so I don't know maybe
six years - time in between those six
years where I was doing other stuff or
just experimenting or exploring what I
was really really interested in like for
example I mentioned that one of the
programming languages that I'm really
familiar with the c-sharp well I didn't
really get into that until like two and
a half years ago or three years ago or
something maybe two years two or three
years so it's hard to answer how many
experience how much experience do you
have because I've done so many different
things for short periods of time
so I've I've tinkered with PHP MySQL at
tinker but sequel server oracle I've
seen tinkered with db2 I'm tinkered with
C sharp C C++ Python you know JavaScript
web development app development xamarin
like I you can't be an expert in all of
those so how much practical experience
and as a person I don't personally feel
like I can be like yeah brah got like
six years of experience back up because
the reality is you know I might have a
half a year of experience in a lot of
things
see sharp though is what I probably say
I would have well I would say I have a
good solid experience in and also
database design and yeah that's
basically it
hi Caleb I'm your biggest fan well thank
you Kevin
message retracted well thank you bad
word I'm not very good with names
it's Python as suitable for web
development as PHP absolutely it is so
go ahead and pick it up and Python I I
don't really like Python but that's
because my experience of learning it was
probably bad and now if I went back and
learned it I'd probably really enjoy it
it has a lot of uses and is becoming
much much much more popular with machine
learning and all that good stuff so
Python could actually serve you as a
multi-purpose programming language which
is pretty sick that's one of the reason
reasons I tried to study sharp so much
because you can use it to make apps
through xamarin for iPhone Android
Windows and you can also make web forms
or MVC or whatever you can make apps for
loop the desktop you can make all kinds
of stuff with it so that's something
that I look for is like I want to learn
something that's going to have lasting
value so one of the like one thing that
kind of annoys me is like all the new
JavaScript frameworks like they come and
go like every two minutes and nobody
really is finding the fundamentals in
the JavaScript including me I did
angular for like a couple months I'm
gonna learn a thing about JavaScript and
now there's a new version of angular out
and I lost all those skills so I think
Python would be a great way to go yeah I
have a video in my see program in C Rees
it's called a
I think it's number 37 loosely typed
verse strictly type languages or
something like that I highly recommend
you go watch that because that's going
to put a perspective on how Python works
with datatypes and how that's different
than C or C sharp or Java it's just a
different language a lot different what
do you think about agile I talked about
that
oh thanks Carl for pointing out my
potato can well yeah it's a potato can
I'm sorry okay
awesome and awesome man I don't know hi
bro I always get this error when I try
to save my DB some errors have been
deleted on the server please look at the
bottom of this window yeah I'm not
really sure what you mean sorry but if
someone's out there watching who is
super good at fixing stuff please reach
out to me because I literally get like
errors and stuff sent to me on a regular
basis sometimes a couple times a day and
I literally can't keep up with it so I'm
looking for a company that I could refer
people to and maybe make some Commission
off of it to grow this business and help
my customers because people are sending
me these huge messages with like 200
lines of code and like 4,000 errors and
they're like hey this needs to be fixed
by the end of the day please help and I
understand that like you need help and I
I like helping people so if it's a
simple question I usually like to help
but I'm over overburdened by the
pressure to respond to all of the
messages specifically ones when it comes
to very specific problems you know if I
was building the application with you
and I got that error I might be able to
help walk you through it but it's it's
not easy to look at a huge program and
just magically know what's
it may be may be something that we need
to add to this channel is some talk on
proper debugging skills because that's
something that I personally want to grow
my abilities in because that's one of
the frustrations I have with computer
sciences or programming is I just I get
these errors and I just feel like I
can't get past them for the longest time
so I would like to improve my debugging
skills what's your favorite pastime
salvation marriage hi bro I always good
oh I already read that one he's all are
all like out of order and stuff it's
weird I can't learn a thing or two from
your videos in the past thank you you
are welcome just some dude you're not
just something you're important oh nice
your company bought you a standing desk
which helps a lot to switch back and
forth yeah standing desks so one thing
if this stir if it's a live streaming
thing takes off is I want to start this
fundraiser because basically in other
words I I don't have money right so I'm
gonna ask you guys for money but we'll
get into that another day but I want to
start this crazy fundraiser to build a
sick studio so if you guys are already
sick of this potato cam and this potato
mic and let's talk about that because
patreon and stuff is great but just to
buy some streaming equipment from like a
small black magic HD thingamajig it's
like 650 bucks which is a lot
even with my sponsorships that's that's
asking a lot when when my YouTube income
is not a lot
so we'll talk about that in the future
but yeah something with the standing
desk would be pretty sweet because I
deal with back pain from some severe
health issues that I've had and I've
gone a lot better but it's always a
continual problem so that's why in my
videos I'm I'm always so like like
moving all over the place because I just
cannot sit in one spot for more than
like five seconds or it becomes very
unbearably uncomfortable so it's
basically impossible to fall asleep
because I'm moving every three seconds
okay what else thanks a lot for the
signal art tutorials it helped me a lot
that is great
when I first made that series this is an
interesting thing that I want to share
with you guys I got some hate comments
because some people were like bro your
channel was dying like why are you
making signal are blah blah blah and the
reason I made signal are is because I
thought it was cool and it is and I was
using it at work so you know I could it
was easier for me to learn the material
because at work I was using it so it's
kind of trying to to optimize my time
and that that was something that
actually kind of discouraged me for a
bit because like I was kind of lost on
what to do and I don't I don't think
signal R is what I meant to do for my
luck with my life and with my youtube
channel but just the fact that I enjoyed
it is enough for me and since then I've
had extreme positive feedback on that
series from numerous people like you who
weren't able to find the resources to
learn signal are on the internet and I
gave them that resource and that means a
lot to them so all them haters just
gonna keep hating but I can do what I
want because I have an audience who
actually cares that's what that's what's
awesome about the people here watching
and the people who are subscribed and
support this channel if I made a video
of
that's not necessarily revolutionary or
popular I still get the support because
I'm still helping the community and
that's what's awesome uh-huh Wow lots of
questions about certification zend PHP
certification I actually don't know
about that one but this is great because
I know you guys are obviously interested
in certifications so I will I'll have to
do some some more research so let me
write that down
dude oh no just some dude and Mike's in
my experience and also from talking to
employers though they really care about
what you've done and not at all about
what degree you have yeah I've had that
same experience I've actually had the
problem where I am in school and I'm
having a more of a problem getting a job
because they want someone full-time or
whatever and I have enough experience
with this YouTube channel and what the
jobs I've had that they want me and
school is actually getting in the way
that being said I still think the pros
in my situation outweigh the cons
because I'm not in a huge rush to go get
a job so that's fine and and also I have
the experience so oh yeah you have some
good insight I'll have to get into that
more I'd like to talk about talk about
that so let me write that down as a
potential potential stream idea College
and whether it's a big fat waste of
money and if you should do it or should
you not do it good question there are
some really good reasons why I decided
to go to college that most people
probably don't think about so I would
absolutely love to share those with you
guys oh goodness
Bhairava hello he was a great teacher I
can understand his tutorial very well
thank you sir and then someone corrected
them he is a great teacher well thank
you thank you guys for the support I am
NOT a genius though by any means shape
or form not even close
trust me I know geniuses super good
point about certifications can you do
networking videos I really like you by
the way maybe some networking videos not
my expertise some more on the software
so maybe maybe I could do something like
how do you use different internet
protocols through a programming language
for example or how do you can
communicate to software through the
network that would be something I would
consider doing but I'm not really
interested in like making the videos on
the network topologies and all that junk
because that is that is more IT and I
would rather focus my resources on some
other topics that have been wanting to
record on here so we will see with that
but as of now I'm not really not really
feeling like the networking as a whole
but more like with programming are you
making planning to make videos on
MongoDB as well oh how funny you should
ask my friend there is a MongoDB video
on my channel right now that video has
been up for about a week or so and it's
about 20 minutes so it'll give you a
great introduction on MongoDB just just
go on my channel search for it and you
should be good it if it goes really well
I might consider making some more
MongoDB videos but right now I'm pretty
convinced that db2 is the best offering
out there and they offer on structured
data just like MongoDB so what's what's
the benefit of using MongoDB not very
much
someone asking about like who I am what
do i do what do I like all that stuff
yeah
I'd say my work history and personal
history or whatever probably will say
for yet another talk because uh I could
probably give a big big explanation on
Who I am how I got here and how I got
into programming and why I think it's
the stinking awesomest thing in the
world second a couple other things okay
so let's write that down about my career
probably focusing on my career because
yeah that's that's what we're talking
about here so how about laravel laravel
i don't know how it's pronounced I think
that's a PHP framework I'm done with PHP
tutorials for now anyway so probably not
gonna happen sorry that's all for the
live comments I am going to I am going
to go for some other comments if you
guys have any so post them now
okay so I do have some comments from
other people that have sent me messages
and this is one of the great things that
why I wanted to do livestream is because
I can help these people and help you
guys at the same time and save me a lot
of time because if I spend you know a
couple an hour or two a day replying to
comments well I'm only helping like one
person and yeah one person is super
important in my eyes but that's less
time I have to you know like live my
life and eat food and chill on the beach
like I do every day huh I'm kidding
right I will I have to have more time to
make these videos okay so by rubba Bay
raba I cannot pronounce name so I'm just
gonna probably slaughtered them all but
I think I should say names to make it up
a little more personal will I make
advance to see tutorials maybe actually
haha so see programming is one of the
foundational languages and I think it is
a good thing to know it's not really
like my expertise but I have made some
intro C tutorials and I am planning on
finishing my C programming tutorial
series so that I have the whole thing
planned out so all I literally got to do
is record it edit it upload it write
descriptions right transcript I don't
think a literary transcriptions put it
on my website so I'm going to still have
a ton of work but all the time invested
in planning that series I don't want
that to go to waste because I could
literally no life record these things
for a couple days or a week and get the
whole series finished should be about a
hundred videos and that's not going to
go into advanced C programming but like
at all but it will go into some of the
intermediate concepts with pointers and
maybe maybe memory allocation but I'm
not sure like how much I go into that so
if that series goes well that's my test
run the hundred videos is my test run if
it goes well I will consider making an
advanced C programming series but that's
an
next question
Ellen am this person wants me to create
a website a page on the website well he
wants to create a page on a website so
students can access their certificates
and testimonials or documents using a
pin code but he has no idea how to do
this and he wants me to help out well I
can't help out through this live stream
I can give you a rough idea of how to
get started the essentially what you're
trying to do is form validation just in
a more complex way so research form
validation essentially a form validation
is making sure people don't put in
malicious stuff into your forms to break
stuff and you're probably wondering well
what does that have to do with anything
well if you can check form data for that
you can validate it for other stuff so
you can validate if they're putting in
the correct pin code for example I know
that's kind of vague but just start pick
up some language follow a series on form
validation and you might just get where
you're trying to go once you can
validate if the access code they're
typing in is equal to the access code in
the database or in are coded in the code
at that point you could potentially make
this application my camera seems a
little laggy so let me know if this
dream is this stream is uh falling apart
the date of the internet here is really
fast but it's very flaky it goes on and
off I just bar
Babur Ram next question
learning eight I started learning HTML
CSS about a month ago problem with the
color code in HTML okay so I think I
understand what you're saying if I get
it wrong I'm sorry but I can share with
you the trick to understanding the color
code so I think what you're talking
about
is if you set some color code in CSS it
looks something like pound 1 7 2 4 3 F
for example and you are asking what is
the system behind this this code right
how do you know what code is going to
produce what color or how do you know if
you have a color about what code it is
um well sorry I'm stretching my although
it's kind of like it's like I'm showing
you something but just just stretching
uh
when you get into something so I got I
remember that the microphone is like
down here and I keep like banging so if
it's really super loud I apologize I'll
try to upgrade my mic here soon hey I do
have another mic but I use it for my
tutorials and I don't want to have to
like lug it back and forth so this up
logitech c910 Oh
microphone is all you're gonna get for
right now
what was I saying oh yeah the CSS color
codes how do you understand them well if
you get into some complex colors it's
kind of complicated because it's
complicated because it's hard to mix
colors in your brain and know what its
gonna make but when you're talking about
one individual color it's pretty easy so
the six digit code is the first two well
after the pound the little hash symbol
there's two there's three groups of two
the first one is red the second one is
green and the third one is blue so red
green blue okay now how do you make
colors out of that well the the first
the if you just take red for example
yeah two digits essentially two
characters that is actually in
hexadecimal which is 16
characters so it's not technically a
digit because a digit is implying 10 but
they're 16 so we have 0 through 15
represented through 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11
not 11 a b c d e and f okay so I can't
give you a whole tutorial on how to
convert decimal to hexadecimal right now
because I would probably need something
other than an Irish whiskey
advertisement which I've never drank in
my entire life
so I don't know why I'm sitting here but
that's okay I guess I showed that to my
mom I showed my I'm gonna anyways once
you know the hexadecimal like conversion
system a little bit you can kind of
understand the basics though is the
numbers are lower the letters are higher
so if you have FF that is like the
highest amount of red you have zero zero
that's the lowest amount of red if you
have like two four that's like a little
bit of red if you have like a D that's
like a lot of red but not all the way
full red and then you can do that for
the next color so add a little bit of
blue and then add a little bit of green
and once you mix all those together you
get a color so that's how that works
there is a total if you convert it to
decimal each section of two each one
goes up to 255 so if you think about it
in decimal zero would be the lowest 255
would be like full-out red if you do all
of them the same something interesting
happens if you go to zero zero zero zero
zero zero zero I think it's like black
right zero zero zero zero zero zero it's
black if you go one one one one one one
it's like really dark and you can keep
doing that all together all the way up
to FFF
FFF which will be white so if you
balance them you get shades of gray and
if you guys have no idea what I'm
talking about I apologize I never it's
kind of hard to answer a question
without some if you don't know like CSS
and HTML you're probably like what is
this dude talking about son
and I'm all like blabbering about
numbers and junk so just ignore me
but yeah that's the basics of
understanding color codes inside of CSS
so to pick colors you use that and also
there's another shortcut if you just
want like copies of two so if you want
to like like let's say you want to pound
one one two two three three we could
shorten that to pound one two three it's
a little trick you can also just look up
like hexadecimal color picker online and
then you can pick a color and it'll give
you the code and then you take that copy
and paste it into your CSS and shablam
boom there you go you got the color you
need if you do oh yeah that's all I miss
that so let's move on to the next
question
amen Eamonn I'm guessing is how it's
pronounced is the next question air
questioner questioner so can you do some
videos about CMS okay so CMS is short
for content management system and
basically it's a fancy way to build a
website without actually knowing how to
do anything or very knowing how to do
very little so some of the most common
CMS is our WordPress Joomla all that
good stuff which I would recommend both
of those there's also Drupal and there's
like Umbraco or um bracha or whatever
which is like c-sharp based there's a
bunch of them out there so one thing I
did want to mention is that I do have a
hosting company that I promote I'm
starting to promote anyways because I've
used them since I've started my websites
and I've had the most wonderful
experience with
so if you are looking to get a content
management system so you can build a
website without having to code on every
single little detail I would highly
highly highly recommend this host and
I'm going to give you guys a link so
that if you do want to get some web
hosting and you sign up through this
link you will actually be helping me
because they give commission and they
give extremely high commissions so if
you buy a year of hosting which that
would be the best value for both of us
if you buy a year of hosting I am
getting almost almost the full first
year of hosting to my account and then
after that they get all of it but that
would be a great way to help support me
so let me find that for you guys but um
I run multiple web sites off off of
their hosting and it's been nothing but
good they have the reason I like them so
much is mainly because of support they
support me really well and they do like
a live chat if it's urgent you can do a
live chat so um let me just I'm gonna
get you guys ahead bitly so that way
it's super easy actually I'll get you a
uh a different code it's yeah it's give
me a minute
so I've had issues where I think some
plugins that I had installed with uh
what's it called WordPress had some
security issues and they notified me
they said hey we found these issues
these files have been changed or like
some there's a potential that these
files have been changed we've we've done
what we can do here's what you need to
do and they were able to guide me
through the process and they they do a
lot of great stuff and it's not go daddy
because I don't like Go Daddy just
thrown that out there
so I will give you guys this link in
about thirteen and a half seconds okay
I'm going to take this and I'm going to
paste that into the chat for you guys if
you are interested in it and the company
is DreamHost
so if you go to bit bi tly /c TVM to
dream host that will take you to their
website where you can sign up I'm
totally getting off-topic I should have
had that prepared so apologies for that
I'm almost done here I got about one
more question but one thing with dream
hosts the reason I brought it up is not
just to advertise they actually have
1-click installs basically like for drug
joomla and also wordpress so you can set
up a website with a custom domain super
easy which is great if you're trying to
start like a portfolio you can you can
easily make websites for customers and
make some money without having to really
know a whole lot and as you learn you
can start customizing or whatever
Jamie asks do you ever help college
students I have an online course and the
professor is no help
unfortunately I get this comment like
every day so apparently there's a lot of
bad professors out there either that or
you're sleeping in class Jamie you
better stop it better get some sleep
before you go to bed you better get some
sleep before you good at school do I
ever help college students yes I do
but not very often because typically
helping college students means hey I
have this homework assignment can you do
it for me there's particular situations
I'm thinking of where someone commented
or messaged me and said hey here's this
final project that's due tonight can you
help me finish it I'm like no I can't
help you finish this so he proceeds to
cuss me out and say I'm worthless in
that basically I should stop doing
living whatever I don't know so
generally no I don't help but if it's
something conceptual I'd love to talk
about it in these things so go ahead and
share what you got and I'll see what I
got and see if I could help yeah let me
see if there's anything else I want to
say before I go
all right that's all the questions I
have from messages I'm just gonna see if
you guys put any other messages before I
go someone mentioned making advanced
tutorials for those who don't go to
colleges yeah that's something that I
want to do here I'm I don't just want to
scratch the surface that's not gonna
help you guys if anything I like to go
in for some depth all right it seems
like that is all of the questions I got
for today let me know how you guys liked
my first really full to our stream oh
yeah feels good like yesterday's was 15
minutes and I felt completely
unfulfilled because I wanted to do it
for much longer and I still kind of want
to do it more but I have nothing else to
talk about so your guys responsibility
is to get some questions sent to me
anything send them to me place them in
the comments probably do it on the
published video so that way they're
there they're on there and I can find
them for the next stream oh and as
always it's my first one I'm saying and
I have been doing it for years
check out the upcoming live streams and
please support me by subscribing and I
would highly encourage you to go check
out IBM db2 database because they are
giving me some tremendous help to get
this content out and supporting me
financially so that's a blessing to both
me to them and to you so it's a win-win
for all of us so that's really awesome
yeah that's all basically I got in this
video so thank you and I'll see you and
the next one I'm still working on a
schedule so I don't know exactly what
