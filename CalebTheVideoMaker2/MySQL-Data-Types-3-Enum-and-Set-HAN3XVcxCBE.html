one from a huge set up to 65535 so let's
say you're signing up for a website and
asks you for your gender or your sex so
sex male burfi
and then you select it so here's an
option or enumeration and I'll select
male
so that'll select em out of the possible
options there's only two options here
MRF but this can go up to 65,000 options
530 now we're to set set is very similar
to enumeration and basically the only
thing different about it is you can
choose more than one
so what state you live in and let's say
I have two houses okay and once in a bit
one state and one's in another then I
guess you can say you live in two states
so basically one two three and then four
here's your options please select one if
it says please select one it would be an
enumeration if it says please select
options that apply it would be a set and
just think like a set that's usually
like a set of cards more than one that's
that's pretty good if I follow that
myself so set option one and option
three and option four when using an
enumeration or set the options should
never change they need updated in any
way possible shape form how it doesn't
matter so a good example is male or
female because I'm
sure there's never gonna be a new new
one and you're never gonna have to
update that when you get things that can
change such as the states a new state
could be added probably not so that
might work but there's a better way to
design this now if you didn't watch all
my chalk where you go one minute
if you didn't watch my database
organization and normalization tutorials
you can if you want but I'll be teaching
you what you need to know here just this
part if you want to learn a lot more go
watch that series it's awesome so um
here you have where do you live as a
question and there's 50 states in
America in America I'm talking about
America if you live somewhere else well
just just pretend that you live in
America so we got California what else
Michigan Ohio and you get the point and
then asks you where to select one the
state that you live in let's say you
live in California that's great no but
when you get into more in-depth things
such as let's say you have a library and
you need to select what genre a book you
have this could be anything from like
fiction I need to write society you know
what I mean
fiction horror nonfiction biography
autobiography romance you get the point
here's the better design you have a
table
over here and then a table over here now
if you think about it a table can have
not table a book can have one genre
typically they can't have more but for
this example let's say that you have one
genre for the entry of the book so you
have the books over here and then genres
over here and then they both have a
primary key which just keeps every
single entry unique so we have an ID
that's the primary key and then we have
a genre he over here watch is going off
that's my lawyer for like 6:00 in the
morning shouldn't be up still oh well
Sarah now you have the title of the book
the amount of pages and then you have
the genre and then over here you'll have
the genre name too so you know what
genre it is now when you you can connect
these by replacing the genre over here
with the genre ID so over here so most
put GID genre ID and these came in and
these are to be connected with the
primary key so let's say it's a fiction
book and over here fiction has the ID 6
we can have a foreign key of the ID 6 in
this table which were reference to the
ID fiction now as I said enumeration
that has a max 65535 lady set has a max
options of only 255
now once the numeration you can only
pick one and with set you can pick many
it's got to remember that so integration
and set aren't always used so
they have their purpose so don't ignore
them but they're not always the best
option so watch my next video and we'll
be going on to some more bigger and
better things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
