Caleb's video maker - in this video we
are going to be going over signal are
sorry it's kind of the way there well
anyways this whole series is going to be
about signal are and trust me guys you
have got to watch this signal are is one
of the coolest things I have ever used
ever all right so what is signal arc
I'm going to throw out a bunch of big
words and then I'll break it down and
we'll kind of explain it a little bit
well basically signal are is a way to
allow us to create real time
applications over HTTP as many of you
probably already know HTTP is a standard
protocol used to communicate from the
client to the server it's used for
websites it's why you go to HTTP colon
slash slash whatever whatever if you
don't already know this HTTP is what's
known as stateless meaning you make a
request and you get a response you make
a request you get a response and the
server doesn't really remember anything
about the previous requests everything
is stateless and you have to figure out
ways to maintain this state such as
using cookies or whatever well with
signal are it changes that and allows us
to create real time applications now
real time what I mean by that is when
something happens on the server all the
clients are going to know immediately
this could be great for chat
applications video games automatic
updates of like news or stock market
prices anything like that that needs to
be updated automatically this will be a
great candidate now signal are can also
be used for phone apps and other things
like that but generally it's used for
asp.net web applications
now asp.net is the way we create
websites using the.net framework
hence the dotnet well what languages are
these well usually c-sharp or Visual
Basic this will be completely new
endeavor for us meaning my YouTube
channel because I've never done videos
over c-sharp but
that's the language we're going to be
using for the server side of things and
we'll be using some HTML CSS JavaScript
and the standard client-side garbage for
the client-side now if you don't know
these languages for example if you're
new to c-sharp it's no big deal because
over all the videos are not going to be
super challenging so you should be good
now let's just go a little bit more in
detail on how this works now when we're
talking web development everything is
split in half we have the client side
and the server side so let's just kind
of draw that out here over here we have
the server and over here we have the
client and there's a disconnect here
meaning there are two separate things
the only way they can communicate is
using an accepted protocol so in this
situation a client is any connected
device not a person right so if you have
a phone and you also have a laptop and
you go to a website on both of them you
would be two clients hopefully you
understand that because we're talking
clients as in devices not people so any
device that makes a request to the
server is known as a client so the way
this is done now is using HTTP so a
client makes a request to the server and
the server checks to see if it has
anything useful to send back and if it
does that's what it does it sends the
data back so you can you can see how
this works you go to your web browser
you put HTTP colon slash slash kalcker
com wait a couple seconds and the server
responds with more information and then
we're back to that disconnected stage
the only time it will send another
request is if we click on another link
or make some other kind of request to
the server signal our warps this a
little bit and now we can think of it as
a tunnel so we have a server and we have
a client and within between these two we
have a signal our tunnel and this is
what's known as an open connection or a
persistent connection by that I mean the
connection
days open and whenever the client wants
to send data to the server or make a
request it can just go right through the
signal art tunnel and the server can do
the same thing at the same time so we
have this bi-directional communication
between the two that's really all I have
to say in this video in the next video
we will be discussing a little bit more
about how signal are actually implements
this I mean I know you guys understand
how it works but what tools or
techniques to signal are use to make
this possible that's what we'll be
discussing in the next video so I will
see you then guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
