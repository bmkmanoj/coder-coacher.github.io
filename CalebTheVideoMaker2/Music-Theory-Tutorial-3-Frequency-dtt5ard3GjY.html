vibrates we get what is called frequency
I think you can read that
now frequency is measured in what we
call Hertz
her2 Zee because it's way cooler with
the Z not really this is the guy's name
Hertz and he figured out all this crap
so we measure in Hertz so if something
vibrates ten times in a second
that'd be ten positive and ten negative
because one is positive negative we
would say this thing has a frequency of
10 Hertz so Hertz is vibrations per
second it's that here oops
vibrations per second or cycles as in
it's not always vibrations when we're
talking about Hertz we can use this for
electricity and all these other kinds of
cool things so sometimes you can
consider it cycles rather than
vibrations but as for sound each one of
these wait and each one of these cycles
smells horrible and this wave one hurt
to her that isn't a second if we have
something that vibrates 30 times in a
second it would be said to vibrate at 30
Hertz Hz is short for hers on a keyboard
each one of these notes
has a different frequency it vibrates
differently that's why it creates a
different sound and we interpret it
differently so yeah that's all about
frequency see you in the next video the
forth music theory series in the music
theory series where we will be talking
about pitch which is very similar so see
you then and subscribe and follow me on
