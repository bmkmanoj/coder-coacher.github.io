absolute basics of PHP and all
programming concepts we're really going
to dive into PHP programming which is
awesome because this is exciting because
it's awesome so I know that made no
sense but now that we are ready to begin
programming we should take advantage of
that opportunity and begin programming
so the very first thing that we are
going to do is create an HTML form but
one thing I want you to realize is that
a lot of this is going to be HTML and I
don't want to explain every suit this
every little tiny thing in a lot of
detail but I'm going to explain it
generally you should be able to
understand it but if at any time you're
struggling you can check out my HTML
video series it's like 25 videos that
are real quick over HTML another thing
is as we begin to program in PHP we
can't just jump to the absolute very
in-depth PHP because a lot of it I'm
trying to introduce that's why this is a
series so as you go on I do not
absolutely do not remind your going to
get a manipulated view of what PHP
really is like because once we're done
we'll have to learn to validate forms
and all this so as we go and we're
learning the basics some of it is not
going to be secure and some of it is
going to be a very beginner version of
the professional code so just keep that
in mind as we're going that you may not
be a professional programmer just
because you know how to create an HTML
form and send it to a PHP script alright
so now that you have all that behind you
let's begin by creating this HTML form
so the very first thing I want to do is
create our doctype which basically just
tells the browser that we're working
with HTML and I want to save this file
we can just save it as index.html
alright then what we can do so we can
just open our HTML
clothes are HTML so this is how you open
and close HTML tags and then within here
we can put other HTML tags which
includes our head and my buttons marking
there we go
body and then we close the body so the
head is where we will put information
about our web page such as the title if
you want you can also put the engl the
language and the encoding but I'm not
really going to go through all that
right now so we just need to set the
title and this is going to be our home
page actually we're now let's make it
form because that's what we're creating
so this is going to be our form and then
once we're done with that we can just
close the head because we don't really
need it anymore
all right now we were working with the
body so it's in the body we're going to
create a form so to do that we say form
and then once we submit this form it is
going to go to an H PHP script so what
we do is we named that PHP script that
it's going to be sent to this is a file
that has not been created yet but we
will be getting into that in future
videos so basically this line are here
saying ok once this page is created and
you click submit we want it to be sent
to this page to be validated or checked
and put into a database or whatever else
and then we have a method so the method
is how the data gets sent and what you
want to put here for now is post if you
don't really know what that means don't
worry about it
just think we are going to be posting
this information to a PHP script
another method is get which we're not
going to be used using in this example
so just follow along with that right now
and then we're going to do is make a
field set and a legend and then we're
going to end our legend and then we're
going to end our field set
so to open it we don't have a little
/and to close it we have at /this is
going to make a very nice input box and
it will look good when we're done so
within the legend this is what the
inputs going to be called so we can say
enter your infor mation
subscribe yeah I got advertised you know
it's what I do
alright now everything is going to go
within this field set so we have a
legend and then we're also going to have
paragraphs so each each part of our form
is going to go within a separate
paragraph and we can create a label and
we can make that label have the value
name so then not just saying what comes
up next has the label name and then we
create an input type give it a name a
size a max length
and then we close the input so let me
just explain everything we just did
first we created a paragraph which we
will be closing in just a second then we
created a label what this label is going
to do is basically just give us label
for the input type or the input text box
so if you want to see how this works you
can go to you can go up to the top and
click run which is cut out of the screen
right now well you can just run it in a
program so you can also press ctrl alt
shift or for google chrome's what I'm
gonna use and this will come up looking
like this so if you're working with PHP
I told you already don't run it through
the file but since they're only working
with HTML right now that's perfectly
fine so this is what it looks like right
now the name is the label so you see the
label right here that's what it's going
to look like the other information the
type is text which gives us this kind of
box the name is name that's what's given
to PHP the size 30 characters long max
length is 50 what that means is once we
reach the end we can keep typing it's
just going to extend our box
so yeah that's what everything looks
like now and because label doesn't have
a closing tag we just close it right
here hopefully all is making sense and
so forth all right so what we need to do
now is we need to close our label
obviously I should put the forward slash
we're gonna close it and we should close
the paragraph so all of this information
within this label is connected to the
label name alright now that that is done
we have our first box which is named the
next thing that we want to do is we want
to have basically what our form is going
to look like is it's going to allow
people to enter their name and type in a
little comment and the comments going to
have two types either a question or a
suggestion so now we need to make what's
known as radio buttons
to do this so let's do that right now so
we have a paragraph tag and we can just
close it now and then we are going to
have a label and then we're going to
close the label so once you get into
HTML programming I like to close things
beforehand so I don't forget and then
within this label we have we have to put
a label for equals type and I'll be
explaining this in just a second and
then outside of the label we have to say
type of message we can put anything you
want here this is just what's going to
show up and then we end that label so
this is separate than like in this one
if you look up here you can see that the
input is within the label whoops but for
this one it's going to be outside of the
label that's because the radio buttons
there's multiple of them and we can't
just have them both within one label so
we need to put outside of the label we
say it's for type so it knows what radio
buttons to connect to all right so if
that didn't make any sense don't worry
about it just follow me input type
equals radio name equals type all right
then we give it a value and we can
basically the value is what gets sent to
the PHP script if we reference this so
we can make the first one s for
suggestion and we're going to put that
in a capital letter and then we end that
radio button and then we name it or put
the text on the actual HTML page input
suggestion so now if we look at what we
have we can run it in chrome and I'll
just show you what we have here so we
have interior information subscribe name
and then type of message so obviously
there's only one type of message here
all right so now we can make the other
radio button so to do this we create
another input
input type and if you guys want know
some cool if you just go to the line and
press control-d it's going to duplicate
the whole line and then we can change
what needs change so Q and this one's
going to be a question
oops question so now let's see what it
looks like Ron in chrome drives over
here and this is what we have right now
awesome so we're getting pretty close to
being finished all we really need to do
is add a comment section and a submit
button so to make a comments we just
make a paragraph and then we add a label
and this label is going to be comments
and then we have a text area which is
just a bigger area for you to type we're
going to name this comments then we can
assign how many rows it gets and how
many columns we get it gets and I think
I'm cutting some off somewhere zoom in a
little I guess I can't really columns
equals 50 and then we can end our text
area and then we can end our label
forgot it and those beforehand so now we
have all of that we can end our field
set the field set is going to be a
little black line around everything so
I'll show you what I mean if we just
launched this in Chrome I'll show you
over here we have the actual black line
around here that's the field set so if I
move the field set up here it would cut
out the comments alright so now that we
have that what we need to do is just
have a submit button so to do that we
can have a paragraph tag label and then
we can make it no sorry you would not
put the label word sorry I forgot that
we're done with labels so what we do is
have an input type equals submit
name equals submit and then value this
is what's actually going to show up on
the page submit and subscribe and I can
end that input type and then we can end
that paragraph so this is what we have
when we look at it when it's done we
have the name type of message comments
and a submit and subscribe and obviously
it doesn't work but it's cool-looking so
now let's do it just do a quick review
just for your information a lot of this
stuff is optional I just want to show
you to clear things up so for example
the rows and columns those aren't
necessarily necessary so if I go to this
page refresh after I save you can see it
still works it just doesn't look as cool
all right yeah so yeah so if you take
out let me just put all that back in
there so that's what some of the
optional things are and also the field
set is optional and so forth but I just
like the way it looks so yeah this is
the basics here's how it works we have a
we have a form and then within this we
have a field set and we have a legend
which has what the box is going to say
and then each thing is separated into
paragraphs so a paragraph paragraph
paragraph and then a paragraph the first
one has a label name and then within
this label we just put the information
about what we're submitting and then we
have the the actual radio buttons which
we put the label outside and then we
have these down here then we have a
paragraph for the comments right here we
end the fieldset and we have a paragraph
with the input type of submit so yeah
that's just the basics if it's too much
for you to understand right now don't
freak out a lot of what you'll be doing
you can just copy what I have here and
modify it as you go so obviously you can
know that if you want to change the
value of your submit let me just change
it there
and then when you look at your page it's
going to change the submit button so
yeah if you can just copy this and use
that as you go and if this is way too
easy for you sorry for boring you but
yeah that's all I have to say so
hopefully that was helpful and in the
next video we'll be getting into
something pretty cool so be sure to
subscribe thank you and goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
