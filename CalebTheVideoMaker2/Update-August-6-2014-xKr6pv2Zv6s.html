video maker too and this video i just
wanted to talk about some random stuff
just to share what's going on in my life
alright so first things first i have i'm
currently creating a database design
series right so i want you guys to kind
of help me know where to go from there
what i should make i want to focus on
some databasing stuff so whether it's
mysql again or if it's a different
relational database management system or
anything databasing just let me know
what you would would like to see that
would be beneficial to most people so uh
as for where I'm going I'm going to
finish this database design series get
into like all of the normal forms and
stuff and then we're going to do the
on-screen kind of education stuff
training stuff to illustrate how it kind
of works right so that's what I'm going
to do with that this should be I should
be finishing that up pretty soon and
I'll be saying that and if you haven't
noticed I've been trying to publish
videos every single week so I've been
doing good i've published a good amount
in this last month which is awesome so
thank you guys for the support i'm
reaching a lot more views on mom like at
39,000 a month right now which is like
super awesome this is my highest said
i've received that's in a 39 30 day
total 39,000 for my 30 day total which
means i'm getting over a thousand views
every day which is just amazing to thank
you for that the thing i want i want to
bring more attention to my SQL tutorial
number one which I've been sharing a lot
on Facebook and all my social networks
and stuff so what I want you guys to do
if you don't mind go to my SQL tutorial
1 and if you haven't watched that series
be sure to watch it take that video and
I want you to share that with your
friends by posting it to Facebook or
Twitter Google+ and also you can embed
it within your blog or web page if you
have one embed that on there what you
can do is take the link and send it to
me in a comment or on one of the social
networks and I might share that with
other people which will be good for you
and
me wait I want to bring more attention
to that that video is currently getting
around 40 100 views per month which is
awesome I guess per 30 days which is
awesome that's also an all-time high for
that it's gone from about 22,000 average
and I've brought with your guy's help
and with advertising I'm not paying for
any advertising but with all of your
help I brought that up to 40 100 per
month which is awesome and I want to get
that to around 10,000 which is just be
incredible another thing just reach 5000
subscribers so i'll probably make a cool
video about that i don't know what i'm
going to do yet or maybe i'll just post
this video who knows but i got 5000
subscribers so thank you guys so much
for that it's awesome really i'm getting
about 450 subscribers every 30 days
which is incredible I want to get that
up higher I'm not trying to be like oh
yeah I reached five thousand time to get
10,000 I am trying to kind of celebrate
how far we've all came but at the same
time I do want to strive for more so
let's let's try and get that to 10,000
and we'll see how quickly we can do that
so be sure to share with other people
the other thing is i have posted some
other of my courses on you to me if you
want to download or watch my videos add
3 you can go to you to me and you can
find my profile i'll put all the links
in the description or wherever you're
watching this i'll try to put the link
on there what you can do is you can go
there you can pay for the course like
nine dollars or something and i'll
probably put a coupon code in the
description and i'll explain that in a
minute but you can go there download my
courses and watch them ad free which is
awesome because i know some of you guys
don't like watching your my ads and you
don't like having to use the internet to
watch my stuff when I you can download
it and you can watch it anywhere you
want or use it for whatever you want you
can use it for presentations or if
you're teaching other people it doesn't
really matter to me yeah so as long as
you don't like resell it as your own or
upload it or something as your own well
then I'm pretty much cool with it so
that's that's what else is new i just
figured i'd post some update videos this
week just to kind of share what's going
on I want to get a better connection
with all of you people who watch my
videos so yeah be sure to keep
connecting with me and sharing what's
new with your YouTube channels or your
websites or businesses I also like to
know about what kind of projects you've
been up to with the programming or your
databasing whatever you're doing so let
me know about that and I don't really
have much else to say it's kind of a
short update video because I don't
really have much to update you with
besides the fact that i'm making a lot a
lot of content and you guys are watching
a lot a lot of content which is good so
my stuff's being watched I mean some
people might actually like my stuff if
you have suggestions I know a lot of
people don't like me the using the
chalkboard and stuff and then another
group of people don't like when i use on
screen tutorials so i want to know what
what to do for certain things if i'm
doing more in detail stuff rather than
conceptual stuff like ideas then i like
to do on screen stuff because you can
visually see it being done like
programming a database but if i'm
describing something like data types
well then I think that's easier to use
just a camera because I can talk control
things out I'm not limited to just
typing and presentations I don't wanna
have to go and make 50 powerpoints just
to make a series that be a little too
much yeah I've been trying to do a
little bit more with my youtube channel
I've been typing short descriptions for
each of my videos and been sharing them
to all my social networks and I want to
someday implement mmm captioning because
I haven't done any of that really so
that'd be cool yeah so let me go let me
know how everything's going with you
guys and be sure to leave a comment just
quick review just check out my new
database design series let me know how
that's going and what you want to see
next check out my SQL tutorial 1 share
that with a bunch of people if you want
you can share it with your classroom if
you go to a
computer school or if you have computer
classes feel free to share that with the
instructor or I'll share them with the
class somehow share up to you networks
tell people help me get that to around I
want to get at least 5000 views every 30
days but let's try get that to 10,000
the other thing check on my you Demi
courses I'll post the links in the
description because if you use a my
coupon codes I get a one hundred percent
of the revenue share i believe so that's
better than buying it just going
searching my name and finding my course
because then you to me gets I think
fifty percent which means I get less
money so i recommend you use the coupon
codes and probably be cheaper for you so
that's all i have to say today see you
guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
