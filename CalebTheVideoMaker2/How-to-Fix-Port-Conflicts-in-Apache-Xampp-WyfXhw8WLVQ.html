I wanted to talk about port conflicts With
Xampp so a lot of people keep asking me cause
i've used xampp in my videos a lot of people
ask me about this problem were it won't let
them start Apache and it will say something
such as &quot;starting Apache&quot; and then it will
be busy dot dot dot and nothing happens well
this is usually a problem with the ports so
if you look here it says port eighty(80) port
443 well port 80 and we'll get into what a
port is in a second basically port 80 is often
used by other programs and only one program
is going to have access for complete control
of port 80 so for example if I have heres
my website here its hosted on local host well
I'm communicating to this localhost through
port 80 I'll draw you a little picture here
to make that clear so you could say this is
our web browser this is our local server we
communicate using port 80 so we could say
Google chrome for example and then we have
port 80 and then we have xampp so we communicate
through port 80 theres a lot of different
ports that are used for communications port
443 is another well for web servers 80 is
the main port well to test things on our system
occasionally we'll need to change this port
to allow us to run multiple things at the
same time were they would normally conflict
so to do this we want to open up our computer
and go to place where you would installed
xampp mine is on my second partition xampp
yours is probably c xampp but we'll just dig
this for right now Xampp and then from here
we go to Apache and then look for the configuration
folder or conf then from here we look for
httpd.conf this is a configuration file now
you can double click this and you can select
a program from a list of installed programs
to open it you want a text editor such as
wordpad or anything like that but I'm going
to use edit with notepad ++ cause it's the
best It's pretty legit alright so this is
what we get here just a bunch of junk well
what we need to look for is not too far down
mine is on line 58 you can see it's using
port 80 well we can change this to let's say
82 and then we can save it by file save and
then we can close out of it now we want to
stop the Apache and stop the system and well
restart it and it should work if it's not
working that means there's a different problem
and its not a conflict of port 80 so you can
see its using port 82 right now so that means
when we use a web browser and we go to local
host its not going to work now you can see
it doesn't come up with the same thing and
see &quot;oops Google chrome could not connect
to it&quot; and it doesn't know what to do. so
in order to connect to the proper host we
put a colon and then an 82 and press enter
now this is telling to communicate to localhost
through port 82 so that colon 82 that whole
system right there is actually always in use
its just not always visible for example normally
we just type localhost and we actually have
localhost:80 but that's hidden so we can use
other websites such as google.com and communicate
to it via port 80 and it is hidden that's
just a way to represent the port so if you
have a different file on this server it would
be after the 82 so it can be like registration
.php so that is how you would work with your
server alright well that's all for this video
be sure to subscribe and yeah that's all oh
yeah!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
