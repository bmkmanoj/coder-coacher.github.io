Caleb the video maker - and I am going
to be doing a miniature series over
MySQL stored routines just so you guys
get an idea about what the series is
going to be like I'm just going to try
and do a video by video I have a rough
outline of what I want to do but I'm not
planning every single video out so we'll
see how this series goes if I make ten
videos and I have some more ideas I
might throw some more in there the level
of difficulty for the series is beginner
it's basically a continuation of my 67
part MySQL series and we're just going
to continue where we left off go over
some more topics but it's all going to
be introductory level so to get started
what is a routine well if you think of
the word routine and we're not talking
computer science here a routine is
something you do continually you wake up
and you have a routine for your day well
it's very similar in MySQL with MySQL
you can make a routine and then you can
call that routine multiple times so let
me just illustrate this with some boxes
also I just thought I'd show you guys my
sweet decal on my dad drew this all
right so let's say this is a routine and
you have a bunch of code in there and
you want to execute that number a number
of times like it might calculate
something or it might be some kind of
algorithm or something like that and you
have a couple of options first every
time you need to run that algorithm you
could just write it out yourself and
then you have to memorize all that code
or go reference the file where you saved
it and then once you need it again in
the future you could write it out again
and clearly you could see where this is
a problem because you have a lot of
repeated code and you have to memorize a
lot of things and it makes your life as
a programmer a database developer or
database administrator a lot harder so
an alternative is to just have one
routine and then whenever you need to
execute this stuff you just reference it
and you call it you invoke it there's a
bunch of different words you could use
for that and then if you need you can
pass some data in so let's say this is
an algorithm
of like calculating a discount or
something stupid I don't know well you
could you could pass in the price so
let's say pass in $100 and then the
stored procedure does the magical
calculations and then you get the new
discounted price that's just an example
and we'll be getting into the details of
the different kinds of stored procedures
and all that good stuff
so hopefully you guys are excited I'm
excited as you go through this course
you're going to get a rough overview of
all of this stuff I'm not going to go
super in-depth we're not going to make
this reference material really this is
more for education sake so by the end of
this series this little miniature series
you're going to have a rough idea what
all these things are and it's going to
help empower you and your database
development but it's not going to make
you an expert this is to get your hands
dirty gets you started on store routines
functions variables and some more
programming like things like procedural
programming and all that good stuff with
MySQL so continuing the 67 part series
that everybody loves this is the next
level a little bit more difficult stuff
we'll see how it goes and let me know
what you guys think of this series and
if you have any suggestions for videos
leave them in the comments because I'm
kind of open for ideas so thanks guys
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
