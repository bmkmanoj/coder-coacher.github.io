going to be a quick video right before
we start diving into specific database
concepts this is more of a general idea
of database design so this video we're
going to talk about okay what is
database design I mean we talked about
what's a database when it really talked
about database design why do we have to
design a database
what what's so special about it that it
needs design it's not like we're
building a house or something well in a
way it's it's kind of like that it's
we're building schematics to build the
best database how do you measure whether
a database is good or bad well it has to
do with data integrity which we'll talk
about that in more depth in an upcoming
video so data integrity is basically
where all of your data is correct it's
up to date there's no disconnected data
for example if we have two tables and
for some reason these tables are
connected in some way well if if for
some reason is link breaks well then
when this table updates this table gets
left behind and then the data becomes
incorrect that's a data integrity
problem because the data is not managed
properly so if a good designed database
we prevent data integrity issues so all
of our data is up-to-date we don't have
we don't have repeating data we don't
have old data that should not be in
there which I if for example like if you
have a database you can store lots of
information from like long ago and
that's fine but you don't want data that
has recently changed and it hasn't
changed in the update so you want the
database to always be up-to-date unless
for some reason you're storing like an
archives let's say you have a store and
you want to store an archive of every
single order you've ever made or sold or
whatever well then you can store all
that in a database and that doesn't
really need updated because it's an
archive but if you have if you have a
customer
are in your database and the address is
out-of-date and doesn't update well then
you have a problem another example is if
the person up has four so if your
database is designed badly and you have
repeating data well then one example of
the data can update and the other ones
left behind so now you have like two
addresses for one person which should
just be one address that's another
example of a data integrity problem so
we'll be getting into like specific
cases of data integrity problems as we
go on but when we talk about data design
database design as a whole people
usually break it up into three sections
two or three it just kind of depends on
like what people mean it it varies from
person to person so okay first we have
the conceptual and then we have the
logical and then we have the physical
all right these are all known as schemas
or schemas whatever you however you want
to pronounce it but uh that's this
alright so we have the conceptual schema
the logical schema in the physical
schema a schema or just think of a
schematic like when you're building
something it just tells you the way the
data is structured the conceptual this
up here is when we're just kind of
thinking about things how things are
related we don't think of limitations as
in oh we're not going to be able to do
that because we only have this much
availability or something this is kind
of like unlimited brainstorming phase
and as we move down this is more
specific to where we say okay this is
how we're going to program our database
so up here this up here is more general
this down here is more specific once you
get down here you have to start worrying
about all right what kind of relational
database management system am I going to
use but when you're up here you can just
kind of think of general concepts how
data is related so the farther you go
down to the physical the more specific
things get I mean that's pretty obvious
so rather rather than thinking of it
like three steps I kind of think of it
as a continuum we are taking our general
ideas and moving them to specific
implementations hopefully that makes
sense but basically one file we talk
about these individually the conceptual
just talks about how data is related
because in a relational database
management system we have relationships
between tables if you think of we have a
user's table and then we have a sales
table and these users can go to this
website and buy products but that's our
example here it can be anything but this
is just an example well every single
sale has to be bought by someone
specifically one user so that means
there's a connection between the user
and the sale so we have this connection
here that is part of the conceptual
design we say this table the sales
depends on the user so that's that's
because with without a user we can't
have a sale because there's no one to
buy the stuff and a user doesn't doesn't
necessarily have to have a sale so it's
dependent this way that would be the
parent and that would be the child
hopefully that makes sense when we get
to the logical we start planning out our
table structure so we have all these
relationships between data well then we
can realize all right we have
specifically a user's table and we have
X number of columns the user
name the password the ID the address the
phone number the credit card information
if that's something you need to store
anything like that then we have another
table and it is the the CEMP so we have
the sales table so we have user the user
table and then we have the sale table
and then this this is connected in
someone so we have a user can but have
multiple sales and a sale can only have
one user that's a logical database
design because we're actually
structuring our columns are data types
our relationship for drawing those out
so we have this logical drawing or
schema the physical that is when we
start actually implementing that into a
database so when we're talking about
just designing and we're not actually
creating the database the physical
design would be figuring out what
relational database management system
will work best what are our table types
what what server are we going to store
this on how are people going to access
this is it going to be over the Internet
it's going to be over computers programs
so usually a database will be on a
server and this will be accessed by
multiple different people that's because
the database is like the core of all
data for example if we only have this
one person using the data well then we
wouldn't need this huge database we
could just store that information on
their computer because they're the only
one on there it doesn't even make sense
so typically everything's kind of
accessed on a server so the physical
would be okay what kind of server we're
using how are people going to access our
data is it going to use a web form dude
is that something we need to program and
then when you physically implement that
is that that's when you actually program
the database build the web form or
whatever you are doing
installing the server and
thing building the users who who is
going to access it
the views what are the different views
going to be what data is going to be
returned and so forth this is also when
you really focus on security because
logically when we're in the logical
phase we're still kind of thinking okay
no one's going to try and break it no
everyone's going to use the database
correctly but in the real world that
doesn't work out that way people either
they try to break things or they just
don't know what they're doing or there's
errors or there's incorrect data well
that's when somewhere along this
continuum right here is when we need to
start worrying about security we don't
want people breaking into our database
and we don't want our database to fall
apart and have data integrity issues so
hopefully that clears some things up so
the database design does some things up
real quick
database design is using skills that you
know to build a database that is not
going to have data integrity issues
update anomalies we'll talk about those
too but that's basically when for some
reason you're storing two of the same
data like if if my address is on in the
database twice well that's a problem
because when I update my address only
one may update for example and now the
address says I live in two different
places that's that's wrong so a database
design is a method to separate
information over multiple tables rather
than having one huge table like this
where I store my address we store our
sales we store our our customers we
store our our favorite video games we
store our relationships with oh yeah you
get so basically this is a bad design
because it's all in one table and when
what I have to
date it so we have let's just say this
is a row right and I have the columns
are ID and username and then we have us
gonna need to be a little bigger and
then we have username we have address
let's go phone number it's easier phone
and then we have favorite color when we
store like this well if we need to put a
new favorite color we have the ID 7
that's me
we have the username Caleb curry we have
the phone number 1-800 but the table
favorite color camo and then if I want
to put a new favorite color in well we
can't because we don't want to we
already put one in there so we need to
create a new row save 7 Caleb curry
dotted on the 100 I thought the hot and
then favorite color 3 no no all right
well now we have all those duplicate
data we have this in here twice do this
in here twice we have this in here twice
and we have we have to have two rows for
favorite color so you have to find a
solution to this problem but now if I
decided to update my phone number
because I got a new phone number
well now I'll update it and I'll change
it to 1 2 3 4 5 6 79 whatever it is well
now I updated my phone number but for
some reason we have a data integrity
issue because my phone number is in here
two different ways that that's a bad
database design and in this series we're
going to be talking about fixing
problems like that
and the best way to do this would be to
like separated into multiple tables plus
you probably don't need a store your
favorite color unless you're running
some kind of like Ark website or build
business so it's possible but
we can do the same thing with like
orders how many orders if I had to put
my orders in that table which is another
bad idea we have the same data integrity
issues so this series is going to talk
you through getting rid of those data
integrity issues so you have the best
database design for best performance
