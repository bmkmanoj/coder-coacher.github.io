going to be discussing the second normal
form so in order to put things in second
normal form
they must already be in first normal
form so check out the video I made right
before this one before you come and
watch this one now second normal form
deals deals with what's known as a
partial dependency
that's when a column only depends on
part of the primary key so in order for
it to depend on only part of it
you have to have a compound or composite
key so basically the primary key has to
be multiple columns because think if you
just have one column as the primary key
it call them can't partially depend on
half of it that kind of makes sense I
don't know maybe not let's say we just
have a random table for people so we
have you know the person's let's go with
let's go let's just use a person ID and
we have some attributes about this
person we have their name you know maybe
their phone or their pH level and maybe
their email let's first talk about what
a dependency is before we go and talk
about partial dependencies these columns
depend upon the primary key so in this
case this is the primary key and there's
a dependency here another way you can
think about it is if we have another
table about cars we can have a car ID
which salsa a surrogate key now this
person's name if it does not have a
dependency here you can see this name is
only dependent on the person ID not upon
the car so this doesn't make any sense
here another thing is that the person ID
doesn't have an unrelated entity or an
unrelated attribute about the car ID so
such as the car color
the car color has a dependency on the
car not the person this isn't going to
make any sense
that's what a dependency is now what is
a partial dependency so let's see what a
partial dependency looks like using
surrogate keys you'll see this when you
have a many-to-many relationship
broken up with an intermediary table
which is the correct way to design a
many-to-many relationship so let's think
of the example of books and authors
because if you think about it one author
can write many books and one book can be
written by many authors so conceptually
it's a many-to-many relationship but
we're going to store that in the
database as one-to-many relationship on
one side and then one-to-many
relationship on the other side and so we
get this look at the table intermediary
table and then the table so over here
let's put the authors so this is the
author date for that over here we have
the book this is the book table and then
in between we have the intermediate
intermediary table of book authors or
book author so this is the correct way
to design it now when it comes to
attributes all the attributes about the
author are going to go over here all the
attributes about the book are going to
go over here and all the attributes that
have to do with both the app the book
and the authors connected those will go
in this table
so first let's give them some surrogate
keys we'll give this one an author ID
and give this one a book ID and this
one's going to have two foreign keys of
the author ID and the book ID and those
foreign keys together will be the key
for this table so that's kind of how you
would set this up now things about the
author go over here so you know their
first name maybe their last name maybe
their birthdate whatever you want to put
about the author the book would have
stuff about you know the ISBN which is
the ISBN is the code on the back of the
book you can look up it tries to
uniquely define that book so the exact
Edition and everything else so you can
just use that to define it you know we
would maybe have the page numbers or the
publisher the publisher could be a
primary key or a foreign key to another
publisher table or you could just have
it in that table if if that's how it
worked but likely to go to another table
but we're going off topic anyways it
would look something like this
so author information goes over here
book information goes over here this is
the correct way to design this table
because when it comes to dependency the
first name of the author has only to do
with the author and it has to do all
about the author now let's look at
things that have to do with both the
book and the author we could have
something such as the author position
now what that is when when you write
books often there's a person who has
like the first author position which is
what the big name is and then you have
the second in the third and the fourth
people often compete to try to get first
author this has to do with both the book
and the author because if you think
about it if we put author position here
that's going to pend on what book we're
talking about we can't just put author
position one and say he's first on every
single book he ever is going to write
that doesn't make sense we came to say
author position one on the book because
it doesn't say which author were talking
about which author
one it doesn't make sense that's why we
have to have it in this table because it
has to do with the book and the author
so we could say book ID is 17 author ID
is 22 and the author position is 1 so
that would say the book with the idea of
seventeen and the author with the ID of
22 is in the second or the first
position on that book it's a little
complicated but we combine that with
joins to make it make more sense for the
actual viewing of the data but anyways
this relies on the book and the author
ID that's why it's in this table this is
correct now an incorrect thing would be
something like the ISBN because the ISBN
has to do with the book only so when you
look at this
it relies upon the book ID it has a
dependency on the book ID but it doesn't
have a dependency on the author ID this
is an example of a partial dependency
now the correct way to fix this in this
case which is to be say guys be n and
put it in the book table which we
obviously already did because I put that
in there first when we started but if
you didn't have this table when you're
working with just say like one table
maybe well then the correct way to do it
is to take the book ID the ISBN dragged
them to another table and then use a
foreign key to connect to that table
which we already have it structured
correctly because we understood how to
design that many-to-many relationship
which is why relationships are useful to
understand what if you don't have it
already set up correctly you'll have to
take the partial dependency and move it
to another table and reference it with a
foreign key for second normal form you
want to first be in first normal form
and second remove all partial
dependencies by moving the columns as we
did here we took that ISBN put in the
correct table now another thing you can
think about is if you have a table where
there's a primary key of only one column
you're already in second normal form for
that like imagine it for this how can
birthday be dependent on only part of
the primary key which is author ID
because there's only one you can't you
can't depend on only part of an
individual column does that make sense
hopefully it does I don't know why I
even asked you guys that like does that
make sense it's like you're watching
like a little kids show yeah so yeah
peace out guys thank you for watching
I'll see you in the third normal form
