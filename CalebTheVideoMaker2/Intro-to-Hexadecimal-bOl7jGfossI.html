introduction to hexadecimal so this
video I do recommend you watch
introduction to binary I did that a
couple months ago you can find that in
my computer science /i t playlist on my
channel so I'm going to be voting off a
lot of fundamentals for that so first we
are going to look at the decimal system
so then we can figure out how the
hexadecimal system works but first let
me define what X decimal is hexadecimal
is a numbering system with a radix or a
base of 16 so decimal is a base of 10
deci or deci is based off 10 hexadecimal
is 16 so that means we have 16 different
symbols all right so let's compare the
hexadecimal system to the binary system
over here we're I'm not binary sorry to
the decimal system so over here we're
going to have decimal which is just the
normal system that you use for everyday
calculations and over here we have X
alright so that's my dog's name by the
way X anyways over here zero is equal to
zero and x one 1 two 2 three 3 four 4
five 5 six 6 seven 7 eight 8 nine 9 all
of these are equivalent so if you see a
four and hexadecimal it is a fork and
equivalent in decimal so what next well
a decimal and hexadecimal this is base
10 so that means we're only had going to
have ten different symbols 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8
ten after that we restart and go to a
double digit number over here though
we're actually going to have another
symbol so ten and a or equal this is ten
and Exodus hopefully you watch that
binary video because I'm going to go a
little faster so not to re-explain
everything this should make some sense
11 is b12 c-13 D 14 C and 15 is F so you
can have 15 different symbols 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
alright so how exactly does hexadecimal
work I'm just going to just man I guess
when we're working with decimal not exa
decimal everything is a power of 10 so
when you have a number such as 1 to 1
here's what's actually happening we're
having 1 times 10 to the 0 with 2 times
10 to the first and then 1 times 10 to
the third
this is decimal ok all right so this is
times 10 to the 0 with because we
haven't reached the tenth power the
tenth slop yet the 10th space
all right so 1 times 10 to the 0 s is
equal to 1/2 times 10 to the first is
equal to 21 times 10 to the third is
equal to 100 then when you add these
together you get 121 nice how the system
works well hexadecimal works in a
similar way but now it's what 6
rather than 10 so if you have something
such as this F F well this would be 15
times 16 is 0th power this would be 15
times 16 to the first power so what's
this equal to this is equal to 15 you
can use a calculator if that's necessary
this is equal to 16000 to beat 240 that
one you may need a calculator for and
when you add these together you get 255
so this is equal to 255 in decimal now
if we change this such as we used at
five
well then instead of 15 times 16 we
would use 5 times 16 which would only
give us 5 which would change our final
answer to 245 so that is how we can
convert from decimal up to I'm sorry
from hexadecimal to decimal if necessary
computers work with pure binary they
don't work with decimal or hexadecimal
only we work with hexadecimal the reason
we do this is because if we see
something like this we aren't going to
be able to comprehend that very easily
so we would convert this into whatever
it is I don't really know just whatever
the decimal equivalent would be well if
we're thinking about layering heck on
binary it would be the absolute lowest
because that's what the computers work
with so this is where the computers are
working up here we have decimal
which we work with all right now
hexadecimal is somewhere in between so
we could say this is hexadecimal one and
this is a closer communication to binary
than decimal is so I personally think
it's easier to translate from binary to
hexadecimal or hexadecimal to binary
rather than converting binary to decimal
or decimal to binary it is a better
system to use and I will show you why
right now so hexadecimal represents four
binary digits very easily so for example
here we have a range of numbers all the
way from 1 all the way down to 15 well
since there's 15 different symbols
sit up sorry 16 different symbols in
hexadecimal we can represent up to the
number 15 16 includes 0 alright so that
means if we are using decimal we would
have to overlap and use 11 12 13 14
which would either be one or two digits
depending on where we're at so for
example let me write some of these out
if we are using decimal we would use 0 1
2 3 and then when we get to the larger
numbers we would have to use numbers
like 15 and that's not as convenient but
if we're using hexadecimal we can
represent all possibilities with purely
hex so let's let's try
so here we can represent all of these
four combinations of binary with
hexadecimal 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
13 14 15 now
that means when we have a huge large
strand of DVD we can convert that to
hexadecimal extremely extremely easily
let me show you this in action
I probably shouldn't kept these up here
Oh
all right let's try let's go with all
right so now we have this huge binary
number and if we are working with this
it's not going to be super easy to work
with unless we convert it to decimal or
hexadecimal
so with hexadecimal we can first break
these up into groups of four and then we
can convert these to hexadecimal so I
have this little conversion chart here
which we'll be looking at but right off
we can look at these and say 1 1 1 1
well that's the most you can store there
it's 15 you look at this chart 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 is equal to F or 15 0 0 1 0 is equal
to 2 we're going
decimal first 0 0 0 1 is equal to 1 1 1
0 1 is equal to D which would be 10 11
12 13 now if we're storing for throwing
this in decimal combining these is not
going to work because then we would get
3 1 third 1 3 1 2 1 5 which this would
assume that you would then break this up
into 5 1 2 1 3 &amp;amp; 1
and then you would then convert these to
the 4 digit binary parts which I'm not
actually going to do and just just
showing you what I mean
and then you once you have them all
figured out you combine it together you
get a number that's not actually
accurate to the correct number but if
you're working with hexadecimal you
don't have this problem because 15th be
represented as f2 represented s2 miss
can resolve this actually 1 is
represented as 1 13 would be on a is 10
11 is b12 is C 13 is D so now we get D 1
to F once you have this if you have this
and you want to convert it to binary you
can easily break these up into their
four digit binary parts and you would
actually get an accurate number which
would be equal to what we started with
so that's why hexadecimal is actually a
better method from converting from
binary to hexadecimal and decimal to
binary so when we want to work with
binary but not directly we can actually
use hexadecimal so give some examples of
that for example we're working with CSS
the color of webpage is basically you
can give it a hexadecimal number so you
could say and what what does this even
represent well this is a red green blue
value red green blue has a range from 0
to 255 for every single color 0 255
0-255 so that means if you want a lot of
red you make it 255 if you only want a
little bit of green you make it like 100
so if you want no blue you would then
give it zero and then what you do is you
can mix those three together and you get
your final color so yeah what an easier
way to do this rather than giving red
green blue values with decimal like that
we can give it hexadecimal because this
FF is the number that can represent 255
so from the range 0 0 2 FF we can get
255 as the maximum possible number all
right so what would this be well this is
breaking up and doing red green blue so
this will be 255 red of 0 green and 0
blue so the final color would be
completely red there's that's just an
example of how another way hexadecimal
is used another is in a location of ram
and memory another is sometimes in URLs
there are a lot of uses of hexadecimal
because we can easily convert it to
binary and so forth and once you get
used to it it's easy to work with so
basically if you got nothing from this
video all what you remember is that
hexadecimal is base 16 that means
there's 16 different symbols 0 through F
ah it can easily convert groups of 4 and
binary to hexadecimal all the way from 0
0 0 0 up to 1 1 1 1 and then that can
easily be converted back
that's what else you can easily remember
the order of the the symbols because it
matches the decimal system then once you
reach 10 it goes to the alphabet system
so zero this is decimal this is
hexadecimal 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 13 14
15 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 and 15
so as you can see we can represent 15 up
to 15 with all the symbols available in
hexadecimal so yeah that's just the
basics of hexadecimal I'm sure you can
get into a lot of lots of more of
hexadecimal junk but I just wanted to
give you the basic understanding of how
it works another thing that you may run
across is octal which has a base weight
and we may be getting into that in a
future video that can represent groups
of three binary digits all right so
that's a lot to say in this video if it
