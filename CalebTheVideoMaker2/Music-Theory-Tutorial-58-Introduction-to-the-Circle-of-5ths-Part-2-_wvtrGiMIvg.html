d which is the next one in our fifth
cycle had to and it was f c then we had
a which had f c let's after see g.i
Thank You G and then e which has f c g d
then we had um oh shoot is art d which
ad f c g d and a and then we had what
was after be oh my god f sharp sorry f
sharp which add an f c g d a and n E so
basically this is what notes we sharp so
if we're in the key of B I'll show you
we're going to sharp FCG DNA it's really
easy actually be up to C sharp because
we sharp see the next note would be D to
B sharpie yes we do do we sharp II know
do a sharp F yes doing sharp G yes three
sharp a yes so it's very simple
so thats told us how to easily make the
BG major scale and how many sharps and
flats were within the scale well I'm all
red again alright so that's all cool so
I like it it's very easy to remember so
we start with C and then we go to G and
then D and the E and B then F sharp then
we finally have C sharp which ad f c g d
and e and b now there's really easy to
remember this we start on C we go fifth
from C which is a G now the next number
I mean letter sorry we go start from C
and go up one C to D one up from d a b c
d e f oh then what look at this g a b c
all i have to remember is the sharps for
the f sharp and C so that's an easy way
to remember it c d e F sharp G a B C
sharp it just skips every other letter
so it kind of interlocks them so we have
c d e F sharp G a and B then we just
kind of like push them in with each
other so this goes up here here here
here hopefully that makes sense calling
on it's hard to explain my thoughts I
think really weird so how can we
remember this well all we know is that
it starts on F followed by a seat what
comes after F and G what comes after see
addy what comes after G and then what
comes after D and F that's like one
before so it goes f same content we
start with two letters F and C then we
take the next one of those two letters
full so we augment F to G and we augment
c to d i'm at g
to a so FCG da e points back to e I mean
to D which points back to see a points
back to see G which points back to F so
it's all like this pattern and if you
can't remember that just think of the
space between these so f to see one two
three four five six seven it's also a
perfect fit so that will be the sharp
notes within that key signature okay now
that that all is gone out my brain in
into your camera of my camera probably
didn't make any sense let's take a quick
look at the flat side we have we have F
F be e ad or bead that's a really easy
to remove that DG see we start on to be
so the first flat a note of F is a be so
that means this one has to be this one
has to be slotted bees fly to be fly to
be flatted be capitalized this is you
don't get them confused with the flat
side cool so the next one in the
sequence is e so II what comes after
that um that means all these have ease
with them then the next one is a then B
obsession color
d and then we have G C and then I think
so this is actually be GCF which is
weird because here we have FB GC so this
is the distance between the notes is
still the same it's just offset so if we
have three flats in our key signature
one two three we should know it's a flat
major scale so if we learn our scales we
know how to play the song without having
to figure out exactly where to press we
just learned that be e and a needs
flatted so rather than playing be I'm
going to play B flat a flat and E flat
makes things easier for me as a musician
makes things easier as writers because
they do not need to add all them extra
sharps and flats then you just put in
the key signature all right
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
