Caleb's video maker - and this video I
already recorded it once with the audio
but it screwed up and made a big mess
so rather than redoing it I just decided
to take a couple screenshots from the
video and talk about them so the first
picture we can see I showed off my old
version of phpMyAdmin but that's fine it
doesn't really matter for most purposes
and yeah so I was on page p.m. in my
admin and then I went on to show off my
view count on YouTube because that's
very large number in one day I was
pretty proud so yeah let's make that
even bigger so then I'll be happy then
what I did was I created my database
Bank which will hold both of our tables
and one of the tables were the user the
member information and then the bank
account information so the first thing
we made the member information so we
have member info we have all the columns
member ID which is the primary key we
have this set to auto increment because
it'll raise up on each time without us
having to type in that specific number
and then we have first name which is
varchar' variable character length
because everybody's first name can be
different length last name same concept
phone we have it set to char because all
phone numbers are 10 characters and we
set a default that way we could have it
set to not null because we could have
done is left it available to be null but
if we require a phone number we'll get
more responses and even if they don't
put a phone number it'll be set to zero
which will help boost performance and
then we have a pass or password which is
char 40 the the reason it's 40
characters and not varchar' is because
we're actually going to use the sha-1
hashing function which will give us a 40
digit 40 character representation of our
original entry
we had state fire chart 20 city varchar'
40 zip code char 5 because all zip codes
are 5 characters and then we added
address which is basically just the
street address now the primary key as we
set as you can see this is called an
index it indexes the member ID and the
type of index is primary key that way
MySQL knows what primary key - it is for
this table now the engine is in ODB and
if you remember that will allow for
transactions and foreign key constraints
sweet so next thing I did was I moved on
to create my next table bank account
info that's what ba stands for which had
account ID which is in this table this
was the primary key and this will
basically just have an ID for each
account and it's set to auto increment
for the same reason I just said no
because it'll go up by itself Auto
incremented account holder ID this is a
foreign key and basically we have it set
to represent the same information in the
other table because if we want to match
up right you don't want this one to be
something else when the other ones
something else so if we go back to the
other photo we can see that it's also an
integer so then we have an amount which
is a decimal with in parenthesis 10
comma 2 this means it's counting in base
10 which is how we count and 2 is how
many decimal places after the decimal so
this will allow for sense such as 10 50
rather than 10 point 500 you see what
I'm saying and passcode is var binary 16
the reason for this is we're going to
use our AES encrypt function which gives
us a 16 character binary data that's why
it's var binary primary key is the
account ID in the foreign key account
holder ID references member info member
ID because they're both the same
information now we could say we could
give it conditions on what to do if
there's a mess up but we don't have to
do that because there's a default so I'm
pretty sure they'll just give us an
error if we try and delete the mother
member ID hope that makes sense
and if you haven't noticed everything is
set to not null because we don't want
any no information and there's nothing
that we'll need no information at the
moment for example when we had phone
number that one was questionable but I
decided to give it a default then I
moved on and inserted a value into our
table person now if you remember we
could have said what columns to insert
the information into that would have
allowed us to ignore the one because it
would no because it's auto increment
remember and one is the first number so
it would auto increment up to one or
zero I'm not too sure I think one so
yeah so instead I decided to just put
one in there to save some typing and you
can see the columns over on the side
that's what lineup though so the first
one is member ID
and Caleb is my first name last name
this is phone password with the function
sha-1 blah blah blah blah that's pretty
sweet yeah and then what I did was I
created information in the other table
which was inserting the bank account
info the values one which was the
primary key so the first bank account
and then also the next one represents
the first person which because it's a
primary key which points back to the ID
number one which was Caleb curry in the
other table AES encrypt the first thing
is food that is what we are encrypting
and we also have a salt which is salt is
good because that's what we use to
encrypt it's sort of like a little key
to figure out what's going on so then I
inserted that stuff and then I selected
the account ID
holder ID the amount and then when I
used as a EES decrypt and the column was
passcode if you remember and then what
was the salt salt is good from the table
bank account info then what I did was I
selected it and it will show us that the
result is food for the AES decrypt and
it's the account ID 1 Caleb Caleb curry
I mean sorry first account account
holder would be Caleb curry now if we
change to the salt which is salt it's
good
I just conveniently named that you can
name it whatever you want it will give
us so as you can see I changed it and
then it'll give us a different result as
you can see I put salt is good with 2 DS
and the result is null so you will not
be able to figure it out without the
proper salt so that's pretty much all I
have to say in this video and I hope you
learned a little bit more or kind of see
the pieces fall together and in the next
video I will be speaking of aggregate
functions I think I don't know but
you'll just have to see and it's gonna
be awesome so I'll see you there thank
you for watching and subscribe my name
is Caleb curry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
