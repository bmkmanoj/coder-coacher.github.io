in your database clustering series this
video we are going to be running some
commands inside of this desktop and also
setting up a couple other virtual
machines so we can use them as nodes for
our database cluster so the very first
thing we're going to want to do is
right-click and click open terminal now
that this is open we want to pin that to
the launcher so just click lock to
launcher now when we X out of it you can
open it very easily just by clicking it
right there
I guess that's not saving a whole lot of
effort rather than just right clicking
and clicking new terminal but it
actually does save you one click
so that's conserved energy for other
uses so you're welcome now when you open
this for the first time you can see it
says to run a command as administrator
user root use sudo so sudo is a way to
run one command as the super user or the
administrator essentially before we
start doing stuff we want to make sure
everything we have is up to date so we
are going to do that by saying sudo
apt-get update and then once that is
done running you can use a semicolon to
give another command and say sudo
apt-get upgrade so click enter type in
your password and this might take a
couple minutes so just be patient
yes and that just finished which is
great there's one more thing I wanted to
do before I clone this virtual machine
and that is I want to set this up for
SSH which is something we are going to
be doing later the software that we're
going to be using needs SSH access to
all of the nodes in the cluster and it
will also need SSH access to itself
which we'll get into that soon but for
now I just want to set up the SSH server
so to do that we're just going to type
sudo apt-get install open is H - server
type in your password
yes and there we go now I would say that
this machine is in the state to start
cloning it into the other nodes so what
we're going to do is use X out of that
and we can shut down open VirtualBox
again and before we clone this thing
there is one last thing we need to do
and that has to do with the way
VirtualBox is set up so our actual
virtual machine is good but there's one
thing we need to do inside of VirtualBox
and that is setting up this thing to be
on a particular type of network so if
you right click it and click settings
and then you go to network these are
where the network settings for this
virtual machine are set this n80 is not
going to work exactly for what we want
so what we're going to do is actually
add another adapter and click enable
network adapter essentially what we're
trying to do is make it so that once we
have multiple nodes we want them to be
able to communicate with each other on
the same network to do that you want to
click this drop-down and click host-only
adapter and then we can select what
network we want it to be on and I think
this VBox net 0 is on by default and
then you can click ok now we are ready
to clone so right click and click clone
we can give a new name this one is going
to be the one that we have cluster
control on and we want to make sure we
click reinitialize the MAC address of
all network cards that will make sure
the networking works correctly click
continue click clone and this will begin
processing and it will just take a
couple seconds the next thing we're
going to do is make one of the master
nodes so we can take that starter clone
it again and this time we can call it
master one reinitialize continue full
clone clone great we got one more to do
so right click clone and this one is
going to be master 2 and the reason
they're both master is because we are
going to be using Galera which is a
master master topology so we're not
going to have any slave nodes in this
situation make sure you click
reinitialize the MAC address and then
click continue
so those all finished what I'm going to
do is I'm actually going to take these
and drag them to the top awesome so we
have all of our virtual machines ready
to go the next thing that we need to do
is set up SSH so they actually can
communicate with one another through SSH
yes I know we did set up the SSH server
but there's a particular kind of SSH
called
password list SSH and that deals with
public and private keys that we're going
to have to put on these virtual machines
so the next video is going to be
teaching you guys how to do that if
you've enjoyed this series I just ask
that you please subscribe click like and
that really just helps me know that you
guys are appreciating my content and
encourages me to make more content so
please do that and I will see you all in
the next video thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
