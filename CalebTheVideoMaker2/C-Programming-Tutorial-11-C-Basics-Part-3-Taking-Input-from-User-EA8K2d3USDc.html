programming tutorial series here let me
just clean that off to make it nice and
fresh okay so in the last video we had
this code and this is cool but you can
see we're typing in the values of these
variables right here this is called hard
coding it means like once we compile
this the only way to change it is to
recompile the program we have to go in
there edit it recompile and then
redistribute our new program to all of
our customers that is generally bad
instead it would be so much cooler if we
can just ask the user hey give me a
value for X make the program a
communication between the computer and
the person using the final program that
is our goal for today so we're actually
going to create a pretty cool
application the goal of the application
is to calculate the area of a circle so
the person is going to run the program
it's going to ask for a radius and then
it'll calculate it and spit back the
value to the user and if your crappy a
geometry that's ok I'll teach you how to
do everything so I'm basically going to
just slaughter everything we have here
to get rid of it all but I'll keep some
general structure so first I'm going to
get rid of the string because you know
we're going to change that but I'm going
to keep the new line at the end and then
I'll get rid of the variables that's
kind of like the basic outline of what
we're going to fill in with new
variables the next thing is we're going
to get rid of these variables and just
create new ones so the very first thing
is we are going to create a radius
variable so the radius is the distance
from the outside to the center of the
circle that is the thing we are going to
get from the user so how do we get a
value from the user well just like
there's this printf function there is a
function to scan data from the console
and you guessed it it's scan F if I can
type o scanf
now what do we pass in here well it's
actually very similar to printf the
first thing is we need to say the format
string so what is the format of the data
and the format is going to be an integer
now we don't have to put a new line in
here we only need the new line down here
if we want to output that new line but
in here we're just going to get an
integer and where is that integer going
to be stored well it's actually going to
be stored inside of the variable radius
right here so this part is kind of weird
and this is one of those things where
you might just have to memorize at first
until you really understand it
but you actually have to put an
ampersand I think that's how you say it
and then the variable name for you
smart achill pants people out there this
is called the address of operator and
what this does is it allows the scanf
function to change the value of this
variable we are passing in if we just
you know passed in radius like this it's
not going to work I mean you can try it
but it's not going to work so let's make
sure we put that back in there before we
break things
the reason printf does not need the
address of operator when we pass in
something in here like X is because the
printf function doesn't actually change
the variable all it does is output it
scanf will change the variable it gives
it a value of what the user inputs so
that is super super super super super
important to remember so I'm gonna get
rid of that X for now and go back up
here so let's save this and run it and
make sure it works first thing though is
that the printf is not properly
formatted so the compiler is just going
to complain so what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to throw in the radius
variable here and then let's escape and
save okay so I have an error because I
forgot to put the % before the I so
let's go back into our code and let's
add that in there real quick there we go
okay I just ran the program and you see
it's beeping at me it's just telling me
to type something in but the thing is
it's not very clear it doesn't say
beautiful it's nice to see you today
would you please give me a number yeah
exactly it doesn't say anything but if
we type a number in here you can see it
outputs it so the program is working but
it doesn't ask the user so that is
something we want to implement and
generally when we ask the user to insert
some data that is called a user prompt
PR OMP pron PT and that's just asking
the user to do something we're prompting
the user so let's go back on our code
and make things not crappy so before we
scan we actually want to print two
prompts the user so we want to go into
insert mode and say printf please enter
a radius just like that and now let's
compile using GCC and run it please
enter a radius 200 and then outputs the
radius to make this output a little bit
better we could say hey the given radius
is 200 so to do that let's go back into
our code to them to obtain and just add
in here the given radius is and then
when we compile and run it into radius
2000 the given radius is 2000 in the
next video we are going to worry about
doing all the complicated calculations I
think that was enough for this video
now you guys understand how to get
integer input from the user and if you
go back into our code real quick I'll
show you something cool this percent I
this conversion character there are
actually other conversion characters
used to take different types of data and
we'll learn about all of that stuff in
the upcoming videos so thanks for
watching guys and I'll see you in the
next one
