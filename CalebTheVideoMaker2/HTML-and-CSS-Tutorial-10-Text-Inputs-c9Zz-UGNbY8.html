believe your 10th tutorial
maybe it's your 11 um yeah I'm pretty
sure it's your 10th
but anyways in this video I'll be
teaching you how to make this cool input
box over here alright so basically all
we really have to do is we tell exactly
what pixels of the page to make this
line go across same for this one this
one and then this one and then we have
to program it about 30 lines to tell it
to change colors when we click on it as
well as allow us to type in it so this
is going to be a 56 part not guys I'm
playing I'm playing it's really not that
hard
this would be one video sorry sorry for
those who you who are like yeah but no
this is easy
so I program this beforehand now I'm
going to fix it again so if i refresh
it's gone so let's start with making a
title and we're going to title this sign
in it
refresh now we have a sweet awesome
title now the box that we had it is
known as an input this allows us to give
the web server our our input on stuff so
they'll ask us or something and then
we'll give them something so to make
this we put an input and then it doesn't
have a closing tag so we close it
ourselves right and we're also going to
put this all within a paragraph just to
give it some nice form it's not really a
requirement I just like putting things I
like having things I don't like having
things just out by itself from the
reason so we're going to put in a
paragraph although you don't have to but
we can and we're going to put enter your
name first name let's make them now
let's go use your name so now we have
the hole that Claire's calling me and I
talked to her ever
I shall be right back okay guys for
phone calls and for Hang Ups later I
finally got her to stop calling me oh my
goodness so basically what we're doing
is we're putting let's just get rid of
input to do em and demonstrate something
we have a paragraph that says enter your
user name and then we just add an input
in there all right so that's really not
that bad
but what kind of input is this for
example we could upload files we can
type in a huge comment well this is
known as a text input and to tell HTML
that we put type equals text and anytime
we have like something equals we usually
have it in double quotation marks just
like that so now this is what we have it
looks exactly the same because the input
type text is the default so that's what
it looks like right so we can also give
this thing a name and I'll explain why
we do that in a second let's make it
user we can also give it an ID these
things are optional for what we're doing
but when we're working with programming
languages such as PHP this name right
here user name that's going to become
the how we get that information because
if we have let's just let me just
illustrate this again I get rid of this
and then I have two of these all right
ones for a username and so forth how
does that programming language know
which one to grab because it can't read
our typing so we have to tell us somehow
well there's two text inputs the only
way I can really know is if we give it
some kind of way to figure out which one
is the correct one there's one way is to
give it a name another way is to give it
an ID so for JavaScript you may see
something like document
get element by ID or whatever that will
take this element that has the ID
username and you can do something with
it for PHP we can take that name and
that will we can assign that to a
variable to use it for other stuff so if
that doesn't make any sense don't worry
about it this is just for the future use
you don't even have to put that in there
if you don't want but this is what we
have enter your username alright and we
can also have the attribute value and if
we leave a blank nothing happens but we
can give it value like now that's going
to be default so if I go to this website
it's going to say Caleb now you may be
wondering why in the world would you do
that well when you program these forms
and you click Submit you may have
mistakenly spot your email wrong or
something and if you do that and you if
you do that and you submit the form well
it's basically like refreshing it kind
of so basically you type in your name
and then all dang it you have to type in
all that stuff again so you're filling
out this huge form and you mistake you
mistakingly type in the CAPTCHA
verification code wrong or something and
it gets rid of everything well with
programming languages you can take the
value they submitted and I'm just typing
in pseudocode so this isn't a real
program which I could say something like
if they submitted a if they submitted
the page and the value as a value
because by default there's no value it's
just blank correct so then I could say
if if both of those are true then we can
give the value the value they submitted
that means when they go to the forum the
second time that first value that they
submitted is already going to be in this
username so that's kind of complex and
if you don't even know how an if
statement works basically it tests
what's in this this uh these parenthesis
it tests this expression and this
expression if they have it if they've
submitted the page and the value isn't
blank then we can give the value what
they originally submitted hopefully that
makes sense if not don't worry about it
so this is our official whoopsies
that's my bad forgot about that code
down there this is our official input
now I wanted to show you one more thing
we can actually give this thing a max
like the tribute not sure if that's it's
weighted say fifty so now that means
it's going to limit us to 50 characters
character is just a letter number sign
or something and bullet missed stops us
at 50 now
I'm gonna get a drink real quick what by
the way guys it's seven seventeen just
so you know it's getting late
why would we do that well let me open a
paint document to illustrate something
right on so here we have this database
right and we have this column that says
use your name right and obviously this
will be in code it won't be visual like
this unless you make it visual somehow
well we could say we want this user name
to be
bartsch are 50 that means we want it to
be a carrot a word of the max length of
50 and then if we go to our website and
we submit 50,000 characters well it's
going to have to crop that and do extra
work just for us to put it into the
database so by making this a max length
of 50 we can eliminate work and not have
to cut people's usernames short and
confuse people and so forth so we can
give that a max length of 50 we can also
for visual reasons give this a length
which only this only affects it visually
so let me get rid of this max length we
did say length 50 pixels oops oh I see
what I did wrong I'm sorry I'm so
confused
try to put an active quotation marks
here so I'm seeing if I'm doing this
right all right all right guys sorry
it's actually sighs I was confused so
sighs we can give that a number and it
can limit the size of our input so if I
give it 40 you can see it extends it to
40 I believe characters so let me try it
50 and I'll give it a max length of 50
then refresh I type it should end at the
same spot all right so you can see it
given it a size of 50 fits a little more
than 50 characters so forth so if I give
it 60 with a max length of 60 refresh
all right so I'm pretty sure this isn't
pixels yeah so sizes and pixels max
length is in characters so size is a
visual representation of how long the
thing is but you see if we give it
something like 10 and the max length is
60 we can continue to type for 60
characters so that is really everything
I have to say about inputs this video
who ran a little wrong this video ran a
little long but we covered a lot of
content so in the next video we will be
going over something new so be sure to
subscribe thank you and goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
