11 p.m. man my day is going like nothing
all right so what's up everybody welcome
back and in the this video I'm going to
be talking about affecting nested tags
so what does that mean
well if you look here we have a div tag
I mean a div selector and a paragraph
selector so these correlate to these
tags right here the div and definitive
we have a paragraph another paragraph
and a paragraph so that is how that
works all right so as you can see we
could say the paragraph tag is nested
within the division tag so within the
div and get out some paint here look
cool
all right awesome so we have a just
what's we have a div so this is a div
and then within this div we have a
paragraph another paragraph and another
paragraph so look we have a paragraph
paragraph paragraph we also have another
div within the div so we have a div and
at the top we have an h1 tag so you have
an h1 so you have h1 paragraph tag
paragraph tag paragraph tag and another
div so if you look at this that means
everything that is in this div is nested
into div that's what it's called
you nest it right so that basically this
means it's within it so if we affect
this div here
a marker out if we affect this div here
this one right here that means
everything within it is going to get
affected because it's the balls of them
all
just like we affect the paragraph and
all the text within it gets affected so
I want to try something cool some just
so you guys know some stuff is inherited
so if we affect the div everything is
affected but that doesn't mean if we
give the div a border if we give the div
a border that doesn't mean each one of
the cup of the elements or the tags
within it gets affected only the div
gets the border so that's the case for
some things other things everything is
affected so I'm gonna sort of restart on
my page here I'm not going to get rid of
everything but I'm just going to get rid
of the div here gonna get rid of the
paragraph content I'm gonna get rid of
the paragraph content and the h1 content
so let's look away oh we have nothing so
let's create a little bit I'm gonna keep
comments on there paragraph
this isn't already cool let's change
this to articles so this what we have so
far I'm going to the CSS open the
paragraph tag and I'm going to turn off
text align I'm just going to make it
left by default so that is what it looks
like and the text indent is putting it
off too far so let's give it a text
indent of 10 fix 10 pixels
this is also an article this is another
test so now I have three articles now I
ever did this is just a simple dish so
we could say within this dish we could
say you know a paragraph tag which in
this div alright and then we could say
hmm this is a sub article so as you can
see it's separate from these because
it's within another div so what if I
wanted to effect just the sub article
and make it smaller well let's look at
our structure here we originally have to
get pain out again we have a div I'm
going to do this fast
we have a div and then within this div
we have another div and within this div
we have a paragraph so this is what it's
going to look like we have div div
paragraph so this is going to affect any
paragraphs that are nested within a div
that is nested within it is hopefully
that makes sense let's let's try it out
on our CSS and see if we can do anything
with it we move that aside for now all
right so we create a new selector and
lower that one
if div pete text-decoration:underline so
as you can see we effected this text but
not this text so hopefully that's
starting to make sense so if you want to
change these paragraphs to have these
shadows and stuff but other paragraphs
you don't want them to have a shadows
you could say any paragraphs that are
nested within a div and it looks the
same that's because we didn't change
anything because these paragraphs are
nested within it did you see this div if
we close it it hides all the paragraphs
so that makes good sense to us but if we
have a paragraph up here just a day I
ate seven bowls of cereal now we have a
separate paragraph even though this
paragraph is being affected it does not
affect this paragraph because by saying
this we're saying any paragraph nested
within a div so if we make another
selector paragraph let's say color
equals red well it affected all of them
that's because we don't have any color
settings we're affecting all paragraphs
so when we say this one it goes to all
of them what if I say it here color
equals red instead of here
this is only going to affect these three
refresh sorry and this one that is
because this is also nested within a div
so this way does not work back we start
at the pair all right I'll show you what
I mean if we affect this one up here we
turn the text red it's going to turn
everything red if we start this one it's
it's going to turn everything within it
red but it's not going to go out it
won't go out here but if we go to the
last one and we turn the text red it's
going to affect everything within here
but it's not going to go out with it of
its boundaries so applying a setting to
just a paragraph we're saying text
declaration
equals one through it's going to mark
out all of our stuff except the bottom
one that is because down here we have
text-decoration:underline which
overrides this one so that was a lot of
content in this video that's all I
really have to say so and be sure to
subscribe if this is helpful and I'll
see you in upcoming videos thank you
