now this video is going to begin our
discussion on database design now those
of you who have been subscribed for a
while you know I love database design
and relationships so dating advice 101
here we go
the very first thing when we're talking
about relationships is what in the world
is a relationship why do we want to
learn about it if we don't really
understand what it is I think a lot of
people forget that part they just start
explaining the different types of
relationships but they don't really
explain why or what for or anything like
that so let's just take a step back and
learn a little bit more detail before we
go in and start explaining things one
word that is essential to know when it
comes to databases is entity and entity
is just a thing now
when we store something in a database
it's called an entity but the thing is
we store about that thing like you know
the attributes of that thing those are
called attributes so the attribute
describes the entity and in fact we can
have multiple attributes describing one
entity this is obviously very general
using entity and attribute and all kinds
of fancy words but essentially what you
need to know is that sometimes we are
going to be storing something as the
object and other times we're going to be
storing things as something describing
the object trust me I'll make more sense
is give me a minute
so a relationship is when some piece of
data depends on another piece of data so
in this situation if we're trying to
store some data about something you can
say this data depends on the entity if
you wanted to make this you know a
little bit more concrete we can have a
user and one of his attributes could be
his username or his email these
obviously describe the user the email
that we're talking about depends on what
user we're talking about the user name
depends on what user we're talking about
so that kind of breaks down the whole
dependency thing inside a databases now
what is a relationship well a
relationship is just describing
different ways we can structure these
dependencies so the three types of
relationships are one two
one-to-many and many-to-many the first
type of relationship is just a
one-to-one relationship and it's
actually very very very very easy the
other to get a little bit more complex
because then we're talking about
relationships between tables so for
example if we have a user's table and
let's say these users can post comments
on some kind of shopping website or
something well then we might have a
common staple well we need a way to
associate who posted the comment and
that is where the relationship comes in
that is a more advanced relationship and
that's what we'll be talking about in
the next two videos but let's start now
with just the one-to-one relationship so
yeah I'm using the technical words like
one-to-one without really explaining
what that means but I'm gonna explain
that now and then when we talk about
one-to-many and many-to-many you already
have that foundation and it'll make a
lot more sense okay seriously this is
look super easy you might even be
disappointed a one-to-one relationship
is literally just an attribute
describing some entity so in the example
we had earlier we had a user and an
email that's a perfect example this
email depends on the user so let's just
make this a little bit more concrete by
giving it an actual user and let's just
send his email as Kaleb email com the
term one-to-one comes up because we have
one attribute describing one entity this
one entity is being described
specifically in email terms by only one
email so in a one-to-one relationship
you can only have one email for one user
that means if we have another user over
here
it would not follow one-to-one rules if
this girl also shared this email that is
not allowed additionally we cannot have
Caleb have two emails this would be
illegal in a one-to-one relationship and
you might think well hey what if I want
my users to people have multiple emails
well that is actually what the
one-to-many and also going further the
many to many relationships are for a lot
of this is just depends on how you want
to structure your database sometimes
it's a yes/no black/white kind of thing
other times it's a gray area where the
database designer or the customer who's
giving you the rules makes the decisions
so for example you could design your
database as a one-to-one with this where
a user can only have one email and that
email can only be used by one user or
you could have it a different way where
a user can have two emails or three
emails or unlimited emails and so forth
once you understand how to design the
different relationships it allows you to
decide how to structure your database
and actually later on when we start
talking about something called database
normalization well a lot of this
relationship stuff is foundational to
that normalization and if you get the
relationships right the problems with
the normalization goes away now if you
haven't studied normalization that's
totally fine don't worry about it we'll
get to that soon but you might be
reviewing and you might have already had
some experience with normalization so
I'm just giving you that as you know a
little teaser so if we want to design a
one-to-one relationship meaning that
this is illegal and this person cannot
share an email hears and cannot share a
new as you set up a table and you put
the attribute as one column in this
table so now that we have the table we
can put a row in this table to describe
this specific entity and that is how you
design a one-to-one relationship now
once you get into some more of the
advanced database design you can tinker
with the uniqueness of this column so
for example if you wanted to allow
another person to share an email well
then you could do it that way or you can
make it to where all the emails have to
be unique all of those things are things
you can customize so don't freak out
about all of the details right now
what's important is that you get the
general structure and when I say
one-to-one you should think of one table
when they call us that means this here
is also a one-to-one relationship so the
first name depends on the users the last
name depends on the user and the email
depends on the user as I mentioned with
the more advanced stuff well even though
a first name might be repeated a couple
times in general you think of a name as
describing one person so you don't have
to be like super anal
everything it would be totally okay to
have some repeating data here because if
I have another Caleb with you know a
different last name well this is
describing a different person
so this Caleb is like a different Caleb
but we're getting into some detail that
is you know way beyond 101 database
design so don't worry about all that for
right now the most important thing is
understand into the attribute boom there
you go now in the next video we're going
to be talking about the one-to-many
relationship and that gets a little bit
more complex but that's going to be a
lot of fun so I'm excited be sure to
check it out be sure to subscribe check
out the description where I'm going to
have a lot of useful links including a
link to a blog post that describes this
with some beautiful illustrations and
all kinds of cool stuff so check it out
be sure to subscribe and I will see you
in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
