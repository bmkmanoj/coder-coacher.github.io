know how many tutorials we've made but
we're getting pretty far thanks for
sticking with it if you have or if
you're just stopping by to check out
specific video that's cool with me too
although I do recommend you start
beginning and watch them all
so I'm guessing you'll be pleased to
know that the next thing we know are
going to learn I mean is check boxes
which are very similar to radio buttons
so we're going to kind of compare so the
very first thing we make what do you
mean in the outside man gotta call the
police again be right back alright guys
I am back ah
all right where was I we create the P
tag and then we make a label and this is
going to be for interests not sex I'm
copying the other ones alright huh I
swear that's why I put that interests
end the label alright and then we put
input type equals checkbox and then name
goulds we can put pretty much anything
interests should match with the label
for though time and then we can put a
value we could say database database
and that input let's see what this looks
like like this pretty awesome alright so
now we can make some more let's let's
have a little break tag in here to keep
things clean then we're going to add
input type equals checkbox name equals
Tristan one try and go a little faster
here so I'll keep you waiting
PHP program PHP program awesome and more
thing I'm going to add a break right
here check all that apply
going to change the little title gear
make it a little cooler in my opinion
sweet alright we're just gonna keep
doing this and it's gonna be pretty
awesome we're done input type equals
checkbox D equals interest after so I'm
just I'm gonna I'm pretending I'm making
a little website for web developers and
I can't spell that's about right I have
no clue I guess I'll just spell it wrong
on purpose I wait I don't look stupid
got that little break
all right awesome so I'm gonna do one
more add a break interest value equals
AB development I'm sorry still copying
the other one not even thinking let's go
with eating chicken sandwiches chicken
shit I awesome except for some reason
there's such a huge gap I ended the
paragraph all right so now this is our
final product now let me explain this
value thing you're probably wondering
why do we need a value if we just copy
the same thing right beside it well for
this we technically don't
what if we're working with another
programming language the value is going
to be sent to that through like a it'll
be inserted into an array or into some
sort of object depends on what you're
doing exactly so the value should
represent what's actually being written
because if I put playing games and it
gets sent its eating chicken well then
it's just gonna confide otter barking
and just try to confuse people so
another thing is name is interest okay
that's some of them so I'm gonna add
nests all right so now why do they all
have the same name because check boxes
you can check more than one so why does
it matter why do I even need the name
well if we put these in some sort of
array and by the way an array is just a
group of objects we get out my painting
pencils
if we have this object here and this is
Tidewater interests and within interest
we have four interests and these
interests were databasing I'm just
putting random stuff does really matter
PHP ab dev e in shape all right so these
all go into the interest little walk
here you see but what if I put one of
them if I take out if I put replace
interest for the last one and put food
well now it's going to be like this this
eat and chicken isn't going to be in
this group it's going to be in its own
group down here zoom out here Oh where's
the shapes it's going to be in its own
group down here you see and this one
will be titled food so that is how it
works exactly and it's very similar to
the to the UH or they call it the radio
buttons I'm sorry and but you can just
check multiple ones so this will all be
sent to a script together alright so
that's all I really have to say about
checkboxes and in the next video we'll
be going over something new so I will
see you then thank you and be sure to
