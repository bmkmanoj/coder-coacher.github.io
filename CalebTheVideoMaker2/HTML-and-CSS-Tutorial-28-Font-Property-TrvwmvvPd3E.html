believe your 28th video maybe I'm not
even too sure I've probably lost track
I've been doing this way too long I know
it hasn't been that long but man I got
up at like 8:00 I started like studying
stuff like 8 a.m. and I was like I gotta
make a video series tonight so yeah it
has been pretty intense and now we're
going to be talking about the font
property so we talked a lot about fonts
in general but now we're going to be
talking about combining all the stuff
we've learned so what have we learned
exactly well we learn font size font
weight font style
I mean font style
here's rid of this and font family so
just a quick review of each of these
font size that can be expressed in
pixels p.m. percents and points font
weight it can either be normal or old
font-style:italic or normal font family
we have one at the beginning and then we
can have some backup once and then at
the very end we have a generic font
family if you look at this picture again
just in case this font family fails they
don't have it supported or something
goes wrong then we have this generic
family that is just so general that
it'll work so yes that is the font
family so these are are our 4 font
properties we have learned so far so
what else can we do with these
what we're going to do now is learn how
to combine these in one awesome property
known as just font so oops I don't need
that so how exactly does this work well
you just as you um put the information
you have here within the font property
in the so in this order so italic old
and then you could say what you want
sighs let's go twenty-one pixels and
then you can say what's wrong
Georgey Georgey is it for Donna no
that's gone I was thinking okay never
mind
so now let's look at it alright so this
is what it looks like yeah so we're
gonna steer to the scrap and this is
what it looks like now so actually I'm
gonna bring that back just just so you
can see edit so we broke this up first
we did we did the font style so this
one's gonna go first and then we did the
font weight and then we did the font
size and then we did the font family no
commas between them just spaces and this
is really cool because if you've done
any computer programming and you know
like if you have a function it takes
parameters and you need like the first
one skipped but you want something for
the second one like this which if you
don't know what this means - signor it
then it's sometimes you can't skip that
first per the first parameter and you
have to use something in order to get to
that second parameter if that doesn't
make sense it's more but for this you
can take out for say italic and it
should still work because it knows the
specific words the values that are
propria for this that means if I put
italic it it knows it's not going to be
able to do anything with that
so if I put bold instead here well it
understands that I made a mistake I put
two bolts so it's going to screw
everything up so I guess it makes it
double bold but it doesn't try to
italicize it doesn't try to use it okay
it doesn't try to do this font style
equals bull it doesn't it understands
that the only acceptable thing here
would be normal or a talent right so I
guess we can make it triple bold then
nope guess not
but yeah let's actually try that font
style equals bullet and see what happens
all right it doesn't do anything that's
because I wasn't expecting it to do
anything because bold is not appropriate
value for the font style property I'm
sorry
drawn blanks here and there but it's
okay so this is the final font the most
useful declaration you're going to need
just font and then you can put all the
information in after and by the way when
you're making fonts at the end you're
not gonna need that many just like to
like a normal font and then a backup
font general font so that's probably
good enough and then if you want to
italicize just put that first whoops
close I don't do that I don't know how I
did that but that's pretty awesome
after that stuff cool too so yeah let's
try putting a talk here maybe it'll work
I don't know it does it does
does it it does so yeah you can switch
bold and italic maybe some of the others
but I like to keep it normal so I'm just
going to keep the italic here so that is
the font property as well as the
appropriate values to create a good
declaration so I'm going over these
terms this together font with these
these values is the declaration that are
applied to the selector P so anything
within a paragraph tag is going to get
affected
so that's all I really save for this
video thank you for sticking with me
let's let's keep going and rock this
series out like a boss yeah so thank you
thanks for watching be sure to subscribe
