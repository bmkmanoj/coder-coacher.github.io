tutorial it has been a while so I'm glad
to get going on these again it's
currently dark out so sorry if it's dark
in here or sorry if I look tired or if
my voice is raspy because I've been
talking like all day so this is PHP
tutorial 40 and what I want to talk
about is page titles so within your head
and every HTML document you will have a
head and within here you will have a
title page title so this is what a basic
HTML document will look like you have
your title here this is going to be
displayed on your tab of whatever
browser you are using so if you're at
the top if this is your internet page
you're going to have these tabs up here
so if you're on Google here YouTube here
and then this website whatever you put
as your title is going to go right there
alright so earlier weird my eraser go oh
it's still really cool earlier we talked
to a bow including a generalized
includes for a header and what this is
going to do is make the top of our
website the same on every single page so
if this is your website we can make this
top part have the same logo and the same
social links and the same tabs to search
for and maybe a search box and a
drop-down tab for example this all of
this stuff right here that I just made
this is going to be put into another
file which will then be included into
your next of actual content
so think of it like this here you have
your header right and then you have your
actual web page content and then if you
want you could have a footer down here
too but I'm just going to go with the
header for this example you can have
multiple website content pages and this
header is going to fit on every single
page so that way you only have to make
the header once so this will be included
here this will be included here except
there's only one problem what about the
page title because the page title would
be included in the header which is in
the which is in the header file the page
title is included in here
well here we have two different pages
and the chances are they don't have the
same title so how is it that we can make
this page have a different title than
this page if all of this content is
stored within the header file
well that's what this video is going to
be illustrating and the way we do this
is by putting the title in a variable so
we can name it page title if we wanted
all right so now within our header page
we're going to have this page title in
here and in order to do this we use a
PHP echo statement within the title tags
so it will look like this
so we open the title tag we open the PHP
echo and then go into new line because
I'm running out of room echo page title
and then we can put a semicolon to end
that statement there and then we close
the PHP and then we close the title all
right so now basically how this works is
this is going to be inside of our header
file
the one thing I drew down here already
when I erased it for some reason all of
this is going to be put in our header
file and then within our actual content
we're going to provide a value for this
variable page content so here's our
actual content over here what we're
going to do is say oh the page title has
the value home page for example and then
it's going to echo home page as the
title and put that within to two title
tags so that is what will be used as the
title so once we're finally done with
this we are going to have to include the
header within our actual page but before
we do that we have to define the value
of that variable the reason for this is
that we can't echo out a variable if it
doesn't have a value that means we have
to define the variable before it's being
used so what we do is we would say page
title has the value
whatever it doesn't really matter so
this is the beginning of our thing and
all basically we're going to open our
PHP here and then we have this here so
that is our first thing on our page and
then we can include the actual file
so once PHP opens this page the first
thing we'll do is it says ok we're
defining a value for the variable page
title page title doesn't exist so we
make it PHP works that way you don't
have to predefined your variables by
saying variable page title it will just
make it automatically so if you're you
can basically just assign a value to a
variable and now that variable exists
and now when we include the actual
header file which is going to be the top
of our website it will have access to
that page title and it will put that
within the title tags by using that
echoes echo statement I showed you
earlier and then we will have the rest
of our website content and that title
will be used to define the title
hopefully that makes all good sense so
that's the general way you would make
each page have a separate title first
things first
you would define the variable with the
value and then within your include all
you're going to do is title that go and
then you echo the variable within the
title text so that is how you do that
hopefully that was helpful and thank you
