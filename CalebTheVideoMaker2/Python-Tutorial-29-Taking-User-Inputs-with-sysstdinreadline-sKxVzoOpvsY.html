we're going to be learning about
learning buffs I can't talk learning
about something new that's going to be
so super cool so these are known as
modules so modules are something that
when you first open Python you can't use
them yet you have to import them but
they're some of them are built-in so you
don't have to download anything but
basically when you import these modules
it allows you to do a whole bunch of
more things and one of these modules
that we're going to be using today is
sys or sis so in order to import it all
we do is say import sis now with sis it
comes it brings a bunch of new features
that we can do alright so in order to
use one of these features we say sis and
then what we can do there's one of these
things that we can do it's a stdin you
see it pops up there oops I didn't press
Enter gosh and then we do read line
alright so this code just memorize this
that what this will do is it will allow
us to take an input when we're running
the program from the user of the program
and we can assign that to a variable so
here I'll show you what I mean so when
we press that we can say something but
it doesn't really do much but watch this
we can say print and then within our
print we can say sis
now when I run this you can see there's
a blank line and now whatever we type
into this blank line it's going to print
it Hey
so you can see it printed hey so
basically it took an input within the
program which is awesome that bring that
brings us to a whole new level of
programming where we're starting to
define variables dynamically or do
things dynamically rather than having it
all programmed behind the shell we start
taking values from the actual user of
the program so let's let's create
something cool I want to create a tip
calculator so in the last video my
computer just froze okay I think it's
working all right
and I'll in a couple videos ago we
talked about a tip calculator although
the only problem with our tip calculator
was that it only told us the the total
price and I don't think I implemented
that right but I was I wasn't really
paying attention at the time although
this video we're going to be creating a
tip calculator where we take the user's
price of the meal and then we take how
much we want to tip them and it will
tell us the amount of dollars or
whatever whatever currency you're using
that you need to pay the waiter all
right so we're going to do all of this
within a function so let's define a
function we'll just name it tip doesn't
really matter what we name it what we're
going to do is we're going to ask some
questions
so let's print
how much was your meal so this is a
question for the user and what we can do
is we can assign an input to a variable
and use that variable to point out
values later so let's just create a
price and let's say what we're going to
do is we're going to force this to be an
integer and the way we do this is we use
in the int function and that's going to
take any value and convert it to an
integer so basically when we insert like
75 within this red line it stores it as
a string with the values 75 and we want
to convert that to an integer so this is
a function that is able to do that all
right so what we can do within this
function we just take Cistus dead in red
red line it's kind of hard to pronounce
like that but you get what I'm saying
this I'll just type it out all right and
then we go to the next line and then we
ask another question how much do you
want to tip them gosh
sorry I mean to press ENTER and you
start using the actual program and just
running these files but we'll get to
that someday all right so now what we're
going to do after this is we're going to
make another variable the tip amount and
we'll cast that to an INT
so now the way this program is going to
work is it's going to start once we call
this function the program will run it'll
ask us how much our meal is we type it
in and it will sign it to the value to
the variable price then we'll ask how
much do you want to tip then we type
that in and it will sign it to the
variable tip all right so the only
problem is is when they put in a let's
let's say leave off any periods just so
people are clear on what to do so now
when people will put in like how much do
you want to tip them or let's say what
percent do you want to tip them so
someone will put like 20 so they'll put
20 so leave off any periods or percent
signs now they'll just put in a value
like 20 all right guys so the only
problem with this right now is that when
people put this in without any periods
or percent signs it's going to be an
integer such as 20 well that can't be
used because that's not a percent that's
an integer so we need to convert that to
a decimal which can be used as a percent
in from math class you know that you can
divide by 100 to do that so basically if
we have 20 and we divide that by 100
we're going to have point 20 and then we
can take a number such as 10 multiplied
it by point 20 to give us the value 2
which tells us our tip price is $2 so if
that's too complex just copy me
seriously it's not that big of a deal so
although you should try to understand
this so it could say something like
final tip amount and then we can assign
it the value price x and then within
parenthesis for priority reasons we
wanted to take tip and divide that by
100 so that way it divides tip by 100
before it multiplies it by price then
what we can do is finally once we have
all these values we can print them out
so let's first print you will want to
tip them and then we need to put a
variable within here so we use % s as we
learned in previous videos and then we
put a % and then we tell them the amount
that we want we we tell them what
variable we want to put there which
would be final tip amount and then what
we had to do is we add the string
dollars so the way this works now is let
me just explain this first I typed it
out all at once to so we could explain
through the process and then we could
actually run it and see how it works so
looking at this final print let's look
at this first it's going to print out
the string you will want to tip them and
then it will print out the value of
final tip amount so for this has to be
correct in order for this to be correct
let's just say this this turns out
correct it's going to do that and then
it's going to add this string space
dollars so that way it'll be like you
will want to tip them too and then a
space between the two and then the word
dollars or whatever your currency is so
looking at the whole program first thing
it does is ask the question how much was
your meal then it takes an input of a
number so this is the this is how we do
that with this sis thing right here we
give it a number let's say it's 10 it
takes that and it's it's in string form
it's basically just a string with the
value 10 it converts that to an integer
using this int function which surrounds
the whole thing and it assigns that
value to price and then asks another
question what percent do you want to tip
them and we give them a whole number no
periods no percents so like 20 20 and
then
what it does is it does the same exact
thing it signs it to an inn and assigns
it to the value tip now we take tip and
we divide it by 100 so we get 20 and
bring that down to point 20 multiply
that by the price and then assign that
whole thing to final tip amount then
what we do is we print out the final tip
amount in a user-friendly sentence so
hopefully I did all this right let's try
it out if not I'm going to look really
really stupid but just be patient with
me so what we do is we call the function
how much was your meal my meal was a
hundred dollars what percent do you want
to tip them leave off any periods or
percent signs okay uh it's plenty I
guess so then it will say you will want
to tip them $20 very simple English and
it works awesome let's try it again skip
a couple lines tip how much was room you
it was $72 what percent do you want to
tip them let's tip them 30% I'm feeling
pretty generous you will want to tip
them $21 holy cow and yeah you can see
that it's not very good at rounding up
but you know you get the point twenty
one point six dollars or sixty cents the
only problem that I can think of right
now is obviously you can put a bunch of
junk in you can try putting words in so
this program is very easily broken
another thing is it doesn't really work
well with decimals so let's I'll show
you this tip if we say seventy two point
five well it doesn't really understand
that because this is not an integer an
integer is a whole number such as 72 or
73 but not seventy two point five so um
there are ways to fix this although that
goes way beyond the depth of this video
and I just wanted to get your guys's
satisfy you guys by starting a cool
awesome program so hopefully it was
legit and I think it was pretty legit so
as videos go on we'll try to figure out
how to improve
programs and do other cool things so let
me know if this video was useful or if I
jumped into the in-depth programming too
soon or what because I mean this is kind
of this uh this style I don't you really
use make videos this style usually so
I'm kind of trying new things and I want
you guys to give feedback so I know
which direction to go so yeah leave a
comment subscribe and I will see you
guys in the next video keep on
programming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
