your MySQL tutorial series I'm Caleb
from Caleb the video maker to this video
we are going to be continuing our
discussion on database terminology two
terms you need to be familiar with our
entity and attribute an entity is just a
thing we store data about attributes are
the things we store about that entity
now I'm going to continually bring up
the concept of data integrity data
integrity means that the attributes we
are storing about the entity are
accurate as up-to-date as possible not
redundant meaning duplicates and there's
no conflicting information there is a
lot of stuff we do inside of a database
to enforce data integrity it's one of
the most important things to have when
it comes to database development in
database design so if we have an entity
and we have a couple attributes that
describe this entity let's say we have
another entity so two instances of an
entity let's just say these are users
and each one of these is an attribute
that describes the user what if by
chance this matched this this matched
this and this matched this it would
almost be as if we had duplicate data
that's because both of these would look
like the same thing that's because all
of the attributes about it are the same
so we could have like the first name
last name and email for example and we
have two users with the same first name
last name and email that's confusing how
do we prevent this well we need to
introduce something known as a primary
key now a primary key is something that
is unique and not null so for example if
this third one was the email right we
could make this the primary key and if
that was the case we would be able to
distinguish these users because we would
force the email to be unique and that
would mean two users couldn't use the
same email this is an example of a
natural key that's because the key is
something natural it's the email it's
something that exists in the real world
another type of key is a surrogate key a
surrogate key is just a value that's
generated by the database generally an
ID so we could say this user has the ID
of seven and this user down here has the
idea of hate we can use that to
distinguish the two different users that
way we know that there's actually two
users and not one user entered into the
database twice that's because we have
this to distinguish it the ID now what
do you do if you want to reference this
primary key in another table or if you
want to reference another column for
example we might have a comment table
and this comment table might reference a
user how do you do that that introduces
the concept of a foreign key and that's
the word we will start with in the next
video thanks guys for watching hopefully
that was helpful as always I ask that

give it a like I will see you in the
