Caleb the video maker and in this video
I will be telling you how to
automatically have social networks
update when you make a new wordpress
posts so what you'll need is obviously a
WordPress and I'm not going to go into
the basics of how to make posts and all
that that's too simple so I expect you
have some knowledge of WordPress but not
not ton so what you need to do is under
plugins add new and what we're going to
do is we're going to search social
networks Auto whoops I can't even type
networks auto poster search plugins and
this one next scripts : social networks
Auto poster and you want to install now
and click OK and we are going to be
connecting to a Twitter account so our
Twitter will automatically update and
what we want to do is activate this
plug-in alright so now we have it
updated it's I mean activated it's right
here and what we want to do is we go to
settings and this stuff can get pretty
complicated so don't freak out add new
account add new network and we are going
to go to Twitter alright and um this
isn't too hard just put your Twitter URL
by the way you can follow me at Caleb
curry now from here we can put Caleb
just a nickname for that now what we
want to do is we want to go to this link
right here HTTP colon slash slash de Vie
twitter.com forward slash apps so this
is for Twitter developers and we can
sign in here
all right once we get to this page there
are a few things we want to look at the
first is the access level in order for
WordPress to be able to write on our
account as our Twitter account it has to
be access level read and write so we can
go to settings
and then we can scroll down select read
and write and then update this twitter
applications settings and then we may
need to go to details and you may need
to refresh the page in order for this to
show up as read and write all right so
once we have that there is a few other
things we need to look at and we can
take look at this as a reference we need
to consumer key so I'm going to
highlight that copy it and then I'm
going to paste it and then we also need
the Twitter consumer secret so we're
going to take that copy it paste it and
then we need your access token so what
we need to do is we need to create my
access token all right you're then it
says it's successfully been created and
it may take a few moments so you may
need to refresh the page once this is
done you will have more stuff down here
so we copy the access token here and we
paste that in our access token here then
we take the access token secret copy and
we paste that here alright and then what
we can do is we can attach an image to
the Twitter post or change the message
text format but for now we're just going
to click update settings
we still have something we haven't done
so let's look at this we can test our
settings by clicking submit
and it'll tell us to see our Twitter
account so let's open Twitter and we can
look at our post test post from free
programming tutorials one two three
great and I don't really want it on
there so I'm going to delete that
awesome
so then what we can do is we can update
settings I didn't really change anything
but oh cool
and now let's try it we're going to add
a new post publish alright our post is
published we can view it oh that's
beautiful and we can check our Twitter
account let's go to me
and you can see it automatically posted
that tweet so that is how you
automatically set up tweets from your
WordPress account hopefully that was
helpful and if you enjoyed it please be
sure to subscribe and I will see you in
the next video oh yes real quickly
everybody before I go you can also add
new accounts and let's say you wanted to
do one for Facebook well there's always
these detailed installation guides that
you can find and basically this is going
to teach you exactly what I just taught
you in this video it's pretty simple I
just thought I'd show you in video
format so yeah basically if you need any
type of social network you just follow
those guides and it will tell you how to
do it so thank you for watching and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
