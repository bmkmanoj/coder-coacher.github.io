last video in this MySQL complete series
and I know there was a couple things
that I did not cover but it was complete
introduction so you never know maybe
there'll be an advanced series but yeah
who knows so I will actually be talking
about sorting full-text results by their
relevance to the search terms now you
can see this is a search not source this
is a query you would type in for a
standard full-text search and I left a
gap in here and you'll see why in a
second now there's a couple things I
need to say first a normal full text
search does sort things by relevance but
a boolean text search does not so you
need to sort it by that but I'm actually
going to be showing you something for
the full text where it will display how
relevant it is to what you're searching
for now this is how easy how to set up
select review from reviews table where
the match of what column reviews against
what terms price so we're looking for
reviews that mention something about the
price now if we actually take this where
match against reviews again where match
reviews against price I mean and place
it up here as a select term so we could
say not the we're ignore other where
where don't take the way you can say
match and then
we abused that says reviews just in case
you can't see it probably not against
and then what terms price by adding this
up here this will actually give us a
number such as three point two or
something that will tell you how
relevant it is to your search terms to
higher the number the more relevant now
that's all pretty cool and stuff but
it's not that important because it's
already in relevant it's already
descending in relevance so now if we are
to use in boolean mode we can do the
same exact thing by simply adding in
some more space in movie and mode space
that's okay in boolean mode into the
parentheses now this will actually sort
things by relevance and also when you're
in boolean mode it does not matter if
terms are less than three characters
long so I could say plus for the price
to make it have to be in there and I
could say within here I could say - hi
so I don't want anybody to say about the
cut of the pie within the restaurant
because it's just not that important and
I don't care about the pie I hate the
pie even though I love pie because I
just say it like a whole one but that's
okay so now that is how you sort the
relevance but there's also one more
thing also for boolean searches it does
not matter if more than 50% of the
results have these terms it'll still
review them so that's the difference
between a boolean and full text
don't forget the boolean is the one with
the secret codes here cuz only you are
gonna know what they've stand for
because you watched my series this and
then I think there's a tilde which means
less important yeah that is how you sort
things by relevance make sure if you're
change the terms down here to just also
change them up here it will give you the
relevance for something
that you're not searching for it see ya
everybody that's all I have for you in
this series I am glad if you've made it
through this whole thing that you've
made it this far what else do I have to
say not much but from now from now on I
would try and learn more advanced things
for MySQL or other databasing systems
now you can learn more specifics on how
it works and what exactly it's doing
when you tell it to do something this
will give you a greater understanding of
what you're doing when you're saying
functions or other types of queries what
you can also do is learn another
language that can combine with MySQL for
databasing reasons such as Java or PHP
for web development or anything like
that I I would like to see a PHP
tutorial series coming from this channel
so maybe that'll happen someday you
never know and I'm not gonna tell you
because I'm evil but yeah that'd be
pretty cool so let me let me know what
you think what would you like to see
more from from me and also what you
liked about the series or disliked so
I'm asking for you guys to give feedback
so I can make improvements and changes
along the way and so yeah I would really
appreciate if you gave some feedback it
doesn't have to be nice but try not to
like crush me because I'm really
sensitive I'm just crying thinking about
all these rude things you guys are gonna
say like not bad and you did okay please
subscribe to see future content my name
is caleb curry and this was the last
video in your MySQL complete
introduction thank you for watching and
I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
