video will be about giving a header and
a footer to your web page so if this is
helpful please be sure to subscribe so
since the series is mostly based off of
PHP I'm not going to focus too much on
CSS and HTML so what that means is I'm
just going to be downloading a theme
that you can use for free where we can
easily make our web page so let me just
open a web browser right here and we're
going to Google search free CSS
templates I guess then we go to free
- CSS comm and we're going to go to free
CSS layouts and the one we are going to
take is CSS layout 10 the link for this
is free - CSS com forward slash free -
CSS - layouts forward slash page one
forward slash CSS - layout - ten a pound
sign shout so I'll probably just put a
link to that in the description because
that's really long you can check out a
live demo of what it's going to look
like this is basically what it's going
to look like and what we can do is
download this template should only take
half a second and then what we can do is
open so this is what we have right now
layout 10 we can open the folder and we
can see it has an index and a style CSS
now what we're going to do we're going
to open our xampp folder and go to
htdocs so once you are there you want to
go to htdocs like I already said and you
want to take this index.html drag it
into the htdocs' and then you want to
drag this style CSS into this and yes
I'm just going to replace it because I
already have one
so now we have an index.html and a style
dot CSS and we can open index.html with
notepad plus plus and then we can take a
look at it so this is what it looks like
see if I can open this larger all right
there we go so we have a lot of
information on here I'm just going to
clear things up a bit we are going to
separate this into a header and then the
actual content and then the footer so we
would separate it right here because
this is the actual content on the page
all the divs and stuff we keep in the
header and you can tell this is in HTML
4 which is fine if you need an html5
format you can go search one online if
that's what you wish and then this is
considered the footer now there's
another thing that I want to look at if
we actually run this in chrome you can
see we have this more stuff here I'm
going to remove that because I think
it's pretty unnecessary
so that would be div ID extra just going
to delete that all right so now the
other thing I want to do is I want to
take this navigation and I want to put
this in the header instead of the footer
so I'm going to put it up here just drag
it or I guess I have to zoom out some up
here so now we save it and then we still
run it in chrome you can see that it
still looks pretty good I'm just going
to drag that aside now what we want to
do is we want to just get rid of some of
these extra paragraphs because it's
confusing me and then I'm going to
replace this with English right here is
our sort of our header or whatever you
want like our miniature header we could
say content and now we can run this in
Google Chrome this is what we have so
far it's pretty simple now we can see we
cut a lot of it down so it doesn't take
up as much room
okay now what else do we want to do what
we want to do is we want to create an
includes file that we can store our
header and footer so we need to create a
new folder and name it includes and I
already have one so yes and now we want
to open this includes folder actually no
we want to do is we want to go to our
HTML document create two new files save
this one
save as travel - that includes folder
and name this one header HTML and I
already have one so I'm going to replace
it and then we want to take this one
save as footer HTML and yes I want to
replace it so now we have a header and a
footer that we can include in our main
page so what this means is that we can
separate this page by taking all of this
header content and we can copy it and
paste it in the header and then we can
delete it from our index page now we can
take all this footer content copy it
paste it in our footer and then we can
delete it from our actual content page
so I'm just going to clear this up some
so it's easy to read so this is what we
have in our actual index.html page we
can save all these and you can tell if
you run this it's not going to work out
right now the next step for us to do is
we want to convert this to a PHP page
because we are going to be including
those PHP file these header and footer
files and it won't work unless it's in a
PHP format so file save as index dot PHP
I'm just going to overwrite mine yes all
right so now to run this we open a web
browser and what we do is we travel to
local post and press Enter so this is
what we have on our page index dot PHP
is the default but if you wish you can
go to index dot PHP there we go alright
so now how do we get the header and the
footer to actually be in there what we
need to do
is first open our PHP and then we can
close our PHP and then within here we
define a title so we say page title is
equal to let's say homepage and the
reason we're giving this a variable that
will I will explain that in just a
minute I don't want to do is include our
file so within the include parentheses
we within single quotes we're going to
put includes forward slash header HTML
and then save it and then we can refresh
our page and you can see it's starting
to look more like the actual page now we
just do the same thing down here we go
PHP close our PHP and we don't have to
make a page title because that's only
for the top and we include the footer
now so includes forward slash footer dot
HTML save it
refresh our page and now we are pretty
good on what the play out now there is
one problem you can see the page title
says home page but on here it says free
CSS layouts the reason for this is
because within our header we we need to
make a dynamic title and to do this we
replace this with PHP code and we echo
the Act the index dot PHP title so what
we do
oops these I mean do that oh darn it let
me open that again real quick
all right so what we need to do is we
need to use this variable and echo this
out as our page title so echo page title
and that statement and then we save it
now make sure all files are saved make
sure that there's no spelling mistakes
or anything like that make sure you're
running through a URL so localhost not
file colons forward forward and then
refresh it alright so you can see that
the title changed the tab up here
homepage now what we need to do is
change this text free CSS layouts we can
do this by typing here on our header and
we can just replace this with poem page
save it refresh the page now our website
is pretty much complete the only thing
is there's some links on here that are
going to take you to other places which
we can fix those as we go so actually
let's just fix this right now I'm going
to make this title here say Caleb curry
comm and then what I'm going to do is
change the link so basically I changed
it to Caleb curry calm as the text and I
changed the link to HTTP colon forward
slash forward slash localhost and I'm
pretty much going through the same thing
here so this one is going to say home
and the href is going to equal same
exact thing they put up there HTTP colon
slash colon forward slash forward slash
home I know I'd be a local oh sorry
local host and then I'm just going to
delete this last one so then we save it
refresh the page and now we have our
basic website complete now within the
index page we can add some more content
by if you just want you can copy/paste
this so it takes up some more space so
you can see what it actually looks like
content actual so this is what our
website is going to look like and we can
change this as we go and that navigation
here is I don't really like how that's
written so I'm going to change that to
navigation : there we go so now we have
link to the home page and a link to the
home page so the reason we have a two
links to the home page is when you go to
other pages and you click Caleb curry
com you can pretend that's your website
name it'll take you back to the home
page and if you take if you on the
navigation you'll have like home videos
blogs or whatever you click home and it
takes you back to the home page so
that's the purpose of two links the
footer is pretty simple so we can add
some stuff copyright 2012 13 boom all
right so thank you for watching and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
