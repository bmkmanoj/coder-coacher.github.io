to talk about the it's pretty much just
a continuation in the last video it's
going to be more on a race because the
last video is getting long so I thought
I'd cut in half so what are we going to
talk about on the last video we talked
about how a race or pretty much just a
list of values rather than a single
value that's to say they are non scalar
because scalar values hold one thing
they are atomic because it's non scalar
it holds multiple values and when when
that's the case we associate a key to
the value so we can either use numbers
or we can use words as the key and this
is the difference between an indexed and
associative array so this is associative
this is indexed and I also mentioned how
what indexes start at zero rather than
one so the first thing in the array gets
the index 0 well now I wanted to talk
about accessing specific values within
an array so once you put all this crap
so here let says all this stuff within
an array well we put all this stuff in
here well how do we get it back out well
in order to do that well sorry about
that I found those off like all the time
it's pretty easy alright so we say the
variable that is storing our array so we
could be like names and then within
these boxes we can have the index 0 so
this refers to a value it could be
people well how do we get this to go to
the screen or to be printed out or to
use it for something well we could just
echo it
like this echo name is more handy just
like this so now this is going to echo
the first index within our array or the
0 with an X however you want to think of
it and in this case it didn't Caleb
because that's what I referred it to now
what if we have an associative array
where within the box we have something
such as let's say buddy like that well
this starts a little problem I guess
well in order to echo oh my goodness
in order to echo a string as a key we
have to put the whole array within curly
braces so it'd look like this I'm not
really sure why but that's an order for
us to echo whatever this points to let's
say it's still Palin that's not going to
work unless we put curly braces on the
beginning before our variable the money
sign the dollar sign I should say and
after the curve the box bracket so just
like the last one we could echo it like
this echo and then we have oh my gosh
where is this going crazy today money
sign dollar sign variable name and then
within bracket within the boxes a square
brackets we have the associative key
close the square bracket then a curly
brace and then we could have a semicolon
and this would echo out Caleb without
the without the quotes so this is this
is the value we would get back
so yeah that's pretty much all had to
say in this video pretty simple so yeah
when just remember when you're echoing
associative arrays you have to use these
curly braces and you'll see that quite
frequently so thank you for watching and
I will see you in the next video yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
