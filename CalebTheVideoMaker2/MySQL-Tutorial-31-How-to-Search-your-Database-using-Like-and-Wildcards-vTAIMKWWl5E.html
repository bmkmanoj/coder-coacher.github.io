in this video I'm going to be teaching
you something really cool it's called
like and not like something write that
out what this does is like will allow
you to match things when you don't
necessarily know exactly what it is for
example you may have somebody in your
database with the name John and when you
have the name John it can be Jonathan
Johnny or John so you may not know for
sure so what you can do is use a like
statement to help you figure out this
person's name and I'm going to go into
more depth here with like and not like
it's just basically the opposite of like
but not not too big of a deal now in
order to do this you need characters to
take places of characters that you may
not know so like this here's one that's
that can represent a character and
here's another the percent sign so this
this will be the wild-card just
basically just means anything and this
is just a character so let me explain
this a little more we have John now
Jonathan could be so many characters so
what this character means this
represents any amount of characters
after the specific point of this
character so I'm using the word
character a lot so I'm trying to explain
this without confusing you if I take
John and put this at the end of it
so John % this is going to take John
with any amount of characters after it
so if we have John 3:6 then this % will
it will accept this because the %
represents any amount of characters this
character on the other hand is in place
of one character so we can have John
with an underscore and it will take any
character so John 3:6 will not work
but John three will work because this
represents a single character so let me
go a little bit more in-depth Wow
completely confusing you these can go at
the beginning or at the end so my name
is gah my name is not a good example
alright so we can say uh let me think
with him
bo alright so Bo so we want to find any
words that start with Bo and then we so
we put up % to represent any characters
and let's say we're looking for names
this will bring back Bob it'll bring
back Bonnie and bring back bond you get
the point because this can be any amount
of characters so this this can be in
place of this this can go in place this
and this can go in place of this so what
you would do is you would say find a
name that is like Bo % so like Bo % and
it would bring back all of these because
as you can see they all have thee o Bo
they all have Bo ah that's funny
bo with that the only one that would be
returned is Bob because Bob Eeyore bond
has more than just a single character so
this represents a single character this
represents any amount of characters if
we put something at the beginning like
that
this means one character can be at the
beginning so let's say you're out of
store and you got your database for your
store you want to find anything that has
to do with like fish so you could put
like this sign
fish and then printed a % again so
basically this could be fishing pole it
could be all fish
it could be cooked fish with spices and
rice but but if you only had a let's say
1 2 3 dashes instead this could be three
characters so like fishing so I
hopefully hopefully that makes sense so
for an example you would just say um you
want to search for a name so you would
say like you'd say where name is like so
where the name is like then vo % this
would bring back ball you get the point
so this is how you would do the query
with the where clause where the name is
like Bo and then whatever other
characters you want to do but having
this and then this in a row is kind of
pointless because that's saying one
character plus any any amount of
characters which is basically the same
thing as just having this so you
shouldn't really have two of these in a
row but you can have two of these in a
row because that just represents two
characters whereas two of these in a row
represents unlimited characters and
unlimited characters so it's kind of
pointless so that's that's how you do a
light clause and a not like Clause is
the same thing just basically the
opposite so we're my choco
basically this would bring back
everything that is not like Bo or so it
want to bring back Bob it wouldn't bring
back Bobby you want to bring back bond
or Bonnie or I can't think of any other
names so uh yeah that's basically I need
to know and in the next video I'm gonna
be talking about something really cool
it's really cool trust me it's going to
be MySQL MySQL engines so subscribe and
click like and see my next video it's
gonna be up so catch later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
