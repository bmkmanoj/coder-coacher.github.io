Caleb the video maker - welcome back to
your oracle series this video is going
to be covering utf-8 and utf-16
character sets now I know we already
talked about utf-8 and utf-16 a couple
of videos ago but this video is going to
be talking about character sets they use
those encoding so we as database people
don't deal so much with in codings as
much as we deal with character sets
that's because specific character sets
are going to use certain encodings so
the only time we deal with encoding is
through character sets now I've
mentioned before that utf-8 and utf-16
are examples of encoding for the unicode
character set but it's not quite that
simple we don't just have a character
set called Unicode there are a couple of
different options that use utf-8 or
utf-16 and that is what we are going to
be talking about in this video so we're
going to be talking about the very
specific names we need to use in Oracle
database the first character set is a
l32 utf-8 and this uses the utf-8
encoding in this character set each
character can take up to four bytes now
there is another character set and this
is where it gets super confusing called
UTF II of course have if you had needed
and the encoding that this character set
uses is utf-8 so way hold up what is
going on here well notice here that this
one does not have a hyphen and this does
so utf-8 without the hyphen in Oracle is
talking about the character set with the
hyphen is talking about the encoding so
here is a good question if both of these
are using the utf-8 encoding what could
possibly be different between the two
well the difference is that utf-8 is
using an older version an older version
of utf-8 that is overall they work about
the same but the primary difference is
how things are stored specifically
things known as supplementary characters
supplementary characters are the
characters that take four bytes and this
character set
the difference with this character set
is that each supplementary character
takes two sets of three bytes totaling
six bytes so the way they are stored is
slightly different overall it's about
the same but since this one is using an
older version almost always are you
going to want to use this character set
this is the default for new databases
and it is the character set you are
going to want to use 99.999999 repeating
percent of the time the next character
set we are going to talk about is known
as Al 16 utf-16 and this uses the utf-16
encoding now we discussed this encoding
a couple of videos ago so I'm not going
to be redundant and explain that all
again if you want to learn more about
the utf-16 encoding go watch that video
over utf-8 and utf-16 there is a fourth
character set known as u TF e the
encoding this one uses is known as u TF
e b c d IC and this one is super archaic
and you're almost never going to want to
use this but I thought I would mention
it in case you run across it because
there is a chance you might in general
these are the two character sets that
you're going to use the most it's
important to understand this character
set this character set and this one when
we start talking about n char which we
are going to discuss a little bit more
in the next video because these
character sets are going to come up this
one it might exist but you can basically
pretend that it doesn't so yeah guys
that's all I got for this video
