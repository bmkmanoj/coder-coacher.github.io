will be talking about what's called the
dominant seventh major chord this is
also called major slash minor now this
is more common than the major seventh
chord and when we represent major
seventh chords we would we would put G
ma G I'm at an image it just say G major
and then we put a seven
well sometimes you'll see just G seven
Mary common chord this means a dolmen at
seventh chord and they're very similar
to creating a major chord
except it's major slash minor so we make
a major triad major third plus minor
third oops and then we just add a minor
third on top rather than a major third
so here's the original formula for a
major 7th chord dominant seventh or
major / minor chord is a lowercase M
which means three half steps another way
to think of this is taking the seventh
chord and a made seventh note in a major
scale and lowering it a half step
so here is a D major scale and we
originally had the major 7th chords o D
plus F sharp
plus a plus C sharp this is a D major
7th chord if we wanted to make this D
major / minor or dominant 7th chord then
we would take the C and lower a
half-step C sharp to C natural so this
is the example oh by the way in case you
didn't notice natural if you don't have
a natural sign it's it's considered
natural and this previously placed as a
sharp so C natural and I can't even draw
the natural sign C natural is the
equivalent of seed I probably should
have said that like a hundred years ago
but this is the formation of a d major
7th chord
it's pretty cool eh so let's try AG
chord well we can follow the formula I
mean we can follow the yeah major third
followed by a minor third plus a minor
third so don't forget the real by the
way so you have G major third from G is
G a B major minor third from V is B G D
and then remember the seventh in the
scale of G is at F sharp so a minor
third a major third from D would be F
sharp but it's a minor third which gives
us F now if you notice this does not go
along with the G Major scale it takes
the seventh of the scale and lowers at
half step so it's actually not 100%
within the scale and causes some tension
so this is very common to put before the
solution of a song for example if we're
playing chords we may play a C chord to
start it out go to a G 7th chord and
then finish it with AC set with the C
chord because it it resolves and let's
show you on the piano to show you what
I'm saying no I'm saying I have my
keyboard and the formation of a major
chord for C would be right here
it'd be quite common to move up to a g7
from here although that's pretty big
jump so we have our water called
inversions so basically I can make it
cheap because the G consists of a G B
and a D if I start from here I can just
move these to do G it's just in a
different order so if I wanted to create
a seventh chord which would consist of
an F I can basically just place my
finger here I could play the D but it's
almost like too powerful so basically
they sound good together versus that's C
to G which sounds good still although
the seventh adds a tension that wants to
resolve here it doesn't sound bad it's
just just bad enough to want to resolve
it does that make sense hopefully it
does the formation of a major seventh
major dominant seventh sorry would be a
major third
minor third followed by a minor third or
if I can get those my heads there's a
little bit of tension but not too much
so that's that so thank you for watching
and in the next video I'll be talking
about some more courts which wirless
thumb courts sorta ish so keep up don't
quit thanks and I will see you soon bye
hey I can see my keyboard hey I can see
my other hand through my head
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
