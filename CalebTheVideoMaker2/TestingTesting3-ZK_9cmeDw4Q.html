started here I was talking what's up
everybody my name is Caleb and you're
probably like what's with all the tests
needed a deter like oh sweet more tests
but I need to test one more thing so I'm
sorry about that what's gonna happen
just want to see the quality of this
when I'm pushing my computer so if i'm
running a bunch of stuff not necessarily
using the internet too much because like
i don't really have the greatest
internet connection but what I want to
know if using my processor and ram is
going to affect this hangout very much
so yeah let's take a look so far seems
alright I mean I'm I'm not skipping too
badly or anything maybe if I try opening
some programs we'll see what happens
yeah let's do that see you no wonder if
I'm going to skip any so yeah today's
going pretty well I reached 2160
subscribers I know it's in such a
specific number it's like I've been
waiting to get that number for so long I
am publishing six PHP tutorials that
will conclude 10 for the week so I i
upload 10 last week well actually 24 two
weeks i uploaded like 13 last week and
i'm uploading seven this week and i
might try get some more over the weekend
so that way i could get a little extra
cuz that's not a ton to be honest I mean
yeah it isn't on 10 videos a week but I
mean come on I could do more I mean Shh
so yeah uh I'm gonna stop it now yeah
that's what we do all right thank you
