off to my pocket okay so now we're going
to practice making sound courts
particularly seventh chords alright so
to start I'm gonna draw staff I'm gonna
say a chord we're gonna figure out how
to make it now let's say we want an F
half diminished chord oh this is an F
which means all the notes are going to
be like this half diminished is minor
third followed by a minor third followed
by a major third three three four so f
let me get a piano here to visually
represent this F and we are going three
half steps up one two three
also known as a flat it's a flat because
it's on that spot one's on on the staff
rather than on the G so we're here three
hits three half steps from this one two
three puts us at B but you see here we
have a note on C so we actually move no
we don't move it haha try to trick you
that we flat the C which puts us at B
coz C flat spot in it boom it's B so now
we're we're at C flat we take up three
half step four half steps for a major
third one two three four eise evan or D
sharp which one will it be
it'll actually be why did I say seven
man I didn't get my voice together it
will be e flat because that is where the
note is on the staff this note it's not
going to be d sharp because we'd have to
have a note here and we don't so it's e
flat not D sharp so that's a good
example let's try a different one
stridor cool
let's try a major / minor dominant
seventh E chord so we start on E which
will give us notes on the lines let's
try this out that that consists of a
major third minor third minor started e
here take up four half steps
one two three four which will put us at
either G sharp or a flat let me get my
marker and as we can see on the board
we're on the G so it will be G sharp
which leaves us here three from this one
two three these are set B and we're on B
which is good oh by the way this is
treble clef boom and then we can go up
to three half steps one two three to put
us on D and guess what we're on D so
that's really good
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
