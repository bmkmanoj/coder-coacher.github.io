PHP tutorial and in this video I will be
telling you how to set up a local server
to run your PHP code on so as you can
see right now I'm just this is my
website I just you know have to
advertise as I go and also I just didn't
know what else to have up here so
basically this is all generated with PHP
code and it uh gives me HTML so I can
inspect these own elements and you can
see it's all HTML so this is a mix of
PHP and HTML we can do this by running a
local server using xampp so what we want
to download is xampp you can download it
by searching it on google or going to
apache friend's dog work once you get to
once you open it you'll get to this page
you want to scroll down and figure out
what operating system you're on I am on
Windows click that if that's what you're
using now you'll want to scroll down to
see download xampp and you'll want to
click xampp
it's a link and will bring you here
let's scroll down a bit and click the
Installer just give it a minute it'll
bring up sourceforge.net and a
downloader will pop up down here now
this is the same exact file that I have
over here so I'm not going to let it
finish but basically once once it's done
you will want to click it and it will
open just like this a window will pop up
asking me if you want if you want to
allow to make changes to your computer
click yes you're not going to be able to
see that one video but I got see it so
that's all that matters
all right and then down at your Start
bar it might pop up and it'll say
important bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
just click OK it should still work and
if that doesn't come up and don't worry
about it next you can choose what to
install I'm going to install all of it
next now the location as you can see
mine says G :
backslash X am yours is probably C colon
backslash
zamp the reason for this is I'm actually
running two partitions so I am on my
second partition that's why it's not see
but actually G so whatever's yours come
whatever yours comes up as that is
probably the one you want to use unless
you know you need to install it other
we're in a different location so I'm
going to stall it install it on G colon
backslash X am next and no I do not want
to learn about bit Nami for xampp' next
setup is now ready to begin installing
xampp on your computer next by the way
be sure to read the Terms of Service
Terms of Service it's good stuff so I
just want to wait for this to install
shouldn't take too long
and I guess I will pause the camera and
start back up when it's done so as you
are installing it this box may pop up
down here which you can look at that
that is just a blank black box so just
ignore it and wait for the installation
to finalize okay so now you can see that
it is finished and it asks if we want to
start the control panel now I'm going to
check that and click finish and this
should come up alright now as you can
see I have some red errors here that it
says port 443 in use by unable to open
process so I'm pretty sure that's this
box here so if we start Apache and start
MySQL Apache is kind of broken so I'm
going to X out of this black box here
you probably won't get this error but if
you do here's how to fix it then we can
start it and you can see it's running
fine so when they're shaded green that
means everything is good so those are
the two that we want to activate apache
and mysql now to access this server we
can travel to local host on our URL or
our search our url bar don't even know
what it's called
web address bar and then we want to
select our language I speak English so
I'm going to select English and it will
bring us to localhost /x and forward
slash index dot PHP so if you ever need
to get back to this specific page and
localhost is not working just like that
you may want to type in /x amp and it'll
bring you to this page so this is the
home page for our web server we can also
access it by typing in 127.0.0.1 pull
and then um enter and it will bring us
to the same page so this this is just
another way to get to this page this is
the IP address that brings us back to
our local server okay so now what
exactly do we want to do well our using
the server we can access PHP files and
we want something to write PHP files so
we could use a good text editor known as
notepad plus plus so to download this we
can go to notepad - + - + dot word or we
can just google search it or whatever
search it notepad plus plus
I'll bring us to the notepad plus plus
homepage then on the left corner there's
a download currently on version six
point four point three so it may be
different for you download and then we
want the notepad plus plus installer
click that and just like just like the
xampp I already have one go over here so
once this is done you just click it but
I'm going to cancel it and I'm going to
open this one user account control pops
up again click yes language English
click Next agree to all this stuff it's
really good stuff you won't if you're
looking for a good book be sure to read
this
I agree now the location same concept
mine is on gee yours is probably on see
but that's okay just whatever you need
to wear if it's if you don't know where
to install it just keep what it gives
you at first
and if you know you need to install it
somewhere else you can change it but
yours is probably see next and you
choose what to install I'm going to
install all of it next and I'm also
going to create a shortcut on the
desktop install then we can check run
notepad plus plus finish and down here
on our our bar
we have notepad plus plus so this is the
change log this has some information but
I think it's boring so I'm not going to
read it what we're going to do is file
new or ctrl n now with here we can save
it and save it as index dot PHP I
already have this file because you know
I forgot I already worked her through
this once and I forgot to delete it but
name it index dot PHP so we can the PHP
is known as the file extension we can
select the file extension by clicking
this type box there's a ton of them or
we could just put at the end of the file
name so I'm going to choose to put at
the end of the file name and click Save
yes replace it ok so now we have an
index.php if we go back to our web
browser so we have the file go back to
our web browser localhost it still
brings us to xn but if we forward slash
index dot PHP we can see still it does
not work and I'm going to explain why
right now see where is this saved it is
saved in Program Files notepad plus plus
back slash index dot PHP this is the
wrong location to save the file we need
to save this
computer and open up the xampp folder
you might have to go to see I'm going on
2g xampp and then there's an HT Doc's
folder if it's not there you probably
did something wrong try creating it
htdocs double click that and it brings
us to all of our web servers files now
within the HD fulk
HD Doc's folder we want to name this
index dot PHP and yes we want to replace
it so now if we go to localhost it
brings us to our PHP page and as you can
see there's nothing on it it's pretty
blank that's because we have not done
any prior PHP programming on our script
so what have we learned so far well in
order to access PHP we need a web web
server so to illustrate this I'm going
to type some PHP code you probably don't
know how to do this yet but that's okay
I'm just giving an example hey and you
can see it echoes out hey to the web
browser for people to see so if you went
to this web page this is what it would
look like this is an exact
representation on our local server now
if we were to run this specific file
like let me find it ok if we open the
computer and then we open the xampp
folder and then I go to htdocs here's
index dot PHP well I could open this
with Google Chrome that's what most
people think but it doesn't quite work
that way so opening it obviously is not
going to work
we can select a program from a list of
installed programs and you could say oh
let's browse and let's look for program
files 86 Google Chrome application
Chrome so now I'm going to open this
file with Chrome
and you can see it just displays my PHP
code that's because we're not running it
through a server on our local machine so
this goes back to the concept everything
has to be run through a server so this
is just opening it on the cert on the
client side but when we access it
through the localhost it's on the server
side so when we ask when we open it on
the client side we can see all the PHP
code that's because it's it's all in our
machine otherwise you want to be able to
do that so I can't open certain web
pages online client side it's impossible
you can only access it through server
but if you get this problem then the
chances are you are opening the file
this way by opening it through here
rather than using localhost so that's
one big problem you will come across
that we'll talk about some more you may
run into so that's really all I have to
say in this video good job for falling
along if you have any questions be sure
to leave me a comment and I will see you
in the next video thank you and
