opposite side today which just feels
weird but anyways we're going to be
talking about data integrity alright so
what is data integrity we talked about
it a little bit in the last video but
this video is going to be going over in
more depth data integrity is just having
correct
data in your database so when you when
we're databasing we don't want repeating
values we don't want incorrect values
and we don't want broken relationships
between tables for example in the last
video I gave the example you have a
table here and this is the user table
this is weird writing like this and then
we have a table over here and that is
the sale table which is where you sell
products for example this is just an
example you can you can implement other
examples but this is just to illustrate
my point a sale is when a user buys
product that means the sale needs a user
as the buyer otherwise there's no sale
we can't have a sale if no one bought it
does that make sense
that means the sale is dependent on a
user and we have a relationship the user
buys stuff stuff is bought by a user
this is a known as a Casillas this is
known as a relation now do keep in
mind that the term relational database
does not come from the word relationship
it comes from relations which is the
mathematical connexion of sets which we
talked about that in an earlier video
but just don't get that confused but
relational database does have
relationships between tables so this if
for some reason this was broken and now
we have a sale that was bought by a user
or no user so for example let's say
sale was bought by user with the ID of
seven okay and then we have a user of ID
of seven so there's a connection the
sale was bought by the user of ID of
seven which points back to the user
makes sense that's data integrity but if
this relationship is broken and it says
the sale was bought by the user with the
ID of seven and then this person is
removed from the database well now this
sale points to a table or a user that
doesn't exist and that might be that
might be practical in some sense to say
that sale was bought by that user when
you did exist but for things that need
to update consistently we don't want
that to happen so that's the example of
integrity issues so you want to keep
that relationship to say okay well we
got rid of the user we need to update
the sales to say well either the person
is deleted or also do something with the
sales so yeah sorry sounds a little
confusing okay so the three main types
of data integrity first one is entity
integrity we're talking about entities
in like one of the first few videos an
entity is anything we store data about
so we had the user to begin with this is
an entity what it means by entity
integrity is basically unique entities
when we have a user we often give them
IDs this is known as a key so an ID is
used to enforce uniqueness among the
entities like for example if we had a
table for users
and we store the the name of the person
and then we store their address no this
is go their phone number yes right this
is when we talk about addresses it's
best to break it up into Lake Street
State and I don't want to go through all
that so we could potentially have a
person with a repeating name so let's
just say his name's Caleb and his phone
number is 1-800-321-8633
onto referential integrity this is the
one we talked about earlier is when we
reference the ID of a table and another
table
if we had a comments table on the
website right and we say who the comment
is by we have a user ID which points
back to this idea over here that's
because the comment has to be posted by
a user otherwise we have a comment that
didn't have someone who posted it which
doesn't make sense in the practical
world so we always have to have
referential integrity which basically
says every time there's a comment there
needs to be a person who posted that
comment and that connection needs to
remain it needs to stay if for some
reason this is disconnected and then
this user is removed or this table is
changed well then this could change I
mean this stays the same and then
there's a disconnection to where this
has changed and this is old outdated
data where either the user no longer
exists and the comment still says he
does or something else like that
that's referential integrity and that'll
make more sense once we start designing
and stuff but yet a domain integrity
that that brings up a new word domain
domain is basically just the acceptable
values for a column for say it's what we
are storing the range of what we are
storing within a database so when we're
talking about tables we have columns so
these columns up here let's say we have
a phone number well that means we should
have a certain number of digits we have
the area code and then the three digits
and then the four digits and that's at
least the u.s. in might change other
places but that is ten digits so we know
that the phone number should be ten
digits and it should be numbers so if
for some reason I put the word
take in the phone number column well for
one this is going to cause an error if
we have domain integrity because it's
not a ten digit number it's just a word
that's not the proper domain it's not a
digit is not numbers and it's not
tenable so we know that's going to cause
an error so that's the basics of data
integrity with when we don't have data
integrity we have errors when we have
data integrity we do something to
correct those errors such as saying all
these all need to be numbers that's how
we implement data integrity by setting
database rules and how you do that with
the database well that kind of varies
upon the relational database management
system that you use some relational
database management systems allow for
general rules saying okay this has to be
a range of this numbers some of them are
more vague where they where they only
allow you to implement data types data
types would be like integer ten digits
so when we talk about practically
implementing data integrity different
relational database management systems
have different things you can do almost
every single relational database system
that Idaho I'm pretty sure all of them
but who knows they allow for data types
so a data type is pretty pretty
self-explanatory it's the type of data
so in database we classify things as
generally integer or text or date so we
either have numbers text or dates that's
like three general categories which
we'll be talking about that more in a
future video but the data type can put
limits on what we're allowed to store
for example
can say okay we only want a character
column with the maximum of 20 characters
that means we can put a string in the
column that says I like people yeah 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
that'll fit but if I wanted to change
this pizza to lasagna well then I just
added a couple extra characters that
might cut it off I'm not sure 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
so that's the maximum we could put in
that data type that's an example of
implementing that data integrity for the
characters so this this will be for the
domain integrity we can also have
referential integrity with what's known
as foreign key constraints which allows
us to connect tables because when we
draw tables we could say that they're
connected in some way but how do we
enforce that in a database we use
foreign key constraints for example we
can say if this is the the parent let's
say this is the users and this is the
comments the user places a comment so
this is the parent this is the child
because the child can't exist without
the parent you can't have a comment
without a commenter well using foreign
key constraints we can say alright if
this user gets removed also remove all
of the comments by this user that's an
example of foreign key constraint
as for the non-repeating data that is
done with just designing your database
in the best way so yeah I know that
video was kind of a jump back and forth
from concept to concept and maybe a
little confusing but I'm sure you'll get
it as time goes on so yeah that's all
