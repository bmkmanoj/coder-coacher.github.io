killing the video this video we are
going to be talking about the char
datatype sponsored by onyx anywho char
is short for characters this is another
type of data we've already discussed the
numeric data types which are used for
numbers well the character data type or
char is used to store individual
characters now what exactly is a
character a character is anything we're
allowed to type input or output on the
computer so you can generally think of a
keyboard as anything on there being a
character so you know you're going to
have a space you're going to have a tab
we're going to have a backspace you're
going to have a bunch of letters a bunch
of numbers all that good stuff there are
some other characters that you can't
visually see on a keyboard for example
there is a null character which you can
represent as a backslash 0 so examples
of characters would be a a which by the
way these are not the same character B
b1 - backslash t for tab backslash N and
when you're writing characters in a
program you will always use single
quotes to surround them that establishes
the difference between one as a
character and one as a number there are
two separate things well how do you know
what characters are allowed like I
mentioned that most of the characters on
the keyboard are allowed but what about
different languages and all that good
stuff well that has to do with what's
known as a character set now the
character set is the allowed characters
and the character set we use when we are
using C is a very limited character set
known as ASCII now if you want you can
look up ASCII and figure out the
characters that are allowed in this
character set now before we talk more
about character sets I want to discuss
binary now whenever you hear the term
binary
should automatically sync to States we
can represent two different states using
zeros and one this could be on-off
high-low yes/no true/false etc the term
binary you often associate it with
computers but it doesn't necessarily
have to be computers anything that is in
two states can be considered binary but
in computers we use binary to represent
numbers and characters and all of that
stuff so if we just have one individual
binary character like this it is called
a bit so an individual bit can be either
a 0 or it can be a 1 now having only two
options isn't very helpful so to make
things more complete and more complex we
can have multiple bits for example we
could have 8 bits so a group of 8 bits
it's so common that it has its own names
this is called a byte you're probably
wondering why I'm going into all this
stuff
trust me this is very useful when it
comes to understanding data types and
data in C programming in any programming
language so each one of these bits can
have a value of either 0 or 1 so we
could say 0 0 0 0 0 this is this an
example you could fill it up however you
wanted well computers understand groups
of bits like this to represent something
in the computer if a programming
language is using the ASCII character
set it will interpret groups of eight
bits so this actually means something
what exactly does this mean well this is
actually how you represent a capital A
so when you make a capital A this is how
it is stored in binary now standard
ASCII actually only uses seven of these
bits so it's going to take the first
seven of these
and this last one is left untouched some
versions of ASCII use that last bit and
those are called the extended character
sense what we need to understand is that
a ski has groups of eight bits the
biggest one or the most significant one
is left alone so it doesn't worry about
that one and it uses these seven to make
some kind of data well since we only
have seven spots to put data there is
only so many options for example you
could have 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 11 11 11 11 11
11 11 0 0 and so forth
if you count all the possible
possibilities of ones and zeroes you get
a special number which is 128 what this
means is that we are able to represent
128 different characters the question is
though how does the computer know how to
interpret this data well it's actually
pretty interesting because if you
interpret this data as a character you
get a what if you interpret this data as
a number you actually get 65 so what
that means is there's actually this
direct correlation between characters
and numbers a as an integer is 65 it's
kind of confusing at first but just
think that every character has some
numeric value behind it it just depends
on how we interpret that data if it's
interpreted as a character it will be a
if it's interpreted as a number it will
be 65 and every single character is
going to have a different number so for
example if this was 1 the number would
be 67 and the character would be C so
hopefully that is a pretty good
introduction to ASCII binary characters
and all that good stuff it's a lot of
information for one video so if it's a
little overwhelming that's ok just watch
it a couple times be sure to click like
and subscribe and share it with
all your friends alright thanks guys
I'll see you in the next video peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
