MySQL my name is Caleb curry and I will
be explaining some cool concepts risk
Hey sorry
someone was waving to the outside but
anyways basically when we search terms
we can actually say which ones are more
important in the last video I said in
parentheses match against and you could
say like cost well let's say I want cost
to be super important I could use a plus
sign and it has to be in the results and
order to show up and another thing the
more results you have this can actually
work better because if you only have
like five results it's not going to be
such great of a search engine but if you
have like billions or trillions or
good.you billion switch down on the US
per but this will work great so
basically these will all do things the
plus means it has to be in there that
word has to be in the search results the
minus sign means it can be so if you
don't want anything to do with mushrooms
because mushrooms are disgusting
then you can say mushrooms so you could
say you'd be searching what is the
greatest web browser and then you'd say
- mushroom so nobody talks about these
stupid mushrooms that you hate so the
next one is a less than sign this will
say it is less important so let's say we
have the word printer with nothing and
this is worth like five points for the
search I don't really know how they
search but let's just say it gives you
five points and then you use a less than
sign it may actually give you only three
points towards our search so it doesn't
contribute as much so when you get the
results you can say oh this one has
printer let's put it at the top because
it's worth five points where a three
isn't as relevant to what you want to
find that was a stupid example now the
greater than sign is actually going to
increase the importance
so now printer may be worth seven and
mushroom will be worth three or if we
this out and maybe worth five basically
it's not going to be as wanted or as
high in the search results if it
contains a less than sign
but if has a greater than sign it'll be
higher up within the search results if
it has stuff about printers so I hope
you're understanding this understand
understanding this
now the next to these ones are for more
specific things such as you say let's
say you say all your base are belong to
us and you want that exact phrase you
can put this within parentheses oh boy
he said you see so that will work for
specifics but if if you don't want that
you can separate the words without
quotation marks what it will do is it
will just go through the words and
ignore that because it's three
characters and so forth it'll do its
thing it's like a mathematical equation
that you don't have to do it's pretty
cool the last one here that I have
listed it's the wild card this is very
similar to the like that we use for
comparison operators a while ago like
four hundred thousand videos ago but
anyways basically this will allow for
anything to be included before or after
a word so let's say you really like bras
okay so bra now if you were to put this
before this word that's that's by the
way is a capitulate or an a strict I
can't draw them cuz I'm I'm just not a
good artist so I just usually just draw
like a big ball that looks sort of like
a star ish kind of thing but anyways
this would return zebra and sports bra
you see basically anything before the
word bra as long as bra as the ending
now you can also instead put this at the
end right here and the result would be
anything starting with bra such as brie
or
breath bra bra bra Oh No Oh such as
great
yes see so this will change I know this
is a stupid example like always but
anyway some it will allow you if words
if you're not sure how it'll be spelled
such as like I can't think of any other
examples that's why I was stupid on here
but a lot it'll allow you to get more
specific or less specific results just
depending on what the word is and what
you are looking for so yeah you can try
that out and there's also a couple other
of these things that I'm looking to
talking about so you can look those up
on the MySQL manual you should be able
to find them there this will not
automatically put things in relevant
order from top being the most relevant
and bottom being the least relevant so
you have to do that a different way so I
will be teaching that in the next video
but before we leave I have to tell you
how to do this because I never I Utley
really actually taught you so they just
erase all this crap before we had match
and then we had the columns against then
we had what words this is where we would
use the code things plus minus less than
so forth and then you say
Booya
or bullying depends on how you pronounce
it
I say boolean but that's just it's
probably not right I've heard baleen but
I don't say things how they're supposed
to be spelled
cuz I'm hardcore I mean said I don't say
things how they're supposed to be said
but anyways yes this is how you say you
say match parentheses against what in
boolean mode my apologies I was
practicing this and this actually goes
within the parentheses here so you
should have it like this in boolean mode
within the against but everyone makes
mistakes right I'm sorry don't hurt me
you should have your terms in quotation
marks and in boolean mode is not within
the quotation marks but it's still
within the parentheses thanks for
watching I'm Caleb and I'll see you in
the next video why do I keep pointing
like a gun my name is Caleb and I'll see
you in the next video wha-wha-what job
my name is Caleb and I'll see you in the
next video
my name is Caleb and I will see you in
the next video cheesy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
