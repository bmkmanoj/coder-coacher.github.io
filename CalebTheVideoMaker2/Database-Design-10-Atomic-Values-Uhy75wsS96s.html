this video we'll be talking about atomic
values so atomic values basically just
mean that it means that the value stores
one thing everything we store in a
database should be one thing when we
have columns there about one thing all
of the values within that column are one
thing we have a column name well what
does a name consist of you can have a
first name middle name and last name
well this although we're talking about
one thing a name it's not really
necessarily atomic because we're storing
three names within one name so if we
wanted to make this atomic the best
thing to do for database design would be
to break this up into first name middle
name and last name so now I have Caleb
Daniel
three three separate names right all
right so when we do store things in
database we want to go we want to try to
make them atomic now we don't want to go
to the extreme where we break everything
apart to where it doesn't even make any
sense but I just think of like atom an
atom atomic when this word came about we
never really split an atom so we thought
of an atom as the smallest indivisible
indivisible I thinks the word a piece of
information in this world now we can
split it but whatever just so sometimes
you may think that wow this isn't really
good
but everyone will still use this term so
just think of atomic as the smallest one
one individual thing stored now we don't
want to go to the extreme for example if
we have the word subscribe this is a
word it's one word don't go to the
extreme where we separate it into like
words like individual letters because
I'd be ridiculous it's like alright we
store in a table instead of having first
name last name we have first letter of
the first name second letter of this lab
first name third letter of the first
name fourth letter of the first name
that doesn't make sense we want to break
you down until we can treat it as one
thing for example an era a phone number
it often has an area code well we don't
want to break a phone number up into
multiple portions I often just store
phone numbers as one because you treat
it as one thing when we come when it
comes to addresses one address consists
of like multiple we have we have a
street address we have a city and then
we have a state we have an area code for
zip code Amin so address is I often
break this up into multiple columns
rather than storing one address with one
two three epic Lane legit California
seven three eight two one rather than
storing all of that in one column I
break this up into street address city
state area code and then that allows us
to run more complex queries on our data
because we can select all of the users
from the state of California or we can
select all of the users who live in this
in this city or pretty much anything
like that so this is part of one of the
normal forms which we will be talking
about in future but as for now just
think of storing everything as one so
not only do we want the column to be
about one thing like an address is just
an address or a phone number is just a
phone number but we want the values
within that to be singular as well for
example we could have a column favorite
movies this isn't going to work because
within that column we could store
unlimited movies and that is also
improper so that's not going to work as
well every single column header should
be singular favorite movie and you may
be asking well how would you store
multiple movies well that has to do with
more complex relationships and that is
something we'll be talking about very
shortly but the solution is not to store
multiple things within a column so yeah
that's all I have to say about atomic
values thank you for watching for this
video if you liked it please be sure to
that's what's different I knew this
scene look different I'd have a litel oh
man anyways thank you for watching
