over transcribing and this one I'm going
to be going over pitch which I kind of
jumped ahead with the chords because
chords consists of pitches so I should
one over pitch first but I thought that
would been boring so I decided to the
courts first so now we're going over
pitch so basically when you're learning
pitch you want to be able to listen to
songs and try and figure out what notes
they're playing best way I do this is to
develop a pitch memory by playing the
same note over and over again or
listening to a popular song that has a
certain note that you know over and over
again and get a certain note memorized
and then learn all the notes so you can
better figure out what notes or what so
you can also do that with chords by
figuring out how a c-major chord sounds
like or G major chord sounds like just
develop a pitch memory then you can
compare oh well it's let's say you have
middle C memorized that's cold and
memorized that's called a memorization
reference so you can refer back to this
note to figure out the other notes so
let's say here's this note and the other
note you're trying to figure out is way
higher pitched on the side and then you
have another note way lower pitched well
you can guess that oh this one is going
to be above middle C this one's going to
be a below middle C that's kind of
obvious but that'll allow us to
eliminate all those bass notes and get a
lower area to figure out what note it is
then you can do the same for this side
now once we get into the concept of
interval memorization that's going to be
even help more helpful because you can
memorize intervals from this note and
you can figure out oh it's a perfect
fifth for example but first just get a
memorize memorize a reference so you can
figure out if it's higher pitched or
lower pitched now some great tips
practice is get a piano hit a note and
then wait 10 seconds 20 seconds or
something then like sing it or helmet or
think it or something probably make it
out loud because that
it makes more sense so helmet out loud
or sing it out loud and then wait some
more seconds then play the note back
play the note again on the piano now if
you're humming matched the original note
that means you have a good pitch
retention and you want to develop that
so let's say you strike middle C then
you wait 20 seconds you have to memorize
that pitch in your head to develop your
pitch memory than 20 seconds down the
road you sing and you play a b-flat
while your pitch memory is a little bit
off so the next time you try and you get
0 C sharp that's a little high now so
you do it again and then you get C and
boom you're developing your pitch memory
slowly so you just give it like 20
seconds wait play the note and then you
can strike the note again on the
keyboard to figure out if it sounds like
what you spoke so here's you and here's
your mouth and your nose as and this is
what you spoke then you see how close it
is to these two reference pitches makes
sense so once you get good at that you
can increase your wait time to 50
seconds or even two minutes you can make
it very long and see if you can retain
that specific pitch in your head to
where it matches the note so this will
get you very familiar with all the notes
the keyboard do this with more than one
pitch not just middle C because that
would just give you a reference bitch
you want to memorize specific pitches
basically develop as close as you can to
perfect pitch remember if you don't
remember a perfect pitch it's like in
the first ten videos of the series to go
all the way back there it's about being
able to tell exactly what pitch each
note is just by hearing it what you want
to develop as close as possible to that
so if you don't have perfect pitch
that's okay that means you have relative
pitch but that doesn't mean you can't
improve your pitch interpretation to be
close to perfect pitch so that's about
that that's all for that but I want to
go over one more
real quick as for getting notes that
aren't specific like if you just want to
be better with pitch in general and not
be stuck to these specific notes then
take a glass like a wine glass or
something fill it with some liquid and
then strike it with a knife or something
don't break it just tap it but boom and
then listen to it but now just just tap
it and listen to the pitch it gives off
you'll probably be able to tell a pitch
and then you can hum that pitch because
you're not going to know what notices
you it might be c plus thirty cents for
example but you don't know that so
that's just building your general pitch
interpretation without being stuck to
specific pitches that you already know
then if you want to change this just
give it more water or less water or get
a different shape glass that's a weird
looking glass but that'd be pretty cool
so that's more ways that you can develop
your pitch skills and that's all I have
per se over pitch and I'll see you in
the next video thank you sure to
