are going to be talking about this third
base case for the id3 algorithm now why
is this so special that it deserves a
video of its own
the reason this base case is so special
is because this is the generalizing
power of the algorithm now if you don't
remember what that means that's okay
generalizing is the ability to make a
decision on the target feature value
when there is not enough data to do one
of these base cases
so I'll write it out and then I'll go
through a little example so if we keep
branching our data and we get to the
point where there are no instances left
for a particular branch this case is
going to get hit what this is going to
do now is actually take the majority of
the parent node data set and once it
does that it's going to return so one
thing I'm gonna have to figure out is
how to give what that value is to this
recursive call so you might have to pass
that in as an argument or something like
that but essentially what this means is
if we take a bunch of people we keep
splitting them we keep splitting and we
keep splitting them and then not the
people the group we don't want to split
no people here okay
we keep splitting the group and
eventually we split and there's there's
a group with nobody in it well what
we're what we're going to do is go back
a step before that split and then look
at that group and figure out what the
majority is there and use that for that
particular split with no people so let's
draw that out okay here is our data set
and we start going through this
algorithm and we're splitting on
different descriptive features so we
take age we split everyone who's under
50 and above 50 and then we do it again
and we split you know male and female
and we're just looking at this half now
because we're gonna we're just going to
focus on one specific branch so you
could do the same over here but just
keep getting smaller here for this
example so now all we have are let's say
females who are under 50 so this group
is females under 50 and then let's say
we split on family history
diabetes and this is how it splits oh ho
ho you can see that one of the
partitions the two partitions has no
data so we split it but this one kept
all the people that's not fair and you
know this might still happen if we're
doing a descriptive feature with a
higher cardinality it might split like
this to where one group has four another
group has one and then a group has zero
and when this happens what we're going
to do is take the parent data set
meaning the node before the split so get
rid of this split here and just take
this data set and then we're going to
take the majority at this point so if we
get to this point let's say one out of
five have diabetes well then the
majority is that most do not have
diabetes so that is what we would use in
this situation so the ability to
generalize is seen because even though
we don't have anyone in this group we're
able to make a likely prediction on what
they will have because if you get to
this point
the chances are you're not gonna have
diabetes because in this parent set only
one out of the five have diabetes so
hopefully that's nice and clear
essentially it's just saying getting to
this point you have to go through this
case anyways you have to go through this
group here and only one of the five
people have diabetes so the chances of
getting in this group and having
diabetes is very low so it generalized
beyond this group and looked at the
bigger group here okay that's all for
that I'm gonna erase this algorithm now
if you wanted to see that entry form you
could have it like this so we split it
down less than 50 female history where
we have yes and no and we get down here
and our data set is empty we don't have
anybody there
I don't know if you guys can see that or
not but it's just an empty box well what
we're gonna do is go up a node and grab
all females and look at their majority
that is another example of how the
generalization works it's just going to
go up a parent and then figure out what
the majority is so that is how an
algorithm generalizes hopefully that was
helpful I hope you guys please please
just subscribe and check it check out
the next video please thank you for
watching I'll see you then
alright peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
