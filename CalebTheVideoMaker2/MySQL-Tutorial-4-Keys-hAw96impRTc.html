talking about keys for MySQL there are
two types of keys primary key and
foreign key but for now let's just worry
about the primary key basically what a
key is is it keeps each entry in a
database separated and unique so you
have a database to store all of your
friends so there's two entries I'm
skimming there's 500 entries and each
one would be assigned a number the first
friend assigned a one second friend of
two there may be some gaps so you may
have the third friend of six it doesn't
really matter but by default it will
auto increment which means it goes up by
one each time the point of this is to
keep each separate line or entry or row
unique so let's say you have a friend
named John and then another friend named
John how do you know like who's who well
you can tell John is assigned to five
and John is a sign of six so you can
tell John number five oh I don't who
that is and then John number six okay so
that's the point of a primary key so
basically here are all the features of a
primary key it's a number Auto
increments which means it goes up one
each time it is never null or blank
never has that blank entry it'll always
have a number never changes because then
what's the point
you'll get things confused and its
unique so no other entry can have the
same primary key foreign key is actually
just a reference to a primary key that's
in a different table so it just points
to a different primary key and the point
of this is to keep everything relational
that's why MySQL is a relational
database management system so let me
explain a little farther two tables
doesn't leave the back table but it's
okay customers and then orders now we
have a customer with the primary key ID
of one they have the primary key of one
and then over here we have an order and
has a foreign key value the foreign key
value is who submitted the order and it
will have an entry of one because
customer number one submitted the order
now for different customers such as
customer number five submitted it then
the prime of the primary key is five and
the foreign key would also be five so
this will basically this table lists
this information for each person with a
primary key so one will be John or Jim I
mean one will be John five will be Jim
then over here we'll list an order for
each individual person so then you'll
have values across here what they bought
a new pair of shoes for seventy bucks
order number seven thousand three
hundred twelve and then uh it'll have a
foreign key to who bought it or who
submitted the order but now the thing
you need to know it's every table should
have a primary key no matter what so you
have the orders what you would have is
an ID for each order say on the table
and you have order ID
I used order number and the last thing
but it could be the same thing the order
ID will be like seven thousand whatever
so each time somebody buys something
this it'll make a new entry so along
across the row entering what they bought
how much it cost it and then a primary
key of order ID such as seven thousand
and then a list of prime foreign key to
the available people of who bought it so
over here we'll have all the people with
a primary key listing their ID and then
over here we'll have a foreign key
listing the primary keys ID so if that's
a little confusing let's say I walk into
a store it's a strong picture because I
like
drawing and I'm like oh I really like
those shoes over there and I like that
pillow too so in here we'll have an
order with everything I bought so I
bought a pillow and then I bought shoes
now I'm the 6,000th person to buy
something from that store so my order ID
number is 6,000 but you see I was the
first person to ever come to the store
and buy something so I was actually the
first person entered into their system
so I have a primary key of one now this
is not the first thing I've ever bought
on in this store this is a long time
after the store has been established a
couple days and there's already been
6,000 orders so the foreign key which
references to me a foreign table would
be one this is because I bought the
shoes and I bought the pillow for the
order ID of 6,000 so the 6,000th order
is a pair of shoes a pillow and it's
bought by the person with the primary
key of one and this is a foreign key
