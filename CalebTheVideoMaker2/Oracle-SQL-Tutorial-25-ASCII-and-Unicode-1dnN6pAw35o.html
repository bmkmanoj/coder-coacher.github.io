oracle tutorial series now in the
previous video there were two datatypes
i mentioned well there was actually a
lot of data types I mentioned but to
that I'm particularly interested in for
this video and that is char and n char
now unfortunately I'm not going to go
into detail on these data types quite
yet that's because I want to explain the
difference between char and n char
because they seem very similar but there
are some foundational knowledge that
you're required to understand before I
can explain the difference between char
and char so I know it's like this chain
you want to learn about this and you
have to go through 30 other things but
trust me that this information in this
video and the next video is going to
help us understand the rest of the data
types so please stick through this video
and yeah let's get started this video
I'm going to introduce the concept of
character sets and we might address this
more in the future but I wanted to give
you a little bit now so you can
understand the datatypes a little bit
more now what does the character set
well when you're working with the
computer there's only certain characters
you're allowed to use for example a b c
d whatever the character set is a list
of allowed characters one common
character set is known as ASCII now
ASCII is a very small character set in
fact it started with only 127 characters
now they came out with an extended one
which is 255 characters but even so this
is very limiting when you're talking
about other languages you're not going
to be able to store all these different
languages with only 255 characters if
we're talking English alone and we have
all of the lowercase letters all of the
uppercase letters and a bunch of symbols
now this will work for some cases but
it's not going to work with everything
especially with the globalization of
software being a big thing with the
development of the interwebs and the
movement towards a new world order did I
say that
this means the ASCII is no longer the
best character set it has largely been
replaced with the character set known as
Unicode Unicode allows for multiple
other languages and Oracle supports a
couple unicode character sets that are
going to allow us to globalize our
software a little bit better and allow
for other characters such
different symbols smiley faces and cleft
signs and all that stuff
when you start studying character sets
you will run across the word encoding
this is slightly different than
character sets character sets are the
characters that are allowed so you might
be allowed you know a b c but the way
this is actually stored and implemented
on the computer is known as the encoding
so if the character set is Unicode
Unicode will have some encoding and the
types of encoding czar what we are going
to talk about in the next video
the reason and coatings are so important
as so that computers can communicate
with one another for example it's not
enough to say that you can use these
characters because one computer might
say that this character is some code and
another computer might say that this
character is that same code and then you
get these flip-flopping of characters
and when that stuff starts to happen you
start getting weird things like random
question marks and all that stuff so
it's very important that you understand
character sets and encoding so be sure
to check out the next video because
we're going to talk about some of the
most common encodings for Unicode and
it's gonna be very helpful so thanks for
watching guys please be sure to
subscribe and also click like and I will
see you and the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
