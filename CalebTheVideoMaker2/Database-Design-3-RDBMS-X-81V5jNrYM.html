design video this will be about database
management systems and because this
series is over relational database
design it will be specifically
relational database management systems
and we'll talk about the difference so
first let's just talk about in general
what is a database management system so
this is often shortened to B DB and s
for database management system and
relational database management system is
the same thing except it starts with an
R so the R DBMS so I'm just going to
write that because it's easier all right
so where we left off in the last video
we learned well actually like both of
the videos we learned that a database
can be used to store a ton of
information so we have this database I
just think of it like a barrel with a
ton of information just pile it in there
so like usernames and like passwords and
junk and transactions and all this stuff
is listed in here and as you saw in the
last video it looked very similar to a
spreadsheet so what makes it different
we have all this data now what do we do
what do we do just look at it No don't
be a noob obviously we do cool things
with it obviously so I don't even know
what that is about
so what we can do so we can run what's
known as a query so a query just sort of
like searching our data doing something
with it and giving us cool results so a
database management system uses our data
and manages it allowing us to view it in
a human friendly way and do cool things
such as search for values change the
appearance of data change the way data
is stored and so forth so for example we
have 6 billion users ok just for just
for an example and we want to delete
anyone who hasn't been active in a
year well without a database management
system all we have is a bunch of data
and we'd still have to go manually do
all that and delete all that so the
database management system is what
allows us to easily run a query
all right select everyone who hasn't
been online in a year and then we can
delete everyone who basically basically
just delete everyone it hasn't been
active in a year basically a relational
database management system is just a sub
category of a database management system
a specific kind that is designed to work
with relational databases so yeah not
much of a difference there so just some
of the things that these database
management systems can do the first one
is obviously run fancy queries to give
us specific results such as give us all
of the treant transactions that were
processed before 2011 June 10th
that's something fancy we can do with a
database management system it also
allows us to change the way our data is
presented
that's something known as a view
mechanism so basically a view mechanism
allows us to change the surface
appearance of our data so when we store
our values in our database we might have
it to where it's we're going to store an
ID we're going to store a user name I'm
just going to shorten these up to make
it easy restore a user name we're going
to store a password we're going to store
an email and then we're going to store
street address upstate City so forth but
let's just say this is how it is for now
here is the actual table structure for
the user table so here are all of our
tributes for a user I'm going to get
rid of this so it's clear well with a
view mechanism were able to get
different views of this data at the
surface level so for example if we had
two people accessing this data one let's
just name him Jim and the other one
what's his name her Jane E Jaime Jim and
Jamie let's say Jim he doesn't really
care about the emails because all he's
working on is to find out information
about usernames and passwords so what he
might do is he might create a new view
of just the username and the password
once again I'm just shortening these
just to make things simple for
illustration I probably wouldn't put
them in the database like that unless
you wanted to go ever so this is a
specific view we can select the username
in the password but the internal
structure of the data has not changed
this is still how it's stored within the
database Jamie on the other hand she
cares about the ID and the email so she
creates a new view just like that so
this these are both called views so the
view mechanism allows us to create
different views this can be used for
database administrators as well as for
other applications such as when we have
a web page we may want we may only want
users to be able to access their
username password and email but stuff
such as the date they registered that
might be all private on the database so
then we can just create a view giving
them the information that they have
access to and that is a layer of
security so basically if we have a huge
database for a business well the
database administrator is going to have
access to it all the president of the
company will probably have access to
but the people who are advertisers they
probably only need to know information
about advertising the the people who
monitor comments on your website they
are not going to need access to the
sales and the transactions they're going
to need access to the the table for
comments that's a security feature that
a view mechanism allows us to do by
giving different views so not every
single person who uses the database has
the privilege of creating a new view
just because you can access the database
does not mean you can do things such as
update data change the way it's
structured and so forth that is probably
something only the administrator or the
owner of the business is going to be
able to do that means we can allow users
on websites they can only ask that can
only access their specific username and
password they can't access
everybody's username and password only
theirs but if this guy Jim who is hired
at the company he can access the
username and password of every single
user that's a security difference
difference between the two people not
allowing the user of the website to get
too much information and at the same
time not limiting Jim too few too little
information so that is a really good
security feature all right so
what else a relational database
management system allows us to do
transactions which we'll be talking
about as the time comes basically a
transaction is what it sounds like it's
when we do something with the data that
for the technical terms basically it is
either complete all the way or it
doesn't work at all if we have a
multiple step thing such as transferring
money to an account deducting that much
money from the other person's account so
forth updating the data
boom saved if at any time the power goes
out and the server crashes and it
doesn't complete well then the
transaction is cancelled nothing is
saved that's something you can do with a
relational database management system so
that's pretty much the basics of
relational database management system
just in case you're not really sure like
the terms and stuff examples of
relational database management systems
or just database management systems
MySQL is one it allows us to build and
run a database SQL Server is one
basically like the microscope you like
Microsoft it's run on the server and
then you access it so you have Microsoft
server we have Oracle database we have I
know how to crown so like post gray SQL
or something and so forth the list goes
on but basically all of the big terms
that you're in databasing they're
referring to the relational database
management system or the database
management system if it's not a
relational database don't really don't
really think of the database and the
relational database as two separate
things they are they're used as one but
if you do want to be like conceptual
well things we have the database which
stores the information and then the
relational database management system
which allows us to manipulate that data
when we have something such as MySQL we
don't really have a difference between
these two
you and everything is just kind of like
okay we use MySQL to create the data
it's stored MySQL is kind of like all we
do the actual files they're stored on
hard drives on a server or your home
computer wherever you're running your
database from and the relational
database management takes the data on
the hard drive and puts that into
presentable tables for people to like
the administrator to view because if we
have like a hard drive disk let's just
say this is a hard drive disk and um
some of the data is going to be stored
like regular other parts of data that's
going to be stored like right here and
some right here well if this is a table
the relational database management
system is going to be able to take that
and put that in the appropriate location
to make it presentable so don't really
think of it like oh we have a database
and then a relational database
management system just kind of think of
them as one and whole in themselves so
it's stuff like MySQL the other thing
finally I know I'm kind of running along
on this video
the other thing a relational database
management system is going to do is it's
going to create a consistency bigger
piece of shop here consistently it's
going to make consistency behind for the
front-end so on a website we could have
someone put their full name in one box
and that can be stored on a database as
two separate columns first-name lastname
well let's say if we updated this and we
decided to make it one column for some
reason which I don't recommend
well the front-end didn't change because
the only thing that changed is the back
end with a database we can have
consistency on our front-end to make our
users happy never having to worry about
things changing on the back end the
things can change for example the way we
store dates or
times it's or our character sets well
that's generally that's not going to
affect the front end unless the data on
here is directly affects the front end
for example if this is a username column
and we delete the username column well
that's going to cause issues because
it's not a column on the database but
basically when we have a database the
front-end is generally consistent as
well as we have server-side scripting
languages such as PHP or whatever else
well that is going to hide our database
and even even step farther
so basically rather than saying oh
there's no username column it'll say
something like error try again later
something very vague so people don't
understand like oh crap I can pack this
guy because I know his database
structure I can figure out how to mess
up his website or business or their so
yeah that was a server-side scripting
language I'm not gonna write that all
because it's huge yeah that is the
basics of relational database management
system hopefully that was helpful and in
the next video we'll be talking about
the basics of SQL which is a language
used to communicate to a relational
database management system so thank you
for watching be sure to subscribe and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
