many-to-many relationship design I
wanted to talk about parent-child
relationships so we have when we design
these relationships a table is always
the parent and a table is always the
child and when we're talking about keys
keys keep things unique and they always
there they're used to connect tables
that are related so every tea table has
a key that keeps it unique when we
create a foreign key it references that
primary key in another table so the
primary key is the parent the foreign
key is the child the child points back
to depends it inherits the values from
the parent for example the parents ID is
86 then the foreign key pointing back to
the parent is 86 it's the top so in a
one in a one to one relationship where
we just store everything in one table
which is the most practical way to do
things we don't have to worry about
primary Keys or foreign keys we just
have one table and that's all we have
then we have columns within this table
so we have the user ID password the user
name the whatever else all those are
just columns within a table we don't
have to worry about a parent or child
because we're not making any
relationships across multiple tables but
when we get to one to many
that's when we have this table pointing
there has many children so you would say
this is the one side it's the parent
then we have each of the parents
children
these all point back to the parent with
a foreign key so we think of like
comments on a YouTube video every
comment has a poster or a user account
of a person who clicked post a comment
that means that the commenter is the
parent and the comment is the child
another way to think about that is if
you if you are given a comment on
YouTube you can figure out who posted
that comment that's because the child
always points back to the parent now if
you look at a user account on YouTube
such as Caleb the video maker - awesome
channel check it out and be sure to
subscribe
well you don't necessarily know every
single comment that that parent has
given there might be a feed in there
that says recent comments but when we
look at the child we always know the
parent because it inherits the values
but the parent doesn't inherit anything
from the child think of like in real
life you can see a married couple and
you don't know if they have children or
not but if you see a little baby we
think all right they had that the baby
has a parent her parents
that's the similar idea with database
design think of this wall here between
the parent and the children the children
inherit values from the parents such as
the foreign key a 7 that tells us who
the parent is that is important I know
it seems like ok who really cares who's
the parent or child just get on with the
database design you knew I'm going to
unsubscribe well this is important
because when we
get to understanding how to design each
relationship we need to understand where
we put the forward key which table does
the foreign key go into that is decided
by the child because the child always
has the foreign key that points back to
the primary key so user ID primary key
user ID foreign key points back to the
primary key user ID so foreign keys
always go in the children primary keys
go in the parent when it comes to many
to many relationships we have problems
with parent-child relationships and that
is why we can't store many to many
relationships in a database and that's
what we're going to talk about in the
next video when we talk about many to
many relationships specifically but just
know that when we have an entity think I
want you to think of whether or not it
would have a parent a lot of the times
it would but other times not so much but
if you think of think of an order for a
store an order needs a parent because an
order is bland you buy product who is
buying it someone has to buy it
otherwise it wouldn't it wouldn't exist
the child would not exist without the
order so let's let's relook at this this
is the user and this is the orders we
can't have a child without a parent
logically it just doesn't make sense so
if there is no parent of the order the
order cannot exist we need to keep that
connection an order needs someone who
bought that order hopefully that's kind
of making sense so yeah just keep in
mind parent-child relationships I'm not
trying to repeat myself but I'm trying
to repeat myself so you get the strode
in your brain foreign key goes on the
child primary key go
on the parrot and soon we'll be talking
more in depth about keys so just for now
memorize primary key and foreign key
primary is the user ID the foreign key
is a reference to that user ID it's in a
foreign table and it points back to the
original table so yeah that's all I have
to say thank you for listening to me
ramble and I will see you in the next
video peace and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
