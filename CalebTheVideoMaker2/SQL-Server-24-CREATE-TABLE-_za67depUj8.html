Caleb's video maker to this video we are
going to talk about the create table
statement in sequel server so the very
first thing is you want to click new
query now the create table statement is
used to create tables obviously so this
video is going to walk you through that
process and tell you everything you need
to know to create a table now the very
first thing once you're in this query
window is that you want to click this
little drop-down box and choose the
database that you were working with the
previous video I created this database
called subscribe you know I gotta
advertise right and that's the database
I'm going to be using so I click that
and then inside of here I want to create
a table for animals
now the command to create a table is
actually very simple all you literally
do is say create table and then pick a
name for that table so we'll say animals
and then you put parentheses now what
are the parentheses for well these are
actually where the columns go
so I usually space this out and tab in
that way it's a little bit formatted a
little better and then each column I put
on a new line but before I do that
there's a couple things I wanted to
discuss the first thing is conventions
conventions are these things that
programmers follow to help them write
more readable code it's an agreed-upon
way on how to write something SQL is
very easy to work with and that you're
allowed to type things basically however
you want so this create word it could be
create in lowercase and it works exactly
the same way but by convention I put it
in upper cases that's because I can't
type that's because that's what most
people do and that way when I'm having a
problem and I post my code online people
aren't like what the crap is this they
can actually read my code because I
follow a common convention in addition
to that all database objects are written
as Pascal casing and what that is is
each word starts with a capital letter
and then the rest of the characters are
lowercase so for example if we had two
words we could say animal profiles and
you can see that there's a capital for
each word so that's basically all I
wanted to talk about for that so let's
move on to creating the columns now the
very first thing I do is I think of the
name of the columns
after that I think of the datatype for
the columns and then lastly I think of
any constraints for those columns so
let's go with the names first we'll have
an ID and then I put a comma to say
there's another column coming we'll have
a name and then we'll have a species so
these are three columns we could start
with but what you need to consider what
data type we want each of these columns
to be I haven't discussed data types in
a lot of depth but I'm going to
introduce you to two of the most common
data types the first one is int now an
int is short for integer and that means
a whole number this is used for numeric
data and is almost always going to be
used for the ID column now moving on to
the name this one's going to require
character data so string data that means
we need to use a data type like varchar'
which stands for variable length
character sequence well might not
staying for the whole thing but that's
essentially what varchar' is the thing
with varchar' though is that we want to
say how long we want the name to be able
to be so we need to give it a max length
so you need to ask yourself what is the
longest name I want to allow in my
database now I'm going to use 50 I think
that's more than enough characters for a
name and if your name is longer than 50
characters you should uh you know get a
nickname or something you want to make
sure you put that number within
parenthesis now I'm going to use the
same data type for species later though
you could replace that with a foreign
key to a species table and what that
would do is it would reduce redundant
data and also help protect against the
mistakes but for now since we're just
focusing on creating one table I think
that is more than good
then we're going to want to end that
with a semicolon of course this is
actually all you need to create a table
it has all of the columns and has all
the data types earlier I mentioned
constraints while constraints are
actually optional so this should work if
I run this create table statement and
you can see that it worked and you can
see it over in your object Explorer if
you go to databases subscribe tables and
let's try refreshing this you can see it
right there
now you can expand it
see the columns right here now you might
be thinking what about the constraints
you know what just because they're
optional we can't leave them out they're
important and I would have to agree it's
always important to have a primary key
because in this situation we have an ID
but you can see it's labeled null and
also it's not unique and therefore it's
really just not suitable as the primary
key so we need to go back to this table
and add some constraints that's what we
are going to be talking about in the
next video thanks guys and I'll see you
then also please be sure to subscribe
