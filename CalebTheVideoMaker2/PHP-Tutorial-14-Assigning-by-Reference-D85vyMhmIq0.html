tutorial and I want to talk a little bit
more about assigning things to variables
although I want to talk about something
a little new so it's kind of cool
alright so you can have a variable in
PHP we can name it let's name it cat
right so we have a variable named cat it
points to a value of five I kind of
think of anything else I don't know I've
used five for like every example so far
but it'll work trust me so cat has the
value 5 cool now we can make another
variable dog and we can actually assign
it the value of cat
so now dog has the value of cat so
what's that mean we have a cat
right we also have a dog
right right you following me so this is
the say Kenneth has five dog takes the
value of cat and makes basically a copy
for itself so now we have two different
variables all right now I feel like I'm
database programming anyways two
different variables with two values they
just both happen to be five
well now what if I say dog plus plus
basically increment it well now the
value of dog is no longer going to be
five it's going to be six so basically
it makes a copy but they're not pointing
to the same value they may they may have
the same value but as you can see
they're both different boxes within this
little example here so it's not to say
it's not like this this isn't what it's
not it's not to say that all right cat
has a value of five dog copies cats and
are they both point to this and
then when I say dog plus plus it changes
this value to six and also changes cat
that's what it's not it has two separate
values so cat has a value dog has a
value does that make sense
good I'm glad it makes sense so as we
have it now the cat is five dog is six
that's because cat was originally
scientist I'm five dog stole that value
who made it its own and then we
incremented it up to six cool cool so
now I want to tell you what's known
about as assigning by a reference I'm
just gonna write down here
a sign by reference and that's to say
that they both point to the same I don't
want to say object cuz then you're gonna
get all confused with like
object-oriented programming and crap
basically they both point to the same
thing entity box value whatever you want
to say and when one has changed they are
both changed so let me illustrate this
to do this we put an end sign or an
ampersand whatever whatever it's called
on though it looks like it's like I have
no idea what it looks like it looks like
this it's tan side then we put the other
variable that we were originally signing
it to so now these both point to the
same thing these both point to this
value of five now when we increment dog
well this changes the value to six now
if we echo cat
well because cat points to the same
place well now the vet the value that's
going to be echoed is six not five even
though we never incremented cat so if
you don't understand what this means and
you're looking at this cat has the value
of five dog has the value of five
because it takes that value oh we
increased the value of dog to 6 minus
mean cat has the value of five well
that's incorrect so it's important that
you understand this means that they're
both pointing to the same place when one
changes they both change when one is
incremented they're both incremented
when one is decremented they're both
decremented so that is what this is this
is not very common this is
used nearly as common as the other stuff
I taught you although you may run across
it so I figured that it was important to
teach you here it's pretty simple
concept and allows you to understand
assigning by reference which is pretty
much a really common thing in computer
programming even if you may not use it
in everyday programming with PHP so
that's pretty much all I have to say for
that be sure to subscribe I would love
that
yeah please subscribe I currently have
2090 which is awesome so thank you to
everybody who has subscribed it's pretty
awesome thank you so much and I'll see
you in the next V</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
