tutorial in this series and in this
series I'll be going over data types but
before that I just wanted to say that I
just reached 100 subscribers and I was
like yeah
whoa I know that's not a ton but man
that makes me happy so thanks for
subscribing
really appreciate it and I'm going to
keep doing this and apparently people
enjoy this or they will probably not
enjoy it but apparently people watch
this or they want to be subscribing that
makes me happy and also I got a new
scenery around me I moved to my basement
because it's a lot cooler down here so
yeah let's get started all right for
data types there's three main kinds and
I'll explain what they are so just hold
up there's all right now when you enter
something into a database has to have a
type of it has to have a type of what it
is so as for that let's say I enter
hello my name is Caleb that's obviously
not a number and it's obviously not a
date so it's a string but if I enter a
number like 2007 then I'd be a number
but if I'm talking about 2007 of the
year then it would be 8 so that's the
difference between these two and I'm
going to be breaking these up into more
specific and then uh more specific
options and then I'll be explaining them
so the first one is string here are all
of the string data types I'm going to be
explaining these alright just think
binary var binary and bulbs those are
all for binary data so binary is sort of
like the equivalent to char which is
just a string of text but it's in binary
and so we'll be going over these three
right here later and I'll be using them
in examples and I'll be explaining these
ones here so Auto sir is these for now
just binary var binary involved the
first one here is char and also be doing
varchar' together because they're very
similar
now basically Shorin varchar' hold a set
number of characters for entry in a
database such as hello my name is caleb
so it looks like this
char and then in parentheses we'll have
a number such as 45 that means this
entry of char which is just the data
type is 45 characters long
so hello my name is Caleb I have no clue
maybe 20 uh that would be twenty
characters of the 45 so there's a
difference between char and bar chart
here and that is char will space it so
it takes up all 45 so let's let's give
it a smaller example of char equals four
and I enter I just like that all right
if I use the data type char it'll it'll
Pat it with two extra spaces to take up
the four spots for char on the other
hand we'll just store as high so if I
have our char four it can take all those
extra spots and just get rid of them and
then when you store spaces in a char I'm
in a varchar' like this if I start high
with four spaces it would it would store
this but see if I it's stored high with
a char and then retrieved it again and
actually remove these spaces to show you
the original input so to explain that a
little bit more if I put into a database
Hey and six three spaces right here just
like that if I use char char let's say
seven it'll Pat it with another space
here because one two three four five six
it'll put that seven space in there but
when I retrieve it it'll erase all the
spaces and give me the original entry
but if I use var char on the other hand
varchar' seven and I store in hay with
three spaces it'll store whatever I put
so it's fine that it's only six one two
three four five six that's what it will
store and then when I are treated these
spaces will still be there so let's say
our data type is char with a limit of
three and we enter in horse as a string
it'll cut off all the extra characters
to own so I only have three an entry
which leaves us with horror which we
don't want that so bar char will also do
the same thing if you put too many
characters in now when you choose a
datatype you have to consider some other
things for example the max amount of
characters or letters you can enter in a
char is 255 so if you're writing a huge
book that's not going to work large are
the max is 65535 although when we go
into the next data type which is text
that will have some more options
so using this many characters for
varchars not always recommended we four
types of texts we have tiny text text
medium text and long text and the
difference between these is are the
difference between these are each one
can store more data so tiny text to max
is 255 this one's off 65535 characters
and characters just like a letter or any
key entered into the database medium
text it's like 16 million and then long
text is like 4 billion I think 4 billion
so much so on when you're getting two
really long things you're going not to
use medium text and long text but when
you're using shorter ones you'll need to
step here now if you remember what we
just went over VAR char and char had the
same limits here so what are you
supposed to use char or varchar well
typically for um say messages or long
entries into a database longer than a
few characters you should go with text
but if you're going with something short
such as usernames email accounts and
such like that then I would go with char
or varchar as for the difference between
char and varchar' that depends what you
want to store if you have an entry that
will change over the entries such as a
name everybody's name is not going to be
the same amount of characters then
you'll want to use var chart but if you
have something that will never change
the amount of characters then that's
when you want to use char it's pretty
quickly because I don't think it's
necessary to have all this memorized
before you start using a database you
can just look I mean you can just up
figure this stuff out and that's why I'm
just teaching the basics of everything
so the last two in this video will be a
gnome and set now II know I'm stands for
enumeration and basically you will use
these when there's options a set number
of options so let's say boy or girl has
your sex for an entry and the options
are male or female please choose one and
I'm a male so this would be an example
of an enum so let's just explain enum a
little bit more it allows you to choose
one entry from a set option of 65,000 so
let's say you can for example the state
you live in you can choose one out of
the 50 states now set on the other hand
that is another different different data
type that allow you to choose more than
one so if you still live in one state
while you live in the other say you have
two houses then you can choose more than
one
so there's set which is one or more you
know which is just one out of the set
options now set only allows for 255
options but there's actually a better
method to do this and that's database
normalization to give you more options
to choose from now if you don't
understand that basically uh instead of
having an entry where you can choose
more than one you should have a separate
table store
information and if you want to know more
about this I made series over database
normalization and I've also made one
over data types do you have to watch
them for this no because you'll be
getting this over the course of the
series thank you for watching and in the
next video I'll be going over numbers
and I hope everything makes sense and if
it doesn't you can ask me questions or
ask me to explain things better and I'll
also be going over this again when we
start programming a database and it'll
make a lot more sense when we're
actually using it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
