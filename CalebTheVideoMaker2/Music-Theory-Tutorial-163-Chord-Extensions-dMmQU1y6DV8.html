to be talking about chords some more
very briefly we're going to talk about
record extensions so this is basically
any chord pretty much passed a seventh
chord and when we add a bunch of notes
so we have a seventh chord which it's
assumed we have the tonic the third the
fifth and the seventh well we could also
have a 9th chord which would add the
ninth scale degree which is actually one
above the octave so let's give some
examples let's say we have the C major
scale so let's number this one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve thirteen so have 13 notes
here alright make sure to skipping c d e
f g a b c d e f g alright sweet so if we
add a 9th chord we could play see ye ji
b and d that's the definition of like a
9th chord now this could be broken up
into two types we could say skip any
notes or not skipping it's for example
we could add the ninth have the normal
cord and add the ninth or we could have
a ninth which includes the seventh so
that's two distinctions you may have so
basically any number larger than what we
normally see at seven is just saying to
keep going in the scale degree so this
would be an at eleven we would add this
F here this would be an add nine and so
forth we have learned enough about scale
degrees that this should make sense and
court extensions should not frighten you
they they can get kind of funky so you
may see court alterations so let's say C
minor sharp fifth add 11 let's figure
this out we'll c minor that's C E flat
and G
we know that because it takes the third
of the scale and flattens it C major
scale is all natural notes so it's a
lower down half-step eat flat sharp the
fifth you flat G sharp I mean I'm just
making stuff up here now at eleven that
means we have to count the scale degrees
so let's do that see e.g i'm sorry i'll
skip skip and stuff c d e f g a b c d e
f so we have an f all the way up here
not the f right here but the f the 11th
in the scale so that is the idea of a
cord extension and then get kind of
funky but now that you have this
extended knowledge in music theory /
extensions so I mean a cord cord
creation I got the my major minor we own
we know how to do all that way now to
make the seventh chords and so forth now
the only thing is to look look for is
occasionally when you add a note you may
get one semitone difference between
something such as c e and g and someone
has you add F for something well there's
only a half step between here which
causes a lot of dissonance so oftentimes
they will have you places suspended
chords when you are adding certain notes
or sharping one of the notes you're
adding so it doesn't give a half-step
difference between a note that's already
within the scale just to keep that in
mind that you may need to alter the
chord in ways that sounds Pleasant and
best to your liking or whatever you want
to say so that was short I don't really
have much to say about that but that's
chord extensions in court alterations
and next video we'll be talking about
something new so i shall see you then if
you would like to support me please
