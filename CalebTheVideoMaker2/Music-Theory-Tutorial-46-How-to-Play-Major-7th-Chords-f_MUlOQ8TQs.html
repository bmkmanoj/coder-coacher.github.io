these are called seventh chords and this
will take the seventh degree of the
scale we originally had the root then we
had the third we had the fifth now we're
taking the seventh this will add more
tension to our song and basically allow
us to resolve that tension and make the
song sound more full not just loud it'll
be more intense so the first type of
seventh chord is the major seventh chord
which originally we had a major a major
triad like squeaky pins which had a
major third followed by a minor third
plus the root at the bottom so now if we
have a major 7th chord we're going to
add a major third on top of that this is
one of the common types of major chords
so there isn't there's more common one
but this is this is important to
memorize or you can just think of it as
a major seventh from the root if you
can't remember a major minor major
because we're just taking the major
seventh out of a major scale so for
example and a C scale actually let's go
with a AG scale we have g a b c d e f
sharp and d we're going to take the root
third the fifth and the seventh so the
chord will consist of G B D and F sharp
and if I'm sorry we wrote that on a
staff it would look like this three four
five
so here's G now we have four notes and
they're all on the lines it would look G
B D F sharp make sense hopefully that
does that that is the construction of a
major 7th chord let's try to create a D
major 7th chord well we can figure this
out two ways we can this is my squeaky
I don't want that piece of crap he's
read one oh we can have a major third so
we have the room plus a major third plus
the minor third plus a major third so
let's try it we have D plus the major
third well Dee Dee sharp what we want to
have step C D E would be to be sharp or
F not eat sharp
we're gonna call it F because there's no
a sharp G sharp also known as F F sharp
so the fourth four half steps from D
will be F sharp so I would recommend you
memorize that a and F there's no black
key between these and also C and B
there's no black key between these so
then you know the reference in keyboard
every single time then from D from F
sharp three half steps so F sharp to G
to G sharp to a so D F sharp a plus four
steps from Bay a to a sharp a sharp to B
B to C or B sharp whatever but it's
technically C C to C sharp right plus C
sharp that is AC major seventh chord all
right cool that's cool so what's the
other way to created you may ask well
I'm actually going to show you that net
that's create in D major scale formula
for a major scale this whole whole half
whole whole from D from D we take a
whole step which brings us to e because
there's a black key between D and he's
the next one after that
so here's D if we take one half step
plus another half step that creates a
whole step because two halves make a
whole
now for T we get another whole to F
sharp the reason for this is there's no
black key between E and F
which makes us jump to the next Blackie
e plus a half step plus another half
step creates a whole step
and gives us F sharp so that will give
us F sharp d e f sharp what's after half
sharp well we have a half so G then we
hold for G trick this today the next one
hold from a will give us B hold from B
will give a C sharp the reason it's C
sharp it's because from B we travel a
whole whole step from B will give us a C
sharp we're just following the pattern
that's a whole step followed by a half
step which will bring us back to D
because C sharp falls down to D this is
ad major scale and now what we do is we
take the root the third the fifth and
the seventh which would be D F sharp and
C sharp
remember these are like basically the
scale degrees so the root is the first
one I don't have the neighbors memorized
but this matter ones this is the
dominant and this is immediate or
something this is the leading tone so
basically I just give them numbers to
say the first third fifth and seventh of
the D major scale will give us a major
7th chord this will be D major so that
is the formation of a major seventh
chord thank you for watching see you in
the next video thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
