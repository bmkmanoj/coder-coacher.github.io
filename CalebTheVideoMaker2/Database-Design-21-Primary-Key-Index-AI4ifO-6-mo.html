database design series this video I
wanted to talk a little bit more about
introduction to keys although I'm going
to go just a bit off topic and I'm going
to talk about indexes so I don't think
we talked much about these in this
series yet but we are going to be
talking about an index alright so what's
an index I'm not going to be explaining
every single detail of indexes because
we're not really talking about indexes
in this video we're talking about keys
so I'm just explaining enough so you
understand how this relates to keys so
think of an index best example I have is
a book so if I have a really awesome
book like like physics or something what
I can do isn't like oh I want to know
about this I can flip open to the back
right and I can travel to again index
and I'd be like okay
mm-hmm oh that looks nice page seven
thousand eight hundred and thirty-two
and then I can read about that well
that's a lot quicker than being like ooh
I want to know about this page one not
on there page two hmm nope nothing
nothing not there
oh no and keep going through the entire
book until you find it I'll take forever
another good example is a phone book
when you go through a phone book you
have everything's alphabetic and it has
the data right there so when you think
of an index and a book it points you to
the data whereas a phone book it just
has the data there you can be like oh
I'm gonna go to the letter G find
grandma and call her right that's kind
of how an index works and it's very
similar for a database we had a table
and it's like a user table and let's say
we have six billion rows in this that's
great crazy number and we want to find
everybody with the name Caleb just
capable yeah we want to find everyone
with the name Caleb
well without indexes
basically the database is going to go
row 1 does it have the name Caleb no it
doesn't row 2 doesn't have the name
Caleb no Row 3 yes it does we'll put
that we'll put that back in the return
statement and then what goes through
every single thing every single row
within the entire table which can take
ages so if we give it an index and we
sort we order that data in a way that
the database knows how to find certain
like it could know exactly where the C's
are well then it can go straight to the
C's grab all the Caleb's and boom it's
done it's like super fast that's kind of
how an index works well what's that to
do with keys well when we define a key
it's actually a type of index that's
because keys and indexes are used for
select statements where clauses and
joins so I could do something like
select everything from users for example
there just like a SQL example I mean
it'll vary from whatever programming
like relational database management
system you use this is a general example
and then I could say where now this is
where I specified sorry drop the weight
it's holding my books anyways I'm
selecting all of the columns and then I
want to select every column where
first-name has the value Kayla for
example well that's how we would do this
this right here this will we're thing
well it's best to have an index for that
another thing we commonly do our joins
which is basically combining two tables
and I'm not going to go into all the
syntax for all that basically if we have
a table over here
users and then table over here comments
and we want to
make a generate a new view where we have
all of the comments from a user and all
of the information about that user we
could have a new generated view and we
can join these statements and how does
it know how to join it it uses the eye
it uses the the key right so if we have
a primary key and let's say we used user
name so the key I'll draw the key here
the key is user name well how would we
join it we would say I want you to take
this table and this table and then
combine all of the rows where the user
name is Caleb curry over here and the
user name is Caleb curry over here so
that way it knows all of these comments
are from Caleb curry which we can assign
to that user with the name
Caleb curry or you might often see it
with like an ID number so it could be
like ID 6 take all the comments from the
user with the ID of 6 join it with the
exact take all the rows with the user
with the idea of 6 join it with all of
the rows with the user of ID 6 and it
combines them individual rows for each
ID within when we make a primary key or
just a key for now what we're defining
an index so the database can easily
access the order of our data and combine
things so that is how kind of how
indexes relate to keys key is a type of
index there are all kinds of types of
indexes and we will talk more about that
in upcoming videos but for now that's
really all I got to say so yeah peace
out
check check out the next video see you
guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
