up everyone is Caleb from Caleb a video
maker - welcome back to your MySQL
tutorial series this video we are going
to discuss primary keys and we've had
some primary key information kind of
sprinkled throughout the series but we
never actually devoted an entire video
or two to just primary keys I think this
is going to be useful because it's going
to take all those chunks and kind of
piece them together so you can get the
big picture of primary keys so let's
discuss primary keys what are they a
primary key allows us to uniquely talk
about an individual entity or a row so
imagine we have a table and we just have
you know millions upon millions of rows
and we want to talk about a very
specific row one row out of millions how
do we do that well the primary key makes
this very simple because it allows every
single row to have a unique identifier
or an ID an ID is essentially a number
that's generated by the database it
doesn't mean anything in the real world
but it allows us to uniquely talk about
a specific row
so imagine you're walking down the road
and some guy comes up to you and he's
like bro can you give me information on
the user in your users table for your
database because you know databases are
forgetting data so this this is a
potentially real situation in the future
and you're like wait which user are you
talking about and he starts describing
him he's like oh yeah is he created his
account somewhere in January or July or
January or February and he's a premium
member and you know all these criteria
and essentially what you do is you start
searching through your table and getting
rid of anything that doesn't match that
criteria so you get rid of all the users
that didn't create an account in January
or February you get rid of the ones that
don't meet any of the other criteria but
you're still left with like a couple
hundred users and you can't talk about
that individual user because you can't
define that individual user wouldn't it
be a lot easier if that guy
came up to you and he was like she gave
me some information on the user with the
user ID of 3072
and you've got like oh okay well this
username has this and this and this it
allows you to uniquely identify that
user that's just one example you can use
IDs for other types of tables it's not
always a user table almost every table
you work with is going to have an ID and
if it doesn't have an ID it's going to
have something to uniquely define it the
ID is known as a surrogate key that is
different than a natural key a natural
key is actually used for something so it
could have came up to you and said hey
give me information on the user with the
username of whatever the username is and
as long as that username is unique it
would work so what do we need in order
for a primary key to work the way it's
supposed to work obviously has to be
unique like I just said so the data has
to be unique in addition to this that
has to be not null that means every
single row has to have a value finally
the data should never change now these
two are pretty easy to enforce with
MySQL because these are constraints you
can literally just say unique right
after the column definition when we're
creating a table same with not null
unfortunately the whole concept of the
thing never changing is not quite as
easy in order to help the data never
change it's helpful to use either an ID
or a natural key that is not likely to
change for example an ID will never
change because why would it the only use
is for the database there's not going to
be a situation where the user asks to
change their user ID that's because they
don't even know what their user ID is a
username could be a natural key and that
might be a good one to use because the
chances are you could restrict users
from changing their username and they'll
be fine with that that would work as a
natural key and it probably will never
change so it's pretty simple to think of
a natural key for a user table but when
we start creating other tables and might
get kind of complex and complicated
trying to figure out what do we need to
force every single road to be unique
that's why I think more people are
moving towards surrogate Keys I think
they're more commonly used because
they're just easier to work with that's
because these three things
automatically very easy to get these two
can be easily enforced and the data
changing is not likely now when you
actually insert data into your table and
you have a primary key that is an ID
every single row is going to have a
different value so you might have one
two three four and you might get annoyed
with having to figure out what's the
next number
fortunately MySQL has a very easy way to
figure this out and get this to work and
that's by labeling that column as Auto
increment kana ran out of room here but
that's okay I think actually that's
where I'm going to start talking about
in the next video that's just because I
don't want this video to run too long
and bombard you with too much
information so be sure to check out the
next video where I'll discuss Auto
increment and a couple of other things
so thanks guys
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
