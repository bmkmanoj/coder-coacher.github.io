speaking of aggregate functions oh yeah
you better stop it also known as
grouping functions so if you remember we
learned about functions that manipulate
a single field of data we have a
database and let's pretend these are
here's the columns these are miss
directions which is a single thing such
as like a mount or like a named Caleb
and all these names and here are the
roads this direction we could have a
function to manipulate a single box such
as upper this will take this information
right here and upper case it well then
we moved on to pop hello for you now
we're on to aggregate functions which
manipulate an entire column for example
rather than just manipulating this box
here and I'm gonna plate this box this
box this box and so forth it won't
manipulate stuff this way but this way
but it I guess it depends on how you
look at your database it manipulates the
columns not the rows so if you have your
rows set up this way and your column set
up this way then it just depends how you
look at it so there's a couple of these
I'll be teaching you about and basically
it'll take them all and sort of combine
them together to manipulate them so let
me explain why would you work on your
videos Thanksgiving Day this is my
vacation yeah that's what's up I'm most
dedicated person that Bob I heard to
spend time with my family and they are
like get out of here loser here is my
first aggregate function I'll be talking
about its count this will count columns
rows and I know I said it manipulates
columns but the way this works is I
don't I just do the salary so let's say
these are our columns these are our rows
columns are a single like just the names
of everybody rows are all the
information for one and
so the columns let's say we're doing how
many dogs do you have this guy owns
three this guy owns four in the sky is
five six this is going to count these
columns so it'll count them and say one
for this one two for this one
oh my gosh no Claire I am NOT going out
with you I swear she's psychotic
then I'll go one two three like this
right and four and let's say we have a
couple more so four then we have five so
this guy has eight dogs so we have five
columns so it manipulated these columns
by counting them I know it's not really
like manipulating them but it's just
taking this data and doing something
with it that you can't normally do
unless you go through into yourself
which takes forever so this doesn't it
counts the rows by counting the columns
how many entries within a single column
so for example we have over here if you
extend the sum we have your favorite
food and since it's Thanksgiving
this guy's turkey potatoes stuffing no
leave me alone
I swear I just met her like three days
ago and she's already like practically
naming her future children oh geez
noodles that's my school noodles noodles
babies no and gravy this guy likes to
turn gravy
so this all right no no this guy let's
pretend you didn't say anything if we
use count on this it would say count the
first one count the second one oh
there's nothing in here so it's not
gonna count it don't count the third one
and count the fourth ones so we have
four not five there's a problem with
this because if you're trying to count
your rows and there's an old value it's
going to skip it so you need to use a
column that has an entry for every
single spot such as a primary key is a
good one you can also use an asterisk or
capitulate which will count all the
columns to give you a good counting of
your database to see how many rows are
within it alright so here are some more
average max min and some you see and by
the way for this within the parentheses
you just put the column that you want to
use for the function these are going to
manipulate data just like the columns
like the last one did so for example
we're going to have a database storing
how many complete pizzas people have ate
in their lifetime I know that's like
really weird but I couldn't think of
anything else so this guy over here
listen name give them all an ID one two
three four or five this guy 30 this
guy's never ate pizza
it's got loves pizza nine nine nine
seven and 12 right so this is how many
pizza these guys vegan or girls now the
average is going to take all these add
them together and find the average of
them all so it's manipulating data
through the column not a single row or a
single entry within a row so but to do
this it would say thirty plus zero plus
nine hundred 9999 plus 7 plus 12 divided
by five because there's five entries
that is how you find the average so I'm
not going to figure that out because
it's too much work the men will find the
lowest one so if you typed in min within
parentheses you put pizzas the result
would be zero because that's the lowest
one there is max I don't know why skip
max
that gives you 9999 and some is going to
add all these up so we would get a
thousand six thousand eighteen twenty
twenty eight thirty forty I think a
thousand of ten thousand and forty eight
yeah you can check me on that if you
want prove that I'm a super genius up
here I used a calculator so this is what
some will return so these are examples
of aggregate functions and in the next
video I will be actually speaking some
more about these and I'm going to be
talking about grouping your results and
also distinct so yeah subscribe and I'll
see you in the next video thank you for
