tutorial series and just wanted to
mention something real super quick
before we get started I keep having this
stupid box come up which is like super
annoying which I just want to let you
guys know because it showed up in the
last video I'm not counterfeiting i'm
not i'm not using counterfeit software
I'm just way too lazy to put in the
product key I know that's like horrible
but literally this thing has been
bugging me for like months now and same
with the stupid Java updates come on
they bug me like every single five
minutes I don't want to update it cash
alright well anyways this video we'll be
talking about strings so I can't type
but that's okay strings what is a string
well basically a string is kind of what
it sounds like a string it's a string of
characters so what's a character a
character is any letter on our keyboard
whoopsies don't want to do that so these
are all examples of characters a string
is just a list a literally a string of
those within quotes so hey yo yo yo my
mom's name is Joe that is an example of
a string so when we do that it doesn't
really do much so what's the purpose
well these are usually assigned two
variables or printed back to the screen
so we could say we could say mom we can
make that a variable and we could assign
it hey yo yo yo yo my mom's name is Joe
and then we could go to the next line oh
yeah i forgot a kind of mention this
this uh parenthesis it's it's right it's
required and programs although with with
this Idol you sometimes don't need it
like if I'm just executing one line I
don't really need it so sometimes I'll
use it sometimes I don't don't I just
recommend you use it all the time but if
you don't need it you don't have to so
yeah then we can print
that out so to print it we just print
mom and it comes back out now what are
the features of strings well the very
first thing are obviously the quotes we
open it with a quote and then we end it
with a quote we can use either double or
single quotes the only thing is we can't
mix and match we can't be like like that
because we have a double and then a
single it doesn't work we also can't
have a single and then a double it
doesn't work the other thing is we can
just open it and then leave it non close
so yeah those are examples you have to
have both you can use either one we
could say hey or we could say hey it
doesn't matter as long as you match them
on both ends alright so what else we
have the syntax error what is a syntax
error well syntax that's the way we
structure our sentences and when we're
talking about computer programming it's
how we program so Python expects us to
close a parenthesis well I mean a
quotation mark one dice a parenthesis
earlier I don't know I'm in quotation
marks but it expects us to open and then
it expects us to close a quotation mark
so when we open one it's looking for the
closing so if it doesn't get that we get
an error so that means okay you didn't
do it right and then it says eol which
means end of line which means it went
all the way to the end of the line we
ran out of code and we still did not
find the ending quote so yeah that's
basically what that's saying it says you
didn't close your strength now when we
do something like this although we tried
to close our string with a single quote
it did not work that way because Python
saw that we opened it with a double
quote therefore it looks for a double
quote to double quote to close it and
because it doesn't find one it expects
that you did not
close your string so yeah that's the
basics of strings with in Python and in
the next video we'll be talking about
some more things we can do with them and
more features in depth so yeah be sure
to subscribe and I will see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
