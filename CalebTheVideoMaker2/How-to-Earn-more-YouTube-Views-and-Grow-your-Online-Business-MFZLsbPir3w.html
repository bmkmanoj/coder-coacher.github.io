the video maker too and in this video i
want to try to make something that is
quite practical i'm going to be telling
you how to earn more views on your
YouTube videos hopefully my audio is in
sync well I'm having some trouble snap
but I think I got to figure it out so I
guess we'll see next thing i want to say
was i'm not an expert obviously I don't
have millions of billions of views I
just have a decent amount and i consider
myself successful now me I do want to
improve but so far so good so as long as
you're continually growing I consider
that a good I'm not trying to teach you
how to get a large total amount of views
because honestly 10 million views is not
that impressive if you don't receive a
continuous amount of views a 16 a
one-hit successful video is not
impressive when you're going to build a
business built on principles of
continuing on into the future a one-hit
wonders not going to work so you want to
build a consistent audience and a
consistent view count so that is what
we're going for we're not going for a
large amount of views of one video from
I'm not going I'm not trying to teach
you how to become viral because viral is
not going to help you I mean it can't
help you but that is not your soul thing
you need to focus on what you need to
focus on is building an audience and a
consistent view count so that's the
first thing obviously you should be
humble so I said I'm not the perfect
expert at this there's other videos you
can watch she might be more helpful but
I do I think I have some quality tips I
can share with you so that's what I'm
going to do in this video so be humble
don't go into this thinking wow I am the
best man my videos are the greatest
thing like I don't even have to put
effort into them and like people are
going to flock to me and come to me like
I'm a king because it's not going to
happen if you're making videos
continuously you will earn viewers but
they're not going to flock to you like
you are the God of the world
so you have to put hard work into it
don't expect an outcome I mean you do
put hard work in and you do get an
outcome but don't don't go into it
thinking oh if I make this video man I'm
just going to be the best because it's
not going to happen keep a humble heart
and stay focused on your goals so that's
the first thing I want to say um another
thing I wanted to note this is how to
earn more views not get more views so
this is a process of work it does take
effort it is difficult and
time-consuming and hurts your brain and
it makes you struggle but in the end it
is worth it so yeah I suggest you finish
this video and consume these awesome
tips because they are like the best
you're not going to get any other tips
that are better than these I'm kidding
ok the next thing I want to mention was
a progressive improvement so when if
you're new and you're just starting out
or if you've been working with video and
you don't have a huge audience or
whatever don't expect to create perfect
videos that's what's great about YouTube
here is Watchers aren't expecting
perfect videos they understand that this
is YouTube this is for content creators
everywhere you don't have to be perfect
studio quality HD video and another
thing one dimension this is sort of from
a business perspective so if you were
into comedy and making people laugh a
lot of these tips can help you but in
general this is getting more views to
build your business and what I'll sang
was progressive improvement so when you
first start out if you're making
tutorials or videos comedy videos skits
whatever you don't need the best camera
you don't need the best microphone you
don't need the best lighting tools you
don't need the best content even that's
probably the most important one but even
that you can progressively improve as
you go and you will still build an odd
it's so when I started out I used my
sisters camera little pink
point-and-shoot saying which had a video
option no crossed that before that I
used my sister's a web cam from like
1960s so yeah my quality of my videos
were not good and the content wasn't
even that good but what I still enjoyed
it I did it for fun a lot of the videos
didn't really get that many views a
couple of them got a couple hundred
which is successful and as I went things
improved progressively so as time goes
on things got better I end up using my
sister's portable point-and-shoot camera
once she got one which allowed me to
leave out of my sister's room talk about
embarrassing making videos online in my
sister's pink walled room or purple wall
I didn't know it was so yeah that was a
definite improvement next thing I
eventually saved my money get my own
camera but even without this I mean
right now I'm using a webcam 75-dollar
webcam so that's pretty good i'm using
pretty cheap microphone progressive
improvement I didn't get this all to
start out with I didn't expect to have
perfect videos when I started and
honestly I didn't really want perfect
videos because I was just making videos
to show people at school and my friends
and my family so we could laugh at him
and be stupid and make make friends and
you know just make stuff so of what I
did so after that um I kind of got into
actual high quality videos what I
thought of at the time wasn't the
greatest but it was still an improvement
and I got comments saying I've been
getting better and so forth then I
started making tutorials I just made a
quick database design series in my
bedroom on a chalkboard and I didn't use
no fancy microphone I use this camera a
canon powershot sx20 is which is kind of
expensive but it's not super bad that I
use that to make almost all my videos
I use one set of rechargeable batteries
which i recharged hundreds of times to
the point where literally they hold a
charge for about 30 seconds and then
they're dead and as time got 101 I earn
some money and I bought like 60
rechargeable batteries so don't go and
do that unto a video making expecting
perfect quality that's what you should
go for but if something's limiting you
don't worry about it still make that
video if you want to make tutorials you
can do a lot of stuff without a camera
I'm just you can use print screen button
I don't know if you ain't even see image
I could disappear where'd it go we go
print screen probably find that on
keyboard that'll take a snapshot of your
screen you can post that into paint and
you can guide people through tutorials
using photos and adding text if you
don't even have a microphone but uh that
that's if all else fails I mean I'm sure
99% of us can do that and the chances
are you can get opportunities to use
better equipment so a lot of you go to
school or go to a college well these
colleges often have either IT section of
people or computers around that will
have built in webcams or microphones or
cameras that can be used outside of the
school and you can get more privileges
within your school if you earn those
privileges and don't do stupid stuff
with the stuff they allow you to do but
you needa like I could use a whiteboard
at my school if I really wish to or a
chalkboard at my school I could use the
school's cameras I can rent those out
even if you're not specifically in that
field or whatever they may allow you to
do that it just depends
you may have friends who have cameras or
other stuff don't feel limited because
whatever you need to do it is possible
so work for it you will eventually get
there that's progressive improvement
well the next thing I want to talk about
sort of like three things creative
thinking analytics and practical videos
so first one creative thinking that is
to say create a a mindset that doesn't
think about everything like other people
think about things try to look at
everything in this world from a
different perspective like observe
people observe how they communicate
observe how we do things why we do
things how do we do some things like if
you think about it it's weird why do we
like I don't know celebrate certain
holidays the way we do why do we set up
Christmas trees or put lights on her
house it's weird but I mean it's fun but
it's weird everything's kind of weird if
you think about it from a creative
perspective why do you do these things
why do people do this why why should i
create content like this think about why
of everything be creative so go out of
the normal mindset think about it in a
different perspective create something
that is not from the normal perspective
screens going out complete my camera
store again okay I think it's good be
able to create content that not everyone
has already done be able to create
unique content stuff you thought of
yourself obviously the subject matter
maybe not yourself I mean database
design I didn't think of database design
I'm just teaching that in a creative way
that allows people to understand that
whether they be really simple minded or
advanced database managers or whatever I
try to make it simple because I looked
at it from a creative mindset and I
thought okay well I'm not going to do it
like everyone else I'm gonna try and do
it this way and I did it a different way
same thing for anything else try to
think differently than everyone else I
know I've repeated that like eight times
but that's pretty much all eps a for
that one analytics once you create
content check your analytics the
analytics are your graphs your charts
telling how many views minutes watch
subscribers gains liked disliked tons of
other stuff what locations you can
access these going to your channel
settings and going to your analytics and
those are very important so you know if
you're growing how you're growing what
kind of content is good just last week I
released a video called I don't know
using YouTube analytics groups to
maximize future success I think it was
that will give you a good basic
understanding of how analytics works so
if you haven't seen that I recommend you
watch that practical videos make
something that's actually useful don't I
mean there's occasions where you can
just create junk if you want but if
you're actually going to make a business
out of this or use this to amplify your
business or anything like that you'll
need to make practical videos or people
are not going to watch them you have to
think about what is the purpose of these
videos whether it be to be in or whether
it's to entertain whether it's to teach
whether it's to transfer share your
perspective on life share your
viewpoints or a life life of one of
those things called experiences life
experience how do I forget that word
life experiences if you just want to
blog but you have to figure out what the
purpose of your video is and make it
practical so something that can benefit
another person once you have your goal
of the video you can do what you can to
follow that purpose to get that final
product that is going to be use of
someone watching it because if you're
just throwing content out there that no
one's going to watch or no one's going
to want to watch then you're not going
to be super successful you may get a
successful video here and there but once
again we're not going for
viral we're going for consistent
viewership alright so those are sort of
like a balance of three if you want to
create a good video content you want to
be creative but not so creative that um
the practicality is not good because you
can make some trippy stuff but if no one
is being entertained by or no one is
using it then you kind of did it over
did it and it's not going to be
practical third one is make stuff people
are going to want to see so you want to
be creative make stuff people are going
to watch and make stuff that's useful so
like a balance of all three the next
thing is consistency so you want to
create videos on a consistent schedule
I'm not saying okay one video every
friday at 10pm if you want to do that
you can but I'm just saying don't take
huge breaks like three month breaks and
expect all your fans to stick with you
because it might probably won't happen I
mean I've done this I've took took in
long breaks on my when I used to make up
skits or comedy videos what everyone
calm and when I came back I mean my
audience was pretty much dead no one
comment did no one watched my videos and
that was that really a cut my viewership
like a ton so consistency even even if
you're busy just try to throw out a few
videos every once in a while I'm
obviously the more of the better but if
you can't create videos don't cut off
cold turkey throw some videos in now and
then and then once your biz not busy
start creating content actively when
you're creating videos you want a
balance of what you're good at a balance
of what you love and balance of what's
practical and in demand so this is sort
of like the last three things that were
a balance you want to do something that
you actually like to do not just
something that's going to get a lot of
views because you're going to be
miserable
you're not going to be able to create it
as well as someone who loves that stuff
and I just lying so I'll do that so do
something you actually like to do
something you're good at once you
understand that you can then figure out
what's practical and in demand so let's
say I'm really good at database design
and I'm really good at designing
costumes okay now in my opinion I don't
really know but I'm guessing database
design is going to be more in demand at
this time period than costume design now
costume design may still be in demand
but for what I'm going for I want to
attract people interested in computer
science business technology learning
science all that junk so costume design
may be something I can do in the future
but right now I think I'm going to stick
at database design because I like it
it's a was the other one I'm good at it
and it's practical and in demand um now
the next thing I want to talk about is
social networks because oh it's so big
thing right now so yeah we get a drink
so everyone's talking about all your
social networks and all this stuff I
kind of take a little bit of a different
look at everything when it comes to this
I don't think you should create social
networks to build more people to your
business um let me get a whiteboard real
quick and I will show you what I mean
all right so here I have a basic drawing
and I'm going to be explaining this so
whoops this little blue thing is my
youtube channel is larger than all the
other blue circles all the other blue
circles I mean the black circles are
social network so let's say this is
facebook this is Twitter Google+ of
LinkedIn whatever I don't care and what
most people see is social network
yes alright let's say blue is your
business so you have your business
focused on YouTube right now and it's
going good but you add these social
networks and your business comes over
here and your business comes over here
and your business comes over here and
your business comes over here and from
doing this your business grows to take
up more space on a whiteboard so this is
how people kind of view things and I
kind of you it a little bit differently
so let me explain how I mean so let's
restart this is your business okay sit
your business and it's going well you
have an audience the blue is your
audience so you have other social
networks so you have facebook twitter
google+ linkedin whatever is really and
what my difference in view is saying
don't use social networking to grab an
audience use social networking to
strengthen the audience you already have
so my view takes this audience it sends
it to these social networks and then
these social networks communicate with
each other which in turns builds the
center core business so you have a
stronger business now so what basically
what I'm saying is don't use social
networking to obtain more of an audience
use social networking to go to stronger
audience who is more into your content
follows you more strongly and likes your
stuff better hopefully that's clear same
i'm thinking how do you obtain more of
an audience well for me i'm not a huge
social networking person so if you are
you may be able to obtain a new audience
using different social networks but
through for me it's using my website
so if here's my youtube channel big
circle here's my little website what i
can do is i can send people to my
website I really need to buy some
markers it's getting bad I can send
people to my website which inter I'm
grows my website and people can go to my
website which in turn grows my website
and then goes back and grows my youtube
business or whatever because my whole
website is based off of my youtube
business so that's how I see it if I
want to obtain new audience I work on
YouTube and I work on my website and I I
try to grow these two things which then
communicate back and forth and the
social networks are sort of a bonus to
the people already following me and I'm
getting really messy here so pretty much
done with that what else did I have to
say let's see all right um if you fail
i'm making an online business which it
happens my suggestion is to build a
successful in real life business so
don't go for a hundred percent online
content let's say you're working in
computer repair or computer design or
infrastructure whatever and you're
trying to make a business online it's
not working out so well what you may
want to do is think about getting in
real life clients these people will then
use your business as your back as a sort
of like a backup to your main business
so think of it like let me draw it I
think drawings help so much for some
reason i lost my marker like always all
right the way I had it was this bigger
circle was YouTube and this was my
website but if you that's not working
out for you think about it like this is
you're in real
life business and this is your YouTube
channel try not to get reflection so you
build this in real life business which
attracts in real life customers and to
help them out you can refer them to your
YouTube channel which they like it they
share your YouTube channel with other
businesses or other people which like it
and then eventually your YouTube channel
gross which can either replace the
dominant and make it you can make your
YouTube your dominance or you can keep
it as a side thing and grow your main
business just thought there I don't know
just what else alright so next thing I
want to talk about was an
appropriateness so if you want to have a
bigger audience you can have more
appropriate videos for a perfect dog for
a bigger audience so when I first wrote
this I was thinking appropriateness like
don't be vulgar or inappropriate but as
was think about it this can actually
apply to more things I attract my videos
are computer database oriented often and
most of my viewers are guys which up
doesn't really bug me but if I wanted to
obtain more of an audience the best way
to do this would be to obtain more
females but that's not always wanted for
example if you want a specific audience
such as guys age 22 to 36 or whatever
then you're not going to want those
females so this doesn't apply to
everybody but if you want a bigger
audience be appropriate as in make it
possible for b2b for a bigger audience
because if you're screaming bad words
and you have a young audience well they
might not like it or their parents might
not like it and your viewership is going
to drop but if you make those videos
appropriate for everyone it can help
benefit the world but that's not always
the case because it
on the audience that you want to attract
so yeah that's more of an opinion one
there I like to keep my videos PG all
right next thing once you have an
audience interact with the audience
reply to comments read all of your
comments um try to help people if they
need help or assist them in any way that
they may need be careful though you
don't want to focus so much on the
audience that your rule sort of changes
for example my role is to teach people
how to program databases and design
databases in computer science and
whatever else business oriented but
people always throw these comments at me
like huge comments telling asking me how
they can build a database with this and
this and this to make it build a page
that can do this all from a nap on a
cell phone and if I really wanted to i
could probably figure out a solution
probably maybe but that's sort of why i
have the videos i made the videos so
people could learn how to program a
database or whatever I didn't make the
videos to attract people to ask me to
build databases for them that's totally
the wrong audience in my case and if if
I was trying to attract an audience that
asked me to build databases for them and
I did it professionally well that's good
i'm doing a successful job but i don't
want to do that so my focus is on
helping the people who want to learn
themselves to be calm programmers I'm
not trying to attract people who need
programmers I'm trying to attract people
who want to become programmers there is
a huge huge difference there so I focus
more on the people who want to become
programmers so if they ask me a certain
concept in database programming I help
them with that but if they need me to
build them a program that can help their
hospital manage clients for example
it kind of just depends on how in-depth
the question is if I'm going to help
them or not so yeah that's a huge one
focus on the audience you want to
attract because if I spent all my time
helping these other people I would have
less time to create content and my
channel would not be as successful it is
now and it wouldn't go up in views it
would go down because all my time would
be spent in helping people who need
programmers which is not what I want so
keep that in mind for those of you
watching I want to help people learn how
to program maybe someday I'll have a
programmer which I can outsource all
this crappy work that I don't want to do
but until then I'm making programming
tutorials and whatever else comes to my
brain ye alright next thing find the
right kind of video to create and find
hot topics so as time goes on there will
be hot topics which you can utilize that
time to get the most views from so when
a new program comes out such as a think
of a good one Microsoft SQL Server 2014
or whatever the year is if I created
videos when that thing was fresh new
it's going to be the most best potential
time for those videos to be successful
if I wait till 2015 they may still be
successful but the actual amount of
views can be cut in half if not even
worse fourth even more if possible so
you got to utilize the specific time
periods which certain content is going
to be the most in in demand so that's
not cheating the system that's not a
just creating content with that people
want to watch you can still make content
you want to do but if you wait for those
certain times or upload a video at the
right time it can be much
much more successful so keep that in
mind like if you made a Christmas video
in the middle of summer it's probably
not going to make a lot of use just
saying support others don't tear others
down to get to the top that's my next
topic so don't think of this as a
competition think of it as a bunch of
youtubers working together to get to the
top we're all going up we're not we're
not competing I mean yes you can compete
you can try to get more views than other
people and you can try to be like the
best in web design or whatever is but
don't get there by thrashing other
people's content and making your seem
like the best that's not the way to do
it the way to do it is to create better
content and boom if you make the better
content and attract a better audience by
being the better manager then you're
going to be the better channel so that
simple you don't have to bring other
people down in that process so yeah if
anyone's looking for your sport you may
want to be interested in that or any
collaboration I don't know I don't
really do collaboration because I think
it's too much work but I do make videos
with other people just for fun ah
alright next thing defining success
alright that's a big one long does not
simply define success but when creating
YouTube content you may think you're
successful but another person may think
you're not it's up to you if you think
you're successful then you're probably
doing pretty good you need to set goals
on what you want to achieve if you want
to be first on YouTube first you better
get started because you're kind of
falling behind and it's not likely that
it can happen but it's going to take a
ton of ton of work if you want to get
there and you have to create really good
content if you don't think 10,000
subscribers is successful go for more
feel fulfill fria it doesn't really
matter to me but um some people don't
need to obtain that and they're going to
be fine reaching a certain amount of
subscribers and they may consider that
successful it's a relative term
objective from one person to the next so
one person Mayhew's success as this and
another person may view success as this
so yeah to find success next thing is
attracting an audience there's two major
ways that you can obtain an audience so
you want to obtain a forget the word
basically a search engine audience and
you want to obtain a returned viewers
audience these are two different things
now organic that's word so you can think
people search mysql find my video watch
it like it leave a comment they may
subscribe but then they never watch my
content again in their entire lives
because they got what they needed from
that one video boom they're done nothing
that is a organic view they didn't it
wasn't advertised to them they just saw
it they clicked on it they liked it
another thing is you make it an organic
view from people searching my content
specifically so Caleb the video maker
MySQL series for example those are good
views for me they're probably return
audience because they're coming back for
a second time or they wouldn't know I
existed so those are the two main things
first time users and return viewers you
want a little bit of a balance of both
this is because if you only get a search
engine viewership you're not going to
have an audience you're only going to
have people who find your video by
search and if anybody replaces you in
search search engine or youtube search
engine then you are going to diminish
and go down and views or whatever it is
so you want a returning audience to
build that audience people get people to
subscribe comment when they comment
leave them a comment back saying thanks
or help them or give your viewpoint
yeah that's pretty much it return
audience make good quality videos make
the video fun to watch good watch it can
be long it doesn't have to be a short
video not not everybody enjoys short
videos but make videos that are likely
to be found through search or related
content now typically return audiences
will watch longer videos rather than the
shorter videos because they know this
person they're interested in him they
want to look for him or her they want to
know more about their lives and their
content and what they have to say so
that they follow that content creator
the person coming to figure out what a
foreign key is doesn't care if you do
one video every week and that you plan
on making PHP videos in the future they
don't care at all nothing not all all
they want to know let's figure out what
they're what they're trying to get out
from this video and move on to the next
video in the future when they search
something else those are fine too
because they're going to convert into
returning people if they like your
content so if they search foreign keys
and then oh this guy's pretty useful I
might be able to get some other use from
him they subscribe and watch future
content as it goes and go back and wash
entire series so forth so if you only
have returning audience the chances are
you're not very you're not going to grow
because no one's finding you except
through word of mouth which is which can
be slow because a search engine can be
very large amount of people can see that
content another thing i want to say was
advertised actually he wrote this back
here but i forgot to say it
so there's two types in real life and
online so in real life don't be afraid
to advertise your business let your
family know what you're doing your
friends know the chances are if you make
a blog post or a youtube video and you
say oh do you mind sharing this to your
facebook wall or oh do you mind emailing
this to a friend ninety-five percent
chance they'll say yes depends on who
they are like if it's your mom or your
dad that they probably will share that
content I don't know for sure but I'm
just saying family are pretty receptive
to whatever you create no matter what it
is they don't even have to watch it
they'll be willing to share that and
they may know someone who may be
interested in that content so in real
life advertising is a powerful source
generally for me not as many people that
I know are interested in my content
because most of my business is based off
on LA based online so online advertising
there's google adwords forums search
engines so basically organic views you
can consider that advertising getting
people to check your related videos
clicking on those in watching more of
your content those are all examples of
online advertising you can basically get
people to go around your social network
circle at you earlier check out your
facebook google+ and once they're in
that circle the more that they're
intertwined in your social networks your
newsletters or whatever the more chances
that they're going to return as a
returning viewer or customer if that's
what you want to call them so yeah those
are the two main types categories of
advertising in my head I could go into
more and advertising well I'm just
trying to give you a basics for
everything when it comes to getting more
views on YouTube okay so those are the
main tips I have 21 so the next one is
to have no going to go through create a
high quality video so there's some basic
tips that you can do to create a high
quality video I'm not the
greatest at it because honestly I think
low quality videos are way funner to
make so if like for example I'll put
something funny or a mistake in a video
just because I like it there I think
that makes the video good the way it is
I need a drink example when I make my
series occasionally I'll say something
stupid and silly and I'll laughs and
like oh wow I'm an idiot I can't believe
I just said that but I'll leave it in
the video because it's funny people like
that content and honestly people have
messaged me saying that the only reason
they watch my videos was because I was
able to keep them entertained laughing
as they learned this boring programming
junk that they don't necessarily have an
interest in but they need to learn for
some reason so that is good quality to
me although for someone looking for a
professional um Hollywood action film
they look at my videos and think wow
this guy is pathetic he doesn't even
edit out his mistakes what's wrong with
this guy are you kidding me and so
there's two different things there you
gotta focus what is a success like just
like um you can't just define success
objectively it's subjective from person
to person i define success for me when i
create content and someone watches it
and they get something from it and they
like it not just clicking like but they
actually enjoyed it that's a successful
video to mine myself I don't think it's
necessary to bake it perfect cinematic
or anything else because all I'm doing
is usually writing in front of a
chalkboard which brings up another point
oftentimes I write on a chalkboard to
teach my programming tutorials that's
weird because programming is on a
computer what I like the chalkboard
because I can teach concepts draw stuff
and that helps stick stick it in
people's brains so they don't have to
sit there and program they can watch me
if they want they can follow with doing
the examples on a computer but they can
learn the concepts so when they have to
actually program it they understand how
it works
I don't really care about if you can
make a program do something that's not
that impressive but if you understand
how it works and why it does what it
does well that's more impressive in my
opinion if you can understand concepts
so I to try to say why things work the
way to do or what they are doing and I
don't necessarily need to program and
that specific example but a lot of
people get upset because I write on a
chalkboard they're like oh you need to
upgrade either record the screen use
some kind of tablet to write on or use a
whiteboard and the sad thing is I
actually own whiteboards I own more than
one way board but i think that the what
the chalkboard is that goes back to
being creative I think that's creative
in my perspective because it's unique no
one wants to program on a chalkboard
it's weird but I like it I'm not saying
I'm never going to use the whiteboard
because I do often I mean you saw me use
it earlier but I think more people ended
up liking the chalkboard thing because
it's unique it helped them understand
concepts in a new way than the people
who dislike it so often when someone
dislike something they'll comment all
get rid of that stupid chalkboard but
then someone who likes it like oh I like
that chalkboard but that doesn't mean
they'll necessarily go through the
effort to leave a comment saying oh I
like that chalkboard but I'm still
almost ninety percent sure I have more
people who like the chalkboard than
people who don't like the chalkboard so
if I decided okay no more chalk board
because everyone keeps commenting get
rid of the chalkboard well that I am
giving a benefit to the 40 people forty
percent of people you don't like my
videos rather than giving a benefit to
the sixty percent of people who do like
my videos so the chances are if I helped
us forty percent of people who don't
like my videos they're still not going
to like my videos they're probably not
going to watch any more content just
because I add a whiteboard it's probably
not going to happen but the people who
already do like my videos who enjoy the
cha
or if I give them chalkboard or other
form of supplementary material they
enjoy well then that will help build on
my audience and strengthen my audience
so that is a perfect example of
uniqueness and I mean I'm not saying no
one's ever used a chalkboard to teach
programming tutorials I'm 100-percent
sure someone has but that's just one
thing that I like that's why it's in my
own profile picture of me holding a
chalkboard I kind of think of that as
like a significant thing in my business
if I ever make a shirt I think it'd be
cool to have a picture with chalkboard I
don't know but anyways yeah chalkboards
get one no I'm kidding alright the next
thing oh yeah have a high quality video
so um figure out how to make a high
quality video and hopefully an upcoming
video I will go over how to do that so
just got understand that success is a
relative a subjective term different
from person to person so I'm not going
to be able to say oh yeah this video is
a success this one's not as impossible
because it just depends on who's
watching it and what they're going for
because not every you can't just judge
success by how many views they video has
because the video that potentially only
gets five thousand views actually gets a
hundred thousand wow that's successful
that person probably is very happy but
if a person made the sick music video
that goes on MTV plays on the radio and
it gets 100 million maybe not so
impressive it just depends so yeah learn
how to make a successful video high
quality videos what you want to go for
quality is also subjective to but um in
the next hopefully in an upcoming video
I'll be giving you tips on making a high
quality video and those are things that
aren't really subjective like being
articulate and talking so where people
can understand communicating clearly
your concepts and your ideas and that
can vary a lot from genre video such as
comedy or business
like completely different so yeah that's
the end of that tip I'm a very last one
is to have fun because if you're not
having fun uh it's not going to be fun
and that's not fun so the whole goal
should be to have fun and get six
billion views I mean last wanna but go
into video making with the concept okay
I'm gonna do this and I'm going to enjoy
it I don't even care if I like I'm gonna
enjoy so many people have the mindset
that is if you're not if you're working
then you're not enjoying it but no no
like this is a lot of work to make all
these videos plan this stuff I mean
thinking of all it's crap i just told
you in the last 45 minutes wasn't super
easy it was work but i'm still enjoying
it so learn how to enjoy work don't be
lazy you're lazy get rid of that problem
laziness is not a good thing people say
laziness is how the world advances
because you invent stuff to do it for
you i disagree i think laziness is bad
because obviously whoever invented it
had enough motivation to invent it so
yeah I thought I say go into everything
with the mindset that oh I'm going to
enjoy this I'm going to uplift people
and I'm going to be happy while I do
this it actually does show through the
video so yeah that's all I have to say
hopefully that was helpful if you have
any questions be sure to leave a comment
