all been waiting for
Oh setting up a database cluster so when
you come here the welcome screen will
show up now if you close it the way to
get that screen back up is well you can
click this get started button or you can
click this deploy button same thing we
are going to deploy a new database
cluster so this is the option that we
want now a form will come up that you
can start filling out but hold up bro
you don't just want to start filling
stuff out because there's all kinds of
these options and buttons so before you
start filling all this out and going
through the pages make sure you're on
the right tab specifically we are going
to be using MySQL Galera so that's the
one we are going to click now we can
start filling out the form now I
mentioned earlier we need password list
ssh enabled and this user here is the
ssh user so we did it with the Caleb
user and we're also going to put a
password so that way the sudo command
can be used once there's SSH connection
so all of the usernames and passwords
have to be the same because it's only
asking for one user in one password it's
not asking a user for each node and a
password for each node that's why I
mentioned when you have a user it needs
to be the same user on all of the
different nodes so we can just type our
password here and you can see it's
extremely secure and down here we're
going to leave all of these checked and
then the next thing we're going to do is
give it a really good cluster name
always you can't use Winky faces come on
okay I guess we'll just go with
subscribe then we're going to click
continue okay more options yeah the
vendor well these are different types of
Galera now this can get a little
confusing but essentially coder ship is
the company that made Galera
and they made Galera for the default
MySQL which is the Oracle MySQL so
Oracle is the company that owns MySQL so
if you're just going with you know the
vanilla default MySQL this is the option
you're going to want to go with and then
these ones are a little bit different so
moriah DB is sort of like MySQL it was
created by
the original creators of MySQL but once
Oracle acquired MySQL there was this big
uproar and out of that uproar Mariah DB
was created
now percona I think that kind of uses
the original MySQL but just kind of add
some stuff to it but I'm not an expert
so if you want to know more about all
these things go look it up but let's go
with Mariah DB for this one now over
here we're going to create a password
for the root user of this database on
all of these nodes so we just type
password or type whatever you want now
down here we're going to actually type
in the IP addresses of the nodes that
are going to have this software
installed so if I remember correctly it
was ten seven 1.34 dot 102 and then
press enter and then also 10.7 one three
four dot 103 and there you go so you can
see we got the check mark so everything
is set up good and you can see it even
mentions it's reachable on SSH so we
know that is good the next thing we're
going to scroll down and click deploy
this is going to create a job and you
can watch that inside this activity
viewer if you click it it's going to
give you all these messages going
through the process in the meantime I'm
just gonna do some drumming it's just
taking forever I'm having one of them
days or I'm just like what am I doing
with my life
Oh usually that happens around 10:00
p.m. but I'm a little early today I'm
like super visionary
so I have like a new idea every single
day of like this crazy business or this
crazy new invention or this crazy idea I
have but my brain and body can only
handle like half a task a day so by the
end of the day I've thought so much and
accomplished so little that I just go
into this cycle of being
overwhelmed and and then just get like
nothing done it's it's pretty bad
so my day-to-day process is wake up
figure out something to eat and then
kind of plan out my day but you know
when I'm working and doing all this
stuff I'm not just working I'm also like
planning my future and my life and you
know what am I going what am I going to
be doing over the next five years and
what are my ten-year goals and I'm
really good at a plan and that kind of
stuff but when it comes to like planning
stuff that's happening right now I can't
do that like someone will ask me hey are
you going to come to this thing and I'm
like well the thing isn't until like you
know 4 o'clock so I really haven't
decided yet and then 350 will roll
around and like yeah yeah go why not I
don't know where I'm going with this I
just you know throwing that out there
oh my goodness that took forever
I literally have the slowest internet
here so it takes a while but we got this
done and you can see down here we have
this subscribe cluster you can click
that and it's going to give you all the
information about that cluster whole
pretty charts so what you can do is you
can click this little logo here and that
will kind of bring you to the home page
dashboard thingamajig and that'll just
get rid of all that activity junk and
now we have just our cluster here so
yeah Congrats guys you just set up your
first database cluster and it only took
you like 8 videos 9 I think this is
number 9 yeah really took you nine
videos now obviously it's going to take
a long time for you to understand how to
use all this information and the goal of
this series is not to cover all of that
information consider that an exploring
opportunity my goal is to help you set
up a cluster I might make more videos in
the future going over oh here's some
performance things you can look at and
yada yada yada but for now we got the
database cluster going there's a couple
more things I want to talk about so in
the next video we're going to talk about
something new still related to this
database cluster though so it's really
important make sure you check it out if
you've enjoyed these videos please be
sure to subscribe
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
