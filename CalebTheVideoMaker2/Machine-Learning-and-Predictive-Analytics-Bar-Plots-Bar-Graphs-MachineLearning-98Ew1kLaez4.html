going to talk about data visualization
it's going to be pretty simple but just
to warn you data visualization is a vast
topic I am touching like the bare
minimal surface and I'm probably not
even covering that so please don't
expect to know everything after this
video in the next video but I am going
to introduce two pieces of data
visualization that will come in handy
and that is the bar plot and the
histogram so let's get started with the
bar plot or the bar graph so you start
off with having two lines here and you
can put features here and here typically
you're going to have a descriptive
feature down here such as sex and then
we're going to split our data based on
target feature values over here so we
could say percent with diabetes and then
what we can do is have two graphs here
one being male and another being female
so this is like 60% and this is like 20%
and this looks at just that group so if
this is male we're saying 60 percent of
males have diabetes and 20 percent of
females have diabetes this allows us to
kind of see trends and our data you
could say wow if you're male there is a
very high percentage that you're going
to end up with diabetes not that high
but the majority of males have diabetes
what this does is it allows us to take a
descriptive feature and split it based
on the different values and then see its
correlation to the target feature and
because these are different you know
one's really high one's really low that
shows that there might be a correlation
the more different they are the stronger
the correlation and as we all know
correlation proves causation so that is
an introduction to a bar plot very
simple it's really not that hard in the
next video we're going to be discussing
the histogram</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
