Caleb's video maker - and welcome back
to your MySQL tutorial series now this
is video number 23 in the series and
starting with this video we are doing a
competition between MySQL sequel server
and oracle to see which one you guys
like the most so the winner is going to
get 50 extra videos in the series so if
you're liking MySQL the most be sure to
click like and watch the rest of the
series in addition to watching the rest
of the series it's very important that
you go back and watch the beginning of
the series now I know the content is so
last year but everything from video 1 to
22 is foundational to the rest of this
series once you got that down it's time
to move on to datatypes what I don't
know what I said there I was like what
mixed with woot Oh data types is an
extremely important topic when we're
talking about creating databases that's
because every single piece of
information we store in a database has
to have a data type so when we create a
table we have to give the columns right
years and let's say we say food ID this
is not enough for the table following
the column name we have to put the data
type of the data that's going to be
stored inside of this column so think of
us having a table one of the columns is
food ID every single value for this
column every single row is going to have
to have data of a certain data type what
is the benefit of this though well if
the database has all of the same type of
data for a column it's able to work with
that data faster it's able to optimize
storage and it's able to restrict
incorrect data you know data that
doesn't fit that data type but I might
be jumping ahead did we really figure
out what a data type is a data type put
simply is the type of data I know that
totally wasn't helpful but think of the
type of data
and we can categorize the types into
three main categories these are like the
three categories we start with and then
later hopefully we'll learn some more
three categories include numeric string
and temporal now within each of these
categories there are specific data types
that we are going to learn about but if
we're just talking about categories what
determines a numeric data type well it's
actually anything dealing with numbers
and generally these are numbers that we
can quantize quanta size I don't
remember the word but any number that
has actual numeric meaning so for
example this column here has a numeric
meaning because we are going to be
storing an ID here but if we have a
phone number which I know doesn't really
go well with this food table but let's
just say well those numbers don't
actually have numeric meaning
essentially the important thing to know
is that numeric data types deal with
numbers so think salaries IDs prices
discounts et Cie you know moving on to
string data this is anything within
quotes so think of like something like
this this is a string now in databases
it's generally a proof that we want to
use single quotes for Strings now each
one of these is known as a characters so
there's five characters h-e-l-l-o and
other characters would include numbers
yeah you can actually store numbers in a
string so you could say that strings are
alphanumeric meaning alpha four alphabet
and numeric four numbers but the
database interprets that data
differently because we say is a type
string other data that you could put in
quotes include symbols you can put
spaces newline characters and even
symbols from different languages and
lastly we have the temporal data type
this is anything dealing with dates and
time so if you think you want to store a
date or the time that something was done
you will want to use a data type that is
of the temporal
category and as always the categories
kind of just help us out but we don't
actually have to tell the database what
category we are using for example in
this create table if we put something
here such as int that's enough for the
database we don't have to say int
numeric or something it's it's redundant
because that's all the database is going
to need to know how to treat this column
now one last thing with datatypes is to
consider storage so certain Onix bless
you
so with storage certain datatypes allow
us to change how much data we can store
in that column and the general rule is
that you want to store the minimum that
is enough to store what we need for
example if we know that we are going to
store only maybe 20 rows in this ID
column there would be no benefit of
grabbing the largest numeric data type
the same thing goes with strings if we
know we are going to be storing strings
that are never longer than 15 characters
for example let's say we're storing
phone numbers there's no need to make a
string datatype that is like stinking
huge okay just keep it to the smallest
that is needed and no extra if you're
unsure though be sure to go on the
larger size because it would be better
to be on that side than to be too small
and have to go and change things overall
that's a pretty rough introduction to
data types hopefully in the next
upcoming videos you will learn more data
types in more depth and that will allow
us to create our tables really super
good hey guys no dang it oh look at it
so yeah guys see you in the next video
and as always please sure to click like
and subscribe yeah I don't have anything
else to say see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
