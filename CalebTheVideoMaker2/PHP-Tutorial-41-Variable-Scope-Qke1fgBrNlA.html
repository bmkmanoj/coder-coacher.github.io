tutorial and in this video I want to
talk about variable scope so what this
means is it's not saying like a scope
like a gun or anything like that a scope
in PHP is saying what can use this
variable so every variable has a scope
I'm not sure if I talked about global
variables or not but for example if you
have two pages and we have a variable X
over here well both by default this
variable cannot be accessed by this
other website the same thing is if you
have a function within this page with
the variable X well you're not going to
be able to use this variable down here
unless it's a global variable a global
variable means it can be used anywhere
on the page so basically let me just
explain this from the beginning
variables have a scope that means they
can be used in certain areas so here is
our web page or our a programming code
and we have a variable X which has the
value 20 okay and we open our PHP which
I'm not gonna do that here just showing
you well if we then use this variable
down here by obviously this variable is
going to be able to be accessed here but
if we have a function down here then we
create and we say the variable X is
equal to 45 well this is these two have
different variable scopes so that means
this X is different than this X this is
a function level scope this is a
complete page scope so basically they
are pointing to two different variables
the best way I can illustrate this is
use
a whiteboard and colored markers so I
guess I'll use red to illustrate our
page so up here we define a okay of
course not gonna work
try this one alright this one should
work so up here we define the variable
alright so yeah let me try this because
obviously I'm having difficulties we use
blue the variable X has the value 20
okay that means we have a variable so
this box is the variable and the
variable is X and it has the value 20
all right now we have a function I'm
going to do that green
so now what we have is a variable X with
the value 30 well this is actually a
different variable it's weird but now we
have two variable X's which both point
to two different values so this X points
to 20 this X points to 30 so then if we
change the value of the variable X out
here in blue then well that's going to
change the value of the first X up here
to 45 so as you can see by changing the
value of x we cannot even affect the X
within the function that's because that
X is only available within that function
so the only way we could change this
value is by doing that within the
function which would then give the X the
final value 35 so that's just what you
need to think of that's how that is
going to work so obviously if you create
a variable up here and you reuse it in
here it's not going to work to create a
variable in here and reuse it out here
it's not going to work this is where the
idea of global variables come in if we
wanted to have in a global variable we
could before we define it use the word
global
oh crap so it's equal to 30 well then
what this is going to do is it is going
to create a global X that means our
green x variable x and our blue variable
X both point to what's known as the
global global variable basically these
are the same variable now and we get an
overall variable X yeah my Reds are not
working nope
there we go
so now both of these basically combine
to create one global X which will point
to the most recent value so if we
defining here 20 it's now going to point
to 20 but then as we go on in the
program we'd reach this function we
change that value to 30 and then out
here if we use the same variable it's
going to change it to whatever we make
it out there just to make sure when
you're defining it that you have to put
the word global before it so otherwise
it's not going to point to that global
variable it's going to point to that
specific variable within that function
or whatever else like that um another
thing to remember is if you include a
file so if you have your actual page and
you include a title or a header within
your page and you define a variable up
here obviously they are connected to be
like one page so that means you can use
this variable down here but if you
define a variable down here you can't
use it before you can only use it after
so you're not going to be used able to
use variable
I unless you define it before it's used
that's sort of like what we talked about
in the last video you have to define the
page title before you can use it also if
you create so if you create a a variable
in here you can only use it after the
include if you create it in here you can
only use it after the include it's
always after so yeah that's the basics
of an area below p-- so hopefully that
was helpful and I will see you in the
next video thank you and subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
