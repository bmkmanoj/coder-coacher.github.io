video maker - in my spanking new attire
good boy oh you I know you guys are
dying to know we're going to talk about
in this video well we're going to talk
about the details of Oracle constraints
I know we've spoken of constraints but
we haven't actually gone into detail of
what the keywords are to make
constraints and we only really talked
about foreign key constraints and a
couple other things so this video my
chalk got chalk on my brand-new shirt
the goal of this video is to go over
most of the constraints you're going to
run into when you're working with Oracle
database so what is a constraint a
constraint is basically a rule of what
data we allow in a column another way to
think about it is it forces the database
to work or allow certain things so
foreign key constraints force a column
to reference a row of another table or
of the same table there's also other
kinds of constraints though not just
foreign key constraints although that is
one type of constraint the first
constraint is not null this is when you
command a column to always require a
value a null is the absence of a value
and something that kind of bugs me is
when people say a null value because
it's like saying a nothing something
what the second on the list is primary
key but you better not forget about that
foreign key now these two you kind of
get how they work because we've talked
about it I swear my dog is silent all
day until I make a video and then she's
just like all over everything
you kind of already get how these work
but these are key words you're going to
have to use to tell Oracle that hey this
is a primary key or hey this is a
foreign key the next constraint is
called a check constraint and if you
ever heard of this one you should really
check it out there is another one we're
going to talk about and that's the
unique
me now another keyword you're going to
run into and I don't think this is
technically a constraint but I'm going
to write it anyways it's default now all
of these should be an uppercase but I
didn't realize I was writing my
lowercase until I was already like here
and by then it was it was too much to
have to rewrite now we're going to go
through some of these and talk about
some details that way you know what each
one of these means we discussed not null
and unique should be pretty obvious when
you put unique on a column it's saying
that every single row has to have a
unique value so you couldn't have one
row with a value 5 and then another row
with the value 5 that would not work out
primary key is essentially the
combination of not and all and unique
that's because a primary key always
needs to be unique so we can uniquely
identify that row and it always needs to
have a value another thing for the
primary key is that it shouldn't change
if you can design your database that way
that is a huge plus de foreign key
constraint tells the database that every
value in this column has to match a
value of another column oftentimes the
foreign key is going to reference the
primary key meaning every single row in
that column has to have a value that
exists in another table's primary key or
that table's primary key so if you have
this table and we have a couple values
in it such as 5 6 7 8 and over here we
have another table and we need to put
data into this so we label the column as
a foreign key that means the value 5
would be acceptable 6 7 &amp;amp; 8 would be
acceptable but if you put something like
10 that's unacceptable that's because
this value doesn't exist in the column
that we're referencing this would likely
be the primary key and this would be the
foreign key that you would tell it to
reference this column now moving on to
the check constraint this one is
actually really really super cool and
I'm excited to get into this one in more
detail in future videos the check
constraint allows us to restrict more
specifically on what data we allow or
don't allow
think of it like this the unique says
hey they all have to be different be not
null says everything has to have a value
but what if we want to be more specific
like the value has to be between ten and
a hundred that is where a check
constraint might be useful for you
because you can say things like that
essentially we're going to give it a
boolean expression a boolean expression
always evaluates true or false an
example of this is if you had a banking
application you could make a minimum
transaction right so let's say you're
allowed to transfer money from account
to account but you have to do at least
$5 or $1 it doesn't really matter and no
more than $1,000 so you could say
something like between one and a
thousand and then you have to say what
column so you could say something like
transfer amount so I kind of run out of
space thing but this is a boolean
expression is the transfer amount
between one and a thousand the options
are yes and if that's the case it'd be
true and the data would be inserted or
it could be no which is false and that's
is not going to work out for you now the
default keyword can be used very
similarly to continue on with our
banking application you could have it so
when you create an account
the default balance of that account is
zero now that you kind of get a gist of
what all these do how do you actually
implement these in a database
well that's we're going to start diving
into in the upcoming videos so be sure
to check those out hopefully you guys
are enjoying the series it's a lot of
fun for me I'm really enjoying it so
please stick along and be sure subscribe
and you know like all the videos and all
those good things means a lot to me so
thank you and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
