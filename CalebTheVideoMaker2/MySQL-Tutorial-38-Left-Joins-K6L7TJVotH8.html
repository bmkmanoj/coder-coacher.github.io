of outer joins let me draw this out
it'll make it a lot more clear I think I
think I should have done this a little
better in the last video so I'm gonna
try and fix it now here we have what's
called a Venn diagram but doesn't really
matter what it's called
nobody cares but um here is our let are
one of our tables and here represents
another one of our tables now if we have
something that's in both tables such as
a foreign key from this one into this
one like ID six which is a referencing
the person in this table like a in a in
a store we're going to have an online
store we're going to have the users of
the customers that are going to have the
items I mean uh sorry the orders and
then we're going to have comments or
reviews on the items from the people now
let this table represents the users this
represents the comments from the users
and let's say Caleb this guy right here
has a user ID of seven right and he is
within the users table so we have Caleb
here the ID seven right here and then he
left a comment on one of the items right
so seven is over here so y-you can see
where they overlap what you can do is
rather than putting them in separate and
when you imagine this in your head just
consider them as in both the two in both
of the tables so it's in the center
because you can see they should be in
both tables but we put them in the
center to represent that they're in both
tables now this guy over here this girl
over here struggle yeah yeah girl
um I suck at drawing but uh she has the
ID of eight and she bought up as a
customer but she's never actually left a
comment on anything so she's over here
not over here because this represent
comments this represents the users chalo
is in the center because he left a
comment and he's a user now an inner
join what it is going to do is going to
take all the information from the center
that doesn't look right and create a new
table so he will be in this table but
she will not because it's an inner join
and it's only going to take the stuff
that overlaps so if I need all of the
people who have made orders then I will
use an inner join this is different from
an outer join which is going to take the
information that is not included in just
the center so if we break down an outer
join there's actually a left and outer
and a right join so what's that mean
it's just basically where we get the
information from so I'll always use the
left join just because consistency
because it doesn't really matter because
you can alter the way things are set up
and you'll get the same results so if I
want a left join it will take the left
table and the table where their inner
lapping so it'll basically just get this
table out of its mind and you can see
that these are both in the same table so
basically it's going to take these
results and bring them down into a new
table so we have the customer seven and
a customer eight customer seven left to
review good customer eight didn't say
anything so we get the result normal if
we used an inner join the only thing
that would be returned is this that's
the difference between an outer join in
an inner join and if we used an outer
join as a right bow as a right join then
it would ignore this because it's not on
the right side so if we add a review by
a person who didn't exist in the users
table which shouldn't happen then then
we would have this we would have the
user Knoll left the review great
and so on my back that is how the
joining works so this here should
actually say left join I wasn't paying
attention when I wrote that the reason
for this is we have to specify what type
of outer joint as you remember there's
three left we'll get the left table and
the center where they overlap and the
right will right outer join we'll get
the right in the center and then there's
full which will get the left right and
center where they overlap this is very
similar to an inner join
what are we selecting we're selecting
the users and we're also selecting their
reviews so we select the users name the
users ID the review ID and the review
content what it says and this is with
adults in tech so table name here column
name here with a period in between then
from we're going to put the left table
and arm and in our heads the way we drew
it first so from we had users and then
we're left joining a reviews reviews
table and for on you just need to put
where something is equal so the user ID
within the users table is equal to the
user ID within the review table because
they reference each the one reference is
the main user that is all app to say for
now about inner and outer joins on the
chalkboard and I may actually come back
and explain some things more if I
realize that I didn't explain this very
well or if I forgot something so what's
going to happen next is I'm going to be
doing inner and outer joins in
phpMyAdmin with my SQL so catch you
there and you'll catch me there sweet
and if you have any questions in comment
and I may make a new video or explain it
somehow and I know it's kind of
confusing at first but just stick with
it and I swear that it will start
sticking and it will
make more sense I know I say that about
everything but when you first start
learning about something it's usually
confused confusing and it's hard to wrap
your head around so just don't give up
and keep working at it see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
