about using aggregate function with a
distinct addition so what that means is
it'll only count things that are unique
for example let me just show you how
this all works if you remember in the
last video an aggregate function
manipulates data by columns rather than
single entries or by rows so that's what
an aggregate function does and one of
these was count that works like you said
you put a column within it such as
primary or primary key member ID for
example and we'll count how many columns
I mean sorry how many entries into that
column there are so it can basically
count how many data entries you have but
if you use within here if instead you
instead of putting member ID you put it
distinct and then you put member ID then
it's only going to count ones that are
not repeated now you're saying holy cow
I thought primary keys weren't ever
supposed to repeat yes you are right
good but if you're using it within
another table such as we have a
restaurant and you are able shut up
Claire but anyways let's say you have a
restaurant and you can rate the
restaurant one through ten stars and you
can rate it three times in your lifetime
but you have to go there each time now
what if somebody reads it three times
they're their primary their primary key
is going to be entered into this table
as a foreign key to their information
table
so we have a table over here having
their name their ID et Cie you get what
I'm saying
and then over here we'll have ratings
and we'll have ID one gave it a five
star ID you two gave it a six star ID
one then again gave it an eight star
because they had better food this time
then ID one gave it a tenth you see so
this is how this works
all these IDs are pointing back to this
single ID
in this table which is one that looks
awful one that still looks bad one right
here you see so that is how you can have
more than one primary key so let's get
in this a little bit more alright so
here we have let's pretend this is the
ratings table we just had and I kind of
blew it up large so we had a 1 and he
gives him a 5 but 2 these are the
foreign keys to the ID and the other
table gave him a 6 1 gave him an 8 one
gave him a 10 - gave him a 3 and then 3
gave him a 6 what this means is let's
say 1 is this guy right here - is this
guy and 3 is this girl over here see so
this is how this works this one will
point to him
does someone point to him this one
that's supposed to be one sorry will
point up to this guy this guy this will
also plan for this guy now - this goes
back to this guy and that's three points
to the girl so that's how it works now
what this means if we use count distinct
member ID it's going to go through here
and count these but only the distinct
ones for example it goes here it says oh
we're counting the member ID 1 so we
have 1 here - now we have two now we
have 1 again oh we already have a 1 so
we're not gonna count that we have
another one we're not gonna count that
we have a - we're not gonna count that
we have a 3 let's count that because we
haven't had that yet so the result is 3
now if you take this distinct out of
here the result would be 1 2 3 4 5 6
right so that's how a distinct works
within a function so I wanted to show
you one more thing if we were to use the
max function with the distinct keyword
in it it's not really going it's not
really gonna work if we were using for
the stars to see like this just the
ratings from a certain person this isn't
going to work out because it'll look at
the the ratings and
say we have a reading five eight ten six
three and six the only one that's
repeating is six so it doesn't look at
the individual people that's why you
can't use Mac's distinct and then
braiding the column because this is
going to count the distinct ratings
you
so that's that's uh that's pretty much
all you need to know about the distinct
keyword it's great for accounting
specific columns that don't repeat and
yeah you get the point so uh in the next
video I will be talking about grouping
these and that's actually the most
useful thing about these so I will see
you then and please subscribe and like
my video Thanks oh my gosh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
