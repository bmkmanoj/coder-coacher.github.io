video I just wanted to make a real quick
update video and I know I've only posted
like two useful videos or so since my
last update video but the reason for
that is what this video is about well
the main reason is just my life's been
pretty hectic and busy and it's just
hard to keep up with everything i'm
currently in school so it's hard to do
school and make videos youtube videos at
the same time so what's going to happen
so for those of you who have commented
and left me messages or tried to contact
me and i haven't really gotten back to
you i'm not ignoring you i'm not being a
jerk I'm not being mean it's just that
what is my dog doing you guys do that
anyways I'm not being mean I just
haven't been able to get to the mall
because I have a lot of I have a lot of
new commenters and a lot of new viewers
which is awesome but it's just hard to
keep up with it although I have been
somewhat active I don't really post any
youtube videos some of you may have
noticed I've a posted some to Google+
have posted some pictures and poles and
stuff I've also done some Facebook stuff
but I am down too much with that I've
also updated the descriptions if you
guys are interested in what i put in
there i put a link to get web hosting
for websites or whatever if you're
interesting getting web hosting you can
use that link and if you if you sign up
through that link i'll get a referral
bonus which will be awesome and it
doesn't cost any extra for you anything
is same price so also if you look I put
a link to skill feed which is a web
platform I'm trying out for videos but
if you uh if you guys make videos or
anything and you want to if you make
tutorials and you want to put them on
there if you sign up through my link
I'll get a bonus through that too so
other than that I really done much on
post many videos so my goal is to get
through the semester and then post a
whole bunch of awesome stuff that is I'm
just excited but as for now I think I'm
just gonna be on the logo I mean the
logo I need a logo I don't through some
tests logos but
I'm getting off topic but uh yeah I'm
going to be kind of chill I'm not going
to be posting a lot of stuff so once we
get once we hit December mid-december
that's and i'll start posting stuff and
i'll get back with a lot of you guys
you've posted comments i might not
necessarily replied them all especially
if it's like cool video well i mean i
don't really ever know what to say I
mean thanks but I feel like that's
almost almost unnecessary because I like
to comment useful things and as for you
those of you who will have been seeking
help with a technology or whatever so I
haven't gone back to you and if any of
you guys I've seeked help with other
things I try to get back to you guys if
you guys need help with life situations
or whatever set me up HMU such nude yeah
so I will be back soon I'm just gonna
drag it to semester done good and yeah
keep watching keep subscribing share my
videos my my SQL tutorial number one has
just reached 60 thousand views which is
like astonishing like I am just blown
away trying to get it to a hundred
thousand so if you want to help me out
you can share that video and as always
if you want to download my courses all
of you to me links in the description
thank you guys for sticking with me even
though I haven't been doing much and
seems like I'm ignoring everybody just
