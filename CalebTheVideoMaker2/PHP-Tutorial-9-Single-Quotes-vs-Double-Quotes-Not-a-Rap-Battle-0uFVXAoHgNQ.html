talk about the difference between double
and single quotation marks so in the
last video we did learn about some
fundamental things cover in quotation
marks how you can use double and then
within the double use single and vice
versa how you could have single and then
within the single dope the single
quotation marks you could use double we
also learned about escaping which is
when we used a backslash before double
quotation marks to allow us to put this
within double quotation marks that's
known as escaping well there is a
fundamental difference between single
and double quotes and this is that
double quotes are said to be interpreted
and 99% chance I spelled that wrong
single quotes are said to be literal so
as you may or may not know when when we
display a string so you can use echo for
example we could say echo and then
within double quotation marks we could
use a variable name right so as you can
see I use the name here I mean a
variable which has the name name and
then we could say that name that sits up
here because makes more sense name has
the value Jake now let's go let's let's
go all out let's go laFonda
all right so now what exactly is this
going to do well first we're assigning
laFonda to the variable with the name
name then we're going to echo the value
of that variable well in this situation
we wouldn't even need double quotes we
could just do echo name although if we
had something else such as hi comma well
then we need quotes because hi is not
going to be understood as a string
because only when you have double or
single quotation marks will PHP know
you're trying to display a string
hopefully that makes good sense now when
this is displayed on the web browser we
are going to get high fonda you see so
because it's interpreted which I think
that's spelled wrong
I don't think there's too gosh I don't
know I'm just going to raise it cuz I'm
too embarrassed
you should probably learn these things
like before but yeah well it's fine
well because it's interpreted it's going
to take this name and it's going to
interpret that we want the value of this
variable which is laFonda and then it's
going to display laFonda on the page
well that is the complexity of it but as
for single quotes if we did the same
thing with single quotes so let's just
leave that variable definition there and
then we did echo single quotes high name
well this is actually going to send to
the browser we are going to get hi name
because this is literal it thinks we
literally mean money sign dollar sign
and then the word name so this is the
final result alright so that is the main
essential difference now there's another
thing that you kind of need to know
about which we talked about some which
was escaping we escaped the double
quotes well you could also escape the
backslash why is this because if you
have double quotes and then you have a
backslash well PHP is going to assume
that you're trying to escape something
such as a double quote and it's going to
interpret that you want to escape it so
makes sense well if you actually want a
backslash to be printed onto the page
well you're going to have to interpret
not until you're gonna have to tell PHP
you're going to have to escape this
second um backslash that's the only way
so if we have this I do believe it's
going to come out as one single
quotation mark and you can also do that
for single quotes so if we had single
quotes you can backslash single quote
this backslash is going to escape this
single quote which allows it to be in
the final result whatever comes out so
that makes sense although you can do
that and you can also escape a single
backslash like that those are the only
two escaping strings that you really use
with single quotes so anything else is
going to be literal so that um let me
give you a good example in single quotes
we have
hey you're pretty name and then we end
the single quote so now we have a
variable here and we could define it up
here sorry I know is it just like all
the time tries but crazy we can define
it name as the value Caleb and as you
can see we have another problem here we
have a single quote well that means we
need to escape it I chop just like
exploded so now you think this is going
to work out right well no it's not
because this is a variable single quotes
do not allow variables so this is going
to come out hey you're pretty name
so so close we got this fixed out but
the rest not so much so those are the
main differences between single and
double quotes and you're going to have
to use certain ones for situations so
you have to know which one to use and I
mean as long I mean typically double
quotes are going to work although single
quotes are sometimes needed so we will
be using both thank you for watching be
