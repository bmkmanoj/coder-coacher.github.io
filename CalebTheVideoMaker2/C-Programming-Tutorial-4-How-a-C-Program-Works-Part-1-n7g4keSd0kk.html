Caleb's buddy Mike Stowe and I'm
assuming from the last video you got
your first program running that was the
goal
if you've had some experience and you
are familiar with some of the things in
the previous video that's okay
but I am going to teach as if you don't
know anything so the program we wrote
had a lot of commands and keywords and
all these fancy things in there and the
chances are at first you're just going
to have to memorize how to type this
stuff out don't obsess over it though
don't feel like you have to commit how
to write every single thing down with
your eyes closed just know that at first
you're going to have to do some things
you might not understand at a deep level
as to understand why you are doing
things but by the end of the series my
goal is for you to be able to look at
every single thing we just did in the
previous video and a lot of the upcoming
videos now I want you to be able to
explain what every single thing is why
are you doing it and what is the benefit
of doing that in scope of the entire
program in the previous video we wrote
our first program and executed it if you
had to see visually how difficult that
might be it might look something like
this
this is called a learning curve it takes
at least this much knowledge to fully
grasp everything we did in the previous
video but you can't get all of this
knowledge at one second so we have to
build our way up to that point so
starting in this video we are going to
start with the very basic concept of how
AC program works now I'm not talking how
to compile it and how it runs and how
the computer can understand that that's
basic junk we've talked about that in
video number one like forever ago this
is talking about how our code means
something and how we can communicate
what we want to tell the computer in C
so if you don't know what I'm talking
about just just keep watching when you
are working with computers you have to
know they are very very dumb so you have
to break things down and be so super
specific with what you want it to do so
let's pretend that you have the
intelligence of a computer and I am
going to tell you what to do
and the thing I want to tell you to do
is to like this video and know that is
not a subliminal message but you should
like this video so how do you like this
video well to put it very super specific
you have to first move your hand to the
mouth then you have to grab the mouth
then you position the mouse till the
cursor is on top of the like button on
the screen and then you click the left
mouse button the whole concept of
explaining everything step by step is
known as an algorithm everything we want
a computer to do we should first express
it as an algorithm in English then it's
easier to convert our algorithm that's
in English to C and you'll see that in
action as I progress in this series now
what if I wanted to teach you an
algorithm - like any video on my entire
channel we're going to have to modify
that algorithm a little bit and I'm
actually going to write it out so you
can see each step and well this is an
algorithm where you can plug in any
video that I have so I'm going to put
the title of the video there and this
will teach you how to click like on that
video not only do computers need very
specific instructions they also don't
really remember how to do things so if I
wanted to tell you to like another video
I would have to repeat all six of these
instructions so you would essentially
have 12 instructions now just two like
two videos well wouldn't it be cool if
we could somehow kind of teach the
computer how to like a video without
having to repeat these six instructions
what if we could just say like video and
then say what video we wanted the
computer to like well we can actually do
that and that introduces something
called a function so a function is
basically a group of all these came--it
on my chalk exploded so this function is
basically a group of statements that you
can just shrink down into one statement
so it's kind of how a computer learns if
you want to think about it in human
terms so let's call this entire function
like video
when you tell someone to like this video
or tell the computer to like a video you
are calling that function so what that
means is we could open this and say
something like yeah and once again don't
get caught up if you don't understand
everything but what this is saying is
that we are expecting a video title to
put right here now to call this function
elsewhere let's just kind of move this
aside all we have to do is do this I
don't have a whole lot of room here so I
kind of crunched it in here but
essentially all we have to do is say the
function name or just the general
command like video and say what video we
want to like the reason I'm explaining
this all is because in programming we
like to break out sections of our code
into repeatable sections so essentially
you get like a toolbox of commands we
can tell the computer when we do
functions like this things become more
modular we have these modules we can
kind of piece together to make
applications now what if I wanted to
expand on this and say hey you once you
liked the video I want you to tell me
how many people have liked that video
well that is the concept of a return so
I want you to return to me the like
account so every function can have a
return and inside of a function it would
just look something like this return
something and we can just end the
statement with a semicolon so in the
last video our program started with
something like this and then inside of
this at the very end we had a return
zero if you're wondering what the return
is returning to like who is getting this
zero where is it going well we can
actually have programs that call our
program so it's like a chain of programs
and the zero just signifies that
everything was okay even in other
programming languages a lot of them
start with me and that is just the entry
of our program is where we start we
always start right here on the first
line of the main function so that is
your first piece to understanding why we
typed out while we tie
down the previous video you always want
to start your program with a main
function and at the end you want to
return zero and this in here you're
wondering we're getting in this later
but int is the datatype of zero so don't
worry about that for now thanks guys for
watching as always be sure to subscribe
don't forget there's notes you can
download and also you can see the next
video I don't know if I pointed the
right way but somewhere on the screen
there's some clicky buttons
thanks guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
