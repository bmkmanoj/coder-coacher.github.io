want to talk about ear training with
intervals so a lot of this is just
repetitive information from pitch and
courts because basically the best way to
learn it is to just play it over and
over again and practice looking at stuff
and all this other crap is not as
effective as just playing it and
learning it but I'm giving you some
other tips that may help if you're
struggling so this video is probably not
going to be as long first one is to
memorize the intervals so we have lots
of intervals including a major second or
whatever and minor seconds and so forth
so the best way to do this is just to go
through all of the interval half steps
so start on C and then go C to C sharp c
to d c to d sharp C to e c to f c to f
sharp and so forth all the way in to get
to an octave and then you can even do
more than an octave so you can go double
octaves so you can go 13 thurs for
something or whatever you really want to
do so start by memorizing so play a
major second I just erased that I don't
know why I did major so I can then play
a minor third so that is the best way
and then play a major third and so forth
keep doing that until you got all of the
intervals between at least and octave
really closely memorized I mean it's
possible and then the next step is to
find a song reference so you oftentimes
can play like start singing a song out
of nowhere like a very popular song or
very song that gets stuck in your head
easily and those difference between
notes in that song or intervals so for
example we have here the marriage song
on you know it's called here comes the
bride so forth well this here comes the
bride I don't know
sounds like really obviously I don't go
to many weddings but anyways that is a
perfect fourth so here comes the broad
so I forgot to write the four on the
side note and in BAM class I was a
drummer so I didn't play marimba or
anything like that so what's this stuff
is kind of useless to me except like
timing but actually did help me because
I figured out this is what our bass
drums were tuned to apart from each
other they're all a perfect fourth part
so you can just listen you can sing that
song in your head and you can tune the
bass drums which I never really did so
really no I mean I wish anyways I'm
getting off topic once you get that
interval down so here comes this is a
perfect fourth well let's say here
starts on see I really don't know what
it starts on and then C to D to e to F
that is a perfect fourth suf well you
can actually transpose this up or down
so a gap here comes and says see we got
a c-sharp to F sharp so as long as you
have that little piece memorized you can
raise the pitch of both of them and
figure out intervals sounding like when
you're listening to music you can figure
out stuff like that by transposing songs
you already know so can't get pretty
complicated so like I said it's probably
just easier to memorize it but that is a
great way so if someone's like oh could
you raise that like let's say you're
singing now like raised at a major
second well if you don't know the notes
you think of a song or whatever and yeah
you get the point i'm i'm gonna rambling
on now so i'm going to talk about
something else next thing have a friend
play them have a friend sit down on a
guitar or piano and play random
intervals and you have to guess now i
recommend guessing in half steps because
if they're like oh it let's say you have
you have you say it's a perfect fit will
they say no it's a
yeah if I could diminished seventh I
think that no one has seven half steps
of diminished 7th major 7th sorry sixth
sorry major 69 half steps minor success
aight diminished a seven so i believe
that's correct so they both have the
same on half step so you can say perfect
fifth and they'll be like no it's a
diminished sixth which they both sound
the same so that's not going to work so
you could just be like oh well that has
a difference of seven half steps and
then you can think of that as a major
fifth I mean a perfect fifth or whatever
you want so have a friend play them once
he does that have them to have them play
a larger chords and just a larger
intervals greater than a octave so 20
half steps for example and that's that's
really difficult probably yes so that's
pretty much all i have to say for
intervals and the next video we'll be
talking about something else so
subscribe and see you then high five
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
