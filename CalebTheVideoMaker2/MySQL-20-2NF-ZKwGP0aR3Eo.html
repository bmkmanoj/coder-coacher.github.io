the video maker - who this video we're
going to be talking about second normal
form now before we discuss second normal
form we needed to remind ourselves of
what a dependency is essentially a
dependency is when something depends on
something else and in databases that
would be like an attribute describing an
entity so if we have an entity we have
attributes that describe this entity
this is a dependency the attribute
depends on the entity now when we're
just now when we're drawing this you
often see it as like let's say the ID
right so the ID describes the entity
then we have the email for example the
email depends on the ID even though the
arrows drawn this way this is saying
when we change the ID from let's say 7
to 8 the email is going to change
because it's talking about a different
user so if I lost you already don't
worry about that I'll hum going to go
through an example to make more sense
but essentially you have to know that a
dependency means when the thing we're
talking about changes the data
describing it will also change it's very
simple concept almost so simple that we
don't think about it and then we get
confused when we start talking about
different types of dependencies the
reason it's important to kind of refresh
your brain on this is that second normal
form discusses a type of dependencies
known as partial dependencies now
partial dependencies come in when we
have compound or composite primary keys
now a composite key is a key that
consists of multiple columns so let's
say this over here is a column and this
over here is a column and these are on a
table right and we could say that the
combination of both of these columns are
going to be the primary key this other
column is in here because it depends on
the primary key but when we have
composite keys it actually has to depend
on both of the columns if for any reason
it only depends on one of the columns we
have what's known as a partial
dependency you will most often see
second normal form come up when we have
a many-to-many relationship and let's go
through an example now in the previous
videos we discussed a database
for a website where you can list items
and sell them and when we discussed many
to many relationships we made it so that
a user could list something and share
that listing with another user
so basically joint ownership of this
item so let's say I go on there and list
the laptop and I want to split the
profit with me and somebody else so we
have joint ownership of this listing
we had a many-to-many relationship let's
draw that out and kind of refresh our
brains over here we have the users over
here we have the listings and to amend
this many-to-many relationship we broke
it up into two one-to-many relationships
so it looked like this and this
intermediary table was called user
listings so let's label the tables now
the primary key in this table is
actually a combination of a user and a
listing that's because you can think of
this table as an association table once
you associate a user with a listing
you're not going to have to do it a
second time so over here we'll have a
user ID in the listing ID and then the
combination in here now just for fun
let's say we have another column in this
table and we're running out of space so
let's just kind of blow it up down here
so this here is this table just expand
it a little bit more so we added this
column here listing date this is
essentially going to record when the
listing was created the problem is that
this listing date only depends on half
of the primary key remember that the
combination of these two are the primary
key what listing date is dependent only
on listing ID this is an example of a
partial dependency this kind of
information does not belong in this
table it actually belongs in the
listings table that's because you could
say what date and time the listing was
created once for one individual listing
the reason you don't want it in here is
because it's not relevant to the user ID
as well so what kind of data would you
put in this table in the second normal
form would tell us to get rid of this
column and put it in a different table
that is relevant to just this part
whenever you have something underscore
its it's a good giveaway of what you're
trying to describe the listing
it doesn't say listing user it doesn't
say user it just says listing therefore
the chances are it's supposed to go in
the listings table but what kind of data
would be appropriate in this table I
want to put data in this table to show
you guys what would belong here but I
don't want to break second normal form
well we need to find some kind of data
that depends on the listing ID and the
user ID that means the data in here only
describes the association between the
user and the listing so an example of a
column might be the percentage of income
when the item is sold so let's go
through some specific data so you can
see how this works let me clean this up
a little bit
percent share this would not go inside
of a listing table that's because it
depends on which user if an item let's
say we have a bicycle and this is being
sold by two people we couldn't say a
specific percentage inside of the
listing table for example we say 80% is
that discussing this user or is it
discussing this user
we don't really know so that's not very
clear that's why you wouldn't want to
put something like the percentage share
inside of the listing table at the same
time you wouldn't want to put it in the
user table though because you might have
one user selling multiple items so he is
selling a cheeseburger and some pizza
yeah I'm from America don't judge me and
if you just gave a number such as 80%
share well does that describe the
hamburger or the pizza it it doesn't
belong inside of the user table that
means this data actually belongs to the
Association of the user and the listing
so let's say we have the user ID of 7
the listing ID of 13 and a user ID of 12
we'll make them both owners of a bicycle
so the user ID would be 7 the listing ID
13 and then user ID of 12 listing ID of
13 going back to the picture I just
erased this bike would have the eye
d13 the users would have the IDS of
seven and 12 now we can give it a
percent share we could say that the guy
with the ID of seven gets a 40% share
that means if the bike sells for hundred
dollars this guy is going to get $40 and
we can give him a percent share of 60
and totaling this adds up to 100 which
would make sense unless obviously we're
going to add fees so so this percentage
we could say it describes the income
after we subtract the fees so this kind
of data is appropriate for this table
hopefully that makes sense for you guys
that is second normal form just remember
to get rid of any partial dependencies
and whenever you have a composite
primary key go through all of your
attributes and ask yourself does this
belong here does it describe all of the
columns inside of the primary key if it
does it's appropriate if it doesn't it's
not appropriate and you need to put it
somewhere else so thanks guys
that's all for second normal form be
sure to check out the next video because
we will be discussing third normal form
thanks guys and I will see you then oh
