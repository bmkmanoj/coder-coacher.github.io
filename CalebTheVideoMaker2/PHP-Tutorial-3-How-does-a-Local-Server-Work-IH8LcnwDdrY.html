tutorial so as we talked in the last
video PHP is sent to the server side
that means you have to have a server to
access it well I mean most people don't
have servers laying around their house
so we're going to figure out how to test
this on a local machine or a client-side
machine alright so if you have a website
you can use their server system to you
program at PHP so I have a website Caleb
curry comm I can develop PHP send it to
the server and then request it using my
client to see what it's like but if you
don't website which many of you probably
don't but some may that's ok we're going
to use what's known as X amp or zamp
whatever you want to call it what is
this thing for that stands for cross a
cross-platform Apache MySQL PHP and perl
but it doesn't really matter so this is
basically a bundle that gives you a
server on your local computer
so now we can put these files on this
server and we can access them like we're
accessing a website so I know that's
kind of confusing but once we do it it
will start to make sense so when I want
to access my server my website server
Caleb curry com I can request the
website by typing in Caleb curry dot-com
yeah this is totally advertising so I
can I can put that in my web browser at
the very top well if we want to access
this server we don't have what's called
a URL Uniform Resource locator we we we
don't have one of those custom made so
we use what's known
local host so this is our new URL to
access our our virtual on our own
machine server so this server to to
request files from it we can use local
host so to go to the home page we could
type localhost then we may have another
page up I can't do anything like friends
for example friends dot PHP so that's
how you access files and we'll be
installing that in the next video so
obviously it's going to be easier to
understand than a chalkboard where I'm
just talking about it once you actually
see done but there's something else I
want to talk about in order for PHP
files to work they must first be
accessed through a URL localhost they
must be on the server so that that's
included in the first one and second
they must end in a PHP file extension so
if you don't know much about extensions
every file has an extension so if it's a
picture it might have a dot jpg file
extension or a jot Chah dot gif or gif
file extension and so forth so those are
known as file extensions you may have
seen exe dot exe this is an executable
fire file so PHP files must look like
this so as you can see this ends in a
dot PHP file extension this is different
than so this is indexed HTML vs. index
dot PHP PS are both website formats but
PHP will allow us to run PHP code this
will only allow us to run HTML code so
this this is very important so when
you're working
and your website your files aren't
working right you got to make sure are
you usually accessing if your localhost
and is it a dot PHP extension so how
would we access this file well we could
go to the website local host board slash
index dot PHP if you just put dot
forward slash index it probably won't
work you need the dot PHP file extension
why am I telling you all this well in
order for us to code in PHP we need a
text editor such as notepad or anything
like that but with notepad for one it
sucks and for two it sometimes adds an
invisible dot txt extension after the
PHP so we actually get index dot PHP dot
txt which that's not a PHP file that is
a text file so that's one problem with
the text that comes to fault with the
computer so we're going to use notepad
plus plus and those are the two things
we will be needing to download in our
next video
xampp and notepad plus plus so hopefully
that helped clear things up why we're
going to do what we do in the next video
and if it doesn't it doesn't quite make
sense to you well once we get the stuff
downloaded it's going to make a lot more
sense so I will see you in the next
video thank you for watching and
