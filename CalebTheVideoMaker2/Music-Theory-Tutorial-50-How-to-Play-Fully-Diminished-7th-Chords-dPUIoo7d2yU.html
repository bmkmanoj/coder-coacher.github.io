will be the last chord that I teach you
in a while but it's still important I'm
gonna bring up the whiteboard again I
think I like it better no anyways so
basically if we're transferring from
half diminished chord to a fully
diminished chord we have a minor third
followed by a minor third all by a major
third
Alex major but specific minor so now to
make this fully diminished we can
actually take this and lower it one step
for one half step I should say sorry one
half step so let's say it's a C we lower
it down to a B one note on the keyboard
so in our last video I had a chord like
this I believe it was yeah so if I
wanted to fully make this 2 min diminish
like completely 100% diminished I'll
take this and add a flat to that one
right there the reason for this is is
I'm actually taking the last note and
I'm lowering it a half step so if I have
B this is at D sorry
Adie all right so fixed it if I have a d
sharp I'm sorry I D yeah G and I want to
diminish it I lower it a half step so
now it's not a d it's a D flat so this
will create it fully diminished this
triad not triad seventh chord
triad is three try that's where we get
to triad so 7th it's called a 7th
because we're taking the 7th low in the
scale and doing funky stuff with it so
let's try to create a fully diminished
7th chord
all right so here is our staff we're
starting on C so we're going to fill in
these circles to make a seventh chord so
we know it's gonna look like that some
way shape form now I know that a C major
scale is on all the white keys which is
cool now if we change that to a minor
scale it's going to flatten let's know
that's how we get a minor chord so this
will be if we change a major scale and
we change a major triad into a minor
triad we're going to flatten second no
if we change a minor triad into a
diminished triad we're going to keep the
minor where it's at and lower the third
the third note in the triad so basically
if I erase this know right now to just
make a triad
so not a seventh chord just to try it
this is the equivalent of a C major C
major triad beautiful cool but if I
wanna make it minor I flat this one
wanna make it diminished flat this one
so we're already almost there
see it's sometimes it's almost easier to
figure out what you know and alter it
rather than starting from scratch every
single single time
so we're there now all we have to do is
add a minor on top of this G flat G flat
G one step we're moving one key which is
equal to one half step I say step but I
mean half step because the step is equal
to 2 half steps so G flat one half step
boom right there that's one we do it
again it will take us G to a an a what
so I can show you that chief up to an
a-flat
1/2 step so that will give us one more
half step now we only need one more a
flat to a so just create an A
oh that's nowhere in a goes we actually
have to create that's a see what the
heck oh and a would be here but that's
not right so we actually have to create
a B double flat makes sense because ok
let me draw it sticking over here so you
can see here's what it looks like but
from G flat we go G flat to G to a flat
to a but we can't have an a because
we're taking the 7th of a C scale the
7th of a C scale is a B and also has to
be connected on all of the lines so
we're actually going to make a B double
flat makes sense so it'll sound like
this FC that would be e flat G flat and
then hey tickle that is a fully
diminished 7th chord thanks for watching
see you in the next video where we're
going to be doing some cool stuff like
learning because learning is cool
learning gets you all the ladies trust
me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
