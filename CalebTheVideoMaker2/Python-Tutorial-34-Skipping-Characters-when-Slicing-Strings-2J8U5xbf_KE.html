will be talking about a little bit more
about slicing strings and indexes not
slicing indexes like we're not slicing
strings and indexes we're slicing
strings and learning about indexes
I'm glad glad I made that clear anyways
first thing we're gonna do is just
create a variable emanate I've done all
this on the last video but I mean it
will just start fresh for this one so
for understanding indexes before we do
anything in this video we have to
understand that this is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 now in the last video I talked about
how we could like slice and get like mo
n or n ad or ona de that's called string
slicing well this video I want to do the
same thing but this time I'm gonna be
teaching you how you can return every
other letter or every third letter or
every 4th letter or you can return every
you can return it in reverse order or
every other letter in reverse order and
a bunch of other cool thing so that's
what we're going to do in this video
it's the first thing we can do is we can
print yo or you can try to print you
know I can't really type it well and
then we can do is we can print indexes
of you so be like print index 4 and it
prints n because this is index 4 right
here and what we can also do is we can
print ranges so we can go for index 3 to
index 5 and it prints on so 0 1 2 3 4 5
so prints 0 2 5 so o n now what when you
do this there's actually a third number
but because we don't give it it anything
it defaults to 1 so what we can also do
with this is we can put a second colon
after the 5 and a number after this :
and like I said if if we don't put it we
don't put anything it defaults to 1 it
stays the same
that's what Python assumes you want to
ask
what this third there this third number
does is it tells like if we want to take
every other letter or every third letter
or every fourth letter and so forth so
one is just going to return every letter
okay let's get a bigger range here let's
go let's go from index 1 to index 6
that's gonna prepare a letter e Mona now
what if we put a 2 if we put it - it's
going to take every second letter so it
goes looking at this page over here on
the paint it goes it takes this one it
skips em and takes this one and then it
skips N and it takes this one so you
just get the vows CoA know what if we
want to go every third letter so we
start at E skip two letters get N and
then send the string because we stopped
at index six let's try it well what we
do is we replace this two with a three
and we can eat in so basically we start
at E skip to go every three letters so
one two three one two and then the
string is over if we had a longer string
it would it would make more it be more
clear because it would take it would go
on forever but basically one two three
one two it takes every third letter so
it skips two we can also do the same
thing with a four and now I got e skip
three one two three
a so I hope that's clear now there's
another thing we can do I'll show you
here let's get rid of these two numbers
well we can do is we can use negative
numbers in the third after the second :
for the third number we can use negative
numbers and that's going to print things
in reverse order so now I got adenomas I
don't know no so if you want to flip
words and figure out what
they are you can use that so let's try
let's try uh let's go epic and we'll
assign it the value racecar alright now
what we can do is we can print race car
we can go so this is will print race car
in reverse order Wow
it looks exactly the same well that's
because race car backwards is race car
that's how that kind of works so that's
I know a lot of people try to like
figure out what words say backwards well
this is how you can do it get up get up
Python and you know reverse some strings
and whatnot now what we can also do
let's go back to yo we'll bring you back
down here well we can also do is we can
take just a part of the string now
there's one important thing to remember
and it's actually a little complex so
I'm going to actually push that to the
next video just so we can stop here and
make this one individual video over one
topic so hopefully all of this is useful
and I will see you all in the next video
so thank you guys so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
