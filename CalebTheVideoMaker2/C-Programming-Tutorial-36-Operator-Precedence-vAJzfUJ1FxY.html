the video maker - i just got back from
eating some tacos so i am ready to go
and now my dog is eating his dinner so
if you hear him don't let it bother you
this video i am going to be talking
about operator precedence so i've
mentioned before that some operators
have a precedence over others
for example multiplication and division
have precedence over addition and
subtraction but how do you know well
here is a chart that i would recommend
and this also goes to show how slow my
internet is ah this is absurd
alright so this is the page you can see
that everything is kind of grouped into
sections so these are numbered these
have the highest priority or the highest
precedence these have the second highest
precedence and so forth things within a
group like this these have the same
precedence so how do you know which one
happens first
well that is called the associativity
and it says which direction they are
evaluated so for example if you scroll
down here you can find where to go here
it is the addition and subtraction
operators these are evaluated left to
right so you start at the left and go to
the right and you just evaluate them as
you see them some of them are actually
evaluated right to left and we'll see
some of that soon so if you want to know
what has precedence over what you go in
here and you find the operator so let's
say we are looking for the unary plus
and the unary minus you can see that
that has a higher precedence than
addition and subtraction so if you're
adding something that has a unary minus
with it it's going to be negated first
which means to take the negative of and
then it's going to be added and if you
have an expression that has both a
positive and a negative then it's
whichever one comes first from the right
to the left is going to happen so let's
see some of this in practice let's say
we have two integers x and y and you can
declare two integers just like that we
can also assign values on one line
just like that now these are actually
assignment operators so which one
happens first they're on the same line
so we need to know the associativity so
if we look back at that chart we had the
assignment operator is right here and
obviously if you have two assignment
operators they are going to have equal
precedence but then we have to look at
the associativity and its right to left
so that means our expression gets
evaluated like this first the right side
and then once that is done then the left
side now obviously the result is going
to be the same either way but you could
think of this as y equals 5 and then x
equals y I'll leave those here is a
comment for you guys to see now let's
look at a situation where the precedence
and the associativity makes a difference
when we have a situation like this where
we have int Z and let's just say Y is
equal to 2 and x equals negative y plus
Z this is that situation I was talking
about earlier and just in case it's
driving you crazy
I will minimize this there we go
if you didn't have that chart there is
essentially two ways this could be
evaluated the first way would be x
equals and then the plus operator
happens so we have y plus Z and then
that whole thing is negated just like
this or we could have this where x
equals negative y plus Z we'll probably
want to give a value to Z e obviously
because we can't use it until it's
initialized let's say the value is 20
this would make the end results be
either x equals negative 22 or x equals
18 depending on which one happens
according to our chart the negation
actually happens first
as we mentioned so the second one is
actually how it works and just to see
how that this is true we can print the
value of x like so and then we could
save it and we'll run the sucker
I can type it out
and the value is 18 and is that what we
expected let's go back in our code and
find out yep that is so so what I'm
trying to teach you from this video is
not that you need to memorize this
entire chart when I'm trying to teach
you is that there is a systematic way as
to figure out how expressions are going
to be evaluated and as always if you're
unsure of how it's going to work always
use parentheses
you can throw parentheses in here
yourself to force certain precedents so
this will automatically make the inside
happen first so thanks guys for watching
