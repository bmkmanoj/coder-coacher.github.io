start talking about database
normalization now when it comes to
database normalization you have to
understand that there is a continuum so
a continuum is basically an entire range
of possible values I guess over here we
have undesigned and then over here we
have completely designed so when we're
talking about databases you need to
realize that there is a happy medium in
here that you try to go for generally
when you get over here to completely
design your database is extremely
complex but if you go over here to
undesigned well then your database is a
giant piece of garbage so a lot of the
stuff we're going to be talking about in
the next three videos is up to you to
decide how far we want to take this so
we design our databases in these stages
called normal forms and if we were to
put these normal forms on this continuum
you would have first normal form second
normal form third normal form and then
there's some extra normal forms down
here which make the complexity a lot
higher so generally I like to stop here
at third normal form I think that's like
the perfect place to stop where your
database is not too complex but it's
also extremely well designed to avoid
bad data so that's what we're going to
be doing in the next couple videos first
normal form second normal form and third
normal form now I know I've been
blabbering about these normal forms and
I haven't really even explained them
that well so let's just start from the
beginning with first normal form what is
first normal form well it's the very
first step of database design now make
sure you watch the relationship videos
and the previous videos because the
normal forms kind of build upon that and
a lot of the problems with these normal
forms are basically automatically fixed
when you design your relationships
properly not everything is going to be
perfect but if you get the relationships
down doing the normal forms is a lot a
lot easier so let's get started
first normal form has some rules that we
need to follow the first rule is that
every column in a table describes only
one thing the next thing is that every
value for that column can
only one piece of data so if we had a
column interest this is like a dead
giveaway because it's ply so this does
not meet rule 1 so rule number 1 columns
describe one thing this is breaking that
rule so let's say we try to fix that and
we just make it interest so now we have
this table and one of the columns in
here is interest so we have a user's
table and we're only allowed one
interest here well let's say someone you
know goes in there and inserts multiple
interests for one single column just
like that well this is actually breaking
rule 2 so rule 2 essentially says there
can only be one value per row for that
call and an additional rule is that you
should only have one row per entity so
this refers to one specific users so
essentially if you wanted to encapsulate
everything for first normal form you
would say it follows the rule of 1 so
columns describe one thing there's one
value per row for that column and every
single row describes only one entity if
you find that you want to store multiple
interests or something in here
well that's where I said the
relationships are going to help you
because you'll understand how to
structure that a more common example
that breaks first normal form is having
a column name so name is that one thing
well the other term for being one thing
is atomic so I think indivisible because
you know atoms can't be split right ok
so this is really broken up into two
things we have the first name and the
last name this is an example that you
might want to split up into two columns
or three if you want the middle
some people decide hey I'm just gonna
put it in one column and we can't query
by last name but if you break it up into
first and last name you can do queries
saying like select everything from the
users where the users last name is blah
blah that kind of thing is harder to do
if you store the first and last name
inside a one column another common
example is the address so the address is
actually not atomic if you think of what
an address is it's usually a street or a
street number a state and then a zip
code well if you wanted to get all of
the data within a certain zip code range
it wouldn't be easy to do if you just
stored one column address so you always
want to try and break things up into the
smallest pieces as possible this follows
the first rule that I mentioned of first
normal form where a column describes
only one thing a street address a state
in a zip code pretty good if you want to
extend that rule of one thing a little
bit more to make your database really
good well then just apply it to some
other things a table should describe
only one thing or one type of thing
would be a better word so users the
table is kind of the exception usually I
make tables plural and it's
controversial but I like to have them
plural so we are describing one thing
the user then every single row is unique
describing only one user you can kind of
enforce that by having a primary key so
a primary key is just a unique value for
every single row well that means every
value of the primary key is only used
one time additionally you're only going
to have one primary key column that one
primary key value describes exclusively
one entity so if you tried to put one
entity in the table twice that's not
something you want to do you just you
just don't do that
okay stop don't do it one entity gets
only one primary key and a primary key
describes only one entity so yeah guys
that's first normal form pretty super
easy I know but that's okay we're gonna
go on to a second normal form in the
next video and that's gonna amp up the
difficulty so put on your big-boy pants
because we're just gonna dive in and
have some fun so thank you for watching
