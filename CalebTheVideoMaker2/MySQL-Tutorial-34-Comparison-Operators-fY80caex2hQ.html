about comparison operators and basically
what these mean what these are is a way
to compare data so for example if you
remember in the last few videos I used a
where clause and said where something is
equal to something else
well the equal sign is basically saying
the same so this is the same as this
well there's actually some more
comparison operators and the equal sign
is an example of one so what are some of
the others well if you remember if
you've ever had math classes you may
have come across less than or greater
than these are examples of comparison
operators
so you could say select all of the the
bank accounts where the amount of money
is greater than $500 that's an example
of a comparison operator and there's
actually a whole lot of these and I'm
going to be going over some of them so
here are a couple of them the very first
one is the equal sign which is just like
equal so 5 is equal to 5 basically yeah
this is the less than son so the side
which is smaller is referring to the
small okay so let me just try to explain
this 5 is less than 6 so if you were to
ask this is 5 this would be pronounced
Lessman is 5 less than 6 and because the
mouth opens to the bigger one as 6 is
more than 5 that is true so this is less
than because the small side is pointing
to the smaller number and the larger
side this opening right here is pointing
to the bigger number so basically if you
have this one and yeah this 5 it's
greater than this would be 5 is greater
than 6 which is not true so if you need
to compare something that is bigger this
is greater than and this is less than
you may have seen this before this is
less than or
equal to something well when we're using
MySQL or many other programming
languages it's written as this less than
or equal to like that so less than sign
and then equal sign and this is because
we don't have a character that looks
like that so when you see this this
means less than or equal to so five is
less than or equal to five and that's
true and this could be anything that is
greater so five is less than or equal to
any number five and higher this is
because it can be equal to five as you
can see if this is gone
and I read this this is false because
five is not less than five it's equal to
said this would work equals sign and so
of this equals less than sign equals
sign the same goes for the greater than
so five is greater than or equal to five
or anything below five so here we have
some more of these and the very first
one is null and basically this is asking
if it has a value so the value so if
something in a database is five that is
not null because it has a value if it
was this nothing then it would be newald
so that's what no means so if you're
asking if something is null you're
asking if it's empty or no entry at all
now if you're asking if it's not null
you're asking if it has an entry so the
value five would go to this one this one
here because bad and the reason for this
is it's not null so if you're asking if
it's not null right here it would be the
one to use because it has a value the
fatten the next one is in so this is is
the value within a set of options so
like is five
in and then a list of possible values
and if one of them is 5 then it's true
now between this is like 4 numbers say
is 5 between 6 &amp;amp; 8
no it's that that would be false because
5 becomes before 6 so in order for this
to work you can put as 5 in between
I mean it's 5 between 3 and 8 basically
like that and what you can also do is
you can add the word not so not between
not yeah you get the point
so if you want to inverse it such as it
is not null you put the word going and
ot now when you're doing where clauses
you can actually compare it against more
than one option so let's say you have
the number 5 now you can say is 5 less
than 7 and it is but is it also less
than 4 it's not so you can use them do
this by using and you can say is 5 less
than 7 and less than 4 and this is a way
to compare it against multiple questions
to ask to see if it is what you want to
retrieve so you maybe you just want to
search things by their first name but
you may want a person whose first name
is Caleb and and a person whose first
name is last name is curry and I think I
showed you that a little bit of this in
one of my last videos but I'm just going
to review this now or on the other hand
this is where either one can be true so
last name first name Caleb for say last
name curry now if we have somebody John
curry
and we use or the first name is Caleb or
the last name is curry well you can see
this one has Caleb as the first name and
this one has Korea's last name so that
won't work
this one does not have John as the first
name but that's curry for the last name
so it would also work but if you use and
it will only bring back
Caleb curry because the first name has
to be Caleb and the last name has to be
curry so in the next video I will be
talking about foreign key constraints
and it's going to be sweet so subscribe
and I'll see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
