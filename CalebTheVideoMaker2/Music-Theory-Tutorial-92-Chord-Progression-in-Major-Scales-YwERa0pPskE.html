a little differently in the last video
but I'll just correct it now when we
have a scale let's say D maybe C D F
sharp G a B C sharp and then D again
this is a major scale we label all of
these by their scale degrees which we
talked about in the last video and we
also if we ever create an chord from one
of these scale degrees we label it with
a Roman numeral and I got into that but
I just need to make sure that the Roman
numerals lined up with the scale degrees
in your head so the first one was the
tonic which is the first which is the
same thing as a 1 or a capital I so if
we are on the sixth scale which is the
sub median the sixth scale degree that
is we can represent it with the 6 or
with a sorry well if it's major chord we
can represent it with a capital v
capital I but if it's minor lowercase V
lowercase I that's what I was trying to
say so now that we know this I want to
talk about what I like to call major
minor minor major major minor diminished
major sometimes so this is basically the
tonic so these are the scale degrees 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 tonic know how what does this
have to do with anything well the scale
degrees this would be I capital I this
would be to lowercase size this we 3
lowercase size this would be IV this
will be V this little B lowercase V
uppercase I I mean lowercase I then we
can have VII
with a degrees or Celsius what everyone
say
then we have the time you can get we're
just gonna get rid of F now for any
major scale this will always be the
chord progression so the if we have a C
major scale we start on C that makes the
fourth and the fifth F and G F and G and
if we create chords off of them they
will always be major if we are following
the key signature so let me show you
what I mean if we have here we have a
staff when we start on C right and we
create a chord off of it c e g that is
the creation of a major chord and i can
prove that to you by showing you here or
c c 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 c e g that is the
creation of a major triad so if we start
on F this tells us that it will be major
F this here let's fill in the gap FAC F
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 C FAC C yes that is
correct
this is major and if we start on G well
I'm not gonna show you again but yes it
still works because it's G e G B D which
is a major chord so what does this mean
no matter what key signature were in
this will always be the core information
so let's try the scale of a major so
that would mean we sharp the F the C and
the G let's try
and five here is our staff we sharp the
F we sharp the see sorry let's let's see
here's the C and we sharp the G which is
up here so now when we start we start on
a which is why no there's a day here so
we're starting here we create a major
should we create a triad off of that
separated by thirds one two three one
two three make sense remember you start
where you count or mean you count where
you start one two three one two three
well things hit resume with you one two
three one two three so this means that
the snow here is sharp and that's all
the sharpness so this consists of a C
sharp and E let's take a look at the
keyboard hey 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 it is a major
triad so this is Eva it's the first to
the scale
a B C sharp d e f sharp G sharp
that's an a major scale here sorry
zoomed out first one way so that is
basis of what I'm trying to tell you now
if we start on the the 7th of an a major
scale that would be G 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 G
sharp conveniently G sharps right there
now remember if we have a sharp sign
here that means also this G is sharp so
I'm gonna start it down here just to
make it easier so I don't take a bunch
of extra lines ledger lines so we're
starting here at G
we make extra notes that go thirds up
one two three one two three
also if you can think of it g a b b a b
c d e f g g a b b c d so yeah you get
for it so um now we have G sharp um B
and D let's see what that is on appeal
G sharp 1 2 3 B 1 2 3 D so we have a
minor 3rd + a minor 3rd which qualifies
us as a diminished chord oh how
convenient it says right here that this
is going to be diminished so this is the
formula formula for every single major
scale depending on what scale of the
degree of the scale we start on oh that
was scary almost died so it's always
more on a major scale following the key
signature gets darker when i zoom in for
some reason I don't know why super
annoying though so let's try it on we're
not gonna draw it this time I'm just
gonna tell you let's try it on a D major
scale well in a D major scale we have d
c e F sharp don't know this look at your
circle of fifths or make a D major scale
use a whole whole half whole whole whole
half patterns on the keyboard d e f G a
B C sharp and then Dean good so now if
these rules apply when I start on the
4th it
major one two three four this is
represented as V makes sense so let's
try it well if we're on well what's in a
G major triad we have were there thirds
they're separated by thirds so we have a
so I have a G what's a third away from G
G a B so they have a B what's a what's a
third away from B be DC deep now as you
can see should any of these have a sharp
side well we can figure out from the key
signature which will tell us that we
sharp two F's and we startled the seats
there is no F or she'd season season
here so this is the formation now we can
show you on a piano that this will be
major G one two three four one two three
sweet so sweet
that's basis of chord progression now
let me think of one in the D major scale
let's try in the D major scale using the
B that was that would be the sixth
because it goes d e f a b c d one two
three four five it's the fifth month at
hub right no cuz there's a G here I'm
stupid one two three four five six it's
the sixth so if our little rules apply
it should be minor
now let's find third strom bee bee bee
first tonic or though
yes unison nope third a second would be
to C and the third would be deep so B D
what's going on and then D would be the
Unison note e
would be a second F would be a third so
do we need a sharpening these well in
the key of D we sharp the C's and we
sharp the S make sense so we would
actually add an F sharp to this and that
would be because over the key signature
it tells us to which one we're reading
the music that means we apply a little
sharp to this well since we're not
writing music I'm just gonna leave over
here so let's create this but first I
want to show you
B is the sixth of the D major scale and
our pattern was major minor minor major
major minor diminished here's the first
here is the second here's the third
fourth fifth the sixth so we can see
that it is it says to be minor that's it
better see it so let's see if this is
mine start on B B 1 2 3 2 gives us a D 1
2 3 4 F sharp that's a minor 3rd plus a
major 3rd which qualifies this as a
minor chord so that is the basis of
chord progression for major scale</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
