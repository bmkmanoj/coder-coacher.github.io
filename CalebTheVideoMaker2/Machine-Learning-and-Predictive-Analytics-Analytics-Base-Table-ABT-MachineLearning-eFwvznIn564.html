are going to be talking about what's
known as the analytics base table or abt
for short so this is one of the terms I
picked up from that book I mentioned in
the first video
predictive shoot I always get the name
wrong data machine learning for
predictive data analytics and this is
basically a term that means all of your
data in one giant table with tons of
rows and instead of typical names were
used to such as columns and stuff we're
going to have some new terminology
that's specific to machine learning that
allows us to better describe what we're
talking about so this is the table we
were working with in a previous video
I'm going to basically describe this in
terms of an analytics base table so
these are now known as features or some
people call them attributes they
describe the data there are two types of
features there are descriptive features
and there is also the target feature so
inside of an analytics base table there
is only going to be one target feature
and there's going to be numerous
descriptive features the target feature
is the result what happened what are we
trying to predict that is going to be
stored in the target feature which in
this case is whether or not they had
diabetes there we go so if we wanted to
categorize our data we would have
descriptive features and a target
feature so the descriptive features
describe the thing and the target
feature is what we're trying to predict
for future instances okay so now what is
this data describing if we had one value
in here what is this called well this is
an instance
of what we call the predictive subject
all right so let's just break this down
the predictive subject that is the thing
we are trying to make predictions on in
this case the predictive subject would
be a person or a patient an instance of
that is one particular person or
instance having these new words allows
me to describe things with less talking
so I could say the target feature and
you automatically know talking about
this one rather than saying oh we're
talking about the the column that has
the end result so having these new words
actually is going to make things easier
rather than more complicated now that I
have these words to find there's a
couple other things I want to talk about
that are going to help you understand
the analytics base table just a bit more
the target feature that is key that is
the most important thing in this entire
table if this was empty it would be like
we have this person who's a male who's
less than 50 and has a family history we
have all that data about this person but
we don't know if he had diabetes or not
so this would be null that is useless to
us because we're not able to predict
future occurrences because the
historical data is not complete we don't
know the end result
additionally now that we have these
descriptive features we can start
thinking about what are the descriptive
features that are going to be the most
valuable for my situation
what descriptive features are going to
be best for our predictive subject of a
patient or a person you can start
thinking about what things are going to
somehow correlate with diabetes machine
learning all it is is taking descriptive
features and finding correlation with
the target feature so that's the
analytics base table hopefully that'll
help you guys out when you're working
with machine learning so thank you guys
and I'll see you in the next video where
we'll be I think we're going to be
starting a new topic so it's gonna be
cool be sure to check it out and please
be sure to subscribe thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
