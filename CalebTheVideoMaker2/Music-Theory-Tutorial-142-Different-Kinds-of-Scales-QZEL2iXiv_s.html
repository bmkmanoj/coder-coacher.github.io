wanted to say we're gonna talk about
some pitch concepts and I wanted to
apologize that I've been using this
really small whiteboard
oh I'm sorry whiteboard what you say you
say you said I'm tired of you insulting
me if you're gonna keep doing that why
are you just get a new whiteboard okay
Oh would you look at that so this is a
whiteboard I stole from my church so
it's not permanent
maybe I don't know if they want me to
give it back or what and I didn't really
to understand but I'll probably keep
this one for awhile in case you haven't
noticed I'm on a pretty tight budget so
things like these are accepted so
there's a couple scratches and it's
dented a little bit but that's perfectly
fine it still works right right it does
hey hopefully you can see it good
so yeah let's go there's this reflection
here but I'm just gonna have to
apologize for that right now oh well in
this video I wanted to talk about pitch
a bit more so if you don't remember
pitch is how we perceive changes in
frequency frequency is how fast
something vibrates measured in Hertz now
focus
we have a standard tuning system which
assigns a 4 I believe to 440 Hertz now
different tuning systems may have this
changed so be careful in that be careful
of that when tuning instruments I'm
actually gonna start talking about
scales and I know we've talked about
scales over and over again that lights
flashing it's really bugging me can you
guys see that so far we've learned about
7 note scale these are said to be pepti
tonic a hepta tonic scale has seven
notes that's where the term hepta that's
what the term Hebda means so
there's actually some scales that don't
always have seven
so we're going to go through all of
these and say how many they have so the
first one is monotonic scale a monotonic
scale has one note that's it so it's
kind of like is that even a scale well I
guess it in two octaves but basically
you won't really see one of these very
often so mono means one next one we have
die tonic diatonic scale that has two
notes diatonic scale you still really
won't see them either those would be to
try pens which we'll get into that so
the next one is a tri atomic scale try
tonic which is three try and then we
have the tetra tonic scale this has four
tetra stick of tetris like the game
there's four kinds I think four kinds of
blocks something something do it and
never mind now we have pentatonic now
you will actually come across pentatonix
quite frequently so you won't see as
many of these ones but now pentatonic
you will see then we have hexitonic this
has six EXO means six back to a
restarted hepta tonic this one has seven
notes so let me give you an example the
HEPA tonic hepta tonic that be the major
scale we got whole whole half so we have
c d e f g a b one two three four five
six seven
and then we go back to see which we
don't count that within the scale so we
have seven distinct pitches here then
the last one is octatonic these are the
eight numbered scales and you may come
across chromatic scale which has twelve
notes but we're just gonna stop at eight
here so monotonic one diatonic to try to
like three tetra tonic for pentatonic
five hexitonic six hepta tonic seven
octatonic eight a pentatonic scale we'll
have five of the notes within the octave
for example we could have C D D G B or
we're gonna have c b g c e f g b it
doesn't really matter it's just five
notes within a scale it doesn't have to
be a certain pattern all it is is that
many notes within the scale and that's
all i have to say for these in the next
video we'll be talking about something
new so I'll see you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
