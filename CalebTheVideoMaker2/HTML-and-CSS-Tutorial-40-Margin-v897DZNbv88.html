video I'm going to be talking about
margin so in last video we talked about
padding
what does padding do it pads the inside
of an element so if we have a a
paragraph here it's going to push the
words farther in the box it just puts
extra padding on the inside so if I give
our body padding let's say body that's
going to pad everything that is within
our butt padding equals 50 pixels and as
you can see our body is all the way
around here with 50 pixels before any
content is displayed so 50 pixels if we
inspect the elements here see the body
is right here awesome so what is margin
well it's actually pretty much the
opposite of padding
it's like padding but it's on the
outside of the content so let me save
this here whoops refresh this is what it
looks like if we added margin to our div
50 pixels and then saved it well it
pretty much does the same thing because
our div if we inspect it is this this
blue box here and with the padding is
the orange colored stuff that pushes 50
pixels out from anything else
so padding let's I mean let's go back to
margin we can add margin to these
comments if we wanted so margin equals
30 pixels that's weird
oh that's because this is on sorry so
refresh now the padding has 30 pixels
now it has 60 pixels so if you think
your stuff is too close together for
some reason like if I have two divs here
let me show you what I mean I need
another div here
content and we look at it the content is
really the two divs are actually
touching that's why we have a thicker
border because the bottom one has a
border on the top and the top one has a
border on the bottom so if we gave the
div some Largent ten pixels then it's
going to push that content away so if we
wouldn't like it like let's get 40
pixels that looks a lot better if we
were to have X more than one pieces of
content so like yeah copy all of this
and show you what I mean
if we had the same thing pretend you
said something else like this is a video
stream and here's a video and then
here's a video versus for example we
could separate them with different discs
and to make them look nicer we can add
padding so padding pushes everything
away from it
think of like a claustrophobic child and
a closet he's going to start pushing
everything away by pixels so he's like
oh my plaster phobia is acting up I need
to push everything away 20 pixels so
let's say this little child he pushes
the h1 tag away I don't remember any
pixels I said 20 pixels it pushes the
end of the div away 20 pixels that
pushes the start of the other paragraph
away and it pushes well there's nothing
over here so it doesn't push so that is
pretty much padding and margin I mean
what we just talked about is margin I'm
sorry so in the next video we'll be
comparing these two and showing what we
can do with them so awesome I will see
you in the next video thank you and
