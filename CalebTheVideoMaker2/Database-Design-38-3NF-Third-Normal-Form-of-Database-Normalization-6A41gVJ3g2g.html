normal form so thermal reform in order
to get there you have to first do first
normal form and second normal form so
it's kind of like a ladder you can't
just start a third normal form you have
to work your way up there so this one
deals with what's known as a transitive
dependency which is when a column
depends upon a column which depends upon
the primary key so I know that's kind of
like confusing so let me just kind of
draw it out in a table make a lot more
sense so here we have a review table as
you can see I'm kidding you can't see
it's just a square so we could say
review so like this could be on the
website it could be you know like a
shopping website where you review a
product or it can be a review on a video
or anything really it could be review on
a book most likely it'll be on a
shopping website where you buy something
whether it be a book or anything or cars
or whatever it doesn't matter what in
this you would have something like a
review ID obviously which will be the
primary key you would also likely have
what that review is like in a text form
so like a comment so you would have the
actual review and then you would have
maybe a star rating or multiple star
ratings so you could have a star rating
so maybe one through five one being the
worst five being awesome and then four
maybe being like really sort okay you
know and then we might have something
that has a star star meaning so that
would be like a sort okay right and
finally we might have something like
either a user or the poster I'll just
put the user because likely you will
have some kind of user account on this
website where you can post comments so
this will likely be a user ID and it
will be a foreign key to a user table
we're not going to put that in here
right now because that's unrelated to
the actual point so foreign key primary
key now let's look at right here we have
an issue this is what's known as a
transitive dependency because the star
meaning depends upon the star and a way
you can kind of try and figure out if it
depends on it is okay well if we change
the star is the star meaning going to
change well if we take the star and we
change it from a four to A three it
might go from it might go from really
super okay at a really average so the
star meaning is going to change so
that's a dependency but then the star
actually depends upon the actual review
ID because if you change the actual
review the star is able to change so
this is known as a transitive dependency
and it is bad now you can also have a
multiple transitive dependency which I
don't even know what those are called
but that would be where a column depends
upon a column which depends upon a
column which depends upon a column which
depends upon the actual primary key you
can go on forever for as long as you
want but you don't want it because it's
bad which is what we're going to remove
it so to remove this you take the
columns that are causing a problem you
move them to a separate table and then
you create a foreign key and replace of
them which references the actual other
column so let's do this so since these
columns right here are the ones causing
the main problem we take them we put
them in their own table we have a star
table within the star table we're going
to have a star I D and then we're going
to have the actual star whether it be
one two three four five or whatever kind
of rating system you're using and then
we're going to have the star meaning
and then over here we're going to
replace these columns let me make this a
little prettier and I just made it five
times worse we're going to replace that
with a star ID which is going to
reference this table over here so now we
don't have that problem because the only
column over here is star ID we don't
have this star meaning which was the
real column that was causing the problem
now over here we could have if we drew
out the table we would have you know we
could have a star ID of three and that
star could be a three star rating and it
could be meaning it can mean a average
now we'll likely to only have five
individual rows in this table so it's
kind of like a reference table so over
here we could have a star ID of one two
three four five or zero one two three
four or five six seven eight nine it
doesn't really matter what the ID is
because the ID is just a number used by
the database and has no real world value
so we would have five rows in here and
then we would reference them in the
reviews table so we could have okay this
is too ugly let's let me just explain it
we could have one review with the star
rating ID of five which could correlate
to a certain rating from this ratings
table that's the main idea of the third
normal form is to take this transitive
dependencies move them to a note table
create a four key to reference that
table so in review first normal form is
making everything atomic second normal
form is removing any partial
dependencies and then third normal form
is removing any transitive dependencies
so thank you guys for watching I'll
catch you in the next video where we're
going over something awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
