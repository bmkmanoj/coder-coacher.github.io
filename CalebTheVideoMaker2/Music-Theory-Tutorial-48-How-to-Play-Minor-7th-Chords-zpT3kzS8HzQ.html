more thing although I'm pretty sure my
batteries are going to die like any
second now because they keep dying and I
keep a determent camera but oh well
basically I'm going to go over the minor
seventh chord which is very similar to a
minor triad with just an extra minor on
top so the minor triad had the root
which where you start minor third
consisting of three half steps and a
minor third consisting sorry that's
diminution and a major third consisting
of four half steps if we add on another
minor third we get what is called a
minor seventh yes so this is cool and
all so yeah this is like taking i
believe the minor scale taking the
seventh the first the SEC first third
fifth and seventh of a minor scale so uh
I think that's right but anyways not
that's the formation minor third major
third minor third now I don't really
know what else to say about that that's
pretty much it I was going to devote
school video to it but I don't really
know what to say so let's just try
making one so if we have MF and we want
to make an F minor well let's sink a
manor off ok we have F then a minor
third consists of three half steps so f
2 f sharp F to G F to G sharp see i was
thinkin G sharp but you have to think of
the scale it has to go F what's after F
G and the what's after G the third melt
a second so it's actually an a-flat
tricked me there I was like wait a
minute so this is mrs. a chord with flat
sides in so let's have a flat we go a a
sharp B C and that's the major 3rd which
puts us to see right here no accidentals
and then we have a minor throw on top of
that so C to C sharp C sharp D and D to
F flat
which no at fly where we can Ephram be
flat sorry so I think that's the
formation of a minor chord probably
screwed it up somehow I wasn't even
looking at the pietà or anything but
yeah that's concept pretty simple and
this video is kind of short but I don't
really know what else to say so I think
I'll stall i'm looking to waste your
time although i would like to say that I
hope you are enjoying the series because
I sure in I love music theory or else I
wanted to study with this much but um
don't quit because it gets cooler and
cooler every single time you learn
something new this doesn't make music
any less fun makes it more fun my eyes I
like playing music more and I find
enjoyment in it and I've always been
more of a beat kind of personally but I
still enjoy music like chords on all
that kind of stuff so I recommend
studying this as much as possible and
learn an instrument but don't have you
don't have to learn it's r is not that
big of a deal but definitely you use
this for something alright thanks for
watching bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
