through all the scales and stuff and now
we're going to put that to better use
and we're going to talk about chords
which is I think the funnest thing about
music theory so I'm super excited I hope
you're excited because it's awesome
according to me and get it chord these
jokes horrible but then again all music
theory people have horrible jokes it's
just natural natural haha oh man
I'm pretty sharp aren't I there's these
things called triads they consist of
three notes once the root of a scale of
a major scale well not always so the
ones the root once the third of the
scale and one is the fifth of the scale
and when you play them together it
creates a triad many people call them
chords although there's this huge
argument about how many notes is needed
to make a chord some people say it's
three some people say it's - some people
say it's four I don't really care all I
know is triads can sometimes can there I
consider them chords all right so we
have triads which consists of the root
the third and the fifth of a scale
typically so we can alter them in ways
this is the basis of chords now chords
ah I personally consider them three
notes or more played together although
sometimes people think otherwise now we
have intervals and we could play
intervals together in harmony
which is called harmonic notes if we add
one more we get a triad so a triad
always consists of three notes in in
this pattern basically when gets into
some advanced chords and stuff but to
start things off and this is what it
consists of so we can take the root
third and fifth keep them how they are
or alter them in some way it
we'll get a quart so let's go with the
major scale of C which was c d e f g if
we take the root which is the first note
C by the way learn this learn this word
third
I mean root bit then we take the third e
and then we take the fifth G we get a
major C triad makes sense it's pretty
cool
now if I like I can try playing on here
it probably doesn't sound very good it
sounds better on a real piano yeah yeah
yeah it sounds alright so that's an
example of a my major C triad I'm gonna
G's it sounds horrible I'm gonna have to
bring my keyboard over here instead of
continues some contraption cuz that's
not working right and it's piece of crap
I don't like technology even though I'm
a database administrator for my house uh
but anyways okay technology is pretty
awesome but anyways that's an example of
a minor chord finding the third and
these all can-can you can say they
consist of pieces of the scale or
intervals themselves such as the root to
the third is a major third when is this
a non flat and then the third to the
fifth is a minor third and we can get
different sounds so basically the next
couple series I'm not serious videos
we're going to be going over the most
common triads and then we'll also be
going into some less common ones and how
to form all of them so after this you
should then be able to form scales and
chords we're just gonna be fun so I
think that's all I have to say but there
are a couple rules they are when we're
writing them on a triads on a staff they
are always spaced one line apart so if
there are if it's here there's another
go here and here if we start in a space
they're all in space makes sense so
bye-bye one line of it line the line
line the line or space to space space to
space another thing is we do not mix
sharps and flats for example I can have
a sharp and then a sharp and then a
double sharp hard I must do two sharp
signs look at me making mistakes but I
can't have instead of a sharp I can't
have a flat you can't do that you have
you can't mix sharps and flats typically
you won't even see sharps and double
sharps mixed but it's possible so same
things for double flats and flats so
don't mix sharps with flat sides that's
one of the rules and I think that's
about it don't so let's say one of the
notes is be sharp so be sharp I'll shoot
that's in the wrong spot know that I'm
used to erase all this crap okay so
here's B and it's B sharp don't move
that up to C because it's in our martim
in harmonic because remember the sharp
is seat we take B sharp it come see
don't move that up to a C because then
that's going to break our pattern and
there's going to be a gap between the
notes and we don't want that by the way
that's supposed to be here so keep them
all connected sort of like a snowman
just think and then 1/2 rest above them
wait no yeah but yes seriously all right
so I think that's about it thank you for
watching the next video we'll be getting
into major and maybe minor triads if I
get enough time so it's gonna be sweet
catch it
