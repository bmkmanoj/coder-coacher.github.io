owe you see there you see that's abuse
huh huh I'm sorry I still love you I
didn't mean to hit you I should love you
unconditionally even if you beat me
sorry you've done so much good for me
hey guys welcome back in this video
we'll be talking about the mixolydian
mode mixolydian mode now this is sort of
like starting on the fifth scale degree
I hope you're getting the pattern by now
so for in the key of c c d e f g a b c
the mixolydian mode would be g a b c d e
f g that is if we started on g so let's
write this out on a stack oh and by the
way the whole step half step pattern for
this is whole whole half whole whole
half whole so angie it would be G wait a
sec d e f g whole whole half whole whole
half full and that's true because we
know that there's no black key between B
and C and there's no black key between
E&amp;amp;F therefore it's only one half step
let's try this in the key of E major a
major has four sharps I think let's
first write out all the letters e f g a
b c d and we have a F sharp C sharp G
sharp and D sharp that is the scale of d
I know that's from the circle of fifths
so if we wanted to
Mami's black for this if we wanted to be
in the key signature let's try this in
bass clef because that one's tough so
the dog that a signs and f2 right here
and the way the little trick we used to
remember this was great big dogs fight
animals so this is a G B D F a I'm not
very good with this so just trying to
strengthen my bass cleft skills now for
the key signature we would have an
f-sharp so right here G sharp which
would be right here C sharp right ah
here and d sharp would be right here so
that is our key signature and in order
for this to be diatonic which I'm not
gonna write that out because I'm pretty
sure you know what that is been out that
is within the scale notes we must start
on the fifth scale degree 1 2 3 4 5 be
so we're going to start here and we're
going to ascend up the scale here are
all of the notes for the mixolydian mode
starting on B now what are the notes we
would have B c-sharp d-sharp e f-sharp
g-sharp day and then we are back to be
so here is the mixolydian mode starting
on B because of the pattern is whole
whole half I'll be spike pull
pull half and then we could go back with
a whole so this is the whole step half
step pattern for the mixolydian mode
this is very similar to the major scale
with only a lowered seven in this case
this would be the seventh and
conveniently enough in a B major scale
this would be a sharp because on the
circle of fifths it's out we got C to G
to D a to e to be so this one has zero
this and has one two three four five
these are accidentals this one would
have five accidentals the order of the
accidentals are F sharp C sharp G sharp
d sharp a sharp and then if you kept
going to be sharp and then be sharp and
the way you can remember this this is
totally inappropriate don't tell anyone
I said this fat cows give dogs an
erection and then just remember the
letter B it's the only one that's not
there so yeah the sharp notes within a B
major scale would be FC GD and because
there's five F sharp G sharp d sharp da
frosty sharp a sharp that is the B major
scale so to create this into the
mixolydian mode we would lower this
upside us we would lower the seventh no
cool
