caleb from caleb video maker to caleb
curry calm this is the third video in
this little series on getting better
YouTube content the first one was
receiving more views the second one was
how to make a better quality video and
this one is how to make better quality
content within the video so the second
one was like lighting and all that junk
this one's actually getting a content in
the video so I'm just got i guess i'll
just start right off mom if anything's
helpful please let me know and if you
like it be sure to subscribe the very
first thing i think is essential is to
have an appropriate length video that
doesn't mean it has to be short or long
or anything like that for example a lot
of youtubers think oh if your video is
longer than three minutes no one's going
to watch it well this is not true at all
and in fact if it's longer chances are
people are going to watch it longer
which will increase your minutes watched
so that does not always mean you have to
have a short video it's to have an
appropriate length video that means use
the amount of time needed to explain the
content or whatever you're doing this
can be for tutorials or it can be for
skits and little movies and stuff like
that it doesn't really matter all the
matters is that you don't drag things
out for too long and you don't try to
crush it too short that it loses its
effectiveness so obviously the shorter
the video the less content you can have
within it so for example there's a lot
of YouTube videos about like something
in 30 seconds well that video is
designed to be 30 seconds long so they
don't need a lot of detail it's not like
they're really trying to take a whole
movie or whatever and crush it into 30
seconds they're just doing that to make
it fun that's an appropriate length for
that video although for these videos the
appropriate length is longer because I
have a lot of content and if I cut them
short you won't get all that
so figure out what you're trying to
express with your video or what you're
trying to have within the video and then
make a video that no longer than what
you need to express that content don't
drag it out I am probably one of those
people who drag it out because I explain
things a million times in like four of
different ways so hopefully my videos
are the appropriate length but I'm not
too sure alright so that's the first
thing is to have an appropriate length
and the next part sort of addressed in
the previous two videos but this is to
have a balance between a practical
mindset an analytical mind set and a
creative mindset um I forget where I got
this from it was something in child
development about this guy who talked
about how children developed using
either one of these three mindsets but I
turned it into a business aspect and I'm
teaching it now once I figure out what
it's called I'll probably tell you but
probably not so the first one practical
so that means your video needs to be
practical what this means is that people
need to get something from your video
you don't want people just to
accidentally click on it and then X off
of it you want people to seek out this
video want to watch the whole thing and
then if necessary watch it over again a
second time or more if it's funny share
it with friends if it's useful share it
with colleagues and stuff like that so
you want it to have a practical purpose
that means you need to figure out what
you want people to get from this video
whether it be to laugh to learn to make
them understand your viewpoints or just
for them to have something to spend
their time on such as a talk show or a
long blog of some sort you need to
figure out what the purpose of your
video is so that's the probably the most
important thing is purpose
I don't know how to spell purpose but
purpose this is probably one of the most
important things you need to think about
in your video so what is the purpose of
your video think of what do you want
people to get from it is do you want
them to laugh do you want them to learn
or what once you figure that figure out
how much depth you need to go in to get
that goal accomplished after you got
that figure out how long it's going to
take to make that content and make the
appropriate length you don't want to go
too long you don't want to go too short
you want just the right length so those
are two important things when it comes
to creating videos so the other the next
part of this little triangle the
practical creative analytical triangle
is a creativity so you want the video to
be practical but you don't want it to be
so normal and playing and common that
someone could find the same content in
another video so you want to have a
creative mindset that gets an idea
that's different from the rest of
everyone else and it doesn't have to be
completely creative as in if I wanted to
make a video that no one's ever done
well then I couldn't make programming
tutorial videos because millions of
people have done programming tutorial
videos I try to be creative by
addressing all the things in programming
in a new way that helps people learn in
a new way a creative way that allows
creative people to understand as well as
people who aren't so creative to follow
the programming concepts so I mean I
know not all of you are going to be
programming but anyways for example when
I'm programming a lot of people who are
not creative are good at programming
because it's following simple steps to
create a program that it has to be
perfect as to be a certain way but
unfortunately with programming there is
an ass
of creativity to it because you have to
create a program a concept of a program
not just programming you have to be able
to make that concept a good concept so
often the people who don't know how to
be creative will get stuck in a lame job
programming stuff other people tell them
to program a person who is more creative
is going to be able to understand
aspects of design business management on
all that stuff and they will implement
both of them to get the best product so
yeah that's the second part of the
triangle third part is analytical it
doesn't mean yet to check your analytics
every day what I mean by that is you
need to create content that's wanted by
the audience so you can check your
analytics figure out what videos are
successful what videos attract certain
types of people and so forth so yeah you
need to be practical creative and
analytical so make videos that are
purposeful that have a purpose in life
that are creative and that people want
to watch that doesn't mean you have to
not make what you want to make you can
still make what you want to make and you
can still create content that is wanted
by the world all right so third thing so
the first thing was appropriate length
the second was that balance of the
triangle the third thing is make it
entertaining I do not care what kind of
video it is I don't care if its
education I don't care if it's a
documentary I don't care if it's a
comedy it needs to be entertaining and
that doesn't mean you have to laugh and
all this stuff but someone needs to find
entertainment through it some people
enjoy watching documentaries make it
entertaining to those types of people
that means do something that you would
think is entertaining mine is a comic
relief after I do a serious video /
programming I'll throw a bunch of stupid
little jokes in there that no one laughs
at but it's so stupid that it's it's
relaxed it's entertaining in my opinion
so yeah
keep the video entertaining the main
goal of your video is to change a person
either their mindset or their way of
life or their thinking so when I create
a video / / a programming concept they
need to understand a new concept they've
never thought about before so I try to
put that in a way they're going to
understand and that's going to
permanently change their mindset of that
programming concept whether your video
be funny you or go or funny or
documentary or whatever it is your goal
should be able to change that person's
mind set so if my videos comedy well
then I need to allow them to gain
something from my video and obviously it
may just be laughs it doesn't have to be
something huge in astronomically amazing
it can just be okay I got you to laugh
that's a good start I'm doing good now I
can make some more comedy videos simple
as that so yeah change the person in
some way somehow you need to create
content that's hot so popular so
basically you can create content that's
popular and get a lot of views on it you
can also create content that's not so
popular and get a lot of views on it so
for example let me just illustrate this
with my whiteboard all right down here
we have non popular content up here we
have popular content so the higher up
the more views you get but the higher up
here the more people do those kinds of
videos so each little circle is a video
the higher we get to the top the more
videos there are the less likely you are
to get views as you go down there's less
videos which get less views but if
people are looking for these kind of
videos and you have a very powerful one
well a lot of people are going to find
this content
so if it's not the funniest thing in the
world so for example if I you are making
a video over a popular news update well
then everyone is going to make those
kind of videos so if it's like an
earthquake or something there's going to
be a lot of videos about that but
instead you do some article over
something else less popular you still
may get a lot of views because less
people are making that content it's a
less saturated environment so it doesn't
necessarily say you have to make what's
exactly popular on the YouTube homepage
it's just saying make content that is
going to be seeked out by viewers you
don't want all of your views just to be
on accident accidentally stumbling upon
your video you want them to be search
result views all right understand what
the YouTube audience wants to see so
I've talked a lot about what the
audience wants to see but now I'm
specifically talking about YouTube
audience because we're talking about
YouTube videos youtube audience everyone
on YouTube ninety-nine percent of people
like a certain type of video that's why
we are on youtube if you want other
types of videos you're going to go other
places youtube watchers and typically
like certain kinds of videos so I do
recommend you have some sort of audience
that you interact with because typically
people on YouTube enjoy interacting with
the person they're watching as in they
like to have that person person
connection without necessarily meeting
that person that's one thing a YouTube
person generally likes that that's why
even if you have two people on a YouTube
channel making videos oftentimes it'll
be like one person getting the credit or
a there'll be a whole studio making
these videos but one person is the focus
of all the videos that's because YouTube
watchers typically interact with a
one-person youtube channel because
that's how you too busy
it's designed for anybody a single
person off the street to make videos get
views and become popular on YouTube it's
not necessarily designed for businesses
to make productions on YouTube such as
TV shows now as obviously as YouTube
developed people started doing that but
there is still a powerful connection
with single people on YouTube so yeah
keep that in mind that's just one
example so just understand what YouTube
audience wants to see try and figure out
what they want to see from you encourage
interaction within your videos so once
the video is done if you say oh leave a
comment like and stuff like that well
that's going to encourage interaction
which is what you want because you want
to build an audience and connect with
your viewers so I you want to encourage
an interaction this will not only make
more interaction on your channel but
it's also going to make people have that
feeling that oh this person who created
this video actually cares about my input
there's a connection here I like this
person stuff like that so after that you
want to encourage them to watch more
content so often at the end of videos
people will have a annotation to watch
another one or a link to a playlist and
so forth or they'll say Oh see you in
the next video that's usually what I do
so yet you want to encourage interaction
anyone encourage them to watch more
content all right next thing if you mix
all this with high quality production
you are set so in the last video I
talked about quality production lights
video quality audio quality voice all
that stuff if you mix a high quality
content with high quality production
you're going to get like this video
which is just unstoppable and that
you're going to be set so that's what
your goal is you want to make the best
story the best content think of every
video as its own individual store
even if it is an instructional video you
want to have the power that's going to
attract people and then you want to have
the quality of a professional video
that's going to come together and create
this awesome video that everyone wants
to see that's the purpose that's the
goal that's what you want to achieve
doesn't always happen but it doesn't
hurt to try so yeah in some cases overly
professional videos are bad believe it
or not so i made a sixty seven part
series / mysql if you don't know what
that is don't even worry about it but
this series wasn't designed to be a
cinematic movie it was designed to teach
people how to program and concepts on a
chalkboard okay I didn't need
professional cuts or subtitles or music
or anything like that titles I didn't
need any of that all I needed was a
camera and a chalkboard and I did pretty
fairly well so sometimes you don't want
to go overly professional because once
again that's not really how YouTube's
designed people understand that YouTube
videos are not going to be movies that
they go and see in theaters if it was
then nobody would go to see movies in
theaters because everybody would just
watch youtube videos see what I'm saying
so there's a different audience type
between cinematic movies and YouTube
videos typically if you are making
something cinematic they're shorter than
movies for example or broken up into
parts because that's what YouTube wants
to see they people don't usually go to
youtube which watch movies people
typically go to youtube to watch videos
shorter length yeah so that's another
thing to think about I wrote something
here on my tablet defining the purpose
of your video when you're defining the
purpose of in goal of your video here
are some questions to ask yourself
what do I want anybody watching to get
from this so what do you want that
person to obtain from watching your
video figure that out write it down next
thing what do I want non novices to get
from this so obviously there's something
you want everybody to get and then
there's something you want none novice
people to get so when I make my database
concept videos I want people to
understand the basic concepts now people
who are more advanced I want them to
already understand the concepts and
learn things such as the max characters
in a variable character so far it's just
an example I want them to get the small
details that are more memorization
rather than concepts so I have two
separate goals there with my videos
teach novices how to understand the
concepts teach the non novices or the
people who may have a little more skill
I want them to understand the in-depth
little pieces of information that set
them apart from everyone else and I want
both of these people to understand why
all of these concepts are important
because everyone can make a video on how
to do something but expressing why that
stuff's important that's a little more
tricky and lately I've been trying to do
that better teach people why things are
important why you want to do certain
things why this is better method why why
why why rather than how how how how so
yeah that's just another thing to think
about
figure out your intended audience and by
that I mean their age gender race
interests so a lot of people on YouTube
starting out just want to attract
anybody they don't really care who
watches their videos they just want
people to get them you just want people
to watch them and that's perfectly okay
you can try to attract everybody if you
want but if that's the case you got to
be very careful what you create because
certain things can offend people and
you're not going to attract that type of
audience another thing certain different
people are interested in different types
of stuff as I'm a computer and
technology tutorials most of my
viewership is guys men I do get some
girl watchers but not very often so my
intended audience is might not there's a
difference between actual audience and
intended audience my intended audience
is people who want to learn computer
programming educate themselves and all
this stuff pretty much anybody
interested in computers or business my
actual audience is a people who want me
to program for them and guys in college
learning a program so some of that's
okay but yeah you want to figure out who
do you want to attract to your videos
then as time goes on you will attract a
certain type of people you can either
adjust your videos to match their
interests or you can try to attract the
different audience or you can just try
to attract everyone if you want to give
big on YouTube just attract everyone to
your videos rather than a specific
audience just a thought typically if you
have a specific audience you will be
able to advertise better because if I'm
a hundred percent of my viewers are guys
age 23 interested in database design
then I have a very specific audience and
that's very marketable because someone
who creates a product who that needs to
be advertised to guys interested in
database design well then they're going
to want
to advertise online channel like big
time see ya that's just another thought
when creating your video how much detail
do you want to go in figure out that can
be anything if it's a instructional
video teach them how to do this or that
or that understand that the more detail
you go in the longer it will take to
explain but also understand that you
don't have to go in as much detail as
possible if you just want to give a
broad instruction of something you can
do that but this can also be for other
types of videos such as comedy videos
stories and so forth that can go into
characteristics of their main character
so how much background do you want the
viewers to know about this certain
person a lot of YouTube videos cut all
that specific characteristics and there
will just be a person that you don't
know anything about that allows you to
get more that allows you to get more
content within a short amount of time
and as people watch more videos they'll
start to figure out who this character
is rather than having that all explained
in one video just another thought figure
out how much detail you want to go in
and figure out how long that's going to
take the last thing I really have one
here is how long will that take to
express so you want to express your
concepts and your thoughts in this video
quickly but not so quickly that it drags
it or that it's too fast and not so slow
that it drags it out so you want to
figure out how much content you want to
create in that video how much detail you
want to go in and how long it will take
to express that whatever it is so those
are just my basic tips obviously I can't
tell you specifics on how to create a
good video because it's very subjective
basically one person can think this is a
great video and another person will
think this is a great video if you show
them each other the videos this one will
think this video is really bad this one
will think this video is really bad
it just depends so basically I just want
to give you some concepts get a what
really helps for me is to plan out my
videos ahead of time in my head and if
necessary on a piece of paper some
people if they're really professional
they will script their entire video so
this is what I'm going to say it will
take 12 seconds and the final video will
have this many people this many lines
and it will take two minutes and 48
seconds like seriously people do that so
I don't really do that I just make
general ideas of what I'm going to do
however long it takes I'll figure that
out later so yeah you may want to
consider scripting or planning out your
videos ahead of time just answer these
questions what what do I want anybody
watching to get from this what I want
non novices to get from this or people
who really get into it who is my
intended audience how much detail do I
want to go in and how long will it take
me to express this make sure your video
is the appropriate length it depends on
the purpose of the video have a balance
between practicality creativity and
analytics I keep the video entertaining
change the person watchings mindset so
always make sure someone gets something
from your video make a video / hot
topics remember what I drew down here so
do what you're good at and what you love
that's another thing make sure what
you're talking about you actually know
something about don't just jump into
things without understanding a thing
about it make sure it's what you enjoy
and what you love don't create popular
content if it's what you absolutely hate
because it's not going to work out for
you so well you're going to get bored
and you're not going to want to create
content either that or you'll start to
like it and then you'll be set have
confidence but not pride be confident in
yourself but don't think that you're the
best in the world and that this video is
the
best in the world create content in a
way that says oh I could always get
better because as soon as you think
you're the best you stop improving
understand what YouTube audience wants
to see encourage interaction and
encourage people to watch more content
if you mix all of this together with
high quality production you are set then
once your video is created advertise it
get people to share it and you should be
good in some cases over professional
videos are bad so yeah always keep that
in mind those are the basics over
creating high-quality content in a
YouTube video this video is kind of
short I don't really have much to say
but that's all I really have to say for
now so hopefully that was helpful if you
have any questions leave a comment and
please please please be sure to
subscribe and I will see you in the next
