tutorial series now in this video we are
going to continue our discussion of
different terms you are going to come
across when we're working with databases
now the very first term we're going to
start with is known as data integrity
what is data integrity essentially data
integrity means the data in our database
is correct as up-to-date as possible and
describes what we are trying to describe
how good is a database if the
information is confusing it's not
up-to-date we have conflicting data or
we have missing data all of that stuff
is going to make our database a pain in
the butt to work with so data integrity
is something we strive for to prevent
things like that
we don't want duplicates we don't want
conflicting information
we don't want missing data we don't want
data that you can't associate with what
it's trying to describe and that's a big
thing that a lot of people don't think
about that's because it doesn't seem
like it's gonna happen but it has
actually pretty easy to come across when
you have a bunch of data but you don't
understand what is that data trying to
express what is it talking about so this
brings up two important terms entity and
attribute so an entity is a pretty cool
word to describe something so an entity
is something yeah super vague not
helpful I know but it helps if we go
through an example in the last video we
talked about a table that represents
sales or purchases so in that situation
the entity is the sale this is going to
be the table name so we have a table we
can name the table either sale or sales
and every single row is an example of a
sale so the entity in this case is the
sale the attributes are the columns this
is a pretty good start when it comes to
database design that's because we
already have the entity as the table
name and attributes as the call
that way we always know what the data is
describing each row has data for each
column and that data describes that
sales but what happens if you tried to
store every single thing in your
database in one table well in that case
it's going to be a really super long
table and we're gonna have a ton of
columns and we might have columns that
are unrelated to the sale for example
one of our columns might be customer
right and then all of this data might be
describing a customer now when you grab
an individual row and you take all of
this data how are you supposed to know
what is describing the sale and what's
describing the customer see what I'm
saying now this is going to sacrifice I
said oh this is going to sacrifice our
data integrity now we are going to
discuss data integrity in depth in
future videos but just to start off one
way you could really improve the way
your database is structured is separate
tables by entities sales are an entity
customers are an entity so why not split
this table have two separate tables one
for sales and one for customer that will
bring our data integrity back now it's
best to start with data integrity
because it's easier to start with it
than try to force data integrity on
already bad data if your data is already
bad and you're trying to improve the
data integrity you have to go and
correct a bunch of garbage but if you're
starting with a database that enforces
data integrity you don't have to worry
about those issues now I'm going to
remove the customer table here well
we're still going to focus on the sales
for a little bit we have the sales table
and we have all of these columns
describing these sales and let's say we
have two rows inside of this table one
here and one here and these are
describing to individual sales I'm
working on my drawing skills I know they
need improvement
it's working progress so this guy made
two purchases at this store and one he
bought a car the other one he also
bought a car and he just happened to buy
the same kind of car so we might have
the person who bought it okay let's say
his ID is 7 he made two purchases and he
bought a car and as we get into more
specific database design we'll get a
little bit more specific with our data
but for now cars fine and this car might
be a certain model or something but
anyways the data is the same for both of
the rows how do we distinguish this row
from this row this brings our data
integrity into questions to fix this we
need to introduce something known as a
primary key a primary key is a column
that can force every single row to be
unique if we don't have a primary key we
don't know if this is two purchases by
the same guy purchasing two of the same
things or is it one purchase
accidentally put into the database twice
we can't really tell so we need to
introduce something known in the primary
key and this can distinguish different
rows so for example we can give this an
ID of one and this one an idea too or if
you don't want to use just random
numbers or IDs you can find something
that you can use in the real life to
distinguish these things for example the
cars might have some kind of item ID or
something like that that you can use to
distinguish oh these are two different
cars they just happen to be the same
model now we're getting into a ton of
detail that we don't need to go into
right now that's because the focus of
this video is database terms not how to
design a whole database so I might be
going a little off topic and because of
that I'm gonna end this video here in
the next video we're going to be talking
about some of the more advanced terms
you might come across so I will see you
