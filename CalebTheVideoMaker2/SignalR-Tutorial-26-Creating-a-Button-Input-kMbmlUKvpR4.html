method parameters section of this
essentially what we're going to be doing
in this video now is creating a button
that will display the server time on the
client side so we already got the
functionality to get the server date
time we have the method right here and
it returns the data and we already have
the server side set up but we just need
to create that button so we need to go
to the index page and we can create an
input type equals button value put me ID
equals click mini and finally we'll give
it a bootstrap class of button and
button danger so that's just how we can
style the page then we go back to the
browser do a refresh
cool we got the button but it does
literally nothing so we need to program
that button and we're just going to use
a jQuery selector it's very simple all
we have to do is we can do it up here
actually we just kind of like how we did
this selector down here we selected the
element with that ID we can do the same
thing up here so we're going to select
the element with the ID of click me and
then and then we need to add a listener
for an event so what we do is we use the
on method and then the first parameter
it takes is the event in quotes so we
can say on click and then the second
thing is a function of what happens when
that event happens so when there is a
click what do we want to happen and what
we're going to do is we're going to
append the date/time to the page so
essentially we can copy this here or cut
it since we're not going to need that
there anymore
cut back paste that thick
let's give it a try great so you can see
every single time I click it it gives me
a new time so you can see it's working
now we can actually test to see what
happens when the server is shut down or
there's no internet connection to
connect to the server so the way you do
this you need to shut down iis express
is Express is the way we run our web
applications using Visual Studio so if
you look down in the corner of your
browser there's this little icon right
click it and just click exit it'll shut
down iis and now there's no longer a
connection to the server now let's click
and see what happens there we go
that's the error that's all for this
section in the video now you guys know
how to use return types in your
server-side and your client-side code
now come in real handy so thanks guys
for watching I'll be sure see you guys
in the next video where we'll be
starting something new boo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
