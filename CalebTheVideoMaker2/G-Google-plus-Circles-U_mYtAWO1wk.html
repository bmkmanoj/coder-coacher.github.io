going to learn a bit more about google
circles well Google circles are similar
to adding people on Facebook or
following them on Twitter and I just
wanted to say that circles are all the
same and none of them are there just for
organization not to edit your circles
you want to select the circles icon on
the top of the homepage from here you
can add people to your circles by
dragging them or by dragging them from
other circles or by searching their name
and dragging them to a circle simple as
that and you can also open a circle and
search to find the people who are in the
circle another way to see who's in
circles is to hover over them and it'll
the three of the circles that they're in
will glow if you want to create a new
circle you can select this circle to the
left of the screen that says create
circle yeah who would have guessed right
and then from here you can describe the
circle awesome people yeah that's that's
what I want to name it then you can add
a new person I'll just use
raywilliamjohnson cuz it's pretty gnarly
then you can create the circle simple as
that now that the circle has made it
should show up below the rest of your
circles or beside them depending on how
many circles you have you can also
delete circles by selecting the circle
and clicking delete this circle well it
be warned if you delete it all the
people inside of it who are not on other
circles will also be deleted and any
post share to these circles will no
longer be able to be seen some of this
is pretty simple what I'm just trying to
show you the main methods of organizing
your circles and optimizing Google+ uses
now that you know a bit about circles
you're probably wondering what what do
they even do well if you go to the
homepage you can see on the side there
is a stream this you can select stream
just from certain circles like friends
and then anybody in my friends
we'll show up in the stream which I'm
pretty sure they're all the same for me
yeah that's a bit different incoming is
people who have you and their circles
but you don't have them in yours and
notifications on it shows what's a cold
oh yeah notifications yeah it'll show
them and you can also organize your chat
by selecting this little downward arrow
across from chat and click clicking
circles kangra go and then you can
choose which circles you want to show up
and chat and then you can talk to them
but nobody's on for me because I don't
have any friends sucks guess I'll just
get used to it so this will really help
make Google+ organized and yeah this was
made when Google+ was pretty new and I
may make some updated versions for some
of my Google+ videos if necessary so if
I do they'll be a just a link in the
description thank you be sure to
subscribe and add me on Google+ bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
