throughout this series we've been
working on this database essentially we
have three tables that allow us to have
a very miniature project management
database now what's wrong with this
database well overall I think it's
pretty beautiful but there are some
things we could improve specifically
indexes as we've spoken about before in
the past the only columns that are
indexed by default are the primary key
and any columns with the unique
constraint so each table here as a
primary key the user ID the project ID
and the combination of the user ID and
project ID down here as four unique
constraints only the user name and I
think that's Oh nope nope the project
name too
so those are all going to get indexed
but I also mentioned before that a
column you should consider indexing is
any foreign key constraints that's
because they are not indexed by default
but they're so commonly selected and
used in joints that you should almost
always index them so the Creator column
is a foreign key that references the
user name up here but the problem is
it's not indexed so this might become a
bottleneck when we're doing select
statements so in this video we're going
to take that column and add an index to
it now this is actually separate from
creating the table so we don't actually
have to have all this stuff here still
so to create an index yeah it's pretty
crazy but we use the create index
command I never would have thought of
that and then you give it a name we'll
name it the table
underscore column underscore ix4 index
so we're doing this on the project's
table and we're going to grab the
Creator column and we'll just use I X
for index there so we create this index
but we have to tell it what column and
what table we want it to be a part of
because this is not part of the create
table statement it's not just gonna know
by default which table we want to put it
on so we need to say on and then specify
a little bit more information so the
first thing we want to give it is the
table so we're gonna
they projects and then the next thing
inside a parenthesis is the column and
this is going to be on the Creator
column so let's run this see if it works
make sure I got all my syntax right and
you can see we created the index
beautiful now this doesn't apply in our
situation because our column is not
labeled unique but if it is labeled
unique you can actually create a unique
index and you just add the keyword
unique right after the create keyword
but once again that's not needed so I'm
just gonna obliterate that and now I'm
going to move on to teaching you how to
actually delete these indexes once
they're made so if you want to delete an
index it's super easy kind of like
dropping a table you just say drop index
instead and then you just say the name
of the index there you go
so let's run this and you can see it'll
officially delete our index
I thought giving you that little extra
information might be useful in dropping
the index in case you need it
but for now I'm actually going to
recreate that index so we have it that's
how you add an index to a column
unfortunately I still think there is a
potential problem with our database
design to show you that I'm going to go
back to the create table statements and
I will point it out to you so I'm just
going to undo it all so here we are back
at our create table statements the
problem here is in the projects table we
have a Creator column and this Creator
column references the users user name
well in this situation the user name has
to never change and if you're wondering
why that's something we're going to
dissect in the next video so everyone
