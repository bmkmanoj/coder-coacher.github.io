will be explaining some more about joins
but first I wanted to say I have reached
200 subscribers and I'm so thankful I
just wanted to show you that gap to you
guys and and check out this channel it
so what is that but anyways let's get
onto the video 215 subscribers that's
like a ton but anyways I am in PHP
myadmin I kind of cut it off but it's
alright so on the side it shows all my
databases and I actually created a new
one called store so I'm not going to go
through the process of making this I'm
just gonna show you what I've made and
then I under store database I created
two table 1 customers and then this will
have customer ID first name last name
and their phone number so I have 5
entries into this database I mean table
sorry
then on reviews I have the review ID the
customer ID which is a foreign key to
the customers table and then the review
and then I also have date but I kind of
messed that up when I was doing it and I
screwed them all up but I'm too lazy to
go back and fix them all so let's just
say these all were up all these reviews
were from the beginning of time
alright sweet so now what I want to join
things so let's take a look and the
customers I have the first name and last
name and then in reviews I have the
reviews with the customer ID so you look
at this and it's really hard to tell who
actually uploaded this you see because
you can see it doesn't say their name it
just says review ID and customer ID so
to solve this use a joint so we're going
to basically replace the ID with the
first name and last name so SQL now if
you remember we had it
select oops my that didn't mean the
press tab and press enter from and then
left join
just uh not inside we're gonna do not
Aleph join now we're gonna do inner join
first and then I'll be showing you left
join in the next video and then on so
this is basically everything we had and
then we added stuff so this is sort of
like an outline to hope you get
everything right so if you remember
we're going to select the first name
from the customers table so first name
and we want to select last name and then
from the reviews table we're going to
select the review and just for fun let's
select the review ID simply like this
now I know in the last video I said you
have to say things like customer ID
customers table and then customers just
ID like this if you want to select the
customer ID from the customers table as
you can see this is the table and then
this is the column we want to select but
you only have to do that if both of your
selecting tables have the same column
for example if first name was also
interviews you have to specify which
table it should be located in so now we
want to say we're going to select this
from customers and we're going to join
on the table reviews now on is where you
put some kind of equality or like an
equal join if you want to this is the
technical name for this and what we're
going to do is say customers dot cust ID
which is the column name for the
customer ID then we're also going to say
reviews dot cust
ID so this is the equality the customer
ID from customers matches the reviews ID
if we click go we'll get a bunch of
results pretty sweet you see Caleb curry
Wow these products are almost as cool as
Caleb Liu yes so that's cool and these
this is how you join it because
originally it only said through the ID
but now I can say the name this is a
joint this is why these are so useful
because we can really make things more
beautiful and pretty
now we don't have to struggle figuring
out because originally we would have to
go to the customers table figure out
what customer is who and then we'd have
to go back and then apply each one to
each review now we can just see it
visually Chuck Norris said I love these
products five stars bro that's pretty
cool so if you click over here we can
click in line and edit the query from
right here I want to show you something
if you remember both tables have a
customer ID and we have we showed review
ID but I also want to show the customer
ID so what we can do is after review ID
say customer ID and if we click go
you're gonna see something alright
one sec oh my bap
let me edit this real quick I should
have put a comma here so then we click
go and I'll call them cust ID in field
list is ambiguous this means we did not
specify from which table to select it
from so we're going to select it from
customers like this customers period and
then when we click go you can see it now
works and it will say the customer ID
also so if you need to know also not
only the first name and last name but
also the customer ID this is how you
would do it by adding it to the select
so basically everything you want to
display is in the select then you start
from which table customers and also if
you edit this and we changed from and we
put from reviews and then inner join
customers and click go you can see it's
exactly the same thing this is because
it is an inner join and it does not
matter because it grabs the center of
both tables where things in her lap so
this is the basics of an inner join now
I want to show you something a little
more advanced but don't worry it's
nothing too scary
so let's in line edit this this is the
query we had if both
the see where says on if these are both
the same name you can see their cusps
underscore ID short for customer ID we
can use a new command to make things
simpler using and say cust ID and then
when we click go proper syntax for this
is using and then in parentheses which
column up at first I didn't put the
parenthesis and it wasn't working out
right so it's in parenthesis and then
when you click go
you can see it still works and this is
just a simpler way of writing the query
rather than saying on and writing both
the tables names and the columns names
so that's another that's a really good
simple way and in the next video I will
be showing you outer joins and hopefully
I will be showing you some other cool
stuff and just to let you know if you
can see customer ID one two through
there's no three four it skips three you
know why because this is an inner join
and it will ignore people who have not
placed the reviews so if we go to the
reviews table we can see there is no
reviews from three but in customers
person with the ID of three is James
Bond so yeah see in the next video thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
