tutorial series and I have a story for
you well I have been planning these
videos for quite a while now and I have
been planning to record them tonight and
my family decides to watch a movie so if
you hear a bunch of people having fun in
the background without me I apologize
but it's ok I'm not bitter or anything
well let's get started this video is
going to be about creating tables and
the way we do that is we use the create
table command create table after the
table keyword we give the table a name
so we're going to say users because
we're going to create a table where we
can store people's names user names and
all that good stuff after this you put
parentheses inside of these parentheses
is where you're going to put all of the
columns that we want inside of this
table the columns are just the headers
so the the first name would be a column
and so forth so the way my brain works
is I like to do things in sections so
rather than doing one column at a time I
kind of do the the name as a group and
then I do the datatype as a group and so
forth so what I'm going to do is just
put all of the columns we hope to store
in this table and we're just going to
give them a name so the first thing I
would say is a user ID this is going to
be the primary key once we get that far
and then on the next line I will give
the person a user name following that I
will put first-name and lastname
now this is not valid as is but I did it
this way so that way I know exactly what
columns I need to put in this table but
we're not done because every single
column needs a data type data types are
basically the kind of data that we store
inside of this column and there's a
bunch of different data types and it's a
very extensive topic but for this video
we're just going to focus on two very
important data types that we're going to
need to know to start working with
Oracle the first one is number number is
often used for primary keys and
generated numbers the next data type is
what's known as varchar'
and that stands for variable character I
believe basically it means a sequence of
characters that varies in
so if I go down here and make a comment
within here I could put a string such as
Caleb curry I can make that my username
and I could also make it
Caleb curry or Caleb curry it the length
varies but what we do need to do is tell
Oracle a max so to do that let me get
rid of this come up here and within
parenthesis we can say how long we want
to allow the string to be so we'll put
50 in there
and we're also going to do that for the
rest of them now there's something weird
about this data type and that it
actually ends in a two so you got to
remember to put it two after the data
type name you may be able to work with
varchar' without the two but from what
I've read it's really recommended that
you use the two and if you want to do
some more research on that I would
encourage that now I have a question for
you guys what does this 50 mean yes I
know it means how long the string can be
but 50 what is that 50 words 50
characters 50 bytes well that's
something we should actually tell Oracle
so after the 50 I'm going to say char
which means 50 characters so that
includes anything from a space to a
letter to a number in this situation we
would have one two three four characters
if you don't specify char there it
actually defaults to bytes and a
character can take up multiple bytes so
I always like to use char we're going to
add those into the other ones too now
you can see we're getting some kind of
error here and the reason that is is
because when we have multiple columns we
have to tell Oracle where the different
columns are separated and the way we do
that is with a comma so when you put a
comma you're telling Oracle I'm going to
give you another column so we do that
for all of the columns except the last
one because the last one doesn't have a
column coming after it this here is a
very good start but it's really missing
a lot of information for example how do
we tell Oracle which column we want to
be the primary key what if we want to
give it some index
there's just a lot of things missing in
this create table statement that being
said I don't want to overwhelm you guys
with a bunch of new information all in
one video so we're going to break all
that information up over a couple videos
and just continually add to this and
make our database bigger one thing that
you really need to try to take away from
this video is to remember that the
varchar' data type ends in a - I know
it's stupid why would they end it in a -
I don't know
just a random - it's so dumb
well thanks guys once again this is
Caleb from Caleb the video maker - thank
you for watching and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
