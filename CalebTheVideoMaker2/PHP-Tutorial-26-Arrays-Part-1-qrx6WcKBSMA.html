to your PHP tutorial lace tutorials lo I
just wanted to share something with you
this beautiful box of batteries I bought
uh last week they're pretty awesome they
are rechargeable so I just wanted to
share with you what I've been blowing my
money on so you guys know that I'm
actually investing my money and
something useful could snap
Clarence and talked to me in a long time
I think it's been like an hour anyways
yeah my battery runs on cameras uh my
camera runs on batteries so I bought a
pack of sixty of them for like a hundred
bucks or something yeah that's awesome
buy some more anyways in this video I
wanted to talk about something new
rather than loops and control structures
or whatever you want to call them we are
going to be talking about arrays and
this is another data type we're not
going to be going into making them in
this video but we will be talking about
what they are and how they work and how
to access information from an array so
so far we have had strings and we also
had numbers these two are known as what
are our what are known as scalar data
types that is to say they are atomic and
if you don't know what that means check
out my PHP database I'm sorry sorry
my database design series but atomic
means that it can't be broken up into
more pieces so for example if I have a
variable say I know it's
well I can assign this to the value
Caleb this whole thing right here is one
string so we can't break that up into I
mean you could break it up into a half
of two separate strings but that's not
going to be but that doesn't even make
any sense
so this whole thing is one string it's
not two strings it is one string so we
could also assign it a number get rid of
the quotes too
now this is one number even if it's 23
that's still considered one number one
number data type so we have strings and
numbers these are both scalar because
they hold one piece of information
arrays though are null and scalar which
means they hold multiple pieces of
information so for example an array
often carries a list of very of similar
pieces of data so for example 10 strings
these strings may all be titled friends
and then within this array we have this
list of 10 friends so I probably could
only think of like 0 so I'm gonna have
five friends if you're my friend don't
be offended cuz I was only kidding
but anyways it could be a list of these
strings oh my gosh there we go I got it
so that's what an array is so we could
have one variable
and normally this would point to one
string and now be it but now this is not
an array this is a string so an array
does that allows you to store multiple
strengths multiple numbers or even
multiple arrays so now friends can point
to a string hallo I can point to a
friend three four
Caleb four you get the point but this is
all contained within one is one variable
that is what defines an array and
instead of strings we could also use
numbers so we could have it for although
oftentimes they'll all be the same so
four three two one rather than strings
and numbers mixed but not always so that
is an array now when we have content
within our array there has to be some
sort of organization to know what
content is what and this is what where
we get the term index we also have
associative which I'll talk about that
well if you don't know what index is
it's something that points to something
else so for example in this book here I
have this amazing index right here so if
I want to know about output buffering I
go to page 561 so the term output output
buffering points I mean sorry the page
561 points to the content output
buffering so the the page number that's
basically one index does it points to
something else now in an indexed or
array we could have so for example
friends and then within box bars I don't
even know they're called
we could have a number such as three
well this is an index which is a
specific item within this array so for
example this may point to Caleb for for
just just an example now if we change
this number to say friends 27 8 May
point to Caleb 28 that's just an example
of an indexed array that's that's um
pretty much any number we put within
this box is known as the index and it
points to a specific item within that
array we also have associative so we're
going to erased index now an associative
ties to pieces of content together
rather than one piece of content
pointing to another so for an example if
we had people if we have the earner the
array we assign it to the variable
people and it has people read Dana okay
and we wanted to have associates of
array we would do something such as
alright people and then within these
square brackets we have a string that
says for example a nickname so just
making something up celeb alright this
is an associative array that celeb
points to the value Caleb and for these
other ones we could just make make stuff
up
that salmon and this this specific entry
within this array points to this entry
Sarah so hopefully this is making sense
we could have another one people and
then within these brackets we could have
just salmon and this will point to the
value Erin and then we have another one
people I think you guys midpoint and we
could have bacon and that's going to
point to the Dana so that is an
associative so basically the only
difference is in an indexed array a
number points to a value in an
associative array a string points to a
value now there's one more thing to know
with indexed arrays it starts with 0 I
don't know why it just does so when we
have let's say we have a an array names
and we have this box here
these are the entries within the array
here is the first entry here is the
second entry here is the third entry
here is the fourth entry so for example
Caleb I'm not gonna fill in one mile
because I don't feel like wasting all
your time well the index this is going
to start with zero and then this one is
going to be warm and this one is going
to be two and this one's going to be
three so it kind of falls back by one it
doesn't quite line up as you can see
it's diagonal so that may confuse you so
make sure you know that zero actually
points to the first one one point to the
second two to the third three to the
fourth that's really only significant if
you're trying to keep some sort of order
you can also see actually that that's
all I'm gonna say for that so that's all
I have to say in this video hope to see
you in the next one which I will be
elaborating on a race so thank you for
