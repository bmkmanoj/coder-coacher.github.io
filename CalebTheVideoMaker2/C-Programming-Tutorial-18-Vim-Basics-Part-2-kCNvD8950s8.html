video maker too and in this video we are
going to be talking about some more
tricks and then the previous video
mainly talked about how to move around
and then but this video is going to
teach you some even more important
things to help improve your efficiency
so now that you know how to move around
I'm going to be teaching you how to
actually do things the first thing I
wanted to teach you was different ways
to quit the application so as you
probably figured out from this video you
can type in a colon and then put WQ to
write W and then quit q the right means
to save so you can combine these
commands but they're actually originally
individual commands so you could do
these separately as : W enter and then :
Q enter those are the basic ways but now
I'm going to be teaching you some more
ways the first way is to quit without
saving so let's say you go up here and
you just slaughter your code I mean you
just all if you just accidentally
believe in something and you don't know
how to put it back well now how to fix
that the easiest way is just to quit
without saving and then reopen it just
make sure you've saved it at one point
in time so when you do this any changes
since the last time you save the file
will be lost and you can't get them back
so be very careful but you can do it by
typing : q exclamation mark and you can
easily figure out how to do that because
if you do make changes in here and you
just try to quit it'll say add an
exclamation mark to override so you
don't really have to try to memorize
that one all you got to know is that you
can try to quit and if you haven't saved
it it'll tell you how to quit without
saving
voila so I deleted that junk and now I'm
going to teach you a new way to save it
and close it without having to type in :
WQ it's a little easier you just hold
shift and press is easy so to capital
Z's that will save it and exit the
program now let's reopen it the next
thing I'm going to be teaching you is
pretty cool what if you want to
temporarily close them
and kind of put it in the background but
you don't want to have to decide whether
you want to save your changes or just
close without saving you just kind of
want to you know put it to the side go
back to the console for a couple minutes
and then return it's actually very easy
to put something in the background all
you got to do is hold ctrl and press V
and you can see down here it says
stopped to restore that session all you
have to do is type s G and press ENTER
you can think of F G as meaning
foreground you want to take the thing
that's in the background and move it to
the foreground so we want to start
working on it again enter and you can
see it opens just how we had it so that
means if you go in here and you just you
slaughter your code and you think you
like it but you're not really sure
you're not sure if you want to save or
quit without saving pressing ctrl Z then
you can do some commands in here
whatever you want to do and then when
you're ready you can press F G and it's
back exactly how you add it before now
I'm going to tell you right now
occasionally you're going to be working
with vim and something is going to mess
up for example let's say we closed this
using ctrl V and now we try to reopen it
with the vim command like this press
Enter and you can see we get this funky
error with a ton of information
essentially what this page is saying is
hey you have this file open at one point
you might not want to try opening
another session of this file this will
happen if you accidentally shut down
your computer without shutting it down
the correct way or if you already have
the file open somewhere else if it's the
first case where you turn on your
computer after a power outage or
something you can hold shift and press R
to open the file as you can see down
here that will recover the file as you
had it if you have it open in another
process what I would do is I would
actually quit by holding shift and
pressing Q which is right here and then
open it the right way using FG so now
you kind of have some more ideas on how
to open things and close things but what
happens if you slaughter your code like
this and you want to fix it and you just
kind of want to undo things you know all
the fancy editors nowadays have undo
buttons but if you try to undo something
in here using control
eeee all it just puts it in the
background so the question is how do we
undo things when we are in vim you
actually use a lowercase u and you want
to make sure you're not in insert mode
so you can see as I press u it starts
undoing things until it's back to how it
was you can also redo meaning put that
stuff back the stuff you just undid this
one is actually pretty normal and that
you hold ctrl and press R and you can
see it comes back I'll just undo that
because I don't really want that there
you can cut lines using BD so for
example I could cut this and come down
here and paste it using P using DD we'll
put the line in what is known as the
clipboard when you copy something it
goes into this location called the
clipboard which is a magical location no
one knows where it is so I'm also going
to undo that because you know why would
I leave that down there one other way to
do it though is you can actually use
capital P and it will paste before the
line that you're on lowercase P paste it
after the line you're on if you're
working in here and you want to delete
part of a line you can actually use the
lowercase D command followed by the
dollar sign if you remember from the
last video the dollar sign is another
way to say the end of the line
so we could say lowercase D for delete
and then dollar sign to delete up to the
end of the line so let's get rid of this
line I just cut the thing using BD and
now let's teach you how to copy because
sometimes you don't always want to cut
cutting allows you to paste it elsewhere
but you might want to keep it in two
locations so if I wanted to copy this
line you use lowercase Y lowercase Y and
that is short for yank now we can go
somewhere else and paste it oftentimes
you can mix commands with numbers so for
example if I wanted to copy four lines I
could say for YY and then down here you
can see it says four lines yanked now we
can go down here somewhere else and
paste all four of those lines I think
that should be enough to get you started
with them it's a lot of information
don't feel overwhelmed you don't have to
have all those
memorized honestly I'm still learning a
lot about them so throughout the series
if you see me do something completely
wrong or dumb with them please let me
know I am learning too now there is a
helpful website I would like to share
with you and you can find it at vim dot
R T Orr comm and here is just tons of
commands you can use to use them to the
full potential so thanks guys for
watching hopefully this is helpful
once again you can download my notes
which will have all these commands
written in them thanks guys and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
