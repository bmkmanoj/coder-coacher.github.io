we're going to be discussing user
defined variables and this is one of the
kinds of variables that MySQL has I
think there's actually four different
kinds but just to get started we're
going to start with this and maybe after
we could ever all the good main stuff
we'll go back and go over in more detail
all these different things but just for
now I just want to get on to what's
important so user defined variables they
are a type of variable that have a very
small scope so whenever you study
variables I can guarantee you this word
will come up it talks about the lifetime
of the variable so when you make one of
these user defined variables it doesn't
last for eternity it's not like a table
or a database in your database
management system it's just within your
I guess you could say your client the
place where you're typing your SQL
commands whether it be the terminal or
whatever the lifetime is that session so
if you open your MySQL terminal and then
you create this variable and then you do
some commands and then you X out of it
well then that variable no longer exists
you can't reopen it and reference that
variable so different variables have
different scopes this one is a session
scope there's two more terms you're
going to need to know and that's declare
and initialize essentially declaring a
variable is telling MySQL hey here's
this variable I don't exactly know what
the data is going to be inside of this
variable I just know that this variable
needs to exist because I'm going to use
it in the future
initializing is when you give that
variable a value so you can actually do
this both at the same time you can
declare and initialize a variable at
this in one statement and that's usually
what we're going to do I just want you
guys to be clear that when you're
studying this there's a difference
between declaring a variable and
initializing the variable and if you're
not clear on the difference you can come
up with some weird bugs in your
qo statements or whatever because you
might be trying to use a variable that
needs to be initialized but it's only
been declared and so forth so now enough
of this vocabulary garbage let's get on
to the MySQL syntax for declaring a
variable making a variable is super easy
all you got to use is the set keyword Oh
Onix you fart Oh Aaron knows that you
set and then you put an @ sign and then
whatever the name of your variable is
going to be that's all you got to do
set the variable name and then the value
we just initialize this variable and now
we can use it in all of our other SQL
statements so that's all for you guys
thanks for watching this series I'll see
you guys in the next one huh kidding
it's not over yet for now we're just
going to go over a little bit more
theory in the next couple of videos and
then we'll start getting on the computer
and type in some junk out and making
some cool SQL scripts but for now
memorize the syntax set at sign variable
name no space there equals value
semicolon is optional if you only have
one statement but you probably have more
if you're declaring a variable see you
