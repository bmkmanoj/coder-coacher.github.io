the video maker - in this video we are
going to introduce using functions in C
I've talked about this a little bit and
I mentioned a little bit about what
functions are and how to use them but I
wanted a video just to introduce a
little bit more detail so that way as we
use functions you're not like wow what
the heck is he doing so that way you
have a better idea of what's going on
when we start typing out more code and
everything as we move on in this series
we're going to start moving more
systematically through concepts and see
rather than what we've done in the last
five or six videos where we just kind of
give an overview of a bunch of things
that's because we need to go in more
detail in order to understand everything
we need to know specifically farther in
the future we are going to talk about
functions in depth so don't feel like
you have to know everything from this
video and if I've already told you
basically everything already that I
talked about in this video that's okay I
just want to centralize it in one video
so you can have it for your use so with
that being said let's begin what is a
function a function can be used to call
or execute multiple statements at one
time now the computer actually does go
through each statement one at a time but
for us as programmers we only have to
say one thing so for example if we are
trying to print three things to the
console our code might look something
like this
now technically you wouldn't have to
have three printf statements because you
can always break things down to the
newline using backslash n but sometimes
for readability it's easier to break
things up into multiple printf
statements that way we don't just have
like this huge never-ending string with
like a ton of text and a bunch of
backslash ends it's harder to consume
this with our eyes then smaller printf
statements in addition to this we've
also created code that is going to
monitor some kind of information and we
want to continually print out the same
statements with new updated information
so we might have some kind of sensor
that
this will print like temperatures or
something like that doesn't really
matter what we're using this for just
make up something in your head
essentially we want to execute all three
of these numerous times well let they
function we could basically group all
three of these together and you want to
look at me all innocent you just ruin my
video boy I don't even know what else
and anyways you could execute all three
of these at one time and give it some
kind of name like console dump we're
going to dump on all the information
straight to the console and then we can
just call that using these parentheses
that is essentially what a function is
it's a shorthand to calling a bunch of
statements so this here let's print a
statement this is actually a function
itself you can see we're calling it with
these parentheses or passing in
information inside of these parentheses
of what we want to print the actual code
for the printf statement we don't need
to care about that
all we need to know is how to use that
function who knows how many lines of
code that function actually takes up
doesn't really matter to us to be honest
all we need to know is that when we call
this function and pass in some
information it goes to the console
that's all we care about the second
benefit of functions is that if you want
to change something like let's say we
have this code in our program ten times
and we're not using a function and then
we want to go back and change something
we're going to have to change it in ten
different locations that's not going to
work very well if we're using functions
we can kind of think about it as
extracting this code as a formula and
then we only have one copy so this is
our individual copy and then we can call
it multiple times so now we have two
calls and we could repeat this as many
times as we wanted the data that we
actually pass into a function inside of
these parentheses these are known as
arguments functions can accept as many
arguments as they want the only thing is
you have to separate multiple arguments
by commas so for example in this printf
function we could do something like this
where X
the name of a variable that source some
value the action of putting data here is
called passing so if you had to put it
into a sentence you would say we are
passing two arguments the arguments in
this case the first one would be the
string here the second one would be X
and they're separated by a comma
arguments allow us to customize our
functions for example in this situation
where we had this function we created
called console dump or whatever we could
accept arguments that allow us to change
how the function works you can see that
in the print F function the print F
function does something different
depending upon what we pass in if we're
passing in X here and it has the value
of five that's going to print five to
the console but if X has the value of
six it's going to print six so if you
need another way to think about this
you can think of functions kind of as
cookie cutters right let's say we have
this cookie cutter in the shape of a
carrot this could be our function a
cookie cutter only gives you most of
what you need as for the actual color
and the material material you're
probably going to use this for eating so
I don't know if material would be the
best word but substance all of that
stuff depends on you you get to choose
that kind of stuff you can think that
kind of stuff has the arguments you know
you could easily fill this up with
peanut butter and then make a carrot
shaped peanut butter cookie or you could
fill it up with chocolate chip cookies
the end result it looks like a carrot
but each carrot is slightly different
this one could be you know chocolate and
it's on could be peanut butter if you
had to convert this into computer
science terms it would look something
like this
make carrot cookie and then we could
pass in here like a string for example
chocolate where this function is defined
that's what we'll get into farther in
the series when we talk about creating
our own functions but essentially if you
go track down where this function is
created you'll find something called a
parameter
that describes what you're passing in
here so we would say something like
flavor
I guess so flavor is going to be a
variable in the value of flavor I'm
going to be chocolate that is your
rundown of functions in programming
that's super helpful because one they
make it less easy to make mistakes
because you don't have duplicate code
everywhere too it makes your code easier
to read because all we have to do is say
a name make carrot cookie super clear in
three it makes the main section of our
code much smaller for example if you had
an app that makes cookies and sells
cookies you could just have another
function in here and this might all be
inside of main and you can see that all
of our code really looks like there's
only two lines so that's pretty easy
it's nice and readable nice and easy to
maintain it's awesome so that is why
functions are so great and I hope you
guys understand the beauty of them and
enjoy if that's even possible it is
possible to enjoy carrot shaped
chocolate cookies so yeah guys thanks
