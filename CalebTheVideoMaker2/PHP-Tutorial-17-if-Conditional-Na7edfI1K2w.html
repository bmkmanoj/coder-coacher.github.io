series in this video I want to talk
about the if statement or conditional
and basically it's a lot like the
ternary thing we just talked about the
operator although it's a little bit more
structured and easier to follow so
that's what we're going to be talking
about now I'm actually going to get some
new shot what's that a talk thanks to
you guys thanks a lot my truck is almost
gone I'm by the way the ternary thing
operator we talked about I believe it
can also be called a tertiary but I'm
not too sure anyways if it it takes a
test it it has a test just like the old
ternary thing I've had parentheses well
so does an if statement so they're
parentheses will go here and within
these parentheses we place a test or an
expression such as five plus five is
equivalent to ten and that will run true
then we place curly braces like that and
then we close the curly brace like this
and we can place our code between these
curly braces by the way you can adjust
these however you want so you can put
this up here and put your code right
here or you can move this over here and
put your code between here it although
that's pretty adjustable I believe so
that should work for you no matter how
you like it but this is how I usually
set up my some if statements now it's
important I want to mention one more
thing these loops and structures I'm
going to be going into they're known as
control structures
what these do is they allow your program
to flow in different directions repeat
things or or make it just easier program
so for example when you have a web page
oftentimes you are not going to just be
like oh yeah let's let's say hey Jimmy
and put that at the top of the page
because for one what if the person's
name is not Jimmy what if the person's
not signed in or what if they don't have
a computer
I'm just saying so oftentimes you have
to be able to run tests on certain
information to know if it's the
appropriate time to write certain things
so we could I mean in simple code we
could say if logged in right happy
birthday
user name and then user name can be a
reference to another name from a
database so that's just an example of
how these control structures are used so
it's important you understand the basics
of all of them they're not that
complicated basically if you understand
the basics of these then you understand
the basics of all programming languages
and I know it's probably not necessary
for me to go over these in super detail
when I decide to anyways because I like
to and I feel that really gets you used
to PHP so here's the basic if statement
or if control structure or if
conditional it tests this if it's true
then this is ran if it's not true
nothing happens so it just goes on so we
could say if if it's Caleb's birthday
say happy birthday but if it's not then
just ignore this and keep going on with
the code see what I'm saying we can also
use an elf elf an else and that goes
right after this parenthesis
oh my gosh my hands are so dry from this
chalk it's ridiculous and then we have
another one and then we close this one
like cool so we can have another
statement here and basically it's going
to test this if it's true it's going to
run this one if it's false it's going to
run this one right so it's it's a
conditional I just said that
but I'm repeating myself if it if it's
true it'll run the first one the first
brackets if it's false it's going to run
these second brackets if you don't want
it to do anything when it's false then
just erase this entire else clause so if
we could recreate the ternary thing it
looked like this parenthesis question
mark value
so this is the basics of how it works
have we had a chemist shred a test here
a test here then we had a value that it
couldn't be assigned or a different
value that can be assigned now the thing
with this is it's always a value it
always returns a value an if statement
doesn't have to return anything besides
it's going to tell us if it's true it's
going to do something if it's false it's
going to do something but you see if I
have an if statement like this if five
plus five is the equivalent to ten do
this oh well there's nothing there so
this is not going to do anything it's
not going to assign me values it's not
going to return anything but the ternary
thing is going to return a value here
here this one we have to specifically
tell it to return a value so that's one
more difference between these two things
and you will see both both but more than
often you will see if statements so yeah
that is the basic if statement you may
hear this if conditional or if control
structure but you probably won't hear
that one and I think that's all I have
to say for that so hopefully that
introduces you to conditionals basically
it tests a an expression is what we
would call it like five plus five to
twelve well it tests it does this
evaluate to true well with PHP there are
certain things that evaluate to true and
then there's certain things that
evaluate to false
this one would evaluate to false so what
is true and false crabs this true and
false stuff is about it's known as
boolean or boolean
whatever you want to call it and it's
basically a test of true and false nests
which we'll be getting into that in
future videos so that's all I have to
say for this one thank you for watching
and please please subscribe that would
mean so much to me thank you and see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
