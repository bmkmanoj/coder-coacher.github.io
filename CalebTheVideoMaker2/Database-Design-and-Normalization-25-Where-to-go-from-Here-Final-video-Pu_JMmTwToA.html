welcome here 25th video I believe in
database organization normalization
series this is the final video and
basically what I'll be doing is just
going over what we learned and I'll also
be telling you where you want to go from
here so if you don't remember I talked
about what a databases comment are like
rows columns and other common terms when
it comes to databases but also whenever
some more advanced terms they don't hear
as often you'll still hear him but not
as much you still want to know them
though then I also talked about after
that I went under relationships there
was one-to-one one-to-many and
many-to-many and then I also talked to
you about intermediary tables and
many-to-many relationship problems when
it comes to databases I told you how to
fix those I also showed you how to
properly design many demanding
relationships and also the other
relationships on a entity relationship
diagram aka erd and then after that I
went on to normalization if you do if
you forget what that is then you kind of
miss the big section of this but I'll
tell you again it's reducing redundant
data by creating new tables to store
information in a better way that will
that includes getting rid of many to
many relationships by creating an
intermediary table and so on like that
making things atomic right so after that
I had a big paper I don't think it's
around anymore
with like a bunch of crap that you'll
never need to store in a database I'm
just kidding but it was pretty random
but we had some student information and
other stuff you might need for a college
and that's for one specific college and
then uh what you could have done was
have a table for ecologists and connect
everything to that so you could store
multiple colleges information in one
database but I don't really like that
idea because I figure two colleges
wouldn't be that close
I figure they would separate their
information so that's why I went about
that going that way then then what I did
is I showed you programs on the program
on the computer to
make your er DS entity-relationship
diagrams and then also how to make
primary keys oh yeah I also talk about
primary keys and foreign keys I'm told
you how to make primary keys foreign
keys then I talked about in sandbar
chore that's how you want to pronounce
it all right it's up to you and then I
talked how to connect it and how the
designs worked and then have what the
relationships look like on there and I
told you how to properly design that
database that we started with so I mean
I hope that was helpful
maybe that snapped it all on your brain
and realize you learned a ton the very
next thing I would recommend you do is
program your database if you don't know
what I mean by that I basically just
mean actually allowing you make it so
you can put information into the
database rather than just the columns
you actually insert the rows so like
Caleb curry for the name and that would
be made with like MySQL for example a
structured query language SQL that will
allow you to program the database to be
able to put more information in there
and actually store your data and I may
be doing a series over this in the
future
so be sure to check in the description
down there where they end up putting it
in fears and see if there's a link to
another series or another video and I'll
teach how to do that maybe and then also
you can also find it online just look up
SQL or MySQL recommended by me and lots
of others so when you go to program it
you want to use what I would recommend
and so and many others is as I said
MySQL and also PHP myadmin
that basically just puts everything more
graphical and easier to see but I mean
you can still control everything nothing
is limited because you can still use
code and I actually prefer to use code
so that's why I would recommend MySQL
and PHP myadmin if you want to make like
an extremely custom graphical interface
then you need I would recommend we need
a server-side scripting language and if
you don't know what that is basically
when you have a server and then
on the internet connecting to a website
it goes to a server and then that the
language would be all that would be
stored on the server whereas like the
website layout that's on this client
side I know that's just a completely
off-topic but basic information so a
server-side scripting language would be
like PHP a client side would be
JavaScript so if you want to write two
databases you need a server-side such as
PHP which is probably the best so go
with that and you need this because the
database is also server-side ok so now
that you're done I would just recommend
going on YouTube searching some other
things up that you want to learn
whatever you do just do it don't just
think about doing it if you need to if
you want to program a suite database or
make a website go about doing it don't
just think about it because that's the
biggest problem I have especially I'll
be like that's a really good idea and I
never do it so that's what my advice is
for you do it and then be sure to
subscribe and like my videos and leave
me some comments I mean I really do
appreciate it I hope you guys know that
so please give me some suggestions and
tell me what I can improve upon and I
promise I will read and hmm appreciate
everything you tell me thank you see you
next time database models also known as
