be talking about double dotted notes so
it's very similar to a dog know if we
have a quarter note with a dot it's the
equivalent of a quarter note plus an
eighth note if we have a double to go
and keep drawing 16 this for some reason
an eighth note if we have a double dot
right after it so there's two dots it
adds a sixteenth note on to it so it
breaks it down one step farther and it's
making me dark so hopefully that you can
see that from there it's kind of it's
taking it one step farther so now this
is actually originally it was one fourth
of a measure we add an eighth note it
becomes three-eighths we add one of
these and it becomes thing well that'd
be six it would be 7 16 makes sense
because the reason for this is
one-fourth is the equivalent of two
eighths now as this multiplying it by
two if we add an eighth note it becomes
38 38 is the equivalent of six 16 which
is just multiplying by 2 and then we add
and a sixteenth note and it becomes 7
over 16 so in order for this to count
for two beats we can add a sixteenth
note and then this is two beats now that
is basically the concept of a double
dotted note pretty simple let's try
something else let's try one on a half
note
no let's let's make this tricky let's
try one on a 32nd note ha all right this
is gonna get intense all right so here's
the 32nd note we had a dot that's the
equivalent of a 30 second plus a 64th
now we double dot it it's the equivalent
of adding another 128 or so okay I don't
need know where to start here one out of
16 for this Plus this would be the same
thing as 3 out of 32 and the reason for
this is we are multiplying this by 2 to
get to out of 32 it's the same it's the
same value can you see that it's the
same value it's just a now we have a
common denominator to for this one
because this right here is valued at 1
30 second of a measure that's why it's
called a 32nd note and it's hard to add
that with 116 but it's not hard to add
that with two 32nd notes or 2 30 seconds
so if we take 2 30 seconds and add 1 30
seconds we get 3 30 seconds then we just
repeat the concept we make this 660
fourths plus 164th and we get hey I have
a question when I started this I said
let's do with 32nd notes because i think
i did and i use a sixteenth note i don't
know but anyways this will be the
equivalent of 760 fourths the reason for
this is we had 660 fourths we add one
more we get 7 64 this is our final
answer
okay i'm going to try one last one real
quick and it will be a half note double
dot it so this is the equivalent of
taking a half note what's half of a half
to Accord nope so we're hiding a quarter
note what's half of accorded open eighth
notes so we're adding it eighth note
well this will be three beats because to
this is two fourths and this is
one-fourth that's very simple or you can
think of this isn't as one half if you
want to go to the hard way one half
which is the equivalent of two fourths
plus one fourth equals three fourths
plus an eighth note becomes three point
five fourths which is the equivalent of
seven eight sweet so now if we just add
an eighth note it becomes a whole
measure sweet so that's all I have for
dots and double dog notes the next video
i'll be going over I think ties and
slurps which are very cool really ties
things together oh oh oh man I'm just
cracking one right after the other oh
man oh alright nothing I think I'm done
for the night
