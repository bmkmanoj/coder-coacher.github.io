functions upper and lower basically all
these do is uppercase or lowercase an
entire string if I put hay within
actually let's make this hay with a
capital e here so it's lowercase H
capital e Y within the blower it's going
to bring it down to H lowercase e Y and
if I put it within the upper it's all
good it's gonna make them all capital so
bring back oh sorry
hey all capital letters and these will
be lowercase so upper brings in the
upper case lower brings them to lower
case here's just here see it looks like
I'm out of focus
close enough here's a function you may
actually find yourself using maybe for
encryption or some other cool stuff but
it's substring and what it does is it'll
take part of the string and bring it
back so here's what I have
Caleb the video maker and then of 3 this
will start from the third character and
return everything after that 1 2 3 so
the result is gonna be
web the video maker and it'll take off
the see in a what this you know so take
another you can you can actually instead
of putting a comma and then a 3 if you
like English you can set it from 3 if
that's easier to remember and it'll
still do the same thing but you can
actually add another thing in here to
say how many characters to return so if
I put a comma and then a 3 and then a 5
it's going to go to the third character
1 2 3
he'll and return five characters eb2 H
because we start here 1 2 3 4 5 so if I
replace this with a 6 it's going to
return another character and so on so if
I just get rid of this all together it's
going to bring back the whole thing
that's huge named Caleb loves a video
maker that's because we started at the
third character as you can see here 1 2
3 all the way to the end we can also use
negative numbers if you want to measure
from the end so if I say negative 4 here
after the coma after the quotation mark
and gave it this it would go 1 2 3 4 and
the return result would be Rob and we
can also just like in the last time we
can say how many characters to return so
if we add in this to it we'll start our
cuz 1 2 3 4 and it'll return two
characters 1 2 so the return result will
be R I so that's pretty cool to get
exactly where you want and within us
within a string that's why it's called
substring sorry I kind of failed at
talking here we have another pretty cool
one you may actually use this for let's
say censorship if you want to replace
certain characters with the star sign
asterisk or capitulate so the way you
use this is within your parentheses you
give it a string I'll use Caleb because
if you don't know that's my name it's
part of my youtube channel named Caleb
the video maker too so you better
subscribe and you can also if you're
watching this on my future website then
it's just Caleb whatever my website name
is dot-com so I'm gonna use Caleb here
and then a comma I can say what I need
to replace so I can replace the C within
quotes because it's a letter or a one
character string if you look at that way
comma and then give it a K now how this
will work is no have the word cable
it will go through this scan it for the
letter C and O you can see a letter C is
right here so this does the next step is
it will replace it with whatever you
place here okay so now instead of a C we
have a K so from this the result is
Caleb with the okay and we can also
instead we could put and said okay we
could have put K xv4 because I don't
know why I couldn't think of anything
else
now the returned result let me just
erase this is going to be let me let me
show you first
we had Caleb scans at first C and it
says oh we're going to change this C -
okay xb4 and we're going to add on the
rest of the string so this is the
returners all pegs before a le B so
that's how they replace string function
works
the last function we'll be going over is
located finally to the end yes and then
we're going into numeric functions but
Scott deal with it you gotta learn stuff
so locate it will tell you what
character location within a string a
certain given string is that another min
no sense let me just show you I'm Way
better at that so if I put the
parenthesis and I say let's look for a
letter let's look for the we are looking
for the strings uh within the stream so
now it's going to be looking for love
within this so let's count one two three
four five six is where the first key for
the is located so the word love is
located at character six so the return
result is going to be six
now if though it's not in here so let's
say V it's going to return a zero it's
going to return a zero because it is not
within this string now if we want to
let's say I look for the letter A now
it's going to look through this one too
and it's going to return to well let's
say we want to talk about the next a
within this set and I want to ignore
this a as you can see we are looking for
a within caleb the video maker - and i
put an extra number here for this is
going to say the letter a after the
fourth character one two three four it
is going to ignore the first four
characters here it's still going to
count these characters but it is not
going to display the first a so see a LP
that's four five six seven eight nine 10
11 12 13 14 15 so here is the next a the
fifteenth character so the returned
results is going to be 15 not - like it
was before that's because we ignored the
first four characters so that's okay
thank you for sticking with this cuz I
know that was like super fun see in the
next video we were going to be talking
about some mathematical operations whoa
so yeah check it out
I hate functions gosh I love them hate
them
oh I feel like a flipping reference book
Oh No</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
